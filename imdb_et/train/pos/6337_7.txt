I have had over 40 years of suffering from a tornado because my 5th grade teacher, Texan, talked about the stories she saw in her youth. Fortunately, I have lived my entire life in middle Atlantic countries where tornadoes are rare and usually not as violent as Midwest, but I have had two close meetings, one in PA and the other in NJ, over the last decade. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed family scenes, especially the conflicts between Jack and Dan Hatch. When the tornado was close, Dan knew most about what he was supposed to do, and apparently learned it at school because I know that the safety of the tornado is an important part of the parts of the US where these storms occur more often. But the film's characters did two things that some people think they should do or do safely in towers, but what they really don't need to do or is dangerous. <br /> <br /> When the siren sounded for the first time, Dan and Arthur went through the house and opened the windows. For years, what people were told to do, but tornado safety websites now recommend doing so. People also showed that they were hiding under the road. This method became popular in the early 1990s, a video made by T.V. team in a relatively weak twister at Kansas. In the most serious tornadoes, people can be sucked out of these undercarriages. It happened during the May 1999 outbreak in Oklahoma. <br /> <br /> This movie's tornado hit the fall, which is not the usual time for them to happen. (Then one of my close meetings took place at the end of September.) They also traveled to the south-east of the northwest, while most of these in the northern hemisphere go north-west. However, this is not so unusual. The famous tornado that hit Joliet IL in the early 1990s drove in that direction (as did my close encounter). <br /> <br /> I think the film should have been in the spring. This film was based on a book, which in turn was based on a real event that took place on June 3, 1980. But it was still a compelling story.
