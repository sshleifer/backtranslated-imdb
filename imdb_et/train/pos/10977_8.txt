I arbitrarily took this second night out of the library, which had no clue about the cult of the film, or that it is currently staged as music. sad, and yes, exploitative, despite the best intentions of filmmakers. The extended Chriterion edition is mandatory for anyone who loved it when it appeared. I think you also see the disappearance of the class in the little Edie, which is lost, you can hear it in Jackie O's old films; people just don't talk so. I think it would have been interesting in the documentary to get more information on how home fell, old Edie seems at least aware of what is going on to some extent; Didn't he see that any remarkable home breaks down? <br /> <br /> But the theme of the movie is the life that the two women themselves have now built, the real life of Tennesse Williams. It is worth your time.
