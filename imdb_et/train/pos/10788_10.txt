The big rock candy mountain is amazing. I looked at it when I was little and still today (older in high school). if I could imagine the sky, it looks like. I wish I could live on a large rock candy hill where candies grow on trees. Zach Hyman is a profs and my best friend. little bunny foo foo is a man. it is so blurry and colorful that I dream about it at night. In fact, my 18-year-old friend watched it for the first time and loved it. I recommend people of all ages to watch this movie. I have a big party with all my friends this weekend to watch this incredible movie. we order the seal and see how the teddy bear is wearing. I keep looking at the clouds and I wish I was the little girl who went. thanks. bye.
