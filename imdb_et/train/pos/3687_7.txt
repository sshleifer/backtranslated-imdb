Reiterates the darkness. 18 18 seemingly unrelated vignette director of the city of light. A very unusual format that takes a few segments as a viewer. We are so accustomed to character development over a 2-hour movie, it is a bit disarming to take place in an 8-minute segment. <br /> <br /> The idea is 18 love / relationship story in 18 different districts. a great city. Of course, some stand better than others and some go for comedy, while others focus on dramatic emotions. Some well-known leaders are involved, including: Coen Brothers, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuaron, Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha. Many familiar faces also include: Steve Buscemi, Barbet Schroeder, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ben Gazzara, Gena Rowlands, Gerard Depardieu, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Bob Hoskins. <br /> <br /> One of the best segments is mime and then another mime and a nervous but happy young man. Red ditches, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasy, child death and many other issues also play important roles. Don't miss Alexander Payne ("Sideways" leader) as Oscar Wilde. <br /> <br /> The variety of segments makes it interesting, but it can't be called big in the form of a movie. It is still very traceable and a nice change in the pace of a frequent movie player.
