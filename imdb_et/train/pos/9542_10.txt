Don't let the silly title of people cheat, it's one sweet ride! Tetsuo's real successor to Iron Man and Ichi Killer, this pearl starts with a bang and puts the color up to the roll of credit. Aliens seem to take over human bodies and turn them into war machines, which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game to entertain these species. The winner wins the loser alive. This is mostly for a plot of land, but who cares about how good it is? I have no idea how many spoonfuls were used, but it's nasty to see. Stop-motion is interesting and effective when acquisitions are ongoing and loving care is for all creatures and make-up effects. The CGI is a bit limited, but in fact it doesn't reduce quality at least by at least one. It was a really fun and stubborn film that deserves a lot of praise and has really won its place at Cult Classics. Find it and see, you don't have to be disappointed!
