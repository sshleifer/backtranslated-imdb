JACKNIFE is a subtle adaptation of Stephen Metcalfe's "Strange Snow" (also written by Metcalfe), led by David Hugh Jones, who is studying too often the forgotten effect of battling war veterans against veterans. Returning to the 1989 film is especially enjoyable when we look at the soldiers returning from the Iraq war and the crude procedure at our veterans' hospitals. <br /> <br /> Three friends went to Vietnam War together and only two back lives: the problem is that although both battle men are one of David's High School Flannigan (Ed Harris), the post-traumatic stress syndrome is so severely damaged that he "exists" in a drunken vacuum with his very simple teacher Martha (Kathy Baker). As David worsens, his friend Joseph 'Jacknife' Megessey (Robert De Niro) returns to town to help his friend. During the events, Jacknife for the first time offers help to Martha and finally two days - Prom Marta has to participate - and at this promo, David completely crushed the ruins of the school and scared city dwellers and students. Jacknife makes Dave in Vietnam from the moment they lost their friend, and brings David to start his climbing recovery. And long-suffering Martha also finds Jacknife's needs. <br /> <br /> All three actors perform amazingly subtle performances: Ed Harris offers one of his most complete roles, while De Niro and Baker maintain high standards in their careers. More people should be helped to awaken this whole but forgotten movie because it is a brave reminder of the damage our wars bring to the men who fight them and to the families who will get them at the end of the battle. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
