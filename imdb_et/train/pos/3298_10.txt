This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen - that's all - a truly touching scenario, fine actors who make beautiful art look, really elegant romance (it's a shame that such romance just doesn't seem to exist any more), beautiful songs and words (especially the last song), artistic result and costumes and kits that make you live. It was just a disappointment at the end that I was waiting for a grandiose film that had a brilliant ending - but it was still wonderful for most of the films that live there. Be sure to check this movie over and over again. You have many details that you forget for the first time, which deserve another look.
