Jackie Chan's name is synonymous. This movie will never let you down. Opening the best hunting scene and the last role down to the scene is not as risky as one wonder when it knows the meaning of fear. This movie is very close to Jackie's best, which is PROJECT A.But the main difference is that PROJECT A contains three stars, where Jackie in this movie is completely wearing a movie on his shoulders. This is perhaps the main reason why this movie made Jackie the biggest martial arts star, followed by Bruce Lee. also. This makes the work of this film Jakie able to show her honorable contract with her typical martial arts hero. This film was followed by a sequence that was good but was quite annoying compared to its predecessor.
