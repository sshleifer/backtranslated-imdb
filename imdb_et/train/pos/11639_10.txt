I saw an advanced screening of the movie today. I loved it completely. The film kept me all over the seat. Cillian Murphy is extremely horrible as a villain. For those who saw the beginning of Batman, his character in this film was much worse. He played his character very well. A terrible "bad boy", I've seen for a while. Rachel McAdams was great. Everybody in the audience laughed, smiled and praised at the same time as we were struck. The mid-term review is through the film. The amazing part is that the end was not anti-climate. I was finally not disappointed. I felt comfortable. The trailer does not make the film fair. The film is much better than the trailer. Don't wait until this movie appears on your video. Look at this. Although I didn't have to pay to watch this movie, I'd be happy to see it. Enjoy!
