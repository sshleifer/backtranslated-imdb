We often talk about cinema landmarks - Kane, The Godfather, A Bout de Souffle. However, one serious film critic has quite often forgotten one movie. I'm talking, of course, about the classic Doc Savage (M.o.). <br /> <br /> This film is not only exciting, but also seriously explores the exploitation of developing countries by US imperialism. Not to mention kung-fu. <br /> <br /> He also had the biggest film story (of course, the queen was amazing at Flash Gordon). Although this movie is a bit rare, it is worth looking for this movie - it will cost your search effort ten times.
