Get ready for this: it's one of my favorite films. I am relatively aware of other works by David Mamet (writer and director), but after watching this movie half a dozen times (it is always a pleasure to watch), I can say without hesitation that he is a genius. This movie is extremely well written and quickly draws you into the milieu of your fraud, artistic care, and back space. The feeling of the film is very similar to The Sting (1973), and it also respects the movie's poetry. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty psychologically complicated movie and I am sure I think about different plot twists and motives. Shadow characters. Sometimes it is somewhat predictable, but the shocking climax is always exciting to look at. <br /> <br /> In general, the actor is great - especially Joe Mantegna, but someone I watched the movie said to me is not a good idea to be a heroine (Lindsay Crouse) who is not just a gambler, a smoker and a thief, but also sporty 80-year-old hairstyle. I agree, but I think he is outstanding in this role. <br /> <br /> The less you know about the plot of this movie, the better it is, Mamet's latest film, Spanish Prison, because the ending is even more impressive. Just sit back and be ready to go with a movie that is dangerously close to the shine.
