This criminal thriller is kind of like a movie noir, although it changes the post-war and cold war context and there is something relatively decent to say to mankind. "Pickup on South Street", police officers are good guys, criminals are real boys, and the only enemies are "The Commies" who finally stand out from good boys that they are emotionally friendly, driven by real care, as shown by the close-ups that are constantly being watched, what characterizes the film. <br /> <br /> This movie comes around characters. The personalities of this film are quite unique and detailed: Exclude a pocket that can easily carry any risks and sometimes pass through your personal things; A fashion informant who is simply trying to hide the grand funeral, but who can capture the hearts and respect of almost all other characters (and audiences); Candy, a poorly named innocent girl who thinks she's doing government work and doesn't fully understand the conspiracy she's affiliated with; and Joey, a former boy-evil candy cheater who tries to hide from everyone and ironically, is the worst person. Throw a number of very colorful supportive symbols (such as chopsticks and police officers) and "Pickup on South Street" treats you with brilliant individuals as they trace mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frames. <Br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
