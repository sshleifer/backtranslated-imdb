Kazan's early film noir won the Oscar. Some reviews here move on to the film and its symbolism with extraordinary detail and length, and are highly appreciated. I see almost where they come from. But I prefer a toned approach to a long-forgotten film that seems to have been virtually budget-neutral and almost documented. The pneumatic plague is loose on the streets of New Orleans, and the military carrier (Widmark) and the city detective (Douglas) adhere to the main carrier (Palance). The film is spirited, captured in harsh black and white and makes it very good for locations. Widmark is wonderful as usual. Forget the insignia (crime equals disease and the disease equals crime) and just enjoy the pursuit. Such a movie is not always easy to see when we are well into the new century, because it is particularly stylish, very short-lived (after World War II in the early 1950s) and probably not interested in a casual film observer. For those who look at it for the first time, sit at the end of the big chase. It's something else, and frankly, I don't know how they filmed it. I can say that filming the final was probably as long as it made the first 90 percent of the movie.
