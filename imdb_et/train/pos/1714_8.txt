Watching the movie I was in a very light mood and this movie is easy, but the end of the movie is just unexpected, which remembers long-term memory. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Abhay and his profession witness registrar during marriage. Never comes to marriage and to her boyfriend, leaving Soh alone on the street where she can't go home and she has nothing to live in here. Abahy turns out to be his assistant, the basis of the story. <br /> <br /> The rest is simply traceable and the end of the story is bitter sweet that Abhay must face what keeps you on the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> Dialogues and music are good songs that are OK direction is good and so that the scenario you feel that the movie is slow but looking at the story of demand, it's all right. <br /> <br /> Truly observable, especially with a mild mood, I enjoyed it at home with coke and peanuts. my rating is 8/10
