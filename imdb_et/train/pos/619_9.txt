I expected this film to be a decent and probably cliche, but I was totally wrong! Charlie Cox (I had never heard of him) played an incredibly good leading man; he was so serious and romantic that I and my friend, who saw the movie with me, loved him completely. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes, whom I did as before (I loved her in Rome and Julia), made me enjoy her even more. His actions were fantastic, I couldn't even say he was an American. The chemistry between him and Charlie Cox was very good, the casting was quite perfect. <br /> <br /> Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were equally well cast; DeNiro as this gay pirate ... priceless, invaluable. I laughed so hard that Septimus comes on board ... oh my god, wow. Pfeiffer played a good cable, I liked my mother as a hair spray. But he had the right amount of melodrama and sniff throughout the film. In general, it was funny (but not at all!), Romantic, special effects were not quite frequent, but when they were, they were great; Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were also well placed. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who loves fantasy films such as princess bride or even Lord of the Rings. It keeps my interest all the time and I buy it out of DVD!
