As a result of Watergate, many conspiracy films appeared, such as those written by his recent Adam Kennedy (on his novel). Gene Hackman is a former Vietnamese veteran "Roy Tucker", a loser who has left prison. He gets visits from Marvin Tagge (Richard Widmark), who claims to represent an organization that is meant to help the wrongly convicted. They offer him freedom and despite the mistrust of Tagge. But he brings a cellular companion called Spiventa (Mickey Rooney). Exactly why it's hard to see, because Spiventa is an annoying little man who constantly drives Tucker through sex exchange, not what you want to hear when you're behind bars. <br /> <br /> Tagge's benefactors will kill Spiventa before Tucker's surprised eyes. Joined a woman Ellie (Candice Bergen) and gave her a new identity (strangely she doesn't try to change her look. Shaving to make the cheeses a start) she lives off, but she thinks there's a catch - Tagge wants Tucker to do US Presidential Assassination. He refuses, so Tagge has been abducted from Elli ... <br /> <br /> I'm leaving a summary here, but I'm sure you can think of yourself. The script has enough holes in the plot to read the book (clean trick!). The people who represent the tag have never been revealed. The references to the killing of J.F.K are misleading. Despite the conclusions of The Warren Commission, there is doubt as to whether Lee Harvey Oswald was acting alone. <br /> <br /> It was Stanley Kramer's first film of the years, and although Turkey is not, it doesn't say John Frankenheimer's 'Manchurian Candidate' or Alan J.Pakula's 'Parallax View'. As a left-wing conspiracy film, it tends to reflect its object instead of coping with it. I prefer the right people - they are more fun! "Domino" has the look and feel of T-V. a movie and a gorgeous, which must be the easiest way to escape from prison in film history, not to mention Michael Caine's classic "Get Carter". <br /> <br /> What makes it traceable is Gene Hackman and Richard Widmark. The latter, who unfortunately passed this year, is excellent as a mysterious Tagge, who initially seems to be behind the operation until he is mercilessly eliminated, starting with a chain of deaths aimed at removing all the evidence from the traces one by one of the perpetrators of this evil plot - like a domino. Like Tucker, an innocent pawnshop, Hackman is wonderful. You have to think about why he decided to hide in such an obvious place. In my shoes I had escaped to the other side of the world, wherever I got away from these fanatics. Hackman's loving scenes with Bergen slow down the plot and it's almost a relief. Manufacturers probably thought that explains why it opens up with a strange prologue that shows the whole premise of the film - as expressed by British actor Patrick Allen - to warn the audience that "they" are out there and that they "can't" get us. Comedian Les Dawson later his B.B.C. Show "The Dawson Watch". <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney had previously worked with Kramer "He A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World". His "death" scene resembles a picture where the actor looks dead with his fingers, not dead. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy movies were only left-wing in the past, but now the law is right. Last year, Tony Blair's absurd strife and "half-offs" turned out to be "taking liberties" in Britain's response to Reefer Madness. At least "Domino" was lovely Candice Bergen. Best Chris Atkins movie could be Anne Widdecombe! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, The Domino Principle made Sir Lew Grade, the legendary British television mogul "The Saint", "Jesus of Nazareth". and "Muppet Show". In 1980, he re-worked with Adam Kennedy, "Raise The Titanic!", A failure that was so great that he sank Grade's ambitions to be a new Louis B.Meyer. Being somewhat open, I do not rule out the possibility of a conspiracy.
