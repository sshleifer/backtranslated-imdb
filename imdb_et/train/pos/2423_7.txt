Once in a lifetime means that once hoodlum, always hoodlum and no one can get free or free. Neighbors in New York are selling drugs and running scams because they can't do it in a legitimate world, perhaps because they have a criminal record or a drug habit, or because they're just lazy. This simple story, with a few twists mostly on despicable characters, can make compassion for its mainstream audience because they are loyal and compassionate towards each other. The film is written, directed and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who also celebrates 20/20 Mike (all hoodlings are nicknames) and is based on his game "Riff Raff". The game seems to be from start to finish, especially during the longest scene where the three main players are squatting to decide who can trust. Often, dialogue comes very quickly, much faster than on stage, and I think it's the biggest mistake in the movie. The whole story behind the film is a mix of poems from the street, a kind of iambian pentameter rap that is a violent and evident world that this film discloses. Because of the poetry, it is difficult to unleash these men, those who are murdering, deceiving and betraying each other, as we deserve or our contempt. The worry of this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live, but how they suffer for the same reasons as all of us. One is too foolish, another junkie and the latter suffers for conscience, when the audience wonders or even laughs, to the irony of the kings, who demand that he hang on the plank to joke in the middle of his death.
