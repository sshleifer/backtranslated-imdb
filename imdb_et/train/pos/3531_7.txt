Robert Siodmak is doing a fabulous job with this B-Noir, with Ella Raines, Franchot Tone and Alan Curtis playing. And he does it, I can add it without the help of my male actors like Curtis and Tone. It is Raines all the time, a beautiful and beautiful actor who, for one reason or another, did not get to the position of some of his "noir" colleagues. <br /> <br /> Using sex, light, shadows and music is a remarkable feature of this genre. Shadows, light effects and camera angles are all effective. But the highlight of the film is at the nightclub of Elisha Cook's very sexual drum, excited about being in Rain. This is the scene that brings the "Phantom Lady" into the new territory. <br /> <br /> Siodmaki's commitment to material is only suitable for Raines, who gives a sincere impression of a loving woman trying to save her husband. Franchot Tone called it. Alan Curtis didn't seem to be upset that he could die and didn't seem happy that he lived. And he never fell in love with Rain, except for a short while in prison. <br /> <br /> The funny thing about many of these films is that when World War II progressed, interest in psychiatry became more intense. But these terms were often misused in films such as "Possessed", "Spellbound" and "The Greatest Show on Earth". Toni is called paranoid by Thomas Gomez - Tone probably has paranoia attached to his disorder, but it seems to be closer to the psychopath. In reality, as his headache proves, he may be pushing the brain's tumor against his brain. <br /> <br /> Phantom Lady doesn't have the biggest plot, but it's worth a look.
