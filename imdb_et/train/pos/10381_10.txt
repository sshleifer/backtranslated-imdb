The previous reviewer has said this precisely. I saw it once, was fascinated, I saw it for the second time, when it was sent again with a week or two first performance. I still remember some scenes. The provision is the opening of the 20th century, the title war is World War I. One of the scenes was placed only in a public place, which was an interesting historical remark. The moment when one of the women touches another is my greatest film moment of all time. I don't think of it as a "gay movie", it's an interesting and bidding love story where both leaders are women. I would like to see this movie again; I'd buy this one if it ever appeared on a DVD.
