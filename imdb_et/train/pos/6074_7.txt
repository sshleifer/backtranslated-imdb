Laurence Fishburne is a good actor and deserves respect for this trial, but he is not a great Shakespeareane like Olivier and Welles; and he is still suffering from Kenneth Branagh. This Irishman, always brilliant, steals the exhibition purely. Olivier acknowledged this potential in his production and threw Iago with someone he knew he could stand up to. I almost knew Iago, Shakespeare's most evil character, but Branagh shows us the depths. Nice to see the views of Venice.
