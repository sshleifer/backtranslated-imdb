I think this film was probably much more powerful when it debuted for the first time in 1943, although today it seems a bit too preaching and static to raise it. The film was set in 1940 - just before the US entered. Paul Lukas plays a very serious and decent head of his family. He is a German who has won the Nazis for seven years and avoided catching. Bette Davis is her very sensible and long-term woman who has been able to educate and educate her children from time to time. When the film begins, they cross from Mexico to the US and for the first time in years they are relaxing and running. <br /> <br /> For me, the problem was that the family was too perfect and too decent - knowing them is obviously a positive propaganda, not a real family that has real problems. Although at that time it was a very noble goal, it just seems fake. In particular, the incredibly strange and extremely scripted dialogue used by children was not true. It sounded more like anti-fascist speech than the voices of true children. As a result, they were extremely annoying, especially the smallest who stepped out from time to time. The only one who sounded really was Bette Davis and his extended American family, as well as the Romanian novel living with them (although he had no noticeable emphasis). <br /> <br /> It's really hard to believe that the famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialogue because it just doesn't sound alive. The story was based on the game of his lover Lillian Hellman. And the main story of the idea and plot is good, ... but dialogue is just bad at times. Generally interesting curio and film with some great moments, but it's really all.
