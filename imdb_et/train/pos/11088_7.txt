The craze of this film is one of thinking and he seems to enjoy what he does, that is what I think he means. I don't think most men like this movie, especially if they ever cheat on their wife. This is one of those movies that pretty much goes to the end. But then, there's the end of the candy bar that makes me look back and say, "HOKIE AS HELL." Pretty good movie until the end. The end is the end we would like to see, but not the end of such a beginning. And then that's what happened. I think you can do your own idea of ​​the true end. I have the feeling that only one sign should have ended.
