It has been as long as I have seen this film (at least 15 years) and still haunts the vivid picture of the terrifying consequences war prisoners may face despite the terms of the Geneva Convention. <br /> <br /> The Australian Underwater Demolition Experts Unit is being fished in a Japanese archipelago after a successful mission to set up mines in a Japanese port. they will soon learn from their friendly Japanese prison guard that they are being tried as spies because they were busy. The consequences of such violations are the death of Japanese fighting codes. <br /> <br /> Despite their allegations and sympathetic statements by the prison guard, there is a day when approaches such as a labeling bomb are being considered. The tensions are so high that you actually hear looting, though it may just be beating your chest with percussion percussion percussion. <br /> <br /> The end is actually too painful to re-engage with my head, write it down here. But I can promise you - you will never forget it. Good luck finding video in the US
