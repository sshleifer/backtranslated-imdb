Arthur Bach must grow, but unfortunately it is not the only thing he has to do. According to his extremely rich father, Arthur has to marry some rich Susan Johnson or has withdrawn from a family doctor ($ 750 million). The problem is that Arthur does not love Susan (although I hear that he is a good chicken) and has just fallen down the floor of the waitress and part-time shop at Linda Maro. Arthur is an interesting companion. He's a really big boy who was born into wealth for at least one person every day every day. Working just rubs in the wrong direction of Arthur - he likes to have fun, wife and of course drink. Drinking gives Arthur a sort of Jekyll-Hyde complex; and while it gets into any kind of problem, looking at the screen is a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore in this Arthur movie is great, earning an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe victory for his score. Moore is fantastic with the comedic aspects of the film, making already funny lines an unforgettable comic book, but she's also great when she brings Arthur up to a relative level and makes her character pleasant. Moore has help with spouses - Liza Minnelli is great because Lina, who is bold in someone Arthur doesn't get enough, and John Gielgud is terrible as Arthur Butler Hobson. Gielgud won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in this movie and no doubt why. Hobson has a rock-solid, dry and spiritual attitude, but he always looks at Arthur - and Gielgud is in a perfect role. Steve Gordon's 1981 Arthur film is short and easy but offers a lot of laughter.
