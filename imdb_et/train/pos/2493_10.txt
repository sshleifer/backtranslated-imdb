A typical 90-year-old comedy, situation comedy is similar to our "My Family". Thatcher is the height of most political jokes, Bill (Belinda Lang) accuses Thatcher of everything he gets. "Bloody Thatcher" can be shared with most of us. David, a typical teenager, braided the brain with bread knives, Jenny, the eldest older teenage children, only interested in boys and boys. Bill and Ben work as much as possible to keep their family economically from the early 1990s. The first two lines were not as successful as the last, but series 3 is where it all laughs, what I care about. as a rule, this exhibition did not have the best viewing time and should have been kept for a little longer. they probably couldn't continue after Gary Olsen died, but I think they should get rid of "catherine Tate" "little UK" and bring the classics back!
