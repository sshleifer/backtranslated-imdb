Beautifully done. Lots of angst. Friendship may not all suffer, but in the end it is all that matters, or a group of friends. I've been watching it again and again. Music is also amazing. If Kei loses a friend, he will give up until he meets the orphan boy Shoga, whose true nature is not abandoned. On Mallepa's unlawful streets, they fight for their place in thawing Asian races and learn that sometimes top-up pay you more than you ever pay. Surprise that ends as much as the whole movie does. I didn't get enough of it. Gackt and Hyde do wonderful work, showing that they are more than the real guys who sing.
