A young and seemingly promising college graduate (played by Blair Underwood) is sent to jail for murdering an innocent young man and sentenced to death. Sean Connery plays a "happy happy" attorney, who was retired by a young man's grandmother, and asks him to take the case in the hope of releasing his child's child. Laurence Fishburne plays a police officer who was well-connected to the case and hesitantly hesitates the theory that Connery can sue for trying and releasing a boy whom he and the entire police department swear by is guilty. Ed Harris, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and late Lynne Thigpen are in this very intense dramatic thriller.
