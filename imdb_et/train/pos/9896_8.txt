I've been thinking of seeing it in the last couple of months. I was really surprised how good it was. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the high school teenage group who are tempting Marty's boy. They constantly bully him until one of them makes a terrible mistake that leaves Marty terribly burning. <br /> <br /> A few years later, reckless teenagers are recalled to their high school, which is now an abandoned party. Although no reckless teenager has organized this party. <br /> <br /> Later, teenagers will die out of the toughest opportunities. I can certainly tell you that they are also great. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie you will find that it was all a dream and none of it happened. But Marty is in the hospital with severe burns. Although the murders did not happen, burns and worship apparently appeared. <br /> <br /> Operation is terrible, but it's good. <br /> <br /> I love this story. I really feel compassion for Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). The tempters will end up with what is coming to them, and you will feel calm that the victim will get their sweet revenge. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that someone pick up it if you are looking for 80s slashers. /> <br /> I give this movie 10 stars out of 10. Good cheesy slasher!
