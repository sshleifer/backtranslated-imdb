until HBO started running this month. I remember laughing in the theater in 1991 loud and now again in my living room. When I see it turned on, I have to watch it. The question is not simple. It's much more fun for me than other, popular spoofers like the plane! (which I really like, BTW). Cathy Moriarty steals the exhibition in my opinion. Quotes like "Sudden speech! The last symptoms of brain fever! He can blow at any moment!" put me on the edge. And Whoopie Goldberg is not that funny because 'Jumpin' Jack Flash '. Kevin Klein, Sally Field, Robert Downey Jr. I started doing this from 9 out of 10 stars, but then I realized that it should be the type of this movie, nothing I would change or improve. So this is 10. I have to get it on the DVD, that's just what it has.
