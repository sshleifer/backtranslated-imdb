Tight, shockingly intelligent work by the British writer Hanif Kureishi, who wrote "My Beautiful Laundrette" (this is the best thing he has done since then). It is about smart people whose lives are not much supported. They have destroyed what they have given and are mostly empty ships. The only sign on the screen is the mother of the title, but she feels dead until the harsh handyman shows her affection and awakens her to the joy of sex. He has his own motives, but Kureishi treats him with much compassion. This is a film where people and places feel familiar with the characters outside the screen. In some ways, it's a bit like "Sunday, bloody Sunday", but it's a tougher job. Director Roger Michell allows you to instinctively build scenes. And it has worked beautifully. <br /> <br /> As a mother named Anne Reid, she gives her gestures a wasted life. Her extraordinarily lively performances have no false announcements, and this very subtle actor Daniel Craig shows his character to the shade, even if Kureishi hasn't been. When a movie hits the wrong note, the talentless daughter's character is a dirty thing for her husband, whom his mother seduces (or it should be the other way around) and even a lifestyle, but he's so well played by Cathryn Bradshaw. The film is also very beautiful to watch (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and it must be the best British film of the year.
