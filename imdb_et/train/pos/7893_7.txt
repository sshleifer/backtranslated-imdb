I think I'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this movie. Is it one of the best "Nightmare" series? Maybe not, but I had a lot of fun with it. Freddy Krueger reaches out to his evil, destroying the potential. Since Parts 4 and 5 are behind the series, I felt that the so-called final installment ("New Nightmare" is a real finale) brought the series out of its slump. There are some great nightmares, including one where Breckin Meyer plays a stoner who gets into the trash, sleeps and gets a video game that Freddy controls. This is a very original and fun queue, especially when we see him out of dreams, flying around like Super Mario. And Freddy draws out a funny one-liner "Great Graphics". And since the film was made about 10 years ago, he brought back memories when Freddy started to play with Powerglove. Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers Powerglove. <br /> <br /> Cast is great. Lisa Zane is perfectly cast. I have not seen Yaphet Kotto from "Running Man", and I think the last time I saw this movie about 5 years ago. He is another great, underrated actor with a powerful screen presence. And who can forget the fire? The best is Johnny Depp (the first "Nightmare") who plays a spokesperson for anti-drug advertising. <br /> <br /> The 3D sequence at the end is really awesome! So for those who want to watch this movie, please rent or buy it from DVD! Hopefully, all publications will come with 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video edition has been removed. <br /> <br /> I personally didn't see much mistakes in the movie. It's even Freddy's back. The film is a great combination of humor and fear, and the gross output effects are terrible. Would it have given the franchise better justice? Of course it can be. But Rachel Talalay did a good job. And finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done. <br /> <br /> Finally, I loved opening up loans. The fans in the series are joyful and watch it as a tribute to the beloved Fredd. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
