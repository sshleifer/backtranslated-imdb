As a child, I loved computer animation, although it was extremely limited and the tools were almost non-existent. This film, when I sat in awe and watched amazing pictures and almost hypnotic music, designed me to create things on the computer. It's a whole package agreement between music and video that really packs one or two punches. If you know a child who wants to do computer animation, it MUST be. <br /> <br /> I am still almost 20 years later rated this movie as one of my 3 best favorites. In my opinion, the originality is most of today's McMovies, which Hollywood spits on. Now I want to see if I can do it myself; when imitation is a form of sensual sincerity, this film deserves to be imitated TON =)
