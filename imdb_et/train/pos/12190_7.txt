It's very hard to say what's going on with "The Lady from Shanghai" and what the film might have been like without the studio. Orson Welles' main interest in the film was to raise money for his theater; indeed, the funding of his own projects is what prompted him to look for jobs. He made "Lady from Shanghai" to be soon a former wife of Rita Hayworth. Harry Cohn was afraid of Rita's image and held the release for one year. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns an Irish sailor, Michael O'Hara, who loves Else (Hayworth, stunning) short blond hair. His wife is a well-known criminal lawyer, Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane), who is as exhausted as he is. He hires O'Hara to work in his hunt and there is O'Hara deeper and deeper into the network of murder and fraud. <br /> <br /> The Shanghai woman is moving at a snail's pace, although I agree with one poster that is being criticized today for movies because they have taken the time to build a plot. But it drags the movie. The funny house scene is fantastic - Welles wanted it without music, and I believe the studio cut it down. Shame. The whole photography is awesome, atmospheric, bold and very stylish. <br /> <br /> Welles was a great actor, beautiful in youth, charismatic and with great voice and technique, but in many movies it's almost the same as he doesn't trust himself or takes time to develop a character. Instead, it relies on external, such as accents and fakes. The only time he didn't do that was "Tomorrow is forever", where the director gets him great, deeply felt. In contrast to "Compulsion", where he shows that he is the master of pure technical behavior, as he does in his phone. Here, Welles makes a fourfold commitment - director, star, co-author and narrator. Sporting and intense searching with an entirely unnecessary accent was a quick way to characterize. Nevertheless, he is always convincing. <br /> <br /> Supporting players are excellent, including Sloan and Glenn Anders. Hayworth, with a proud and soft voice (his song was again under the name of Anita Ellis) is like a regular goddess and one of the big screen presence. What a sad life for such a viable beauty. <br /> <br /> Every movie directed by Orson Welles is worth seeing and "The Lady from Shanghai" is no exception. But it leaves the viewer's disappointment, as does The Magnificent Ambersons, as well as all the work done by Welles in the studio system. He was a great artist who should have given more free governance; he wasn't. He was a strange dichotomy - he needed more freedom, but as some of his later works prove he needed a studio structure. Unfortunately, he didn't get both.
