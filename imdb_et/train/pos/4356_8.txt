"My people's thing" came as a surprise. We had no idea what to expect. The film was directed by a film directed by Raymond DeFelitta, one of the stars of which Paul Reiser has shown on the screen. Although the film is predictable and we know what the result is, this discovery trip where Ben knows his father, perhaps for the first time in his life, sees Ben as his father for what he really is, but not the mythical figure he has is in your mind. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be the star of Peter Falk's star and runs alongside the film as expected. Mr Falk, one of the actors in this era and the films of recent years, is an actor of such a reputation, he must be taken into account. When Ben Kleiman, who is a distant father, is a man who is clearly misunderstood, not just Ben, but it appears to the whole family and his wife forty-seven years. <br /> <br /> When the matriarch of Muriel Kleinman's clan runs away, everyone is panic, because the woman who has been a strong family member is extremely important to keep everyone together. He doesn't know where he's gone, Sam gets confused in Ben's house because he feels he's married and suddenly abandoned all these years. <br /> <br /> Ben, the youngest son, will take his father on a trip to find the house he wants to buy so he can bring his family to Manhattan. The trip apologizes to Ben for associating with his father in a way he never knew, because the old man had always imagined an extraordinary figure for his younger son. On the way, father and son understand how much they love each other and how the old man has misunderstood his children. Sami's love for Muriel extends over the years when they have known each other; they are inseparable. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is great in the movie. He makes an excellent Sam Kleinman, a man who suddenly realizes that his life is getting worse. Mr Falk shines with the elder man and his interpretation never has the wrong movement of the person whose whole world is breaking under him. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of Paul Reiser, we have to admit that Ben Kleinman, he is right. Ben and his father discover how much they both have together, and their love for Muriel, the mother who has sacrificed her life to keep the family together. Olympia Dukak is only seen at the end of the movie. She is a contributing mother. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel with great style. <br /> <br /> The film has a beautiful look thanks to Dan Gillham's cinematography and Steven Argila's excellent music. Ultimately, the film shows great teamwork between film director DeFelitta and Paul Reiser. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is clearly targeted at the older audience, it should appeal to everyone.
