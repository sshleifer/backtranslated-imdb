I got this movie on the Sundance channel by cable one late afternoon. You can say that "who loves the sun" is the story of a perfect calm pastime, why never. You can visit the trio: Lukas Haas is Will (returns after a sudden departure every year), Molly Parker is Maggie (we learn she's a lot of Bloom) and Adam Scott is Daniel (is he a friend or an enemy or a groom) , by the picturesque Falcon Lake, Manitoba, Canada, captured in graphical compositions against sunlight and shadows. Supporting the Trio is another family in the revealing mix: Wendy Crewson is the mother of Mary Bloom and R.H. Thomson is the father of Arthur Bloom. Writer-director Matt Bissonnette has given creative traits and different combinations - worry, Haas may have a "hopeless" face, but humor comes when Parker and Scott enter the circle of friends reunited, laughing smiles, and knowing the joys of joy. Dialogues can be tiny or even zeros, but we can get what is cooking, confusing, or thinking. <br /> <br /> Yes, "Who loves the sun" can very well be classified as a sleeping bed. The chemistry of all five principals is sure that gels and "burns" giving the energetic band performance. After all, it's all in the family, and the film doesn't take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> The official website seems to be still available at "wholovesthesun.com" and the audio track contains information about Mac McCaughan (Portastatic with guitars and strings), where scores are played, and behind-the-scenes production notes, interview with the writer - Director-producer with Bissonnette on how film and concept came about, pain and much more. Always appreciate Molly Parker because of her free but amazing performance "Kissed" by Lynne Stopkewich in 1996, and she is married to Bissonnette, who "wrote Molly to Maggie."
