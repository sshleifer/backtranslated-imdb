This movie is a small sunrise in the dark season. It stands for quality that is best described as ordinary friendliness. Morgan Freeman plays very much like Freeman - a successful actor who pushes 70. He has traveled to a small, rather grim grocery store who was going to explore the part he could play as a leader of such a place. Soon he will be fond of employees and customers, especially cute, as a harsh, young woman (Paz Vega) who will lead over ten points or less at checkout. <br /> <br /> There are 10 products or less you do not have a big statement to do and pretend to do it. That's why Freeman and Vega, when they become friendly, and when the older man offers his defense, in return for driving home - the film company gofer, who should pick him up, has never shown and Freeman has forgotten his phone number so he can't ask for help. I had a small case of blues New York's gray Sunday afternoon, and this flick improved me, which caught me.
