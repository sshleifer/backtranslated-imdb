While I thought at one point that it would become a Graduate, I must say that Mom is doing a great job of explaining the sexual desires of older women. <br /> <br /> I am so pleased to have a British movie because Hollywood would never have done it, and even if they were, they would have destroyed it, leaving time for the characters to develop. <br /> <br /> The story appears slowly and realistically. Action is great, characters are believed to be faulty and dialogue is sensitive. I tried several times to predict what would happen, and I was always wrong, so the story was very interesting. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. And I have to admit I look at my mother forever in a different light!
