The powerful, powerful gangster's ultimate Frankie Diomede (always terrible Lee Van Cleef, in a tough form) has been taken into custody and sent to jail to kidnap the discovery of a fraudulent partner. Undoubtedly, Tony Breda (Tony Lo Bianco's peaceful image) will also be bluntly blunted in a small amount of time. Frank and Tony make up an unlikely friendship behind bars. Tony helps Frank leave and helps him in trying to get exactly the revenge of a group of attackers led by ruthless Louis Annunziata (Jean Rochefort smoothly). Directed by Sergio Donat and Luciano Vincenzon's absorbing manuscript, director Michele Lupo associates a pure story with a constant, fast pace, retains an appropriately sharp, but occasionally light tone all the time, and slips into action pieces with remarkable dirty brio (coarse jailhouse shower strokes and a long-lasting mondo destructo car chase as a set of exciting highlights). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco present nice, open and participatory chemistry; the relationship between these characters is funny and touching. The fearsome Edwige Fenech hasn't done much if Tony boasts a girlfriend Orchid, but at least she can reveal her extremely proud and vigorous body in a highly priceless nude shower scene. Riz Ortolan's bright, pulsating, synchronized funk / jazz score will definitely hit your breath on the spot. Also impressive is Joe D'Amato's and Aldo Tonti's polished cinematography. Really passionate and fun little winner.
