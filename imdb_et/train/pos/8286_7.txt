Larry Fessendeni has hit most of the forum's comments. Well, the worst mistake is obviously movie marketing and how DVDs could have been targeted. Of course, this is not at least a real horror film, not for people waiting for something that is gory and instantly satisfactory. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is basically a film that seems to have been told by young Miles. Things that children do not understand easily tend to remain in their young minds and ultimately dominated by their fears and the threatening world they cannot understand. Obviously, mother Kim is a psychologist, but she has no idea what her son thinks is going to happen. This is also the story of alienation. It is clear that Father, George, is a distant figure, perhaps a carer who seems to be living in a different world. <br /> <br /> Miles' fears will end up in the country at the end of the week. This part of the state of New York, the winter landscape, the barren with disabilities, plays the imagination of a little boy devastatingly. It does not help that he will encounter a strange figure in the city, which will cause even more doubts in his youth. Ultimately, the Miles world crashes upon him and he can't do anything, even by creating a Wendigo spirit. <br /> <br /> The film is well paced and acted. Patricia Clarkson is great no matter where she is. Jake Weber is perfect as a farther father who has the opportunity to get closer to the son he doesn't understand. Erik Per Sullivan, like Miles, gives him internal confusion. I thought he was extremely effective because the whole movie is what Miles himself is doing around him. Finally, John Spredakos is perfect as a threatening Otis, a man who is annoying the world for how he has come out. <br /> <br /> Instead of this movie, future viewers should approach it openly.
