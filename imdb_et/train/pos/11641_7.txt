I was just trying to get an episode of Brad, a crack cocaine addict who turned to the drug addicts on the streets after his bicycle racing career began as soon as he started. I have to say that the story of his cycling was more offensive than his addiction. Here is the young boy who has won the bicycles left and right and is invited to train for two weeks with the Olympic training team and immediately after arrival he offends Lance Armstrong, one of the biggest athletes ever living, and is generally innocent and unfriendly to everyone in general . Obviously, he will be asked to leave soon. Most of the exhibitions are related to her struggle for addiction and how she got her life back, but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with her to do her job like a ass? <br /> <br /> In any case, I was confused about how the show was put together because it shows Brad at the height of his addiction. We see a frame of how he puts on handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches, and even smokes crack cocaine. I didn't even know it was legal, but why should the camera team watch and film it? Do they do this in the hope that this man will change his life and give them material for a good TV episode? <br /> <br /> In any case, it is an enlightening show because it shows the various addictions and complete control they can take over people's lives. Sometimes it is hard to see, because you really see how badly families and friends are in the drug addiction, although I have to admit that it all seems too clean at last. During episodes there are times when terrible things happen and everything seems lost, but still, and maybe I should warn about spoilers here, everything is finally too happy happily forever and I feel it is very rare in real life. However, it is an exhibition of people who are trying to help other people, and you can never complain too much about it?
