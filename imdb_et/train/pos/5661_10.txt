I see there are many people on this site who want AG to appear on DVD. Well, I bought it on a DVD. (Boundaries, not less!) Although it's great to show this terrible DVD format, I'm worried that they added very little "extra" on the road (director's comment about Shaun Cassidy) Pilot episode) and episodes are shown in the same order when they put them off the TV. There are no episodes that were never shown before running the Sci Fi channel in the box, but they are pasted on the final DVD. When you buy a DVD set, you get the actual order to watch them and you are happier. (In order to see them in order, you need to change the DVD player out and out of your player, but you are glad you did.) <br /> <br /> S
