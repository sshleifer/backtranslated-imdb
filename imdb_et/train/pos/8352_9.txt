This movie is a stunning piece that convinces even the most skeptical viewer that Gerard Depardieu is one of the best film actors of the last 50 years. His performance is shocking, entertaining, disgusting and astonishing, leaving you breathless. The film was filmed in the early days of his film career and is very raw, but still able to pass on the Depardieu's mastery. Must see any Depardieu fan and definitely his best early work.
