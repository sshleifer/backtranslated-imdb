Acting This film is a very well-functioning film. I say that performances are somewhat weak at times; but mostly it is very good. The only actor who flew with me was Jude Law as Harlen Maguire. He was incredible! Tom Hanks seemed insecure at some points in a movie, but he was also incredible. Paul Newman, good as always. Cinema This is what made the film a masterpiece (and I use it rarely). Conrad Hall is a true genius. When you stop the movie at any time, you'll see the delicate work of this man. He sets each shot so that nothing is left out. If the camera is still there, a postcard like quality is displayed. When the camera moves, each shot is perfect. But it doesn't stop there. The choice of color and contrast between light and dark in Conrads is a work of art. The way he illuminates the set is some of the most amazing lighting I've ever seen. His work in this film did what it was. This movie is the best list with the best story, LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge and Vertigo. The story People say that this movie is a gangster of the 1930s, but I believe they left the movie point. It is a love story of a striker who does not try to protect his son from the life he chose. It is a wonderfully designed story that opens up as a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but one. Screen Writing is worth the Oscar. Music by Thomas Newman draws a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story. Music is some of the most beautiful and touching scores I flock. Direction Sam Mendes is a new manager with an experienced director. The symbols he uses and his performances from his actors are a rarity in today's world of filmmaking. I'm watching the next movie by Sam Mendes. 10/10 is one of the most mobile and beautiful movies I've ever seen.
