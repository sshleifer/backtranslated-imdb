My brother brought this movie home from the rental area and I remember this kind of hole. I think the title put me down. I never remember getting a movie with such low expectations and so winning. I watched the movie twice before I let my brother back to the store. It is very rare that the film speaks to me as it happened. I was completely in Ruby's situation when she was trying to survive her life. The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly. I should have looked at the lesson. Another downside is that I've been happy with everything that Ashley Judd has done. He's so perfect in this movie. This movie is easily among my top ten favorites.
