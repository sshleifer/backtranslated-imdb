When I was flying on a big movie, I came to Live! almost randomly. oh boy! what was the choice. <br /> <br /> I remembered that the trailer was seen a year ago, and completely forgot that he was not expecting more than another cheese from the nonsense of the foolish reality. Now I can just say it's been hell of driving. I don't remember the last time I'm so excited. It is not sure if it was my height, but the ratio is gradually increasing through the film until it reaches the peak where you cannot turn the screen, sitting literally on the edge of your seat and biting the rest of the nails. <br /> <br /> First of all, you will pass a personal moral judgment on where you stand for the fairness of the exhibition. You start to think "how can a person be so cruel" that "why not all?". Ask yourself if you do it. Then check out the competitors, their motives and start guessing. Then you look at the competitor pulling the trigger one by one and excited, even though you know the first candidate is safe. <br /> <br /> Good functioning, good leadership, movie experience that reminds you of old movies where you knew what was going to happen in the next scene, but still more. <br /> <br /> Spoilers * A couple of things I would have changed: <br /> <br /> - Casting competitors. I have really been a farmer and we should have had a bit more of him. The idea that a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid, it seemed you didn't care about some of the contestants. Although it might have been done for the purpose, I think the audience should have been able to relate to most of the competitors. - The rules of the game, a big mistake: what happens if the 5th competitor does not die when he fires. you seriously think that the last permanent guy pulls the trigger and fills himself !!! they should have given all competitors the opportunity to live, ie: if 5 is empty, no one will die. <br /> <br /> The interesting thing is that this bad point is not too bothered because I really had a good time. just wish I had a popcorn with me!
