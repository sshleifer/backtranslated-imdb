Unusual film from Ringo Lam and what is strange underestimated. The mixing of fantasy kung-fu with more realistic swords and spears that the bodies pass through is surprising, especially in the first ten minutes. The rider will be two and his waist and legs will ride the horse. Several horses will be cut. This is very unexpected. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple, Fong and his Shaolin brothers have hit a crazy maniac and imprisoned in the Temple of Red Hope, which seems to be a more torture chamber than a temple. The General has a similarity to Kurtz in Apocalypse Now that he hurts philosophy and makes horrific paintings with human blood. <br /> <br /> Production is very impressive and the setting is empty. Blood is everywhere. The activity is very well done, and in most cases it is different from many HK action scenes. Sometimes the film moves into an absurd situation or the effects are nervous, but it is never bad enough to destroy films. <br /> <br /> Find it, this is one of the best HK kung fu movies from the early nineties. Remember, this is not child friendly.
