this film is so complex that it can be described and still together. You have an insecure, restless and exciting main character (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud) who is trapped by two (three, three) women. we listen to his social, philosophical, and moral qualities in infinite monologues; we see that he works around his magic with the three women he loves. it can be a prerequisite for a bird movie full of rigid, cold and interested comments. Director Jean Eustache manages to keep it fresh, ironic and clever. Being such a long film, we can't just laugh when, after 2 hours of politely speaking, Jean-Pierre Léaud suddenly punishes the phone when he remembers the film's cheese. such situations are purely cinematic and cannot be fully restored in the comments. nor can anyone at the end of the film restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of Françoise Lebrun. 3 and 1/2 hours and every minute of twisting.
