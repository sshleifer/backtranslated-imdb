ELVIRA, MARKESS OF THE DARK (1988) <br /> <br /> director: James Signorelli starring: Cassandra Peterson, W. Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Greene and Edie McClurg <br /> Type: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) Closes TV show and lead a small Christian town in Fallwell, Massachusetts to collect his dead aunt from the legacy, hoping to make big bucks to open the show in Vegas. Unfortunately for him, everything is that he is a creepy old house, a poodle and a magical cookbook. When he lives in Fallwell, Elvira tries to make money, breathe life into the teens, win the woman's heart (Daniel Greene), avoid burning at stake and keep a cookbook of his crappy set (W. Morgan Sheppard), who plans to use the book to end the world. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I love both Cassandra Peterson and her alter-ego Elvira. She is a very successful, beautiful and funny woman, and when Elvira is all that sick and fun, naive, not to mention she has an amazing pair of knockers. In this film, his charms are well used. <br /> <br /> I loved the whole fish out of the water to know the movie. You have Elvira with her low cut black dress, her big black hair and her huge "twins", and she's in a Christian city where most girls can't even wear makeup. This also makes his love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) much more fun. <br /> <br /> W. Morgan Sheppard is as big as Elvira's uncle / nemesis Vincent to steal a book to use for evil. He has a lot of presence, but still can't get out and steal Elvira scenes. <br /> <br /> What really makes a movie is not a plot, but a lot of fun. Everything from boy jokes to horror is here and makes me laugh much more than anything after SCARY MOVIE. I hear about 56 booby jokes in this movie, and every Roger Corman B-horror valve fan loves this movie spam. <br /> <br /> If you love Elvira, you love this flick. See also ELVIRA HAUNTED HILLS.
