I saw this joyful little movie from 10/11 in 1979 when it was sent to CBS. I didn't know it would have been in the theater at all. To appreciate this from a child's point of view, I'd give it 4 5 stars because I was a young boy, it seemed a bit "innate". <br /> <br /> A climatic scene where Gazooks fades in the daylight, where everyone was a bit disturbing, but you grow out of it. <br /> <br /> When I discovered Blockbuster Video in 1995, I had to review it! I still liked it, even though it seemed a bit "old". I don't know where the other reviewer got the idea that it wasn't in VHS. <br /> <br /> It's there. Maybe even on DVD, at least I hope it is. I want to share it with my children one day! 10 stars here, it's still a great children's movie. (End) <br /> <br /> 09/08/2009: Finally a VHS copy was found !! Woo-hoo!
