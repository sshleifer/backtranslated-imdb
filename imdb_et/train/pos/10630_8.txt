I find it regrettable that the leading comments on this film include "Clueless and terrible crap." I think it's a very funny movie and great entertainment. It is necessary to stop your disbelief that a homosexual man and lesbian woman could fall in love with a child and live together happily. But it's always nice to see it play in the movie and warm up the heart. Is it so impossible? Many other unlikely events have been described in other films. Action is good, the script is funny. The only downside is that the story may have ended when the family drives away from their original house, instead of exploring whether the man retains homosexuality.
