I believe that Sopranos is a fantastic show because of all the characters it contains. i have purchased all the videos so far and look forward to the rest of the release. In all 42 episodes there is at best episode # 3, Denial, Anger, Acceptance. This episode deals with my most favorite character in Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filone. He was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and killed the driver by chance. Brendan was fantastic because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against Tony and his gang. Eventually, he reached out with the aging, and this is my favorite scene ever in the history of Sopranos. Brendan Filone is # 1 for me. And my # 2 most favorite character was Matthew Bevilaqua, who was killed after the murder of Christopher Moltisant. Tony and Pussy shot him in the Hucklebarney Park when they caught him and tormented him. My most popular symbol # 3 is Sean Gismonte, who was killed right after Christopher's shooting. And finally, my # 4 favorite favorite is Chucky Signore, one of Uncle Junior's handbags. Tony killed him on the boat. All fantastic characters are dead. This is the only bad thing about the Sopranos. All cool guys are always killed. Do you know what it would be great to change about the Sopranos? They should have a whole episode where they show all dead supporters in hell and they all try to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvio and Paulie because they need their revenge. Brendan Filone strikes back !!!!!!!!! 1
