This "Walker, Texas Ranger" team's incredibly formal flick contains some of the most incredible scenes ever seen on TV. In addition, you can get a lot of predictions. However, this is a fun little movie that does the job done: it attracts. That's all he had to do and do. Stunts and explosions are fun and exciting, and the plot is not half bad. The actor is also decent, which is no surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Steven Seagal. If you are a fan of the genre (and "Walker, Texas Ranger") you will definitely love it. If not, don't waste your time. 8/10
