How I came across: When I started to look at this series of Cartoon Network, I have to say that I've never seen anything like this and it was the best. But when I started the VHS series and years later I collected the collection of the DVD disc of Bandai Anime Legends. It was amazing and really worth it. It was a lot of explosive action that would kick you out of your seat. Of course, "Just Communication" and Rhythm Emotions "were the best. <br /> <br /> Characters and Gundams: My favorite characters were: Heero, Duo, Relena, Treize, Lady Und, Noin and Zechs. I liked most, Wing Zero and Epyon, and of course Altron and Deathscythe I and II. <br /> <br /> Meaning to show: This series tells us that wars are very difficult in real life and we can sometimes win or lose, but peace can also be hard to come by and I believe that the Gundam pilots are doing the right thing and are trying to get the world peace. <br /> <br /> But this exhibition is really the best of the finals. .
