The contribution of Ernst Lubitsch to American cinema is enormous. His legacy is an outstanding group of films that live forever, as is "The Corner". This film has been redesigned to other less-recognized films and musical games without the charm or elegance of Lubitsch's own and firm version. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked together in many films. The characters in these films are distinguished, for example, in how to be in the movie without working at all. Both stars are admirable because those who do not know each other, but who worked together in one and the same shop in Budapest, are so. <br /> <br /> The reason why these classic films worked so well is the amazing supportive castings that the studios will capture after the picture. Here we have the wonderful Frank Morgan, who plays the shop owner. We also see, among other things, Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, doing impressive work to believe that they are in Budapest. <br /> <br /> Therefore, these films live forever!
