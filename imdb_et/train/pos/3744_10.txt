This is probably the best short crime drama I've ever seen. It is great, especially Amanda Burton, who is frightened to disturb the sad and then some ... She does an amazing job of balancing the feelings of Rachels / Carlas and taking away the pain that has lost her child. it seems more like a real life story than a drama. Other participants are, of course, also excellent at what they usually have on British TV / Movie. The end I am not going to give is fantastic mainly because you really don't get it ... (you get what I mean after you see it). and again, and if you don't touch it, you're a cold-hearted person.
