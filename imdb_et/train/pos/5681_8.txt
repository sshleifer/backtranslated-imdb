I had no problem with the film, which I thought it was pretty good. This is the actual LAPD crime picture video that bothered me. I don't know if the Lion Gate really thought the general audience would like to see people who were dead at times and blood all over. Sorry about the Lion Gate, it was the BASIC MORE IDEA !!! <br /> <br /> Return of the movie: Cast was great, especially Val Kilmer like John Holmes. John Holmes was buggy, threatening women in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, Kate Bosworth as his girlfriend) and he is hopelessly into drugs. His connection to Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) creates a spiral that results in the infamous Wonderland murders. How much was Holmes involved in the murder? We may never know the whole story (Nash is still alive and free), but the film does a good job.
