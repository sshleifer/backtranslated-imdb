This movie is an exact copy of the Indian TV channel Doordarshan, which was broadcasted at least 15 years ago. The series was known as "gubbarre", which means balloons. Every episode was a new story. The story is great and the original is much sweeter and "more convincing" Abhay Doel does a good job, but he does not fit the role of "normal" and "third-class" boys (as he calls himself in the film). In fact, Shayan Munsh's short hair would be Abhays without a dress, but Shayan doesn't just have the talent to pull it out. <br /> <br /> I would recommend watching the series if it is available. This is the same story, except running around with friends with your mother and the initial introduction. The activities of the TV actors were much better than those "stars". hours. So it has to hit. Even the songs of the feelings of the nose song could not build up. Script and series completion was much better <br /> <br /> ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######## # ### ## SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### Termination of THe Initial Series was much stronger than the hero himself digs the girl, even if she is ready to marry her. He is aware and tells him that he does not want to be "repaid" and never helped that intention. The director or script somehow writes that he did not get the original end of this movie. The original end would have bought tears for the girls' eyes and would have had to nod to the boys. The delivery was just not right. But personally, I feel it's a pathetic copy. The director / scriptwriter should not be given credit. The story is amazing and it is one of the famous novelists belonging to the PRemchand munshi class. I'm not sure if this is a premsand and munshi story, but many other series in his series include some premchand munshi and other great Hindi writers.
