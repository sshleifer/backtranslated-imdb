This film is perfect for any romantic in the world. John Ritter has never been better and the best line in the movie! "Sam" hits close to home, is cute to watch and so fun to play with. Ben Gazzara was a great cast and easy to fall in love with. I'm sure I've met Arthur elsewhere. The whole evening is a great choice !! :-)
