That's the kind of movie I love. Some very good British actors and one and only Sharon Stone. Catherine Tramell (Stone) manipulates a well-trained group of well-educated people by gaining experience in collecting their weaknesses to write a mystery book of murder. She plays the female psychopath quite well, using her abundant sex appeal to convincingly imagine what could be considered one of the ultimate black widows. Tramell is the use of blind spots in society and freely participates in sadomasochistic strings when the city never goes after the blind. From the beginning, there is nothing missing from the R rating alone in this dialogue. Stone could also be described as a kind of female Hannibal Lecter, an emotional femme fatal without a meal plan.
