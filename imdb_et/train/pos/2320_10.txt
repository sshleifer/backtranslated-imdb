Not only is this film a great film for film art (scenario, acting, setting, etc.), but also its realism. This film could take place in any farm or rural area. It doesn't matter if the film takes place in Louisiana or if it happens in Kansas. The story and messages it contains would remain the same. This film shows the family's values ​​and connections to the older audience, while it shows the youthful behavior of younger viewers. Anyone who follows it walks aside, having personally touched them, I know I did. The end strikes the home too close that I will not tear every time I look at it. The final point emphasizes the importance of farm safety, and anyone who has ever worked on the farm must watch the film. Lack of attention and negligence will lead you to dangerous situations. <br /> <br />
