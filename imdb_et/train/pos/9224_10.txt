This film is visually stunning. Who cares if he can act or not. Every scene is a work of art made by John Derek. Locations, designs and costumes work perfectly to convey the love story of beauty, youth and prosperity. In some way, I would like to read this movie with respect to John and Bo Derek. And ... this comment wouldn't be complete without mentioning Anthony Quin's role as a father, mentor, lover, and a man, men who have lost the past, when men were men. Some of us who value strength and direction are entrusted with feelings of trust, isolation and security. Yeah, they don't make men any more like that! But how often do you find women who are made like Bo Derek.
