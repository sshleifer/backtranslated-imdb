Despite some reviews that are clearly Luke-warm, I found this story completely fascinating and even if some critics have described the story of love as "Mills and Boon", what? In these cynical times, it is good to see a warm, touching story of true love. Many in the audience sniffed and lurked in their eyes. You really believe that young Victoria and Albert love each other passionately, although for political reasons it was a marriage. However, I felt that Sir John Conroy, who was desperate to lead a young king, might have played too much like a pantomime villain. Since it is said that he was actually the real father of Victoria (as a result of the relationship with his mother, the Duchy of Kent), it would be interesting to study this theory. Emily Blunt is completely persuasive as a young princess, a crowd of criminals and politicians to manipulate her. He perfectly depicts the strength of character and determination that eventually made Victoria the Queen of England, who, like ever before, succeeded in her long reign. I believe that word of mouth recommendations will ensure the greatest success of this most enjoyable and wonderful film.
