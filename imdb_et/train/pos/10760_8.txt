"9/11", organized by Robert DeNiro, on September 11, 2001, in New York, presents external and internal material for twin towers. <br /> <br /> Never too harsh or passionate, but powerful and mobile. "9/11" is a real affection. Anyone not moving this TV show is immune. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
