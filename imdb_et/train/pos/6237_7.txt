Oh, from my box description, I thought it would be LA-crazy like a 2-day valley or a Hugo pool. Ulrich Seidl must be a very strong man. Most would then have turned the rock out or at least put a massacre. I admit I only look at the first half hour (now). Reading all the comments here, I have a lot to look forward to. Professional reviews often call the Swedish movie "The Songs of the Second Floor" in parallel, but it is in love with humor and fantasy and is unreliable in its dour realism. What is the Marshall Plan and the EU? Seeing it in the theater with someone I know would only lead to much less time than forced DVDs on forced departure. The Universe is more annoying than Jar Jar Binks - Hellhiker Hell. Whatever happens to him is not enough! Soulless suburbia, which I thought only in Arizona and Florida, flourishes in Lower Austria. Oh no! I thought the sex clubs had ceased to be even in New York and San Francisco, and here they are in suburban shopping centers? Was it Mahatma Gandhi or Jawaharlal Nehru who asked about Western civilization: "Why might it be a nice idea?" If the world really likes this movie, bring this black hole, we're ready.
