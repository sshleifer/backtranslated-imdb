I feel that Monarch Cove was one of the best written and functioning "Drama" series that will come to every network for a long time. This show had great potential and I couldn't wait to see it every week. It could be a big Primetime soap. People are waiting for this type of action as we are "Reality TV", which is full. I have this type of writing and acting that shows like Dallas, Knots' Landing, Dynasty, MelRose Place etc. Monarch Cove upgraded this concept quite well and I was expecting it only for the better. There is so much to expand with these characters and they were all very interesting and exciting in themselves. It would be a loss if it was not explored and further developed after drawing and engaging the world. I loved this example absolutely, because it was mysterious, interesting, and sensual without being overrun or corrupted. I loved it.
