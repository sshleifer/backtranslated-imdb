In general, this film was excellent for its time and is interesting for many future generations. Although the plot is not 100% accurate for the book, everything is correct. The movie goes a long way and leaves some important parts away. I found a book and ready and wanted to make a movie right now (because I wasn't yet aware of the movie), but later I found a movie in Wal-Mart's favorable bin and decided to buy it and see if it was what I was expecting . In general, I give this film ten out of ten good parts (relative precision and common sense) and bad parts (big misses and small but noticeable inaccuracies).
