Starring Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was really skeptical when I first watched this movie. I mean the conceptual NIGHTMARE. Jim Carrey playing God? Nothing is sacred anymore. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is hardly sacred, but it is not disappointed, at least to some extent. Yes, Jim Carrey has God's authority for some time, but he is not God. Confused? I'll give you a lower one. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who has his own luck and a feeling of failure. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace (Anniston), and you can say right away that they love each other, but the relationship is relatively weakened. <br /> <br /> Then Bruce gets to the anchorman just to steal Evan Baxter. Of course you don't want, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world on television in a way that is comical and definitely worthy of being fired. <br /> <br /> Lots of complain and grab later, Bruce gets the page. After a while he gets tired of calling, so he answers and goes to the Omni Gift House (heh). There he meets God (Freeman), a building boss, electrician and Janitor. I found this very amusing. God is the boss, the Holy Spirit is the electrician, and Jesus Christ is the caretaker. Think about it. Boss, obvious. Electrician, the man who holds everything. Janitor, the man who cleans up the mess the world has left. BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> In any case, Bruce is a little skeptical about actually meeting God, but if God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a fire to play God, he will start to believe a little. Interesting why. Enter abuse of power for personal gain and abuse of enemies. <br /> <br /> Since it is Hollywood, Bruce will eventually entertain, learn his lesson, and start using his abilities for the world. Finally, he cries out to be taken away by God and prayed for His will, not for Bruce. <br /> <br /> As it is Jim Carrey, the movie is a lot of fun and there are definitely great fun moments. Film is not perfect theology, but for Hollywood it is definitely a good test. Many of the film's statements can be quite meaningful and even challenging, and I congratulate Tom Shadyac on the efforts made on this film. behind the thought. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth or two)
