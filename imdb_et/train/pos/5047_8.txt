The actor Paxton debuted this cool, blind and expertly made thriller about the widow's mechanic (Paxton himself), who entices his two sons to take part in the murder of a wild ax, claiming that the victims are not human beings at all, but "demons" and that God has chosen them " demons. This is spoken by one of the sons, now a grown-up (Matthew McConaughey) skeptical FBI agent (Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> It's hard to forget this movie automatically; Better than most kind of killer features, it is a complicated and soothing story that is light-weight and with minimal cinema tricks. Paxton, commendably, does not show almost any blood until the end. Well done by everyone, especially two childrens (Jeremy Sumpter's recent "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary "Spy Kids 2" and "Domestic Disturbance"). The only reason I dropped all the points is that I understand that some people may hesitate about it. In any case, this is an atypical thriller with a decent script. <br /> <br /> 8/10
