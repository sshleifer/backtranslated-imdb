This is a great little movie about the loneliness of a single man. Phillipe Harel, like Notre Heros, is somewhat similar to the Robert de Niro amalgam in a taxi driver, Inspector Clouseau (in his stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner, being there (including Peter Sellers). He is lonely, but he has no idea how to attract the opposite sex - he does not make any effort at all! <br /> <br /> He has stoicism and fatalism that violates the hope that we can always bind - his friend Jose Garcia as Tisserand is in the same situation, but at least boldly strive to overcome his extended maternity (he is 28 years old) and admits that he has never had sex). <br /> <br /> Very good outdoor conditions in Paris and Rouen, where two software people travel in business. They try different nightclubs and places, but everything is unsuccessful. My theory is that they are trying to make the wrong places - they go to more or less "young" nightclubs; they should try more of their age with older people. <br /> <br /> Harel is becoming more and more isolated, and she does little to de Niro's efforts, like a taxi driver, encouraging her friend / colleague to go. Bloke who pulled a beautiful girl in a nightclub. <br /> <br /> Worth viewing.
