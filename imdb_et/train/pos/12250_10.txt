Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Bravo! Too bad Knightly is not as good as Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong did a fabulous job. Bernard Hepton was perfect as Emma's father. I love the end of the scene (which has been added to the novel but well written) when the harvest is and Knightly dines with its employees and high-class friends. Emma must show that she will accept it now. She's become a woman. It's too fast, but OK. I'll buy it in. Samantha Bond plays Emma's former ruler and trustee. She's wonderful. as I would have imagined him. I believe that if the UK does its best, Jane Austen. American versions of American literature are made for money and not for quality. Check it out!
