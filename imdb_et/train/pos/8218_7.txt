When Harry Callahan rose for years, the inevitable "old man with his wedge story" had to play. Callahan, meanwhile and insecurely, was still unsteady. Fortunately, this film took time to develop a different story that could rediscover Dirty Harry and the whole genre. Though the film couldn't do it, it was still a great addition to the series, even though it was a little away from stupid fashion trends and New Wave music.
