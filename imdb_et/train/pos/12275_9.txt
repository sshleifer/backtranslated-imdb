I've never heard of this book or read it, but a movie that I probably see many times. <br /> <br /> This movie is unforgettable, probably with the richest movies. Just as I look at the land many times, which I think was the idea. <br /> <br /> Amazing movie, story, actors and cinematography. Totally deep emotions from every angle. Although I do not love especially romance films, I loved it and Winona Ryder's claim against her father ended deeply. <br /> <br /> Mr. Irons deserved a prize for his actions and Close was never better. <br /> <br />
