I didn't really expect much from this movie, but it wasn't bad; in fact it was pretty good. This movie contained some more fun text I've ever seen on film. Now I'm not saying it's all the funniest movies of all time, but I laughed in some parts quite hard. "The police drove my father's death to suicide. They said he fell under the lift shaft. For some balls." Now this movie is not for everyone, mostly for stupid humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball; so if you hated these movies, I'd suggest you probably run. All in all, it was an enjoyable film that was related to a group of superheroes, who will eventually become real heroes. This is an overestimated comedy that many people have probably not seen yet, as I expect to see it as a complete garbage before watching. After watching the movie, I finally understand why this movie was capable of collecting a superstar that included Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria and even this baby from Burger. This is because Mystery Man is full of great comedy writing periods from 7 to 10. Very big surprise.
