I loved this movie, at first the sliding graphics seemed nervous, but I found it fast. You have to have thousands of hours of shots and I admire the work done to reduce it. If you are shocked by drugs or violence, it may not be your movie, but here are some great characters (and some real tossers). I liked it very much technically, they have to use a new de-interlacing algorithm, or maybe it was just that the film material was so dark anyway, but I was not disturbed by the usual video artifacts. (Open Water drove me nuts, mainly because now there are cheap, progressive cameras and I don't see any excuse if you don't want to encode the cinema). I'm sorry this is my little bead. I definitely recommend this movie if you have ever participated in a music scene, it has some tragic moments, but most of it is fun, I can blame others for laughing, but this is a classic piece.
