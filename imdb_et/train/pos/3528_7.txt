I appreciated it in the movie 7/10, which is an average of 8/10 of the scenario, direction, and production results of 1944, and 6/10 for action. My exhibition rating was calculated for all screen marks 4/10, except for what was played by hero Ella Raines by Carol Richman, who was great at 8 / 10.I also praise Thomas Gomez as inspector of Burgess, whose character convinces that he personally doesn't I believe that the culprit for Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) was just his na√Øve alibi. These two then form an interface to prove Scott's alibi. <br /> <br /> I have this movie on "Suevia Film Noir Cine Negro" DVD in Spanish as "La Dama Desconocida" along with the original "Ingles" soundtrack, because despite the search I couldn't find English. However, I was interested in seeing Ella Raines' second performance after she was impressed with her heroin "Impactis" who played a unique female garage owner. another heroic role in believing in the innocence of his engineering superior and refusing to make a number of recommendations that he should return to his home in Kansas (his boss's pet name) before resolving the missing alibi. The fact that he is secretly in love with his boss is a little hard to believe because he officially just seemed to have an official business relationship with him. However, he had designed orphanages and playgrounds, so I think "family man" had burnt in Carol's brain. <br /> <br /> In the 1940s, "movie code" works, producers can only portray sex through metaphors, and here's the furious drumming game played by Elisha Cooke jnr.Caroli dolls as a light virtue girl, trying to attract the drummer by giving her information The Phantom Lady Alibi. Another main character, Jack Marlow (companion of Scott Henderson), plays Franchot Tone, whose performance I found too much theater and wondering why Carol, for example, hadn't noticed him constantly and was not admired by his hand. these theatrical moves telegraphs the plot audience too early.
