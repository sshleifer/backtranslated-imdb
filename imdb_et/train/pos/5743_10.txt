I loved this movie! It was all I couldn't break into tears when I saw it, but it's really arrogant. I was hit by Ray Liotta's performance, but especially by Tom Hulce's talent, who represents Ray's twin brother, who is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood event. But the nature of Tom, although a heartbeat, doesn't feel sorry and full of hope and life. This is a great movie, don't miss it !!
