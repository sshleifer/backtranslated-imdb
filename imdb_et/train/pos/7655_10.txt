Having seen this movie for about 20 years, I still find it impressive that it is a hard-working effect and a star. Of course, one of Mr. Mickey Rooney is indeed INCREDIBLE in his role as "Killer". (With another review here - none other than Orson Welles brought Mickey Rooney's name as the biggest film actor.) I also remember jazz brass scores and bare black and white photos. I love Mick's last line before she goes out of her poisoning dose. (I think Stranglers raised it for one line in one of their songs - Get a Grip on Yourself.) It's a great movie and an unfairly buried movie. Let's get it out! Recent magazine Film Review released Don Segal's "Babyface Nelson", made a few years before "Last Mile" and also released by Mickey Rooney. Another Mick intense and sympathetic rave of performance. Perhaps this is the start of a landscape that recognizes some truly higher cinematographic performances.
