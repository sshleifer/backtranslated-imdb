<br /> <br /> Have you ever felt that your tracking, as someone keeps tabs on every move you do? Remember, the FBI always exists before you decide to break the law. At least the feeling you get when you look at the thrilling, but somewhat soft crime drama, the FBI story. It follows the roots of the organization from small offices to one of the most modern facilities in the world (in 1959), telling the story of one of its agents, Chip Hardesty (James Stewart). <br /> Chip was with the FBI from day one and he rejoices his work all over the world, even occasionally with his family. The FBI story follows his life, describing what he does as an agent, and how it affects his personal life. The film does an outstanding job of showing what cases the FBI handles and how they handle them. The audience sees the Chip-stop Ku Klux Klan rebellions, lit up to solve the Indian murder / real estate scandal, bring refugees into custody, rescue hostages and help fight World War II. He even contributed to the justice of communist spies. <br /> <br /> Stewart, in a vaguely complicated embodiment, is a star (as always) a somewhat neurotic agent who loves his job, or a little too much. One of the best parts of this film is that we see both Chip's family life and the inner workings of his work. We know him suffering from the death of his best friend and then his son. We also follow our husband, who has an abortion, and his marriage, which has a rocky time. Almost all of his personal problems are due to the love of his work. Vera Miles gives an accurate result, but it is still very convincing. She was never a brilliant actor, but she was always very attractive and attractive. Maybe it's just me? Unfortunately, it is not worth mentioning any of the other performances, but the attention-catching story was extremely interesting to me. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of this movie was impressive, especially in the South American jungle. The colors had a texture that really set the atmosphere in the film. Perhaps the biggest part of this film was the fabulous direction of Mervyn Leroy. Each scene was so liquid that they just rolled to talk about a brilliant story. It's full of brilliant camera techniques, some of which are very Hitchcockian. <br /> <br /> All in all, the FBI story is a remarkable but neglected movie. After two and a half hours, some viewers may be intimidating, but if you get the chance, I suggest you jump into it. I liked Jimmy Stewart's remarkable performance and enchanting story.
