This movie is fun! I watched it with my friend and we had to see it again. This movie is not meant for your filmmakers who are watching only those acts that have been issued for Academy awards (you know who you are.) I don't want to stick to it because you have seen it from all the other reviews. <br /> <br /> "Foamed" is a light-hearted comedy that laughs at me. It doesn't take you too seriously and should be monitored by your friends, not your girlfriend. It does not win any awards, but it has to be seen just to evaluate it. True, some jokes are toilet humor, but it may not be bad. It can sometimes be used by anyone. Some people need to lighten and see "Foam" for what it is, not what it is not. <br /> <br /> **** 1/4 out of *****.
