I lost my father at a very young age. So really young that I haven't remembered him. I've learned a lot from him over the years. One of these things was that he loved the West, and watching Bonanza every Sunday night was an absolute ritual for him. I myself remember the end of the series, having been 8 years old when the show finished production in 1973. Looking at this example over the years, it's closer to my long lost father. It has all the right elements that show successfully, laughter, tears, the edge of your seat, and it even angered you sometimes. memory from the very beginning of the exhibition, soon after our beloved "Hoss" Cartwright, Dan Blocker's death. One specific episode and the closing credit ended with a blocker image and disappeared and I also remembered my oldest sister with a tear in sight of this horizon. I remember it as it was yesterday. In the name of our later father who is not here to say this, we love Bonanza.Long live Cartwrights.
