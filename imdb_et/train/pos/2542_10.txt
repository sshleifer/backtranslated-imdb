With a special telescope, dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) successfully managed that a meteorite that contained an unknown but very powerful element had landed years ago in Africa. Benet (Bela Lugosi) forms an expedition led by Rukhi. Unexpectedly, Rukh finds Radium X, even more powerful than radium and very radioactive, and Karloff is contaminated and can kill anyone just by touching them. The sparks indeed fly between Lugos and Karloff in this classic fictional film after World War II. Director Hillyer used some of the "FLASH GORDON" series that were filmed at the same time, and also introduced some electrical machines from Frankenstein. Universal kept the public unaware of the special effects that were used in this great classic film. Karloff and Lugosi were their best, and both enjoyed cooperation and received them for future generations.
