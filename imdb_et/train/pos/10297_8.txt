Well, not really. This movie is very fun. I went and saw it last night with my girlfriend and I had to use the routine "I think there may be something in my eyes". The film is a great combination of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carey is a great reporter for his happiness who is empowered by himself and the city where he lives. Actually, all the characters are big. The film is not too funny or cute, a good woman to see her. <br /> <br /> All in total 8/10 .... Note * I am not an easy grader. These are all over and over from BigV!
