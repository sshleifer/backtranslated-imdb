Daisies pushing is the landmark of television as an art form. Everyone seems to be respectful of Amelie and Tim Burton, but in a world where fresh ideas are clearly rare, this exhibition ensures that you don't care whether it is fresh or not. It's just brilliant. <br /> <br /> I have been fascinated from the start, intelligent writing, backgrounds and dialogue make this the most amazing masterpiece from Shield and the wire (ok is not quite good), but pushing Daisies beauty is that he doesn't have no comparisons on television. <br /> <br /> Really addictive and absolute joy. Perhaps, like one of Piemakers pies, mentioned in such torturing ways.
