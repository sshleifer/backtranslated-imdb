AG was an excellent performance for American television from such a rare drama, arrest and thriller. Sheriff Lucas gave willies to many viewers. We rooted in Caleb when he tried to resist Sheriff Lucas's surprises. As we learned the unimaginable relationship between the two characters, we stepped in and feared. Manipulations that showed the weekly fear that Lucas followed were truly surprising. This exhibition lived up to the "gothic" moniker, so American entertainment has so rarely tried, less learned. The costumes definitely made a big mistake in supporting this show. It shows the stigma of the current slip of "reality" exhibitions, which is less than satisfactory viewing. This shows high-quality viewing that provides a hungry market for quality viewing. The public, which is tiring of overwhelming the prices of an astringent reality, welcomes this jewel of true storytelling. Bring a DVD box kit!
