The beginning of the 90s was, in my opinion, the ultimate point for historical drama. The last Mohicans, Braveheart, Rob Roy - all represented a particular passion and intensity in their time periods. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy was a unique and intriguing taste of the time and place the film was rarely represented. It's really all - an interesting story, a great example, a remarkable dialogue and a breathtaking landscape. Particularly impressed was the impressive genuine dialogue. I can imagine people talking and behaving at the beginning of the 18th century. <br /> <br /> Something else that surprised me was the vulgarity of the symbols. I found it to be more repulsive and shocking, though often more subtle than today's movies. The film had a very special and sexually charged edge that was unique and probably very realistic in the context of the era. <br /> <br /> This tempo was a very tight, barely dull moment. There were a lot of intrigue and political principles that made things a little harder, but still didn't reduce the main story. <br /> <br /> The action was also very well done and thrilling. The thing I discover forever is that there is no soundtrack when the movie is highlighted. This makes for a very tense, exciting sequence because we don't have musical chips about the direction and resolution of the scene. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy always stands high in his favorite movie list. I would recommend it to everyone.
