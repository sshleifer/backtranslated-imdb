Giallo fans are looking for this rare movie. It is well written and full of all the usual low lifespan of these films. I don't want to give away anything, so I'm not even saying something about the plot. The whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere and you don't know what to expect or suspect. Recommended! The only place I've seen to get the movie in English is European Trash Cinema, $ 15.
