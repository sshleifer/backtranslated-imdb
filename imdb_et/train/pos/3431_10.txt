Just the best Estonian film I've ever seen, even though it's done by Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallin in the Darkness is an entertaining thriller of gangsters trying to steal a large amount of gold belonging to the Republic of Estonia. At the same time, it is a summary of the situation in many Eastern European countries. In the early 1990s, the Soviet Union fell into pieces and many countries, like Estonia, became independent. Now, in most of these countries, there may be better conditions. But in the early 1990s, many of these new countries had to fight corruption and organized crime, which the Soviet era left them as a legacy. (And many of them are still ... at least on some level ...) <br /> <br /> Tallinn's timing is a very realistic film of this era, with incredible characters and a well-written script. The actors are also very good, especially Jüri Järvet (perhaps Estonia's best-known actor, playing Tarknajski's Solaris Snaut), playing and the old gangster who is slowly tired of his way of life. But the most amazing result is Monika Mäger, who plays Terje, a boyfriend in his early teens whose presence on the plot is quite important. (and its name is not even mentioned in the list of IMDb credits !!!) w <br /> <br /> There are not many films in the world that can be entertainment and artistic at the same time. But Tallinn is doing it in the dark. Unfortunately, other Järvi-Laturi films are far from such achievements. His first, Head home, was too artificial and his last, history made at night, was just a weird mess.
