For the first time I saw this movie at the theater's foreign film festival, I thought it was an intriguing, exciting, sensitive bi-sexual artist. So very European, so very Dutch! I recently rented it for a second look and hardly missed the crazy writer's religious sexual orientation persecution complex on a superfluous topic. Pull yourself together! This guy is a freelancer who lives in society. I suspect that the real reason why he uses these fantasy-horror figures for "spiderstar" is that his guilty factor turns off in a year, ignoring the mother's advice on getting cars (and beds) strangers! Not only does he make awkward amounts of money (probably tax-free) for looting stories (which are guilty of traveling), but he's too cheap to pay for haircuts, so he got to the beauty salon owner. Then he's nervous to complain about the bill! But I also suspect that the world has made a lot of changes after this film. In case of a serious remark, it was fun to see some Jan de Bonti camera works and one of Paul Verhoeven's earlier films. Hmmm, maybe the world hasn't changed so much?
