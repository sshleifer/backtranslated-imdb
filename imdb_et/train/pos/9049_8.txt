There is an old saying related to Joe Johnston's new film, which goes like "A man who thinks he can, and a man who thinks he can't be both right." This is a very cautious statement that refers to a person who is motivating and credible in itself, which is true in this film after roadblocks and family problems. <br /> <br /> "October Heaven" is about a young man who believes in the name Homer Hickam, who grows up in the 1950s in a traditional, strict family. Homer loves a small coal mine, where almost every person grows into a miner. All his friends, Quentin, Roy and O'Dell, think their life after high school is like everyone else. Homer does not leave this future. <br /> <br /> The Russian spacecraft Sputnik moves in the capital one night while everyone is looking at the sky. This is something new to Homer and he thinks it is remarkable and overwhelming. From that moment on, his vision of life is never the same. <br /> <br /> First, he tells everyone that he wants to work on rocket scientists for occupation. Flabbergs, what he says, goes to his family over this idea and continues his life as usual. His friends, however, think that this idea may have some potential. After all, Quentin is a very intelligent person when it comes to things like that. <br /> <br /> When four friends start testing the model's rockets and blow the white longhair loops, what seems to be scaring the forest fire is that they have to stop their progress. <br /> <br /> The performances of this movie are completely riveting from start to finish. All actors will perform as if it were a real mumbo jumbo. Get out of honor: Laura Dern as Miss Riley. This may be the Academy's award material if judges remember the beginning of this year when this film appears. <br /> <br /> Characters are also very well developed. Not only do filmmakers give a clear and obvious reason why Homers are interested, but they also explain to the audience how they manage their rocketry. We clearly understand all the motives and beliefs of the characters, especially the father who is bent on the eternal tradition. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film loses its momentum in the middle, because it is a silly, recycled romantic sub-block that involves the interest of Homer's love and how his brother stole him from him. This type is becoming so common in high school films, not that this film is aimed at universities. Actors stare at each other meaninglessly as they are in the trance. I put it without a complaint in 1997, "Abbot 'the Abbots," but I have almost enough. <br /> <br /> But this is just a small complaint. The authentic Oscar and real-life customers of the cinema, all of which became dreams great, especially from Homer, are the first big film of 1999. <br /> <br />
