In the hands of a qualified leader, this film would have been considered a masterpiece of horror. Despite Michael's "Death Wish" winner, there is an easy way to go, the movie is interesting, original and more than frightening. <br /> <br /> The script will win back more than one horror clip (several can not shake)) including Chris Sarandon as the heroine boy who actually listens to him when he insists that terrible things fall. Burgess Meredith is a cheerful mad neighbor. Eva Gardner is a haunted young Beverly D'Angelo as her silent and disturbed lesbian lover. John Carradine is sitting on a chair. And look out for a short hearing from unknown time from Chris Walken! This film is creepy and creative. The plot turns beautiful when they are predictable. The climax, which I do not give details, is disturbing and quite impressive. Again, a better director could have done more with it, but it is quite satisfactory - at least for those who have the sensitivity of the Seventies. <br /> <br /> If you like the modern super-finished body counting torture-fantasy, you won''t like it. Gore is almost non-existent. The direction is quite spartan. There is little effect, although there is a nice make-up near the end, most of which are not really makeup ... but maybe I have said too much. <br /> <br /> I have rated it little higher than its quality can be justified, but I enjoyed it as much as every "8" movie I've seen.
