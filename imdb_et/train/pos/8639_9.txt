I have to start by apologizing because I thought the first 75-80% of this movie was fun. This is mainly the result of Brad Pitt's action. Spot is on. <br /> <br /> The action of all the players was pretty good, but Brad stole the movie. The atmosphere was perfect in every sense. I'm not a giant Pitt fan, but it must be one of his best roles. <br /> <br /> Brutal, Honest, Gritty. All good films to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> I read the previous review and the person said that the reasons for the early violence are not explained. This is explained, but they do not need to go to the graphic detail to get their point. I think humor in the first half is perfect for this movie. Reduced.
