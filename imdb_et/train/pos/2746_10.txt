Imagine luminaires in your distant household on a cold night and then fall asleep. Do not lock doors. The only sound is the wind that fertilizes through the trees. Sometimes after midnight the cars are out of the lights. Moments later the intruder flashes into your dark living space. <br /> <br /> What makes this picture so scary is that it is far from the farm ... at night. Based on Truman's most popular books and the black and white light that is comparable to the best 1940 Noir films, "In Cold Blood" presents a terrifying story, especially in this first law, as the plot takes place largely on the road at night and in the rain-colored country. It's a nightmare. But this is not a dream. The events really took place in 1959. <br /> <br /> Two fraudsters with upcoming scams will kill the entire Kansas family by finding money that doesn't exist. Director Richard Brooks used real events, even the farm, real locations ... and its interior! This makes it a memorable and haunting film. <br /> <br /> Both leading parties are closely related to two real killers. Robert Blake is more than convincing because Perry Smith is a short and tight leg on his feet, dreaming of finding Cortez's buried treasure. Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock, a fluent speaker with an all-American smile. <br /> <br /> After their killing, the duet goes to Mexico. Things are going to be terrifying there, so they come back to the US, steal cars, drive and are generally unhappy when they move around. But it's a stupid life, and two laws that will soon regret their actions. The last twenty minutes of the movie is amazing when the rain falls, the rope tightens, and everything we hear is the heart of beating. <br /> <br /> Even with this somewhat wide-ranging middle, the "In Cold Blood" riveting stages describe the real story that is still hypnotizing, almost half a century later. This is the provision that does it. Do you think the people in the rural areas of Kansas leave their doors open ... at night?
