It's a movie I decided to go and see because I'm a fan of big adult animation. Often I find that if a film does not represent a famous actor or actor, but rather a story or style, it allows the film to be seen as a work of art rather than as an actor's ability to vary his style. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely more of a style than a story. Although I found the story interesting (a thriller that borrowed the story and atmosphere of films such as Blade Runner and many anime movies), it was sometimes difficult to follow and did not feel it would all come together. could have. It was definitely a confusing sense of French animation and Japanese anime. Whether it is good or not, it is up to the viewer to decide. This film is visually eye-catching and a work of art in that sense. <br /> <br /> If you like adult animation or want to see a movie that differs from most of the films currently released. I would recommend it. All I can say is that I enjoyed the movie experience, but I got a little disappointed because it could have been better
