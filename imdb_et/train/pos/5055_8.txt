I didn't expect much when I first saw the DVD cover. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as gray Owl ?? <br /> <br /> Ah ... but then this story started, discovered in a beautifully captured and stretched film. I was surprised and glad about this (basically) true story. I advised me to read more about this interesting character, which means that the director fulfilled his goal and the film was a success!
