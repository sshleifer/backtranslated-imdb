This picture in 1935 went along with the music of all the best Ocaride directors, John Ford, actor Victor McLaglen and Max Seiner. Victor McLaglen (Gypo Nolan), "Call the the Marines", "42" gave outstanding results among Irish rebels who were a tough and harsh crowd who all fought for the cause and at the same time poorer and poorer. with plenty of drink. Gypo Nolan made a bad mistake when he decided to become his best friend informant to travel to America with his gala and a new way of life. Preston Foster (Don Gallagher), "The Guadalcanal Diary" 43 played a major supporting role as a leader of the Irish rebellion and wanted to defeat his group informer. Gypo Nolan is worshiped by his friend's betrayal and begins to feel just like Judah. Great movie for 1935 and great performance by McLaglen, but it is more frustrating in every aspect of the film.
