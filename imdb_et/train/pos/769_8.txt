From all the breakdancing / hip-hop films that appeared between 1983 and 1986, the 1984 film Beat Street is by far the best. The story follows DJ, his younger brother, graffiti artist and wanna-be showbiz promoter through one winter, where they try to break out of the ghetto using their street talents. Action is not always par. And the characters are not completely pulled out, but they are more than compensated by underground dialogue, plausible story, fantastic dance series and timeless hip-hop soundtrack. It should be noted that this movie was shot at the birthplace of breakdancing ("It's not New York, it's Bronx!"), And there are breakdancing, dance performances by Rock Steady Crew and rapper Afrika Bambaata. Rock Steady Crew gives the best scene in the film when they dominate the breakdancing club of the early 1980s, in the battle of Roxy dance. Must see hip-hop lovers.
