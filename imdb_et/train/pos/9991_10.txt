I thought this film was hysterical. I've been watching this many times and I highly recommend it. Mel Brooks was great. The cast was awesome .. I don't understand how this movie gets from 2 out of 5. I loved it .. I've seen other movies and they were funny too, but I really think it's stuck with humor. He just can't say enough about this movie. I'm looking for it to happen periodically, but it's never enough for me. People who play homeless were the most fun standards. Please put this movie more often. I don't see it enough .. Widow Ann Warren was also my favorite from Cinderella. I always thought he wasn't really funny but loved to act. In this film he was very funny ... and he and Mel did a great job together. They should put their films more on TV.
