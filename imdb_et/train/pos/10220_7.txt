This fun line is typical of what these naughty sisters say. (It's funny also under your own circumstances and unintentionally funny.) Only two sisters are really bad. Boy, are they bad too? One is given pinupide and salacious comments where e'er he goes. The other is up to look like Marilyn Monroe. He has these sensual, slightly separated lips. And nothing to give away is worse than the other. <br /> <br /> All three sisters play with characters. The man who steals his life is played by John Bromfield. He had a career. <br /> <br /> Today it looks like the first mainstream soft-core porn that is ever marketed. Well, of course not the first, but at that time the most racial. <br /> <br /> Girls carry as little as possible and do not forget the female audience members: Bromfield is a shaved electric razor whose fetish was it? - Uncovered. It is also shown as a wet swimsuit. <br /> <br /> There is also a real plot here: The girls' family, look, are cursed. They are prone to suicide or dramatic deaths that can be committed to suicide. <br /> <br /> Film is not bad. I really don't know where it was shown. Maybe it was made for a car ride. Somehow, and I could be wrong, I felt that a typical male audience was not the main goal here. Women are little dressed. Often they are similar to police detective or fine book jackets. Not everyone in the film likes her, but all the girls love her. And I think the audience is also meant. <br /> <br /> It's very fun - and also on your own terms.
