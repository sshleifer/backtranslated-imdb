This movie is hard to watch without having to show on television, especially if I like it, like me, like a TV show more. But there is a lot to say about this source. <br /> <br /> Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) is a top New York athlete who lives in an eight-room apartment himself, a divorce and his own stubbornly sloppy way of thinking. Enter his friend Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon), who needs to live after his wife threw him stubbornly at the Nuns. The result is a train wreck and one of the most pleasant movie adaptations of Neil Simon's performance. <br /> <br /> The first thing is first: I love this apartment! Poker table, new darts, pictures of baseball players, empty and beer containers, even a couple of Roman columns. This is where men can be boys. Simon and director Gene Saks are doing a great job of opening a one-off set of stage games, an Oscar living room, moving the action bedroom and kitchen, and giving the Oscar and Felix a more intense effort. <br /> <br /> Neal Heft's familiar score was listened to in the TV show, but never as widely as here, in a variety of ways, making it easy on the screen when it is played. Manhattan's actual location and night-time pictures give the film the usual energy ("Buddwing", "Henry Orient World", "Midnight Cowboy", "Manchurian Candidate", "Rosemary's Baby", etc.) for movies at this time and time. <br /> <br /> Is Lemmon and Matthau too heavy compared to Tony Randall and Jack Klugman? To be fair, the film must be a more serious matter that deals with the average time of life separation and the unusual condition and the disappointment inherent in not engaging in relationship work. Simon has more of an adventure than entering Felix and Oscar in the "Password" game, or struggling with Howard Cosell. But I don't know ... <br /> <br /> Both Lemmon and Matthau were fantastic comedians I enjoyed especially in the middle of this movie, as I often do in my separate movies, but I've never understood why they were considered great comedy team. Here they seem to work in partnership with the best views in two different films; Lemmon comedy drama and Matthau farce. Matthau is great at first, fooling us with his playful behavior around the poker table, but at the end of the movie he takes a turn like Jack Torrance's "The Shining", responding to Felix by cleaning his apartment and serving delicious food to his friends in a way that completely disturbs the delicate balance of guilt. <br /> <br /> Although it ends up being annoying to me, the part that many see as the toughest, the beginning, well. Looking at Felix's stumbling in an attempt to kill himself is not a great comedy, no, but it's a good way to make a great comedy that puts us up with some real pain before bringing warmth and laughter. (There are some great shots of the city's drills.) In the middle of the movie, this scene would have been a miscalculation, but it works as a way of knowing Felix's torture and sharp relief. we see the Oscar and his poker staff harshly and weakly. <br /> <br /> Then Simon's lines are so big. These are the basic forces of the film. He gets the beater right and real and still makes it funny. "I don't mind talking to you, Felix. You have something to say. What scares me, I've started listening." The TV show showed how wrong it is to assume that the film is always better, in fact, the TV show has once made a good "assumption" of something, but the film provides a solid foundation and joy in itself.
