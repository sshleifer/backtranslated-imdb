Well, like many other such films, out of the SNL skit. But Tim Meadows does a fairly fantastic job of making a 3-minute one-dimensional character a moderately viable comic film. He falls into a consistently threatened one-liner with a fair frequency, Billy Dee Williams is in this, though his Lando days have long gone and the whole thing is pretty good. True, it's not a great art, but when you went to the Wayne world to look for Gone With The Wind, you did something wrong. Enjoying what it is .......
