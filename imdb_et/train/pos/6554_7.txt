OK heres what I say: <br /> <br /> The film was great. I'm a big Nancy fan and I've read all the 1-56 original books and I read more. I'm now 96. Beware of the villains that give this film a lower grade than it should. All the hints point to a wonderful movie! I loved the whole thing. So Nancy is now. She's still old-fashioned as she is in the books! People who haven't read more than 5 books complain about Nancy's view. I've read all of them and I think Emma is perfect and Nancy was perfect. I found some of the movie horrible. I loved exciting car rides and get away. I loved the clues. I solved the mystery myself! It was really wonderful. I suggest you see it because people who have complained do not know anything about A, what a good movie is and B Nancy Drew. Look at this. It may not be worth the Oscar, but it is really a good movie.
