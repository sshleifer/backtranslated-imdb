In the era of world depression in Prague, this is a story of an ambitious shopkeeper who falls in love with a mystery woman with whom she has exchanged romantic messages to discover that a mystery woman is not the salesman of her shop, who seems to be constantly harassing her colleague. Add a little twist (the owner is convinced that her favorite worker - Stewart is in communication with the owner's spouse), leaving Stewart briefly "fired" with a testimony that the saleswoman "liked" Stewart all the time, a happy ending is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Although OR dated (references to poverty and -I have a woman and two children to consider are overused, with the notion that many small joyful objects like musical) cigars have failed to enjoy ordinary people), this film is more effective (and more reliable) than in the 1990s, "You've got us" restored. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan starring in the actual chain of events are so incredible that the viewer's intelligence is heavily offended. <br /> <br /> "Around the corner" is an innocent walk along the memory stick for a less complicated, less passionate and romantic time and place known as the writer's utopia. Lovers of classic romantic comedies enjoy this picture!
