It is estimated that 68 million people will die prematurely from AIDS in the period 2000-2020. The most predictable topic is in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 55 million additional deaths are expected. Beside the grim statistics, there are personal stories we rarely hear. Christophe Honor√© describes one of the most moving films from Leo, produced for French television as part of a series of youth-related issues. Although it is fictional, it is a situation that, unfortunately, is too common for a close family that loves the diagnosis of HIV. <br /> <br /> When twenty-year-old Leo (Pierre Mignard) talks to his parents and two teenage brothers Tristan (Rodolphe Pauley) and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann) with AIDS, the family is devastated. For young people's concerns, they decide to keep their youngest brother, 12-year-old Marcel (Yannis Lespert), but he listens to the conversation and starts mixing and behaving insecurely. When he goes to Paris to treat Leo, he goes with Marcel, but the young boy is standing with Leo and needs to know the truth. Leo tells him he is sick and Marcel is sad but agrees. When he brings Marcel with his former gay friends, the tension between them is to the surface, setting the stage for riveting. Although I was uncomfortable with bed-in-bed scenes, I feel that Leo's proximity and the excellent performances of Lespert and Mignard are more than scales in favor of it. From a young boy's perspective, seeing events gives the film the authenticity that reminded me of the Quebecois' Leolo and Truffaut 'The 400 Blows'. Unlike some American films dancing for the anxiety of AIDS, Leo's close tells the truth, but does it gently and miraculously.
