This was the second of three films Irving Berlin wrote for the Astaire-Rogers franchise, which has by far the highest score and is somewhat unusual in that two numbers are made by Harriet Hilliard, leaving the rest divided and / or divided between directors. As usual, the wire doesn't have to hold us, but it was based on the game, Shore Leave, which was also the basis of Broadway Musical, The The Deck. Anyone who actually saw Shore Leave in the theater can be confused for a moment as Fred and Ginger's roles were created for the film, but what is important, as always, is music, lyrics and shouting, and that's all right on the bottle. This is the departure from other franchise titles in that 1) we see that Astaire is playing the piano - in real life he was a pianist and made up of several songs, one of which I was Down, was Johnny Mercer's lyrical and spent a few weeks with charts - and this is the only series in which he played the military, although a former hoofer who was a dancer's partner after the dance partner's dumping. Ginger before the story begins. He can fill a little-known but excellent Berlin number, I run a band rather than a duet when I put all my eggs in one basket, but the final number is prophetic - in 1936, World War II was already being felt - let's face music and dance, one stronger ballads that the team has ever done. What if Randolph Scott is a bit of wood and fish outflow without a horse or six guns that are easily accessible and Harriet Hilliard can't fire on the screen; we came to see Fred and Ginger, and the only question is, do they deliver. Answer: Pot.
