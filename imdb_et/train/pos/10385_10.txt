It has been a while since I watched this movie and series, but now I am refreshing my memory! It was a very funny movie based on the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were fun together. Bo and Luke Duke assist Uncle Jesse to lead Moonshine at General Lee. When the Boss Hogg forces the Duke out of his farm, Bo and Luke Hoggi cast a spot on the local construction site and find coal samples. They will soon realize that Boss Hogg is slipping into Hazzard County unless the Duchess can stop him with his beautiful cousin Daisy. My only problem with the film was that Burt Reynolds wasn't right for Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was too serious. Other than that, I recommend very dangerous hazards!
