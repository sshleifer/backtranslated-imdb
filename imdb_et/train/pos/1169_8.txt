Stylish, desperate, innovative revenge bleeding. Of course, it is also cheesy and randomly very exciting. It reminded me of a lot of heat, because it has a plot of vengeance within the reach of the same event and the girl goes to a good boy because a bad boy is just as bad behavior. It is sad that there is no Gloria Grahame, but so fantastic that it is Alain Delon and not Glenn Ford. Could anyone be as beautiful as Alain, who goes to cashmere sweater and trenchcoat? But he's totally tough and icy. No one can touch her right now - though someone like Jude Law could try I think. It's hard if someone looks good on her. The music was funky and perfect, and there were many great car rides (and these aren't usually my cups of tea) - especially one in the woods. People also met their creative and bloody fashion, such as junkyard cruncher. However, outside the cheese, the general atmosphere and expertly influenced it. More creativity, excitement and freshness in this "forgotten" movie than most of what I've seen lately.
