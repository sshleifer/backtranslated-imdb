Measure. Comedy. Excitement. This movie has it all. <br /> <br /> Plot 4 says that professional thieves are invited to take part in an attack in a small town in Montana. Any kind of crime movie archetype is here. Frank, Master. Carlos, weapon expert. Max, explosive expert. Nick, secure cracker and Ray, car man. Unfortunately, Frank has been detained for 2 worshiping detectives (very well represented by Ed O'Niel and Daniel Roebuck) who have written him from New Jersey after sending letters to another. /> Our 4 characters meet at the train station and from the start none of them likes or trusts each other. The blend is accompanied by the fact that Frank has disappeared and they are not sure why they have called. <br /> <br /> Frank now takes two New Detectives back, but soon flees away and tries to get back to his boys with all sorts of problems. <br /> <br /> A really big movie full of smile and great action. Just a common good movie for anyone looking for a laugh or something a little bit different
