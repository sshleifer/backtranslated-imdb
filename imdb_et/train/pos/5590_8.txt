(The plot doesn't have to be taken back because others have already done it.) <br /> <br /> It is understandable that many viewers find mistakes in the movie that have been raised with the slam-bang sensurround of today's cineplex experience. Against this background, it seems like a movie like Ecstasy has been lost on another planet. I think there are several values ​​for this. <br /> <br /> The most important thing is that the film opens poetically, as the camera is slowly placed around the surrounding mountains, trees, clouds, etc., providing a peaceful and lyrical natural feeling of a world that integrates a man and a woman with his flap. Together, these cinema-based cinemas are now almost completely lost in style and dimensions, where fast fire editing helps to direct the audience's attention and not focus on it. In addition, the story is transmitted through the eyes, not through the ear, with almost no dialogue to explain what is happening. This is another extreme departure from today's very grammatical price, where visions appear to be counting the viewer only by exciting. But perhaps the most striking - the film is sometimes uncomfortable silent, not in the sense that silent movies are quiet because we are waiting for them. But in the sense that characters are rarely spoken when we wait for them. Thus, the burden of the story is divided between the filmmaker and the viewer. The first must choose its visual design to convey the narrative, while the latter must think about these visuals because they are not explained. <br /> <br /> None of them are designed to humiliate today's movie. -Production. It's just a reminder that a movie like Machaty comes out of the very different aesthetics we have today. I'm not saying it would be better or worse. However, I argue that Ecstasy is a perspective that is very lacking in today's film experience, where such "thoughtful values ​​are routinely left slow and boring. <br /> <br /> The film itself is not a masterpiece, although sometimes it reaches an artistic height, such as a beautifully designed beer garden scene whose final crane has risen to reveal the subtle table below. Slow pans of rural areas with pantheistic life, nature, and regeneration are also well-presented. These are scenes that do not kill you, but instead of giving the party a chance - to accumulate quietly in an experience that is memorable in its own way, such as the vertebrate choice of jaws. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is sometimes difficult, like Machaty piles in images, especially in the final, ode-to-work order. It is difficult to find out this rather disturbing presence. Perhaps the symbolism is related to the heroic dimension that hard work keeps the love-sex hero and the people in general - a topic promoted by influential Soviet cinema. Nevertheless, its presence here is quite annoying. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I have to admit that I initially tuned to see the proud Hedy LaMarri. But now I have to admit that in the process I got much more than just a peek-a-boo romp in the forest.
