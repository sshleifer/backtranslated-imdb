Moon Child was one of the most symbolic films I've ever seen. What I really liked was an example of immorality / mortality and obstacles to life. There are many vampires in the film, Kei, who have immorality and its advantages. What people usually want is whether they have supernatural abilities or eternal life. The child of the moon shows the pain and imperfections of immortality, because the effects of loss affect almost every character, especially the main characters Sho and Kei. The meaning of the title "Child of the Moon" appears when the film is close to the end, where it clearly shows that everyone is a month that stands out and gives guidance. Personality is the morality that is depicted in the film. The weaknesses of the film are functional and have a special effect in some parts, as it made the film less authentic. The scene in which the character Toshi dies could have been more powerful and realistic by placing more authentic emotions in the example. Some scenes with special effects, such as weapon shots, could have been more authentic without being too much like a video game. Sparks that came out of the pistols appeared too fake and I think it could have been eliminated or fixed. However, I think Moon Child should be a movie that everyone should look at. The symbolic ideas and images that the film brings out would be acceptable to all and may be of interest to many viewers. It's a pretty thoughtful film and also entertaining.
