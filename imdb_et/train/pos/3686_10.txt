Diane and I saw this fabulous movie today in Fremantle and we both agreed that she had her head and shoulders over the pastiche films. I say that because we were fascinated by the short, five to ten-minute segment that made up the film, and the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and of course this topic was a love in many forms. The film probably appeared in different cities in Paris, thus giving a special taste for each segment. Having been only in Paris several times, I did not have enough knowledge to easily recognize places, but I am sure that Europeans, and especially French, can easily recognize the location of the city. In any case, the viewer is pulled into each story immediately because of his production excellence, so that these city locations disappear into the consequences. <br /> <br /> The movie moves quickly and the viewer leaves one scenario while the new one is on the screen. These stories are not graphically similar to some of the Hollywood nonsense, they are fine and thought provoking and delicate as most of the life without a media shift that bursts so much of the beauty of life in the pile of the nearest manure, but sell, sell. sell ... <br /> <br /> Go somebody you care about and let this magical little film swim like a spa treatment and if you miss me, you will feel new.
