Here is the term "classic film". This is a wonderful story of a woman's bravery, courage and extreme loyalty. Bad Olan was sold to her married husband, who over the years learned to appreciate her. (Yes, A PEARL !!) <br /> <br /> Luise Rainer was a beautiful star who had won the Best Actor Oscar's "The Great Zigfield" a year ago and it didn't really show What a talent he did not have, besides exotic beauty, but "Good Earth" shows that he can really act! His beauty was erased and he didn't have any great costumes. People say he didn't show any real emotions in this film. Like hell. His character Olan is a shy and timid woman with inner strength. She is quiet during the film's part with her eyes and body to convey her emotions. Example: those scenes in the city in the fall and in the shooting of the looters. , he has NOT been looking for. <br /> <br /> Paul Muni shows that he can also act, his character is not pleasing to me, he never sees him when he is until the end of the story. and the mother with her special beauty n beauty from the inside, like a pearl. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this movie, check it out. You'll see one of the best movies that Hollywood's golden age has created.
