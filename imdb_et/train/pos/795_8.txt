Too bad a couple of comments before me do not know the circumstances of this case. It is based on real events, a highly publicized disappearance and murder case in Wilmington, DE / Philadelphia PA from 96 to 2000. I have to admit that I was very skeptical about how Hollywood dramatizes the real history and events and was actually quite impressed by how close they stayed, as constantly reported by local news and Philadelphia Inquirer news all the time. Of course, I immediately noted that the actor (who I really like Cold Case) who played Fahey didn't see anything for him (Anne Marie was actually more beautiful). I must admit that Mark Harmon did indeed laugh at the type of personality that appeared in Capano and Capano during his conduct. The details of the case were right ... no deviations from the dramatic effect ... even down the carpet, gun, furniture and cooler. Finally, I would like to add that I have met Tom Carper several times in various tasks (a good person, regardless of the politician) and I am so glad that he pulled the necessary strings in the federal field to solve this terrible crime. The boys like Capano are real and it was nice to see him finally behind the bars.
