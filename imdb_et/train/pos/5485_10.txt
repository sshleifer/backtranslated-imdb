One of the most timely and appealing documentaries you will ever watch. Although the story takes place in the Caracas capital of Venezuela, it gives an intimate insight into the political dynamics that dominate the western hemisphere. Although this film is the second chapter of the story of the United States-backed Latin American coup, this film crowns in real time, which can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity, political savvy and courage! <br /> <br /> The political knowledge offered by this film is invaluable. One is a clear example of private media, which is a huge force for mass fraud and propaganda. We see that Caracas poor people are exposed to American politics. People have a clear understanding of the impending doom if people are unable to deal with conspiracy tyranny, which has forced them unlawfully against the conspiracy. We also see the arrogance and fascism of the private media, plutocrats and generals guaranteed by the CIA, who have agreed to bring Venezuela under Washington's domination. Although the people of Caracas carefully lead President Hugo Chavez, they are forced to act without him after Chavez was kidnapped by generals of arms. Their answer is the high point of the film. If you want a great portrait of what the US government, Hugo Chavez and the revolutionary Venezuela are, is this movie!
