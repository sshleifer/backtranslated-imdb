It was the eighth and final of Columbia Whistler's film and the only one who didn't have Richard Dix, who had retired from the movie and was dying next year. This is still a competent thriller, the machine continued without him perfectly, but ?? something was missing: Dix! The stories in the Whistler series were always interesting, sometimes brilliant, the scenarios were often always atmospheric, but it was not only Whistler himself who hung it all on the screen, and Dix. <br /> <br /> A young couple who will step out for a whole week want to marry in a rainfall, but is hampered when a potential bride first disappears and is discovered already married before she is probably crazy. Will a potential groom be put down even when he is hired to find him unexpectedly, strikes him and flat or is love blind? Who spins, who is the question. Michael Duane on his penultimate movie is OK, a little wimp, lovely Lenore Aubert's best moments came to the next film, Abbott & Costello. Meet Frankenstein and Richard Lane were wonderful as ever from Boston Blackie. Also the only outing where Whistler himself has to precipitate the rain, unless he has sprayed the foam. <br /> <br /> This last hour has seen a lot of things to look at and review. again as usual as I like genre fans. The Whistler radio series, which began in 1942, featured nearly 700 half an hour until 1955, almost all of which are available on mp3 and are based on what I have heard so far so far.
