This film has always been my favorite because I first saw it as a 12-year-old child in 1962 when it was shown at the "late show" of the Los Angeles television station. The characters are very involved from the beginning of the picture and it is too bad that the film has never been published on a videotape or ever shown on television (probably thanks to Dr. Muusikar's actress's actress ban) / producer / director who wrote this song and presented it for the first time during World War II New In York - the reason for denying it is hard to do in over 50 years). I didn't see the movie for more than 30 years, when someone who was the main cast member of the movie was able to get a "bootlegged" copy of VHS (poor video quality but good sound). My memory of this was right: it was still an interesting and exciting movie. The amazing aspect of this film is just how many of his stars, which started in their career in 1944, became either big movie stars or at least well-known and full-fledged actors (eg Judy Holliday Edmond O'Brien, Jeanne Crain, Barry Nelson, Don Taylor, Karl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George "Superman") Reeves, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy, and Gary Merrill). B-24 Liberator scenes are terrible, especially in close-up shots that show the details of a 4-engine bomber (then 18,000+, now almost extinct) for a giant detail (for those times). A good overview of the different levels of training that the pilot cadet passed through the assignment of a bomber to a crew (of course, very sexual bias, as well as the trend of the day: only men became a pilot, women simply supported them in their roles - hardly acceptable in today's world). I hope that one day it will appear on the video for a new generation.
