The things that come are really the classic work of speculative fiction; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and on progress. This makes some surprising exact words that were supposed to follow a few years later, but are utopian utopian. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson are a great lie, although drama is played more than a stage than a cinema. There are grandiose, when somewhat tendentious calls are often delivered as the actor tries to reach the back of the theater. But there are some deep words. Is technology a means of saving or destroying humanity? Film is a visual party when it is possible to remove the effect from age. Of course, Hollywood is more complicated today, but rarely inventive. The third act is imaginative: a world with underground cities, massive deco-bombers, space cannons, gyroscopes and secret scientist rescue organizations. It has all the sci-fi cellulose adventure, but instead uses the tricks necessary for philosophical training. <br /> <br /> The things that come and metropolises were signs of Neolithic Hollywood science fiction. They are operational and visually inspiring. Technology has left them for a long time, but their ideas are still breaking. There is artistic art, one with heart and emotion, as with today's mass-produced cinema. These films are products of artisans, not industrial products.
