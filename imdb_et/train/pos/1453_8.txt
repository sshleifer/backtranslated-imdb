Well, there are many ways to break the political thriller. Usually they are derived or too ambitious, often they have a conspiracy that is completely paranoid and incredible. But the Town Hall does not do either of the above. The plot is smartly designed, the story is plausible. As for the characters, I would say that this movie is a solid average. No sign seems to be inappropriate and Al Pacino is brilliant as always. His image of a charismatic NYC mayor is excellent and proves once again that Al Pacino is now an absolute top of the American actors.
