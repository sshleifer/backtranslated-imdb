This is the most beautiful film. Color photography is beautiful because it shows the brilliant color of the Metropolitan Opera House. Other internal scenes in different buildings etc. are equally brilliant. As far as music is concerned, what else can be said about the fact that Lanza's voice was at its peak when he sang as many of the world's most well-known and loved arias. The wonderful Dorothy Kirsten is also a joy because her soprano voice mixes with cozy harmony with Lanza. Of course, Hollywood took its usual freedoms with the Caruso biography. There is very little story about actual events. For example, his death-related facts are fully prepared and have no connection with the truth. There are some very good websites that tell the true story of Carus and include many of his pictures. These websites can be found by any good search engine. There are also several books about his biography. But the fictional story doesn't make this beautiful movie gauze. The votes of Lanza, Kirsten and choral members are the actual stars of this film. Enjoy, I know I'm sure.
