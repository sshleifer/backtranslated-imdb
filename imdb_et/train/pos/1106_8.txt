If you are a fan of Altman's big ensembles, as shown by big movies like M.A.S.H., Nashville, Gosford Park, and less-seen movies, such as A wedding, you will undoubtedly entertain HealtH. In the midst of a health convention where two women work in front of the president, HealtH contains many of Altman's 70s regulars, such as Paul Dooley (who helped write the movie), Carol Burnett, and Henry Gibson, including top Altman newcomers like Lauren Bacall, James Garner and Glenda Jackson. Like many of the films in the Altman ensemble, this film has numerous sub-blocks, but it is almost as prevalent as films like Nashville or A Wedding, rather it is a more focused feeling, such as M.A.S.H. or Gosford Park. The whole thing is an obvious satire of health, filled with superfluous, extreme, contradictory signs and guest characters like Dick Cavett, which give the whole thing a hint. Emphasizing the entire electoral process is Altman's pessimistic policy and public appeal, but the most attractive for this film is that most people seem to be fun. This would be one of Altman's latest such films for some time!
