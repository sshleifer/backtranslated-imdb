Here is .. the first EVER episode of friends where we introduce Control Freak Monica Gellari (Courtney Cox), recently divorced Ross Gellar (David Schimmer), Hippy Pheobe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), unknown actor and ladies man (Matt Le Blanc and very sarcastic Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry), so the scene begins until we introduce 6th and last friend Spoiled kid Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> The episode is better than most people give credit, like every new sitcom, the first episode is not always fantastic, because doing this episode is not great, because cast cannot really believe its new characters (except Kudrow and Perry who shine). <br /> <br /> Matt Le Blanc-Man, his the actor was terrible, because only later will he become more confident, but I think he will try to be funny, but he will fail most. <br /> <br /> David Schimmer - Why does he pronounce every word? he became one of the most funny later but it is not sure. and i can't sympathize with him with the warmth of Jennifer Aniston-Looks and do a good job like Rachel Green, but we see the real Rachel only in the first season, Courtney Cox - sees in this episode quite anorexic, worrying, she looks completely now, differently (healthier) she is little sketch, but everyone has this 20-minute pilot! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry - I'm doing these two together, because their comic timing and sample quality were great and for Lisa it was one of her first roles and she's as natural as Pheobe (Pheebs) and Matthew Perry is just Matthew Perry playing basically! The quality of the episode improves later, such as sets, they look dark and horrible in this episode and make them unsuitable, the actor is OK, the characters trust every new scene and I'm proud that it's a pilot! Hope to see friends reunite! because they are always with us!
