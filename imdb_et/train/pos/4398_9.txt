When I heard this movie led by Ang Lee, I saw it. This Taiwanese director exploded a few years ago with the famous "The Wedding Banquet" and "Eat Drink Man Woman" and then moved to "Sense and Sensibility" and "Ice Storm". He now draws attention to another American icon - the Civil War. <br /> <br /> This story is happening in Missouri, a union of Union countries. They have never officially joined the Confederate Army. Instead, they formed illegal bands called "bushwhackers," they grew hair long, and sometimes confiscated the Union uniforms they wore over their usual clothing. and at the time of their allegedly heroic tasks, kill storers and farmers who supported the Union. There are no letters in this movie unless you think the singer is a singer who is an adult widow as an adult. <br /> <br /> Tobey Macquire, as a young German peasant, is his legacy because the Germans were sympathetic to the union. This young man is a great actor, full of fresh, facing young people, whose presence includes his wonders and subtle effects as he gets into the fear of war. his loyalty to a young man who bought his freedom. It gives a fine and underestimated performance. <br /> <br /> Some actors, however, are wooden, especially in long conversations about morals. And their costumes are too new. And the "southern gentleman", which concerns men and hats, and politeness for women, comes so much - especially since they make a point of murdering all the men they pull out of their wives, and then burning the shops though I don't think it goes down one Lee Ang's "great" movie, I found it fascinated, despite the slow parts and its excessive length of 140 minutes. I was interested in what followed, and I felt empathy for every character who came to the real and imperfect people who have reached the forces of history. <br /> <br /> Not as much action as a normal war movie, but still recommended - especially for civil war. <br /> <br />
