In another Bugs Bunny lame noisy short trousers work with the famous lepers * with the display of the department store, when owner Gildersleeve decides to put him. Of course, this is almost impossible, because Bugs probably knows the store better than Gildersleeve (and knows when to cross it). As always, they keep everything that comes at top speed, and so you have to think about how fun this comic was when it first debuted! Among other things, "Hare Conditioned" is a good example of how Looney Tunes polished them in the 40's before the crowd of Termite Terrace. But don't get me wrong, the cartoons were really good after the refined forms arrived. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's great. <br /> <br /> * Reptiles are rabbits and rabbits.
