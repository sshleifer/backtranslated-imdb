I had been watching as many series as I was able to watch on television, but unfortunately I started work that gave me work nights. I managed to have at least some of its recordings ... and of course I bought a whole series of DVDs recently released. Watching the DVD, you can see that the animation was initially a bit more crude, but after the pilot, they eliminated a fair number of errors. Votes fit well with characters and writing is great. This is quite refreshing when you view animations at its roots, adding adult themes again. The point is how society has reached the last century, you must be somewhat blatant in today's standards to be recognized as adult-oriented exhibitions. The characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that are parallel to real life. This is your typical sitcom in this regard, but humor is more like what you expect from late night television, like chat rooms or Saturday night Live ... when the SNL was actually funny. Good work, Dreamworks. Perhaps you need to work with one more liberal network to keep this series ... and also improve the marketing of serial products to help cover its high costs. It is a challenge to make it a mature comic. Oops ...
