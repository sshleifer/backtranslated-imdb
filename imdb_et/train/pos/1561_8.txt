I enjoyed this episode. Seeing Flash, Cyborg, Green Arrow and Aquaman (though everything he did, swam) increased my eyes. To see most of the founders of the League of Justice trying to bring down Lex Luthor is what I've been waiting for. It sounds a little out of the subject, but making a live stroke on the Justice League show would definitely give me a reason to justify everything I usually do during a week's drain just to see one episode. This is the excitement I got from watching this episode. I wish they would have done this episode for a little longer, like two hours, because I felt that one hour of the League of Justice was not enough. Now, before I suffered you (if I don't already have my rambling), I just want to say Smallville is cool again. It was lost when the exhibition began to focus on Lane. But I'm sure the writers will come back to this loop. :( So enjoy this episode. Who knows when another good person will come out. Try it again on Thursday, February 22, if you didn't respond to the first incitement.
