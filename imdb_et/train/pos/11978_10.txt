I love the full house so much that I couldn't live without a full house. Why did it end? It is a lot of trouble for this fan. Do we have a complete house II? Ah now! But it is better if we have these DVDs to help us. But I need them real to come up with a new new episode. Love, heat is full of houses! All the characters are very cute and beautiful! Candace Cameron, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Jodie Sweet, Bob Saget, Dave Coulier and John Stamos, loooooooove you! DJ, Michelle, Stephanie, Danny, Joey and Jesse, please come back! How's Michelle after the horse falls? How about Nicky and Alex? Is Joey alone or with a woman or at least a girl? Are they still living in one house? I want to continue the plenary life! and don't irritate me!
