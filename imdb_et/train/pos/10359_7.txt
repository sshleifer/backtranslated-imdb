Meryl Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as an actor. I know he's been kidding to make a lot of accents, but he's stressing every time. His production by Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, as depicted here, was not very pleasant or all that was wise. But this makes Streep's work even more remarkable. I think he deserves all 10 or more Oscar candidates. There were a couple of interesting things about the movie. I don't know much about Australia, but the story of religious religious rites was great among the public. I was very much lost when I first saw the movie a few years ago, but yesterday it came out loud and clear. And it seems that the Australian press is just as achievable in an arduous endeavor and generalization as American colleagues. Pretty good movie. A little different. Rating: B
