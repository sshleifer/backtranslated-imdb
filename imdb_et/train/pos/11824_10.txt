Dick Tracy is just the best comic book movie ever made. The film has the same feeling as the comic book, which remains true to the color scheme. The Batman series has risen, fallen, climbed and fallen again. Dick Tracy has a real permanent power that can be enjoyed by both adults and children. Good guys win over evil, without blood and gore to score. Al Pacino does a great job of adjusting his Big Boy Caprice and Madonna is memorable as breathless. The best job is far from Warren Beatty, who simply imitates Dick Tracy as Clyde Barrows. I can't wait until it appears on DVD on April 2, 2002, my tape is wearing thin.
