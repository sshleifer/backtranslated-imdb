This movie talks about this nervous man who decides to become a glamorous high tech company called Digicorp. This witty man, Morgan (Jeremy Northam), is pleased with his unhappy suburban life and his demanding wife, so he decides to become a spy. He thinks he is going to conventions with other high-tech companies and will find out all business plans. Instead, Morgan finds that he is interested in a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu) and these two entrepreneurs have doubled to make her a double agent. How's Morgan going out of it? Can he trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And more importantly, can Morgan bring it to life? Wow! What a great movie! 15 years after watching this movie, I was completely sucked. It is very tense and you can feel the fear and confusion of Morgan because he does his best to survive. The scene where they put this terrible conflict with Morgan's head to be temporarily washed is terribly horrible and scary. Morgan slowly undergoes a transformation of personality that is not so easily visible until you think about it after the end of the movie. With bad hair and glasses with bad hair, she becomes a man who is actively fighting for her life. <br /> <br /> End, wow, end is incredible! Twist is so fun! It left me feeling and joy as crazy! Good presentation from all over, especially Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie!
