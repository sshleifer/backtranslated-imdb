"Luzhin Defense" is a movie worthy of everyone. it is a glowing, intense film and keeps my attention all the time. John Turturro is absolutely stunning, the eccentric male Grandmaster and Emily Watson are spellbinding as a gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on the screen is evident from the moment their characters' story comes into contact. All in all, this film is one of the best deepest moments of the Grandmaster's life, and Turturro and Watson add a whole non-mainstream, non-clich√© to the film. Most people come out of theatrical thinking and feel that this brilliant look is about the most likely love stories.
