I would not have been more excited; Just eight years ago in 1983, I saw a movie in Star Wars! The best day in my life was happening. By that time, my only Star Wars experience was a Star Wars HBO show. I hadn't even seen The Empire Strikes Back. <br /> <br /> And boy, did this day give my less critical eyes. Jabba. Large rebel spaceships. Emporer. Green Blade Light Cabinet! Wow! From this magical day I've been watching this movie hundreds of times. I can't even make an accurate estimate right now. Of course, with these multiple views, I have seen that this film - REAL Episode III - has its drawbacks. <br /> <br /> Of course, in the context of the Star Wars movie, these "bugs" are no longer similar. In May 1983 I had mines. And that was my Star Wars movie.
