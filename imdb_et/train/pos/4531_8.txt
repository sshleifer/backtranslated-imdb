It is a purple flower that contains love through the ages. The film consists of Keaton, who is looking for stone-age love, ancient Rome and the present (1920s). In all three cases, he is a normal nervous buster and he is fighting against Wallace Beery for his love. I liked the best of Rome in three time periods, although I admit that it could have been the most exciting. I liked the scenes with a lion that was obviously a costume, but also a strange carriage ride in the snow - but what I enjoyed most was to see all of Keaton's amazing acrobatics. But all three time periods were good old-fashioned fun and the film, though not the best, is still an extraordinary and enjoyable movie. Look!
