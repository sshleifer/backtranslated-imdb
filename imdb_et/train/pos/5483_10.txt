I was very pleased that "the revolution is not on television". This once gave me a positive feeling about the power of people to decide how they want to rule. <br /> <br /> It is regrettable that in Venezuela, twenty percent of wealthy citizens have made decades of decades, if not centuries, of poverty decisions. However, if their return failed; After the Interim Government completed the Supreme Court and the Constitution, as well as the Ombudsman and Electoral Commissions and all civil rights, no one took out the ploters behind the candle and shot them. They haven't even gone to jail. Larger plotters live in Florida, continuing. And the protection they had was the "Bolivarian Constitution" adopted by most of the Venezuelan people. It is not limited to history. Democracy can give you one hell when you let it go. And in Venezuela it's open.
