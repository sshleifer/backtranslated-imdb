I found it to be a charming adaptation, very lively and fun. Except for a few big bugs, the cast is great. I have to repeat some previous comments - Chynna Phillips is terrible as a teenager. At 27, he is just too old (and yes, it shows) and he has no song "stick" for Broadway style music. Vanessa Williams is decent and enough for the singer, and for a non-dancer she is enough. But she is not Latina and her character is definitely. He is also a very STRIDENT all the time, which becomes tiring. <br /> <br /> Sweet Apple's Conrad Birdie fan club girls really shine - special praise for Brigitta Dau and Chiara Zanni. I also liked the performance of Tyne Daly, although I'm not usually a fan of her work. Finally, dancing Shriners is a riot, especially at the bar three. <br /> <br /> The film is suitable for the whole family and I highly recommend it.
