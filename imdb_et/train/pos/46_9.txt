Just finished watching this movie maybe 7 or 8 times, picking it up for one night, previously viewed in Blockbuster and completely loved, I've shown it to 4 people so far and they've enjoyed it. Avoid Hollywood's Glamor, Special Effects, and "Shock Factor" Emphasis, this independent film, F. F. Ryan, hits the nail head to deal with the aftermath of traumatic situations. After the high school, two characters form an improbable bond between Alicia (occupied Philipps) and Dean (Erika Christensen). Alicia, a stone-hearted girl, Goth, who has a pessimistic attitude to life, helps Dean to overcome life and death, and to live after her. In the meantime, Deanna tries to help Alicial again see the softness and light of the world. Not emphasizing the shocking event, but between those who lived through it, he divides the film. Despite its low budget and short filming time, this film is far from being a cheese. Ryan respects a situation he has never suffered and tries to get into the human psyche. With the amazing up and coming actor, Philipps, adds the necessary drama to dialogue and the overall feeling of the film and Christensen helps to balance the "punishment and darkness" feeling this movie may have. In general, I recommend this movie and if you enjoy the school's aggression and violence and learn more about it, I also recommend the documentary "It's a Girls' World" by CBC in 2004 on social bullying. in comparison and contrast, two groups of girls in Montreal, Quebec and another in Victoria, British Columbia, Dawn Marie Wellesley's group of friends and acquaintances, a 14-year-old girl who killed himself after cruel bullying.
