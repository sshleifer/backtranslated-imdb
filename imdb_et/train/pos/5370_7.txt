All of Arnold's 80s films that would have thought Running Man was the most important thing today. Cooling and a surprisingly realistic story about reality on TV went crazy. It may then be far removed, but not so. Not when you mean it. At present, reality TV shows are either scratching the bottom of the barrel or desperate to lift the bar. If the next one is not more controversial in the latter case, it is dude. How long will it last before we see shows like Running Man? How long have we been appointed by the lawyers of the theater or the entertainment department of the Ministry of Justice? There are so many satire and intelligence in this movie that maybe left back in 1987, desperate to see the current state of TV shows. <br /> <br /> The biggest message of all is "You are lying. It's no secret that the government and the media are working smoothly. And the masses believe what the media believes in them. This is a very scary situation and if there is no clearer evidence, we can easily adopt a brutal show like Running Man in the near future. It's no secret that Reality TV is not very realistic. It has been edited and redesigned before it is transmitted, and that's just what the networks want you to see. Usually it is far from the true truth. <br /> <br /> Although the scenario is completely different from Stephen King's book (the end is completely changed), the script matches the typical Arnie formula. Yes, he has a lot of very single horns and he says I will come back (which he never said that often anyway when you think about it) is still in the most ironic situation, but he is still a better zillion if Christopher Reeve or Dolph Lundgren had been (these two were held before Arnie's belief). <br /> <br /> The director is nothing more than Dave Starsky himself (Paul Michael Glaser). It may not be artistic, but it is still strong enough to create excitement, and its neon and fluorescent dyes give every person a pretty cool look. Andrew Davis (not a particularly pleasing director) was added to Glaser, although no matter who controls, the film is still very difficult for 80 years. <br /> <br /> First of all, Harold Faltermeyer's score (remember he's incredibly dated and robbing every action of timeless integrity, and the idea of ​​movie fashion is too excessive to persuade in the future. In addition to dated feeling, the only thing that hurts me , this is a badly staged shooting game that goes through the top. <br /> <br /> This new DVD is zillion times better than the original edition. It has gone through a terrible mailbox picture. Instead, it's an entirely new mouse definition of 1.85: 1 anamorphic transmission. and literally appear on the screen, as well as the amazing new Dolby 5.1 EX and DTS ES soundtrack. Continuous use of space channels with high impact and bass is strong and powerful. Certainly one of the best re-masters I've ever seen. Two intriguing documentaries, trailers and The Meet the Stalkers trick has been added to the 2-Dual Set, which is a pretty clean slip.
