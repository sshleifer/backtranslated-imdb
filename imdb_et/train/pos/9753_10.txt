... in our household. Like everyone else who commented on this movie, my brothers (7 and 4 years old) and I (10) looked over and over again. We all loved Star Wars, but we always went to it because of great songs and adventure. We all loved camel and sang at the top of our lungs during his song. There are some slow moments (the time it took for King Koo-Koo in his court) and we usually missed the Knight song ("The reason I have a sound effect is because I looooove you"), but we loved to save the journey The Babbett and the End, and everyone was a bit astonished by the picture of the King Koo-Koo, who dominated it horizontally there at the end, manically. I still sing "Hooray for me! My friends (I am now 33) who just look at me the way I would have lost my thoughts, but when I sing it, I'm 10 years old, remembering Star Wars" i have a wonderful year.
