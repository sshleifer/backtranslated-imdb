I thought this movie was pretty good. Some parts were bright, but it is understandable because it was made more than 55 years ago. I thought Michele Morgan, who played convincingly Millie, gave the best results to the film. Jack Haley is also very good as Mike O'Brien. Although I'm not a big fan of Frank Sinatra, I think he was very good in this movie. If your desire is silly, the top music comedy, then the higher and higher is the film for you. <br /> <br />
