The Lost Kingdom Wizards is a film of a young prince (Simon) who has been left out of his kingdom because his father (king) kills the clinic as an "evil adviser". This movie is about Simon's adventures. Special effects, plots, acting and generally all about this movie are BAD. But it's so bad that it's funny. You're watching this movie just because it's so bad it is funny, and as the other film reviewer said, it's so bad that it's good.
