Probably my favorite movie of all time, a story of selfishness, sacrifice, and dedication to a noble cause, but it's not preaching or boring. It will never get old, even though I've seen it about 15 times in the last 15 years. Paul Lukas's performance brings tears to my eyes and Bette Davis, one of his very few really sympathetic roles, is delighted. Children are like grandmother says more than "dressed dwarf" than kids, but it only makes them more fun. And the mother's slow awakening, taking place in the world and under her roof, is plausible and amazing. If I had a dozen thumbs, they would all be "up" for this movie.
