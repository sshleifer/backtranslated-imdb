I've seen this movie at least fifty times, and after watching it for the first time a long time last week, I still FELT it. <br /> <br /> The story itself was incredible, but came to Spielberg's knowledge and fabulous casting, including Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover and Margaret Avery. Akosua Busia deserves the Oscar nomination for her short but powerful Nettie portrayal. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, you look at every person's emotion. I laughed, shouted and angered. Like most of the great films, the Academy saw it with several candidates, but not winning. But this film is undoubtedly the best film ever.
