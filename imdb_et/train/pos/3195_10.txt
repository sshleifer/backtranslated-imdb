BEAVER TRILOGY is undoubtedly one of the best films ever made. I was fortunate enough to receive it, with a Q&A session with director Trent Harris at the NY Video Festival a few years ago, and then I bought a copy of Trent's website. This movie must be considered plausible! I strongly recommend looking for Trent's name on the web and then buying a movie from your site. He's an incredibly nice man. Don't be confused: The operator in the fancy parts of BEAVER TRILOGY is not TRENT! <br /> <br /> After seeing TRILOGIA a few times, I have to admit that I can probably make a Penn version without Sea. It's like the Crispin Glover's "Orkly Kid" trial and it's more interesting than curiosity if you're a Penn fan if it's a good video. The penny is pretty funny and you see a great alphabet in this green B&W video. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of Crispin Glover's best roles and I just love seeing an updated documentary about the original Groovin 'Gary. When you see this movie, you will never get Gary's nervous laughter from her head.
