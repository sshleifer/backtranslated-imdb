I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen! I was bored and looked through t.v. and found the "Home Room" and it was about 5 minutes, but I got stuck. It was so interesting and moving. It shows what can happen in someone's life. I'll give her 10, more than I can. The director / writer and the actors did an amazing job. I think teenagers should watch and learn this movie. It was great, drama, mystery and much more. I cried for hours! I think the director / writer should write more of these films. I love it! I didn't know the movie that was sad because it was so good. I wish it could go to movies to see more people.
