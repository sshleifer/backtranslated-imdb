Apparently, many people haven't seen this movie because no one posts more comments. This is not a film to be abandoned. After all, he has won both the George Peabody Prize and the Humanitas Award. Paul Winfield should have won prizes for the excellent performance of this film. Eugene Logan, a co-worker for a TV movie, was also part of humanity or losing it, being a technical advisor to Truman Capote's "Glass House". This movie is now available on DVD. If anyone is interested, I'll post another letter saying that Eugene Logan was a technical advisor to such a wonderful person as Truman Capote. Thank you for reading this and hope you find a way to watch these two movies.
