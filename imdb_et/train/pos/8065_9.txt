Perhaps this is because I looked up in the 1920s on the history of Irish problems and then on the sad civil war that created the Republic after signing the treaty before watching this movie. Anyway, the sudden turn at the end of my eyes. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen is not as famous today as he was and should be remembered better. In this movie, I think he plays himself because he would have been without his innate talents and brains. For example, the scenes where his friend crowd is fighting with men to fight with him are obviously what McLaglen actually did in previous years when he was a world-class barefoot boxer. John Ford is partly responsible for this; The IMDb Trivia section shows how he actually tried to get a bad hangover on McLaglen's spot. This director could also bring out many of his actors, even without such tricks. Mostly, however, McLaglen is firmly in control, especially when his character is almost completely blott (which is difficult for an actor to do incredibly), and he also plays Gypo Nolan with a deep and emotional power that is surprising to a person who only saw McLaglen later on "Quiet person". I especially like the contrast that IRA has, and the much more clearly controlled performance he gave to the IRA man Denis Hogan in the "Hangman House". <br /> <br /> "Quiet Man", of course, McLaglen is a national squire incompatible with the local IRA. Victor McLaglen was a big and cumbersome word in the old sense, but he was also a good actor and had extensive and fine nuances that we just did not expect such a man. This is a rather sad comment on our own expectations and prejudices. <br /> <br /> Ford, as usual, packs a lot of movies. All characters are excellent (though the commander's main American accent is disturbing) - NOTE. - Knowing that Gypo pulled the short straw and ordered him to kill, but let him talk about it, we really feel against a man who pulls a short shoulder to fill Gypo and the humanity he shows, especially when they go to Gypo in Mary's room . <br /> <br /> John Ford really shows his genius, taking what could have been a terrible and yet awaited outcome of the whole story, and instead using a completely unexpected and very satisfying ending that makes us think not only of Gypo and others characters, but in poor Ireland.
