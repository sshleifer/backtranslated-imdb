This is the best of 43 movies Rainer Werner Fassbinder did; its the most successful at least. He was one of the leaders of World War II. <br /> <br /> Hanna Schygulla was great when the cold, she thought Maria Bruan, who lost her husband's war, found her after losing a American soldier, lost her again after she went to jail and found her at the end . His one and a half marriage before he disappeared was longer than their time together. <br /> <br /> This is life. Things come and go, and you do the best. You can give up or adjust your mindset to survive. Though Maria corrected her thinking and did what she was supposed to do, she never stopped Hermann's love, which puts an end to such a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Great drama.
