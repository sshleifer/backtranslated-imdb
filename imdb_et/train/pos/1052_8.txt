A notable documentary about the pioneering achievements of the Kumba Women's Lawyers Association (WLA) in south-west Cameroon, protecting women's and children's rights from domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, where men have always been sovereign over women, Sharia law can well imagine the difficulty of establishing secular legal rights for women and children. After 17 years of unsuccessful efforts, WLA leaders recently started a couple of wins and this film aims to share these winning stories. <br /> <br /> The leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa State Prosecutor and Beatrice Ntuba, Senior Judge (President of the Court). Both play themselves in this movie, which may contain spontaneously recorded material, although I imagine that a large part, if not all, of the camera will consist of subsequent recoveries of actual events. Four cases are reviewed and all plaintiffs play in the movie. <br /> <br /> Two cases involve repeated beating of a woman with forced sex in one case; the second includes a 10-year-old girl forced to have sex; and the second concerns the repeated beating of an 8-year-old child by the aunt. One of the beaten women is also looking for divorce. We follow cases from investigating complaints to test results. The results of each case are favorable for women and children. Criminals receive severe prison sentences and / or fines; Divorce is granted. <br /> <br /> The aggressive accusation of child beating adults shows that their female criminal justice officials are indeed gender neutral in enforcing the law. It is also remarkable how all parties are treated, including sentenced persons. This is a very important and well done film. (Interestingly, one of the directors, Mrs Longinotto, also directed the 1998 film "Divorce, Iranian Style", which dealt with issues related to Tehran.) (In English with subtitles in English). My class: B + 8/10
