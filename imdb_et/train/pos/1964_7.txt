I cannot accept the negative comments of other reviewers. They are too critical, perhaps because they have been stuck in the past. I would like to see a comment from someone who has never seen Basic Instinct 1, maybe someone very young? I was delighted with the cinema feeling that the IMDb reviewers were not fascinated by me. 14 hours later, I'm still trying to find some bugs on the plot, but I don't think anything serious. My advice to everyone is to see it for themselves and shape their mind. <br /> <br /> It follows a similar model as the basic instinct 1, but the plot is less confused. However, it remained questionable to me, but more satisfactorily. Sharon Stone is as sexy and evil as before and carries her 48 years very well; this is his decisive role. David Morrisey was satisfactory, though he is not Michael Douglas. David Thewl, especially a police detective, was particularly fond of the pains supported.
