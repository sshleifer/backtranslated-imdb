I really enjoyed the pilot, it was so amazing when I hoped it would be better, if not better. Patrick Warburton was a riot, though at first I thought I couldn't stand my character. He and Megyn Price were little chemistry at all, but hopefully as the season goes by, they will become more comfortable with each other. Megyn has had to be strange when he has been a star in his last show ["Grounded For Life") to be a star. <br /> <br /> Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson are truly new to the entire Sitcom scene, but I think they will improve in time. The nature of David Spade, to my surprise, was not the focus of this pilot. The way he carries his lines is so different from everyone else I've seen on television, but I think it's just his style. It works for him. <br /> <br /> I think couples or even lumps can interact with all suspicions and struggles and be confident in their decisions that this show is. All the situations that characters are put into are felt like real life, not sugar-coated like most exhibitions. <br /> <br /> I hope all the participants will give CBS an opportunity. This exhibition has the potential to be one of the best series when given the opportunity and the time.
