I've been disappointed when not surprised when this movie hasn't received recognition. Billy Zane proves once again that he is more than just a Hollywood boy in a silent performance that combines spastic strokes and undervalued sins. Calling it a silent movie is inaccurate because there is a lot of music and sound. It is a manic pace and is full of funny inventions that Ed Wood will finally appreciate. Look at the cast list and understand that everyone looks. Nobody has just shown their face. I believe they are all in the movie to show their appreciation for Wood and to do a broad, physical action that is not seen much these days. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, reviewers are trying to guess what is going to be more of a blow than they show any aesthetic recognition of the film. IWUETDID does not have a visible target audience. This was mainly done by the love of the wood script. Even after his death, the trendy social parasites have been struck by another serious blow and have left the world with a less important classic. This is a very fun and truly experimental movie that really deserves at least a DVD.
