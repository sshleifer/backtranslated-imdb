I don't understand why they decided to release this movie to introduce the American audience to Jet Li. The legend fist would have been a much better choice. Anyway, the black mask is not terrible, but certainly not great. The final battle sequence is well-staged by Yuen Woo Ping, who co-ordinated the Matrix. However, releasing from English suffers from untreated editing and duplication. (I ask the Hollywood studios to release these films with subtitles.) Jet Li shows his characteristic charisma in the title, and Francoise Yip has a cool but short role as a woman 701. The Black Mask has a strange Gothic style that adds but it is overwhelmed with arms battles and explosions. More focused on fantastic physical skills. A black mask is a decent film, but we do it for ourselves and take a legend of fist if you want to see a huge movie that really shows Li's skills.
