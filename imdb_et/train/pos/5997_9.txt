Let me start by saying that I've never reviewed the IMDb movie; but i'm in the video. And come from this idea; I can say without a doubt that this film is short. It has a very good story and another thing I love (even better twist). Opening was very well done, I loved the selected video and how it was edited. And with any movie that's important. The movie stream works great and the editing was very good. From a technical point of view (which is usually halfway), everything is well done. There is no bigger technology. noted. The only small thing I have is that the final credits are small. This is probably due to a rendering problem. Let me also say that I would have preferred to see more of the love scene, but I am a man (so you can encrypt it up to a man's factor). <br /> <br /> So overall I appreciate it 9/10. You should check if you are a fan of Indies and / or short films. <br /> <br /> ps. Sorry for bad grammar or spelling.
