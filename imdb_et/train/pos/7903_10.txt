I saw this in the first seconds of the movie T.R. took me to the ride - I didn't like the big glued thumb at first, but the absurd humor and the amazing look of both sisters-actors - I don't know who played the youngsters - but he was great and so was uma !!! - <br /> <br /> Two other people who went to the cinema in about half an hour, I was with a friend - and it's always an attempt to look at a pleasant movie with one of my friends - and we both enjoyed it with the maximum fun laugh - sadness "realistic police-normal". both fans of T.Robbins' books ... I found it well done - I thought Robbins would approve even though I have no idea whether he likes the movie or not ... <br /> <br /> I would like to see the cut stuff - I heard gus v. Sand had to take a lot of scenes for the first time because of the viewers (or producers?), although it is an artistic film. too short though ... this is one of my all-time favorites - and I'm aware that most people can't tolerate such a movie and assume that people who enjoy this movie are what they think ... ... .what a pity. hopefully the day will come when there is full material - a DVD that hopes to see more crisp, keanu - waiting for her to see her baby and everyone <br /> <br /> if you have the opportunity to see it, think twice and enjoy if you decided to look ... m
