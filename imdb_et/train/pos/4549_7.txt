"My Left Foot" is a pretty impressive film that tells the story of Christy Brown, an artist who was exhausted by cerebral palsy and learned to paint his left foot, the only limb in his body. Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Oscar as the best actor for this film, which I am not completely sure of, but which is still remarkable. Day-Lewis gives Brown a realistic and, at times, almost humorous touch. Brenda Fricker, like Brown's dedicated mother, also won the Oscar for a credible and engaging role. My problem with this film is that it is sometimes a bit too real. If Brown is desperate and has to help someone and do it all with his left foot, the film can be hard to watch. It often gives it a frustrating feeling that some viewers may turn off for a while. However, if you look further, you will see hope and inspiration for those with unfavorable conditions and other difficulties. Those of us who are not exhausted and still have problems are inspiring this film, because if we are somewhat worse than we can overcome our difficulties, we can certainly do the same. Well done, sometimes enjoyable but hard to watch. It may not be for everyone, but not at all. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
