How truly friendly, charming and cordial is this modest old series; I was happy about seeing old Lugos. It's armedly friendly and lively. This is a long lost ship document. (Today, the best TV series with these old moderately good serials is difficult to compete with.) CHANDU is deeply, deeply optimistic and hedonistic. It refreshes your mind. It's not stupid; fools are those who do not get such serial works. Chandul has an irresistible understanding of simple, modest and friendly fun. <br /> <br /> Too much to give away is Chandu's casual witch who also goes to this eastern name and who loves and protects her brother-in-law Chandu, expressing her supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate way. <br /> <br /> What is pretty sexy niece Nadji, she kidnaps the Ubast priest. : Varieties of Vindhyan. The poor sexy girl is actually kidnapped by a sarcophagus after she has fallen asleep; almost kidnapped from the boat; fake cop; The Temple of Lemuria and its strange, horrible dinners are reminiscent of KING KONG's images and are barbaric mockings of RCC ceremonies and rituals. <br /> <br /> Would you protect the girl as bravely as Chandu does? <br /> <br /> Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless, average drunk, and it only contributed to his performances. He is a prototypical mean drunk uncle, crazy and cunning and slanting. It might seem like a complicated respect for Lugosi, but Burton's Wood biopsies left me with this impression of Lugos and associated strong sympathy with the actor of fraud. I like the fancy performances of Lugos. <br /> <br /> This series has been unfairly launched.
