In addition to planes, trains and cars, and Uncle Buck, this is John Candy's most fun movie. When he hypnotizes with a playing card (similar to Manchur's candidate) and becomes a hornys who doesn't know what he says, he makes two very memorable bids (both dealing with male anatomy). You need to see a love scene that contains food, it can't be described. <br /> <br />
