I have had a lot of experience with women in Russia, and unfortunately this film is a lot of them. They are very cunning, ruthless and greedy and very unfair. From the genus of robots, the irritation of gifts, the lies and the betrayal I have experienced it in Russia. <br /> <br /> I know what I'm talking about. And here's my qualification: Here's my three trips to Russia for a bride looking for a photo book. It contains thousands of pictures of many hot Russian girls I met, black comedy, the fraud I gave, and the story of my looting and appearance on Russian national television. .com / Photojournals.htm <br /> <br /> It's like Reality TV. You like it. I spent a ton of time putting it together. So look at it. A Russian woman playing Nicole Kidman is much like my Julia and Katya in my photo books. <br /> <br /> My 3 brides looking for trips in Russia are very exciting and selling, so why not make a movie of my bride looking for adventures in Russia? However, this film has one factual impossibility and this is the way a man orders his bride's catalog and his arrival at the airport. It doesn't work at all, so I don't understand why the media likes to continue. There is no one Russian bridal showroom that works in this way, and I invite someone to find one that does it. The fact is that you can order a Russian lady from CONTACT INFO (email, address, phone number, etc.) from the website. From there you will answer and visit him and if you want to bring him into your country, you start the immigration process in your INS office and wait for it. That's how it works in real life. You can't just order it to arrive at your airport. US immigration would never allow such a thing to happen. <br /> <br /> WuMaster <br /> <br /> - I got everything I want to go abroad!
