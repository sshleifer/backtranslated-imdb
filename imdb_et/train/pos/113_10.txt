I haven't seen this movie after about 5 years, but it still haunts me. <br /> <br /> When I asked about my favorite movies, it seems to be always the first. There are certain movies (such as "Dark City" and "Breaking the Waves") that seem to be about the place inside you, so protected and hidden, but so sensitive that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer, not unlike the changing event of life, for example, the termination of a serious relationship or death of a friend ... This film "shook" me the first time I saw it. It left me an emotional couple that lasted for several days.
