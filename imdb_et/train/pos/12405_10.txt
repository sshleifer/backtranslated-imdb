I caught this movie about 1990 in a random way and knowing what I was. Many horror fans might have missed this thinking because it was a typical prison movie and those who did not like it didn't like it, because it wasn't what they wanted to see. The above factors are probably the reasons that are low, but ignore it and give it a whirl when you are a fan of the genre. <br /> <br /> It has strong suits in all departments for scripting and atmospheric action and jail. <br /> <br /> Absolute diamond, the movie I still have video to date. Look at it.
