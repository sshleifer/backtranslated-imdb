The last command (1928) is a silent film directed by Josef von Sternberg. It shows us the Tsar's General, Grand Duke Sergius Alexander (Emil Jannings) during his awards. In 1917 he had all the power, but after the revolution and the collapse he is also a woman's love, Natalie Dabrova (Evelyn Brent). His old enemy Lev Andreyev (William Powell) is a director who can choose whether to hire him as a movie or not. The last command is a very good silent drama.Mr Jannings plays a memorable role in the lead.Evelyn Brent plays a wonderful woman. William Powell is always great. Like many scenes, Jannings and Brent. And then it's over with Powell and Jannings. This is a film that touches many parts.
