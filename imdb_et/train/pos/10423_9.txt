Yes, Be My Love was glorious and popular with Mario Lanza today. His voice was strong and stable, so powerful that MGM decided to use him in Carus. Lanza himself thought he was a Caruso reincarnation. After reading the book of Kostelanitz, which wrote the biography of Lanza, he explains that constant practice and vocal lessons became a vision for Lanza. There is no doubt that Lanza did a great job, but the story is not entirely true; blame it on Hollywood! I practiced singing my songs years ago and I started myself well until I lost my voice because of emphysema / asthma ten years ago. Being My Love Love is not easy; but beautiful!
