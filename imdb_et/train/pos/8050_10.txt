The most powerful martial arts man will do it again. Early Sammo's film, imitating his character's hero, Bruce Lee, Sammo is amazingly Lee like in his actions and struggle. How he slips into the Bruce style and then back to his own kung fu, it is a pleasure to look and show how he has achieved and adaptable. Throw in a bit of such humor from a beloved flick and a movie that has everything - comedy (some involuntary, like a fake black boy), action, and some incredible fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> A big beer and mates movie that's worth an hour and a half of someone's time.
