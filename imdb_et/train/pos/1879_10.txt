I was too young to see this movie for the first time. But I saw it a second time about 7 years ago. My sister told me I had to see it. Now my whole family has remembered it. We will quote it at least once a day. I love this movie absolutely. Of course, this is about a really drunken millionaire that is irresponsible. The whole point is that he still has humanity missing from what we see in the film. And he's ready to give that love. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh. Lots of laughs. Its cozy, sweet and as your movie buffer, it really makes a funny idea. Check it out with your group of friends or your family and I promise you will never have anything to talk about with some authur lines with your head. This will make you laugh in the coming years. <br /> <br /> In my family, it's really hard to find a movie that everyone likes. But this movie felt closer to us. And I know it's doing the same for you!
