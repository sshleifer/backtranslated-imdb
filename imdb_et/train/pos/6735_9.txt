Wow! Stacy Peralta has been watching Dogtown and Z-Boys with a stunning documentary about the history of American wave surfing culture. Together with insider archive material with interviews about the legends of surfing, we are transported to the brave and spiritual life of early pioneers whose only passionate sport is the industry that today affects millions of people. <br /> <br /> It shows those icons and their stories that give the film warmth. You may feel that Peralta has respected this group because we hear the Greg Noll accounts moving from surfers on the beach to surfers on the north coast of Hawaii. Or Jeff Clark, surfing maliciously dangerous Maverick off the coast of Northern California, was discovered 15 years before and became a destination for surfing in California. And Laird Hamilton's storytelling history, today's surfing icon. Listening to Greg Noll respectfully refers to Hamilton as the best surfferers who have ever sent chills to my back. <br /> <br /> (Noll, Clark, and others were on Sundance screenings. Noll described herself as being humble, she was deeply moved by the audience's reception and film, and she and Clark were both personally so pleased as they were .) \ t when they take the monster swell. <br /> <br /> All this and the movie are more. For those who did not live in California in the 1960s, we get an overview of the impact of surfing on American pop culture. (And as a surprise to me, the impact of the movie Gidget on surfing!) Some of the technical aspects of sports and the history of device upgrades are also exacerbated by Peral. I'm not a surfer, but like the rest of the Sundance audience, I was very excited about this movie. Peralta puts his claim on American documentary Big Kahuna.
