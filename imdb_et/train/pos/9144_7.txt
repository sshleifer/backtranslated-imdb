Ok, so it may not be an award-winning "movie of the year" (except for a great soundtrack that I think won a prize), but it's really a big movie "Kid" (Prince / O (take your pick) and events around him who live in Minneapolis, play their music, music is absolutely great, I think you need to have this soundtrack, it is truly classic and brings together the eighties sounds and you feel wonderful fashion and the movie itself plays a nice plot, worth seeing over and over again, especially if you like of course Prince / O (what I do).
