dear god where i start. It's a bar not the best movie I've ever seen. the corners of the camera are great, but in my opinion the action was the best. why the scriptwriters of this movie don't write to big budget movies I never understand. the other is cast. that's great. this is the best ted frame movie definitely out there. I know some of you probably think he doesn't have much better, but you are not wrong. The Raptor Island is a work of art. I hope this should be the best film of the year instead of the crappy movie Crash, where there are no names and no raptor. I believe this movie is really the most wonderful thing.
