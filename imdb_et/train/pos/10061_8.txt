One of the warmest external films I've ever seen. The young girl is an amazing talent. His (Doggie), old man (King of Masks) and Liang (Lively Boddhisatva) star games. <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) The unfortunate treatment of children, especially women, is disturbing. /> <br /> Loved music. The original Chinese dialogue enhances the emotional intensity of the performances and the story. <br /> <br /> This is a BLACK SEE - an enjoyable family film, though not for very small children. It would have been appreciated that the DVD would be even higher if the soundtrack had been better transferred to the DVD and the broadcast contained a widescreen version.
