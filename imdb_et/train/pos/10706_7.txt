This is a good example of a movie that, despite its low rating, is more than worth. The story is tempting and it won't take long before the chemistry of Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin gets your attention. Action is first-rate and the characters are well represented. Sometimes it seems that the director cannot decide between drama and romantic comedy. Ben Chiller's imagination of the law that follows and shy English S.M. Bedroom hidden magazines create a lot of laughing moments! As well as looking at Nicole Kidman's eyes when she offers John for the first time in intimacy, for a long time ... By the way, the actors and especially Nicole Kidman give this comedy a fairly dramatic incline.
