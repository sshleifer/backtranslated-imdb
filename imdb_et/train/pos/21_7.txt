It may not be a memorable classic, but it is a touching romance that has an important theme that emphasizes the importance of literacy in today's society and devastating career and vital consequences for any unfortunate person who lacks this important skill. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Iris, a widow who gets acquainted with a colleague working in her factory, a staff of an illiterate cafe called Stanley. Iris discovers that Stanley can't read and, after losing her job, she gives her a story in the kitchen at home. Of course, as you predict, these two, though initially cautious for inclusion, will develop feelings for each other ... <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda competently plays a woman who has problems with her problems. prospects, two teenage children (one pregnant), an unemployed sister, and his abusive spouse. But Robert DeNiro is, of course, brilliant intelligent and inventive, but illiterate, Stanley, who gives honor to a dignified role. They are not your typical charming young yuppie-pair, as is usually depicted on the screen romances, but the usual working class, the medieval couple, with pretty underground struggles. <br /> <br /> I'm not giving up, but it's a lovely, warm-hearted romance and a personal look at the worrying issue of adult illiteracy, even from the point of view of a fictional character.
