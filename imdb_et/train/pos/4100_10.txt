"La Bête" by Walerian Borowczyk is based on the story "Lokis" written by Prosper Merimée. Lucy Broadhurst (Lisbonh Hummel), an American heir who has been appointed to the impoverished Marika's son, arrives at the family's crumbling church and learns the mythical burial beast allegedly lies near the forest. It is incredible that a former lady house (Sirpa Lane) as a engaged perverted sex creature and Lucy finds themselves consumed in dreams of an incident. "The Beast" is an artistic building consisting of surreal horror, explicit slip and porn. There is indirect sensuality, assault and perversion in the priesthood, large fake ejaculations that are tempered from the breasts, masturbation with rose and the most graphic, named beast toying with incredibly big phallus.Still this truly erotic movie is wonderfully photographed and tasteless. they are naked most of the time. Generally, "La Bête" is a visual feast. If it is fetishistic attention to detail or information about visual motifs, the Borowczyk masterpiece should be carefully and carefully monitored. The fans of the European cinema must be seen.
