I teach Japanese in online high school and engage in cultural events so that students can learn about both the state and the language. And looking at "Gung Ho" is one of the demands. Students can buy or rent a movie. Stereotypes or not, it helps students see that other people look at the world and their lives differently than we do. Many of my students have told me that they enjoyed the movie so much that they got a copy. It is really interesting to see what we value in this culture and what they value in their culture. I just wish I had a cleaned TV version. I am not really in the raw materials used by car workers all the time.
