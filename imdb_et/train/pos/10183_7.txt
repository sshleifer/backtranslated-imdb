This is probably Karisma's best, except for Zubeida. Nana Patekar also gives her best, even without trying. The story is very good from time to time, but in the end it seems to drag, especially when Shahrukh comes to the picture. What I really liked was the performance of the leaders, the dialogue, and the story of what it was. It could have been better and edited. The supporting case was even great, including Karima's mother, though she had just one bright moment, it was nice to look at her. <br /> <br /> Sets were also pretty good. I didn't like their portrayal of the Canadian family, but when they enter India it is as real as it gets. <br /> <br /> Generally, I would give her thumbs!
