I disagree with other comments on this movie. For example, the film is based on a book, and if the writer had a homosexual character in it, how did the Hollywood film simply throw a symbolic gay. And besides, there were two gay characters and I thought they were very reflective of each other. One was normal and the other was feminine, but it wasn't up. And Diane Keaton gave an excellent result, and if the other reviewer had the reality of watching the whole movie, they would have seen her character in the film interact with other characters. For example, when he and Adam went to see a car that Sara had crashed in spam, his mother saw a party coming out and later in a movie that saw that he was also invincible. But I think if you're too worried about homosexuals and mistakes, this movie is bad. But if you're more open and I don't really know what's good, you enjoy this movie.
