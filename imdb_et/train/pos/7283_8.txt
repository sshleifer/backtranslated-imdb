I love to buy these cheap, terrible DVDs from Alpha Video. One day I had to buy it. It is the perfect foolish scientific literature of the 50s, all of which is sexual. Filled with an unconscious ALL, with little clad girls and plenty of melodrama, it's an enjoyable movie for those who appreciate things like that. And if you can "stop your belief" enough, you can really stand out - not just with a psychotic head or beating the thing in the closet, but with the character of the "perfect body". . That's it. . . . what is another word mindf *** ing?
