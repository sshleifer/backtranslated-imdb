1930s. Stylish, elegant Adele (played by Debbie Reynolds with an incredible solution) and filthy, frumpy Helen (great Shelley Winters, full of hysterical panache) are two killer mothers. They leave their gentle past in the middle of the West and move to Hollywood to start with the stars of their boys struggling with their dance school. Adele begins to get acquainted with the dashing millionaire Lincoln Palmer (always fine Dennis Weaver). On the other hand, the religious fanatic Helen will soon fall into despair and madness. <br /> <br /> Director Curtis ("Night Tide", "Ruby") Harrington, who works on Henry Farrell's insidious manuscript (who wrote the book "What Happened to Baby Jane?" Hush, the Sweet Charlotte scenario, understands the blame, fear, repression, and dangerous belief of the thriller of a complicated and compelling psychological horror. Superprost has colored roles: Michael MacLiammoir as a pompous teacher, Agnes Moorehead as a stack of fire and sulfur radio, Yvette Vickers, a dirty, scary child, Logan Ramsey, mother's snoopy detective, and Timothy Carey as a horrible dust. Complex talent justification for Pamelyn Ferdin (Lucy's voice "Groundnuts" on television), which is emcee and original "Friday 13". The victim, Robbi Morgan, who impresses the dead Mae West, is sure to be. David Raskin's scary score, a fantastic scene with Reynolds, who performs an amazing tango in a posh restaurant, a delicious atmosphere of a depressive era, Lucien Ballard's beautiful cinematic art, and especially the amazing macabre ending are also excellent and effective in money. MGM presents this terrible pearl on an amazing DVD disc with "Who Longed For Aunt Root?" both pictures are presented with a crisp wide screen with their theater trailers.
