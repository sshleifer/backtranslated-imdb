I have to admit right now, I'm not a big fan of these family movies. Most of them, IMHO, are sentimental nonsense. But, like TOY STORY, the previous Pixar movie, it's a lot of fun. The two main characters were perhaps a bit too blissful (especially when compared to two wires in ANTZ, but otherwise the film is better), but the rest of the movie has done more. The animation seemed great, humor, though broad, was consistently good (I especially liked Hopper's line, "If I hadn't let her mother's pair of her, so I wouldn't kill you, I'd kill you!" all terrible (Denis Leary made an animated movie; what a concept). And like everyone else, I also loved it! I hope the video is new.
