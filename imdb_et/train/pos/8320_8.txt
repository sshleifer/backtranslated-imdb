Farrah Fawcett has spent the better part of his angelic career in confusion, with an occasional remarkable show that has been interrupted between his Playboy folks and the Letterman escorts. But when it comes down, you can't deny that this girl can act. This far-off story of epic dimensions is not a delicate, quiet and occasionally moving TV movie made well. Fawcett plays a black sheep daughter who arrives home to find that she has forgotten the last days of her mother's life, as well as the funeral, a much more stable and more presumably sister. Brad Johnson plays the interest of love, and the story appears with the typical elements of all the drama of the telephony, but there is always something that disturbs Farrah, and he really keeps a close eye on it. (And yes, I testify that I had this Farra poster back on my wall if). Silk Hope gets three and a half stars (five) in Corkymeter. Bosley would be proud.
