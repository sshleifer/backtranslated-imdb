When I first look at the danger of being quietly holy, I have tended to put it in parallel with "the dead Shaun." Now that I look at Simon Pegg as an indisputable comedy genius, I realize that this is a pretty big claim. And to what extent do you agree that the last statement may be a good initial indication of whether you like Fido. <br /> <br /> Just as comedy rises, where Shaun was left out, except for our return to the original 1950s age-old stereotyped small American city. Zombie Wars is over and zombies themselves have become well-adapted, useful community members. This, so we've been informed at the outset, is largely due to Zomcom's good scientific advancements - a beautiful game for romantic comedy? <br /> <br /> The beauty of the movie lies in its dead contribution, which is a respectable neighborhood that preserves its core values ​​while making a place for zombies and special threats. The magic and balance it does with it is perfect. Themes that you might expect from the main layer of comedy come through - a plywood of good clean living, a touch of appearance, a repressed emotion, a confused parental value, a social decoration, and an alienated individual's situation. <br /> <br /> The story of a lucky heart and a wide range of attractiveness that is livened up by the film's all-encompassing strong pain. This is one of those works where it really shows that all involved were excluded. It is also fun to imagine what Billy Connelly is going to have to have a script ... <br /> <br /> So, you can say that you are likely to appreciate the humor of this movie if your dad didn't try to eat you.
