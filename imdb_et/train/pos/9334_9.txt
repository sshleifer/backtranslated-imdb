Sensuous Nurse (1975) was an Italian sex comedy that was played once by Bond girl Ursula Andress. He was hot in this movie. He was stacked and built like a * @ #% brick house. Ursula smoked hot in this movie. I've never seen nursing clothes that were previously filled. <br /> <br /> ms. Andress is a sister who is hired to take care of a rich parent. Even one house seems to boots knocking. One night the nurse decides to take the grandchild's temperature and give some necessary T.L.C. his old customer. The old man takes his sister and it is angry with the rest of the family. What kind of work did he work for the family? Does the geezer fall by his car? How can he deal with the oceanic crowns and the rest of the family? To find out, you need to find SENSUUSUS NURSE! Italian, but poorly English. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
