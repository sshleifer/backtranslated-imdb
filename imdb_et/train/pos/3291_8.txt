It's a great movie and a shame that she doesn't get much attention outside the arthouse circle and the students who stay in the morning to two to watch it in four channels. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but works very efficiently, blurred by child-like fantasy and heavy nightmares. The budget seems rather low, but the credits of the people involved are not shown too often. Nor is it so dated. <br /> <br /> I was lucky when it was kicked off the TV a few years ago, and it has endured half a dozen views. It's one of those movies that doesn't like everyone; Although as usual, those with a more thoughtful approach to the cinema could get a lot out of it. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Buerke puts Anna, a broken brat, well, and it's a shame she seems to have gone out of the actor. The cross is also very good, carrying its character very well in the context of the picture. <br /> <br /> In this movie, some are really (and I am not saying lightly) distracted by moments. half-second shockers and more strained tension. Look at it with the lights! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
