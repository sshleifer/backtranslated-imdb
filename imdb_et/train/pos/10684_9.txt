Watching this early DeMille work, I was once again confirmed that the early DeMille is much better than the late DeMille. His attention to the use of light in scenes is remarkable. His pace is very good, which allows you to talk a lot during the lessons. It is a pity that he was not as intuitive as he seemed to be in his silent films with respect to his audio recording style. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I saw in Cleo Ridgely. He was remarkable, quite restrained and still gave a lot of emotion. <br /> <br /> The end is great.
