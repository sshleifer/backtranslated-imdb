Few films are visible nearly 60 years later, but are still fascinating. Technological advances have not come to this classical love story. The special effects used are significant for the 1946 film. Action is great. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey are doing a great job. Using black and white / color increases the creativity of the film. It has not been seen on television for 20 years, so few people are even aware of its existence. It's my favorite movie all the time. I look forward to and hoping to release this movie DVD for so many years as a "life and death issue".
