The widow's family man, Dan Burns (Steve Carell), writes the "Dan in Real Life" column, which advises the New Jersey standard families and raises his three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Pill), older, just got her driver's license, but Dan doesn't let her drive; Caral (Brittany Robertson) is drunk at her high school mate in Marty; and Lily (Marlene Lawston) leaves her mother away. When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion, he meets Marie in a bookstore (Juliette Binoche) and spends her hours talking to each other. They feel attracted to each other, but Marie gets a phone call and leaves Dan, giving her a phone number. Dan loves Marie right now, but when he returns to his parent's home, he finds Marie to be a girlfriend of her wolf brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also in love with her. The fascinating attraction between Dan and Marie increases over the weekend and they have to decide. <br /> <br /> "Dan in Real Life" is a great surprise and delightful film of comedy, romance and drama. The gorgeous chemistry of Juliette Binoche and Steve Carelli is fantastic and it's very easy to know why everyone loves Marie. Trio Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston are fantastic and their characters are responsible for the best moments of this story. The scenario is wonderful and the performances of talented actors and actors are stunning, with realistic behavior of the family event. Follow Dan's advice and plan to surprise the family reunion of Burns. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Eu, Meu Irm√£o e Nossa Namorada" ("Me, My Brother and Girlfriend")
