This film is a true reflection of Australia's ingenuity that is needed to make this country the last 200 years. Not pompous like British, not Gung-Ho like Americans. If one of these countries had tried to do this, it would have failed. Whether due to ignorance of the British part or too much faith in the higher fire power on the American side. "True" Australians (ie non-import) are the only ones who can stand out in modern military conflicts because they have had to improvise the lives of most of their adults. Just look at examples like Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
