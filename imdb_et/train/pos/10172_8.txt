Friz Freleng's "Rumors" is an excellent private Snafu comic that warns against the spread of panic-rumors during the war. Like all Snafu short pants shown to military audiences as entertainment movies, "Rumors" are extremely imaginative and good ideas for their very short life span. When Snafu begins to declare a bomb attack, it will finally rumor that America has lost its war. This is perfectly illustrated by the long, haunting balm and a number of strange, fictional creatures who come back to haunt Snafu, gaining more and more terrible news about their country's army. "Rumors" are inventive, fast paced and funny, all of which help to hide labor-intensive, "military" messages. It stands one of the best in one of the Snafu private short pants.
