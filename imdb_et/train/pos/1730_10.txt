This quiet silent gem speaks of a true story of escaping during World War II. Performances are incredible, especially Anthony Steele. The film works on many different levels: brain, emotional, visual and grammatical. The dialogue is brilliant and the rings are very real. In fact, unusual all-inclusive authenticity puts this one on the head and shoulders over most warriors.
