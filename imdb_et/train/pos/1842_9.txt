Series 2 has started great! I don't think you need to follow the first series to understand what happens, but like all the series, it's nice to know some characters and take care of what happens to them. And this exhibition makes you think so! These 4-30 women seem to be leading a fascinating and exciting life, but the premise is plausible and realistic. So their revolutions due to their love and sex life are exciting, but you also know that these are the problems that also happen to real women. How we make decisions about what women do, and how sometimes we are led in our lives on certain roads, instead of knowingly making those choices!
