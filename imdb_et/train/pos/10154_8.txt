This is the first Michael Vartan movie I've ever seen - I haven't seen Alias ​​and I was curious to see if a man can act. He is sure that this movie is pleasant. Natasha Henstridge is of course great, but he usually has more physical and operational roles, so I found him very good and lovable in terms of his different "sweet" role. Some of the negative comments I read are true, the film is full of clichés and the story doesn't really speak at all. Also, although each movie's sign shows how good they are, I don't think there's a chemistry there. But I enjoyed this movie. The local areas are nice, the characters are nice and good eyesight and supporters are pretty good. If you are expecting great romance, this is not it. But if you want to see a nice innocent good-looking movie with nice characters, that's great.
