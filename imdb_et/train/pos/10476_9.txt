My first contact with "Whale Music" was the same album as Rheostat, which I bought in about 1993. I read liner notes and the band said that the album, which is a prominent place in my collection, is inspired by the Canadian author Paul Quarrington's book. <br /> <br /> I took the book a few months later and ate it! Amazing reading! Since then, the book has been read repeatedly, each time I found a new element for Desmond and his desire to complete whale music. <br /> <br /> I found a movie in 1996, on a video. I don't have a lot of good experience with Canadian film, but it worked for me. Claire's role could have been thrown in a different way, but in general I think Paul Quarrington's vision was nicely displayed on the screen. <br /> <br /> Maury Chaykin provides mobile performance as an isolated genius. The film deals with family relationships, love and someone who understands. I strongly recommend "Whale Music" not only to music fans but also to anyone who has lost or lost someone, and tried to find their way back into the world.
