I was a youth who knew a lot about the prince, but in recent years I have seen a lot of Purple Rain Novelty Tea and I thought they were cool, but I didn't want to buy a shirt that I didn't know anything about. So one Saturday came to fuse and decided to watch it. I didn't know what the movie was like before I watched it, but it was great when I found out. In the film, the prince was not known as a prince but a "child". All the performances that were great for me, but my favorite was Purple Rain, Darling Nick and I would die for you. All the songs related to the movie when his mother and father always fought for the song when the doves shouted what he felt. I also like how the wise prince was flirting with Apallonia. I liked it when Prince and Appallonia first met in the club and stood behind him and when he turned around he disappeared! great movie and now i can't even find one of these t-shirts (
