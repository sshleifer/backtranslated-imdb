I was drawn to this movie about four years ago by a French actress friend. I hate myself and even hate French actress. And then ... <br /> <br /> I don't know what happened, but I was pulled out of the movie for years. And that was despite the fact that one of the projectors broke and they had to make each transition manually. I was in the theater for nearly four hours, but it was worth it. I believe that great movies will draw you into the world, make you part of it and then shoot you down to talk to your friends about coffee or drink. That movie did it. It was one of the best movie experiences I've ever had. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
