Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, a daughter-in-law of the newspapers and devoted to one of the three girls. In a large family, where he arrives at home, Dan meets his perfect wife to find out that he is with his brother. <br /> <br /> What is a man? <br /> <br /> "Dan In Real Life," but I imagine that the success of this flick is whether you are willing to accept Steve Carell playing a part that is relatively straight and restrained. he made it so successful. If you can't accept it, don't be afraid, "Get Smart" will be at the beginning of the year, but for the record I thought he was very good. <br /> <br /> Dan In Real Life begins as your typical, casual, fun, family drama, but it gets more fun and funny than it goes and Carelli's disappointment with his situation is growing. This is not a tremendously original (but if you only saw movies with original ideas, the cinematographic election would be really small, right?), But "Dan In Real Life" is fun and good cast (who wouldn't fall in love with Juliette Binoche, who envisioned at first sight ?) Do not use a sufficiently understandable script that contains a lot of reflection about the meaning and passion of love. <br /> <br /> I hope Steve Carell will push himself and make something so interesting.
