I thought it was really good for the first episode of the first series. It was really fun and I thought the actors were great. I think this is a crime when someone says it was bad because it seemed the right time. I find it really annoying when people say it was not historically correct because it should be Saturday night entertainment, which is not a boring history documentary, so I think the costumes and settings were right. A great start and I love what follows! I've talked to many people in my school and they love this example! we all think it is great entertainment and it comes with great stories.
