I saw this movie for the first time and I liked it. His dancing was very fun. I read somewhere that he was part of this film because he knew how to dance. The terrain was also great. Yvonne is such a talented woman and beautiful. We laughed in foolish kisses, but it's great for old movies. I grew up with The Munsters and I enjoy her in her earlier films. They may not all be the best there, but still worth seeing and singing. I slowly buy all my movies and watch them when I receive them. I have a large collection of monuments.
