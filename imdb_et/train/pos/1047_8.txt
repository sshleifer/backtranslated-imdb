It may (or may not) be interesting to note that the only reason I first checked this movie was because I wanted to see the man who beat Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA (10/10 role Best Actor Oscar still giving the Oscar a bike, but Paul Lukas did at least a good job and deserves at least a candidate.) Well, I'm glad I checked this movie because I enjoyed it enormously. I don't think the film preached a little, but not just mind I enjoyed the calls and were never bored with them. <br /> <br /> This movie was impressive, Lucile Watson (rightly a candidate for the Oscar), Bette Davis (not the wrong candidate), George Coulouris and strange, Eric Roberts he just breaks me, even the character name (Bodo) is funny. <br /> <br /> g, where Lukas was forced to do something he thought was wrong, even though he did it for all the right reasons for me. I agreed why he felt he had what he did, and I realized why he couldn't explain it completely. The message that this film does is good and noble, the landscape (that is, the house) is beautiful and the actor is great. Watch this movie if you ever have a chance. <br /> <br /> 9/10
