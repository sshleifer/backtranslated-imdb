This movie is great! Brad Pitt will never be able to perform in this film. Duchovny was the upper limit, like Forbes and Lewis. The 4 main characters begin the scenic journey of historic murder sites in one of the coolest cars ever made, the 1960 model Lincoln Continental. Early Grace has a simple and tasty dry toothbrush and carnage. She loves her women so they don't smoke and smoke and wear PWT dresses. Duchovny and Forbes are a couple of artists from the city, while Early and Lewis are trailer parks near the countryside. While most of the tone is in the film, there are many funny scenes. Writing, leadership and acting are brilliant. If you like movies, murders, humor and stories, check out this movie. Everyone offers, and you want more credits in rolls. One of my all-time favorites. "hey ... shave this dog n teach!"
