This movie is bufoonery! and i loved it! "The Lord of the Dragon" (Jacky Chan) and his friend "Cowboy" made the movie fun, meaningful and just stupid. The film is a rare mix of good and evil struggles and (somehow) growing miracles and fun. Long Shao Ye takes the viewer through the "dragon master" of young people (so-called because he is the son of a rich family) in daily activities and "cowboy", which includes smart, complex ways to avoid (including) learning. the whole household, including the instructor), competing rather in the guy (and idiotically interesting) ways to win a local girl, competing with "football" (see what I mean) and the list goes on. Somehow they find themselves fighting to save valuable antiques and the lives of several people. <br /> <br /> The film has serious moments. But they do not push, but rather inspire. The boys' playfulness is not lost in this shift, but is actually against evil. What I really love about this movie is how it ends. Not a typical confrontation (which was fantastic in itself) but well. Let me just say that it really captures the spirit of the movie. <br /> <br /> Foolish, witty, meaningful and nostalgic. great movie.
