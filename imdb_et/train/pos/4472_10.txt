From the very beginning you can see that "Anchors Aweigh" is a great comedy. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a funny team! The songs they sing together are pure entertainment. Kathryn Grayson is proud and really sweet. Dean Stockwell is the most childish actor I've ever seen. If you like a piano, you will be surprised by Jos√© Iturb. This film was the first to combine animation with real actors and make it a great unforgettable dance number. Undoubtedly one of Kelly's funniest movies.
