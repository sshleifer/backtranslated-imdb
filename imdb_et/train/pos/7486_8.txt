I would really like to go late for some reason for this movie, but I want to touch on why I don't think people like it. First there are people who want to hate Tom Cruise. I don't really understand that. Secondly, Cameron Crowe I think this movie has been successfully two movie visitors. A casual, relaxed, "unwilling to think too hard" group of visitors to the film will be confused when the plot takes full 180 at the end of the film. And deep, philosophical, mysterious fans are devastated when Crowe has one of his characters that fully understands the secret. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie. And Tom Cruise is doing a great job in that. I think this is probably his best result of what I've seen, even though I haven't seen all of his films or even most of them probably. Also supporting cast is good. Penelope Cruz gives a solid result and Jason Lee was enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I like this story and I think it's Vanilla Sky more than anything. It's a mystery, an adventure and a romantic comedy, but it's usually just a good story. And it has many philosophical foundations and many similar ideas and stories as in historical philosophy. David Aames (Cruise) is a person who had everything he wanted, more or less lost, he was given a second chance to try to restore everything back and finally to his demons and to the extent of all this. chooses reality, simplicity, and normality to see if he can finally find one thing he never got: happiness. <br /> <br /> Many people were disappointed that Crowe created the whole secret at the end. I think it's necessary. Then the viewer questions whether David is aware of his circumstances and makes it even more powerful at the end of the choice. <br /> <br /> The music in the movie is great. This probably makes the movie as enjoyable as it is. Especially Sigur Ros "Njosnavelin", which is an amazing song. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'd give him 3 out of 4 stars. This is a movie that has some content for those who want to think about things and a great story for those who want to relax. This "moderate" approach is probably why people do not want it so much because it is not a full blown mystery or a full blown love story. It mixes and fits with different elements and genres.
