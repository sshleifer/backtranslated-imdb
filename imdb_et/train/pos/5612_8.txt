In Paris, the shy and insecure bureaucrat Trelkovsky (Rome Polanski) rents an apartment with an old bathroom, where the previous tenant, Egyptian Simone Choule (Dominique Poulange) committed suicide. The friendly concierge (Shelley Winters) and the harsh landlord Zy (Melvyn Douglas) impose strict rules of conduct, and Trekovsky feels surrounded by neighbors. Meanwhile, he visits Simone Hospital and interacts with his girlfriend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). After Simone's death, Trekovsky feels obsessed with her and believes that her landlord and neighbors are drawing a scheme to force her to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> The strange "Le Locataire" is a disturbing and creepy story about paranoia and fraud. The single story of Trelkovsky and the process of disappearing madness and identity is slowly evolving in the atmosphere of the dreadful place of his apartment and what is happening is completely unpredictable. The performances are fantastic and Isabelle Adjani is very beautiful. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Inquilino" ("Tenant")
