I found this exhibition very late in the evening and tried it. This is a refreshing change from the other things shown late at night when you try your drift. The simplicity of its values ​​and the sweetness of the hearts remind me of how friendships were with children. This is something I promise when I find it (which is rare, maybe I should actually check the lists! Haha) ..... and the tensions between Joe and Nick are so cute. Like any good chick flick, you get really emotionally in cartoon characters. Good ol 'Louisa May Alcott is still inspiring good stories :) So I think my opinion is valid so I should complete 10 lines of text so I think I'll tell you a little more. The gifted actors and actors play the children and the settings are beautiful and natural - another thing not seen on television. Hope everyone gives it off. I know and I am fully aware that it is cute, but it is a good heart. As I said earlier, it is refreshing.
