Spirit: The Cimarron slave is a general wonderful film. Blending animation types is unique, the story is amazing and music is great. <br /> <br /> Drawn animation is a special thing for many animations. Particularly prominent is how they expressed their character, especially the horses. Although it is easy to understand how horses communicate with body language, many young children and people who have not learned horses may not understand. Without words, I would imagine that it would be difficult to publish them through their qualities. That's why I understand the "eyebrows" they added to the horses (while the real horses do not have these thick lines). One of the few things I noticed about the habits of horses that could have been strangely portrayed is that the Spirit directs her mother's herd. In the wild horse herds, the guiding root usually guides the young ones. <br /> <br /> Also, some people may think that portraying white army officers as "bad" is stereotyping, thinking of all the movies, it is depicted by Indians. Sometimes back; they treated blackheads very badly. For example, in real history, the Appaloosa breed was destroyed by military officers. Imagine what would have happened to one of the world's most beloved riding breeds if the Indians hadn't saved them. <br /> <br /> I think it's amazing how realism was not divorced by changing the horses. A bit of narrative expressed the feelings of the Spirit, but mostly through music (Bryan Adams). The songs are really good, Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams did a great job of talking about melodies and songs. <br /> <br /> When you look at the film, you have an emotion, either for the first time or in the twentieth (Yes, I've been watching it a lot), you wouldn't believe it. Some scenes take their breath away, while others seem to force the eyes to tears. The opening order, which shows the homeland of the Spirit, will take you immediately to prominent action. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why some people are so hateful of this brilliant movie. Overall I appreciate this 10/10 - a must watch.
