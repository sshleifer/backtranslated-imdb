But the rest of us who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to cry you ... enjoy! <br /> <br /> Tom Hulce is great, like Dominick, a spiritually slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother Eugene, who is played by Ray Liotta, a doctor and who works very long hours. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Eugene's work schedule, Dominick alone has a lot of time and tends to make questionable decisions. He just wants to be a good boy, do the right thing and make his brother proud. She stops in the church to pray at one point and express her emotions so openly and so well that the sign you cry before the damn film even really begins. <br /> <br /> Nothing to give away here, but the movie is very inclusive and sad and a heartbeat. For those who are not afraid of these things, this is a beautiful story, its loving characters and a wonderful song that I can't say here, which has nothing to do with the film at all, but it is strangely relevant, but you hear it at the bar I thought Tom Hulce is called for this movie, because he was for "Amadeus" what I thought it could give him an inner runway to actually win. There is no such happiness. Liotta is just as good, but has less emotional effect, but later he does it. About Jamie Lee Curtis, he does not have much of it here, but it was nice that he gave him the name of a little drama that has been put in Pittsburgh about two brothers you will never forget.
