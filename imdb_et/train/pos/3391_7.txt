As with all 1970s environmentally friendly films, SOYLENT GREEN has a rather cheesy outline of the ecological collapse. Overcrowding means that there are too many people to feed? I had the impression that the famine was caused by either war or failed economic policy. Stalin's policy in the Soviet Union in the 1930s left millions in death due to famine and today was the biggest man-made tragedy in Mao's rural policy in China, which led to the deaths of over 30 million in the 1950s. Let us not forget the great famine in the Horn of Africa in the 1980s and 90s, related to conflicts that are not overcrowding. You might also think that two of the most densely populated areas on Earth, Hong Kong and Macao have never been hungry today. Similarly, urban sprawl in cities, as viewed here, is not strictly overcrowded - it is related to economic factors where people find a better job in towns than in the countryside (a symptom of industrial development - not too many deliveries) that a picture of New York's streets that are too overwhelmed To walk and sleep in people in the stairwells is somewhat ridiculous, but don't be fooled into thinking SOYLENT GREEN is a bunch of fur tree hugging crap because I think it's the best ecological film in the 70s. He knows the desperate audience of the world where Sol and Thorn are delighted to find fruit, brand and fresh meat. Thorn complains that he has whiskey on ice, cigarette flies and offers a classic line "If I could afford it, I smoke two, maybe three of them a day". But this is a visual euthanasia chamber that is memorable as Thorn's look at wildlife, flowers, running water, and snow-covered mountains, the world of Thorn's generation is never known. This is a very haunting scene that makes SOYLENT GREEN a very memorable movie, with the fact that it includes Edward G Robinson's final screen appearance with the smart Old Jewish Sol Roth.
