I like this movie. I can check it regularly and not the tire. I think this is one of my excellent movie criteria. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. It introduces us to 6 characters; each has a unique kung fu style that is very secretive and very deadly. All these symbols are trained by the same master, but their identities are kept secret. The dying captain sends the sixth poison, his last pupil, to try to do the wrong things he suspects some of his students have committed. <br /> <br /> How does the last pupil get other poisons? How does he know which one is bad? The way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great. <br /> <br /> We also see that the poisons are fighting in each combination. It's fun to see how their styles fit each other. <br /> <br /> If you want to see if you like kung fu movies, this is a good movie. It doesn't get better than that.
