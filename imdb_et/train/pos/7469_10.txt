This film was just absolutely brilliant. It made me think. Throughout the film I was confused by the confusion. I loved it all ... it was just so confusing and so complicated and weird, it was hard not to love. All the actors were phenomenal, and no one would have been able to do a better job ... This is one of my favorites ... it deserves a scarf.
