Although I do not generally like remakes for believing that remakes are a waste of time; this movie is an exception. I didn't know until I read the previous comment that it was a remake, so my opinion is just a real movie and not a comparison. <br /> <br /> The story and the way it is written. There is no question: it's Capote. No more words needed. <br /> <br /> The game by Anthony Edwards and Eric Robert is great. I've seen some movies with them. I was sure they were good actors and, with Eric, I always thought why her sister is number 1 famous star and not her brother. This time this certainty is raised, it is not a question. His game, as well as Mr Edward's game, is clearly the top of his profession. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to your top 50 movies to see and keep on your DVD shelves.
