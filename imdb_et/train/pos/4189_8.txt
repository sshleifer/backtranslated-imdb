Richard Widmark is a badge in this movie. He's a professional pocket-pocket. He has been in prison three times, but at the beginning of the movie he tries to make it four. Thelma Ritter is a busy body that sells information to almost everyone. Jean Peters is amazing as a girl fluttered by Widmark. It is unusual for this movie that Peters & Ritter are both victims of violent beating in an age when women were rarely more than sex spots in movies. This makes this film a poignant, because women often have different roles in this type of film. . Sets indicate that this is a limited budget movie. The script made J Edgar Hoover crazy because patriotism is given a short shot. Hoover wanted to change it.
