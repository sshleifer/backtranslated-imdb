Another item in the "Holiday Horror" category that fills the shelves of the local video store. * Spoiler * "Wealthy runny nose, who vengeance" cool "kids who misunderstood him" plot is of course familiar to those who have been watching it before. And those who saw it before will probably look at it again; Those who wait for Ingmar Bergman and then get angry after their wasted time should just skip it. Marilyn Manson's soundtrack and David Boreanaz, Denise Richards and Katherine Heigl like eye candy - go with the flow and enjoy it. Oh, and I loved the horrible mask.
