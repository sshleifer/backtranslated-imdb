Hello Dave Burning Paradise is a movie for anyone who likes Jackie Chan and Indiana Jones. The main protagonist of the films is definitely the bastard of these two strange fathers. For other characters, they are also familiar changes in stereotypes of similar films. If this film is original, it is combined with the traditional Hong Kong movie style Hollywood adventure. Unfortunately, this is not true for movies made in Hollywood.
