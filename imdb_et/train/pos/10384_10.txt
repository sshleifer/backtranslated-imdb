Almost 30 years later, I almost remember this original PBS movie with intolerance. I regularly check in IMDb, hoping that someone has the right to buy rights and put it on a DVD. It's September 2004 and I hope - deep sigh. One of the two leading players went to a small career mainly for the first time in a soap dinner; another, Frances Lee McCain, was here and there for a few years in small roles. But something that they didn't do before or after was matched by this little film, which I created, as I remember, in a short-lived PBS series that introduced the new and future scenario scenarios of dramatists. <br /> <br /> I watched it every time it was shown in PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times. It was before the VCR era, so I have nothing to do except my eyes. <br /> <br /> 12/31/2006 In addition to the above: Good New Year, ladies! This great movie is finally available on the ladyslipper.org DVD. It is my understanding that DVDs are burned from the writer's personal copy.
