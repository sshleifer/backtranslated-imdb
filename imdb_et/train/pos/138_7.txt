I don't understand why other comments focus on McConaughey. He has never been a very interesting filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is writing and common sense. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw make unusual comics, certainly not stock types. Although it cannot be said that their characters are well developed, they do not make them less fun. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was in HDNET and subtitles for Spanish dialogue, so it was definitely not a problem. Using Spanish means more authenticity. <br /> <br /> A very underrated movie, which is used to judge an IMDb member with an unusually low score, has given it. I thought it was fun and interesting and at least 7 years old. A lot of shiny films with higher scores and big money in the office are much less interesting.
