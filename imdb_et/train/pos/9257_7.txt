Is it your typical women naval transport love story? Perhaps, hell, you know how the formula works now, a beautiful woman is introduced to the picture, someone has to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> I think this movie follows a typical story, but it doesn't speak anything about the content. Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper and Gary Busey have great scenes, though they are short. Some things did not make sense, such as the need to get into casual struggles, but it is fun to watch, the struggles were actually well done. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a comedy, but it has a lot of good feelings. Humor is well balanced, you don't hurt it, but keep a smile. <br /> <br /> Here's a bit of steamy action, so no kids.
