OK, let's get it clear. I'm not really sci-fi, but for some reason I love the Stargate SG-1. Jack O'Neil takes his team SG-1 through the Stargate. A circular device that creates a wormhole. This gives you the opportunity to travel to more distant worlds. It may seem like your usual sci-fi series, but that's not! The plot is not in the distant millennium today, like many other sci-fi series. I find it great. It gives you things, events, and things you can associate with, and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn all the new gadgets and terms. Of course they have, but thanks to O'Neil, who loves simple terminology, there is not much. <br /> <br /> The series has a pleasant action, humor and drama. If you like many special effects, you won't find it here. They do not use a lot of bad but limited parts of well-done special effects.
