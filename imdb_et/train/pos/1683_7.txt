I saw this movie because it was the second album that contained previously banned Video Nasty 'Blood Rites. Because blood rituals were terribly terrible, I didn't expect much from this movie; But in fact, the garbage candidate Andy Milligan seems to have crossed the Blue Blue at that time with style style, and stands tall as more than enough to use the sixties of the sick. The plot is actually quite similar to bloodshed when we focus on a dysfunctional family and of course; at stake is legacy. The film is filmed in black and white, and its appearance and reminiscence reminded me of the trash classic "The Curious Dr Humpp". There is hardly any gore on the screen, and the director seems to be more focused on the gender of incest and hate. Action is usually dirty, but most women are naked at some point naked, and despite the bad reputation, director Andy Milligan actually looks like this, because many of the sequences in this movie are actually pretty beautiful. The plot is paper thin and most of the film is filler; but the music is memorable, and the director also does a surprisingly good job with sexual scenes because most of them are erotic. In general, this is not a great film; but it is likely to turn to a cult fan and get a much higher recommendation than a better-known and lower quality "bloodshed".
