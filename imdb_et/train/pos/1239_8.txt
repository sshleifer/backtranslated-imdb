I think the movie was pretty good, adding it to all of its "classic collection". I believe I saw other posters that reminded some selective people that it's still a movie. Perhaps some esoteric points fail to "logic", but many religious issues accepted in faith cannot pass the odor test. If you intend to accept any faith you are ordering, you can definitely receive the movie. Is it just me or has anyone else noticed that Aja-Yee Dagger is the same possession knife Lamonte Cranston had so many problems to get control of "Shadow". Not mentioned in the trivia section of either movie (IMDB), but I would put the dollar on a ring to make it the same proportion.
