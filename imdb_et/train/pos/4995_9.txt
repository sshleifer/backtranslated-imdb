I don't think most of us tend to act on the concept of "must-see", but I was very impressed with how good this film was and it serves a "must-see" temple for me. <Br /> <br /> Mandy, played by Shannon Lee (late and great Bruce Lee's daughter and late Brandon Lee's sister), has been recruited by Martin, who is a professional thief to help attack diamond heritage at the Crime Syndicate Museum and receive it fee. They know little that another pair of thieves (Lucy and Tommy, a couple of lovebirds), who Mandy and Martin had previously agreed on, are also planning to steal the diamond. <br /> <br /> How do each pair of thieves dismiss the plan? Things go awry, as Martin and Mandy go unknowingly behind Lucy and Tommy. <br /> <br /> You will find yourself rooting for these thieves because they find they need eleven crimes to survive in the syndicate, not at all satisfied that the diamond is not in their hands. <br /> <br /> Action fans do not have to be disappointed because there are healthy weapons at battles, martial arts, and manually fighting doses Surprisingly, this is not just the movie that carries this movie, but romance and laughs (and I don't mean that your typical one-time prisoners are spreading in the action movie that steals <br /> <br /> It is not easy to root into evil, but we see the human side and chemistry of their thieves they are developing. <br /> <br /> Great movie and one NOT miss! <br /> <br /> 9 out of ten
