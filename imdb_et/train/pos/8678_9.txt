Butch Peacemaker? Obviously. After the violent start that began with Spike, Tom and Jerry all turned to each other, Butch calls to stop and wants to know why. This is a good question. <br /> <br /> "Cats can meet dogs, don't they?" he asks Tom who agrees with this head. "Mice get with cats, right?" Jerry nods "no" and then sees that this is not the right answer. <br /> <br /> They go in and Butch draws a "peace treaty" (with professional art!). Most of the rest and much of the comic are the ones that are extremely nice to each other. With a refreshing pace of change. I found it nice to look. I can get millions of these cartoons, where every shot is over the head. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you knew that peace didn't last. A big piece of steak indicates the death of a "peace treaty", but it was a nice change on the journey and still had the usual Tom & Jerry smart humor.
