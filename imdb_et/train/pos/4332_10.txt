Paul Reiser did a great job of writing this film. Peter Falk gives his life. It's worth the Academy Award. It was one of the toughest and most funny movies of the year. The traveler's mind is awesome and he's as good as he can and when he was "Mad about You" for his long TV sitcom. Peter Falk did his father's masterpiece and Peter, who is now 78, made us laugh and cry at the same time. The supportive majority was equal to the task, especially with the gorgeous gorgeous Elizabeth Perkins. It is a must see film of 2005. We contribute that everyone in every age and religion loves this film and somehow associates it in one way or another. We have such mothers and fathers and siblings in the film. We all have good and bad times, and we want things to be the same but different.
