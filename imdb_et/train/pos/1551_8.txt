It seems strange that a complete dreck like "Hazzard Dukes" and "The Hills Have Eyes" (new version) can find DVD distributors, while the older - and much higher works like this movie - can not be found anywhere. With all the ongoing discussions about the morale of warfare (or its absence) and espionage (see several Jack Ryan, Bourne, XXX, and "Mission: Impossible" productions), it seems to be an obvious choice True, it looks like a 1968 film because it is 1968. movie, but disregarding style, it's still a production that has something really valuable to say and has lots of parcels to keep the audience entertained If anything else, SOMEBODY please consider getting a soundtrack on some CD, be it compromise with other Morricone music or as an independent. tell us about your products, but if you read this and other reviews, take us seriously, we will pay for our rich homes where our hard earned dollars are spent on tickets, DVDs and CDs - let us know what we want! If you read it and have not seen this movie, it would lobby for its release so you can see what those of us who have seen it. You don't have to be disappointed.
