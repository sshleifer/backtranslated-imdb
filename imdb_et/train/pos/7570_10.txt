I recently bought a very underestimated DreamCast and went to town to find these games to use. I bought Soul Caliburi (classic) and then took over the domain of Resident Evil Code Veronica. I have Resident Evil 1 & 2, and I've played Res Evil 3 times, and I have all impressed them, especially No. 1, which has to go in history, is classic. <br /> <br /> But none of them 3 comes close to Brilliant Gory Gameplay's dream experiment. If it's just for the purpose of buying dreams for this game, your time and effort is worth every moment, ive never been so attractive to a computer game as it has tempted me. <br /> <br /> In any case, the story continues from the 2nd reading, in which Claire Redfield is looking for her brother (Chris - Story 1), who is expected to be under conspiracy of lost worship. Little is known about this corporation, except that you destroyed them 3 times in the previous shadows. <br /> <br /> So, by helping Clairet with super-brat Steve help, you need to open the true truth of your brother's location. The second CD allows you to control Chris, that is, if you manage to get so far out of the room, you won't get out of fear. <br /> <br /> Leadership is very slippery and character movement is superbly realistic, if the sign threatens, it faces the direction from which it arrives. PURE GENIUS !! <br /> <br /> Generally, I gave this game a bit because it is just a year's game, a decade game and the best game in the world! Please buy this game as soon as possible.
