I can't quite understand why some "reviewer" gave it to documentary "0" other than for political reasons. No, the film did not examine both the "side" of the story, but then one of the films adopted for Chavez against the rise of propaganda against him would certainly be an attempt to balance the narrative in general (especially given A. History). CIA participation in Latin America for fermentation of civilian archives and B. coverage of obviously counterfeit scenes from this country and other supporters of Chavez, photographing non-existent opponents). The most striking thing about this film is that the filmmakers stayed in the Presidential Palace for all kinds of coups - definitely the first documentary - pictures of the coup from both sides !!!
