As incredibly seems, the Gojoe anime and Hong Kong-inspired samurai action flick with pacifistic message. This film's ankle effectively depicts the protagonist (the work done by Daisuke Ryu with great effect), the killer-turned-boddhist-monk Benkei. Benkei has sworn to never kill again, but he still takes the sword to fight what he thinks is the demon invasion ... <br /> <br /> Gojoe is a movie that is hard to gauge. It is a visual imagery that is amazingly designed and beautiful, but it uses too much trickery (camera and fast drive, expressionist frames, colors, digital effects, etc.), so the end result is somewhat tiring. This means that the beginning and end of the film is as elegant as powerful. If only Director Sogo Ishii had been wise enough not to use his trick bag. <br /> <br /> Another problem with Gojo is the amount of violence. For such a violent movie, Gojoe spends too much energy and time on the screen to portray endless scenes of battle. Also, the way violence is shown is always self-conscious; In fact, a blood shower against the night sky seems to be one of the signatures of the film's signature. Fortunately, Ishii is smart enough to show the ugly and tragic side of violence. However, it seems that Ishii is not sure whether he is making a traditional feature film or a deeply moral allegory. The audience cannot be sure of it before the end of the movie. The powerful (albeit cynical) ending is the salvation of the Gojo; it clearly emphasizes that this film is more than just a gore-fest.
