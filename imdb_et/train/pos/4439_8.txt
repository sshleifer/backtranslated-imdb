Most sold horror writer Cheryl (lovely Virginia Bryant strong and sympathetic performance), her husband Tom (pleasant Paolo Serra) and their son Bobby (nicely played by Patrizio Vinci) go to a distant city that is in the countryside. summer holidays. The local legend says the area is cursed. In the basement, Cheryl discovers a terrible, hairy, nasty ogre (glowing David Flos, in a strange costume). Cheryl must overcome his deep-seated beast to be defeated. Director / co-author Lamberto Bava is working hard to create and maintain a shameful and irritating mood. What's more, Bava renounces the usual routine of blood rhythm, which is intended to produce compelling and provocative dark adult fairy tales, how the best way to intimidate us that scares us is with this source head. Sabrina Ferilli is supported by strong moves as a friendly school teacher as Anna, Stefania Montors' female sitter, Maria and Alex Serra batty painter. Gianfranco Transunto's glossy cinematography offers some fluid tracking shots and great atmospheric lighting. Fabrizio Sforza gnarly make-up f / x, Simon Boswell's superb spooky'n'shuddery score, and a dark, dark, twilight-covered basement that all hit the skin on the indexing spot. Worth a look.
