Pride's father was the best new show that hit TV from Family Guy. It was another masterpiece of talented people in Dreamworks Animation. Like The Simpsons, the centers show the nuclear family (in this case the white lions). It also includes many memorable supporters, including Roger, orangutan, Vincent, Italian-American flamingo, eccentric white tigers Blake and Victoria, faux patriotic Snout Brothers, and elephant Chutney. Other stars of the exhibition are Sigfreid and Roy. They are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a magnificent way, making everyday activities entertaining. The cute combination of animal characters with very adult dialogue and controversial issues (drugs, prejudices, etc.) is a source of shine for the program. <br /> <br /> The failure of this exhibition is due to NBC. They decided not to distribute the episodes in any particular order (perhaps the guest letters they could promote), rather than a more logical production order. How many times was this show a half-hour dreck like The Biggest Loser (if 60 minutes wasn't enough)! In fact, television has failed for the future of art, if the original and bold display in this case fails, while the fear factor and American Idol dominate. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, a whole series of DVDs and exhibitions have now been released to give them a bigger chance. 10/10
