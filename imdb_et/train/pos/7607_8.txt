It's not well photographed, well-written, or well-functioning, but it must be the most addictive show I've seen since Twin Peaks. Every revelation is timed so well that you need to see the next episode to get any closure. They have even slowed down the pace of the show, where they only released small amounts of episodes, but they seem to have told you exactly what you want to know. But some of the actors are almost terrible and some dentists are cruel. Some characters are very two-dimensional. More advanced actors like Locke and Ecko really stand out with actors who play Jack, Kate, Sayid, and so on. The development of the exhibition may also be very frustrating as the next episode may not show what the previous episode was leading. Irritating side plates have become a part of the story that sometimes doesn't tell you anything. But the second season has been so far away that the stories return more to the island than before. All in all, this is a great show, but not perfect.
