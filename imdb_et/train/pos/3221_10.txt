The film makes a number of references to the fine Blade runner, but one of the most obvious is that Cain 607 and his unit are all genetic constructs, the breed being the consuming warriors. But if my favorite reference is from the movie, "you should have made them both smart and fast". Kurt Russell did an incredible job, his facial expressions or the lack of films gave way more to the story than the rest was combined. Even if he falls in love with Sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions, and his tears after being expelled or despised when he is hugged, and his detention to a young boy who in many ways reminded Todd himself and what he could have not that his choice would be a soldier.
