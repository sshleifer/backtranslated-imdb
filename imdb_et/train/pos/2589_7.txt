Psychokinetic powers (yes, really) Brothers are not only for Debra Winger's beliefs, but really for the mystery of their childhood, which left them in conflict with their authority. <br /> <br /> There is a surreal touch (a firefighter that acts like a singing Greek choir), but there is also humor, reason and romance. The soundtrack is also great. And just like the American werewolf in London used every big Wolf song, they could get it, but with the fire and I don't think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), setting his own trailer as rockin 'He's a lady ~ priceless ;) <br /> <br /> The best missing line in the quotes section btw ~ 'If you have a clown, you'll never go back!' <br /> <br /> I love this movie (I just subscribed to DVD from the US) and if the comments written by people who would be more legitimate with blonde 3, don't put you out ~ try :)
