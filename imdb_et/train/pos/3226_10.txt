I don't remember this movie to get a cinema here. I only saw it when it came over the cable. The film discusses the dehumanization of children as killers. Specifically, one person, the way he replaces and is dipped (literally) into a world-wide community where he cannot cope with someone who actually agrees with who he really is and what he feels. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that many people thought it was Rambo in space and would have been happy if it were. <br /> <br /> I'm definitely happy that it wasn't - Kurt does a good job of depicting emotional exhaustion. The scene in which he sits outside the compound shows this, although the decision on two slow repeats decreases from the moment. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic SF movie, just as Bladerunner, Alien, Silent running Logan or THX1138 were unfortunately the closest I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> He changes the movie credibly, he may not be arnie against one liner, he does not turn into Snake Plissken and has no definite happy ending. <br /> <br /> That's why the movie didn't work well. It did not follow the formula, and among the 18-25-year-old target group it is unforgivable because it was not what they expected. <br /> <br /> Fear and Discipline. <br /> <br /> Always.
