T'Pol is transforming the Company's sensors to observe Suliban's spacecraft until it reaches the Riger X planet. They study and disclose that Klaang was a courier, giving an important message about the temporary Cold War from Suliban Sarin to the Klingon leaders. Kronos. <br /> <br /> Despite the big fan of Star Trek, I haven't been following "Enterprise" episodes on cable television. I've decided to buy the first season DVD box and this first episode surprised me. The first company adventure, Captain Jonathan Archer, proud T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, dr. Phlox, Hoshi and Trip are great, at least in this pilot. In IMDb I have noted that this episode is actually divided into two parts, but there are only one on the DVD, so my review applies to both. I didn't like the music score that I found very annoying, but it was an exception in this great show. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Broken Bow"
