but it's worth Boyer, Lorre and Paxinou. Greene's entertainment needs filmed during the war required a transplant to the American shore, as is the case with this Gun for Hire, or the use of American actors in roles where they did not fit. Bacall is right here. I waited for him to whistle and drag life; her voice is just a class for English native language wrong. But listen to the dialogue! No, people are not talking, except in the books, but Greene sent a message from England, which was supposed to wake up the world. Another positive note: Greene characters were kept whole. Although Mr Mukerjee reminded more of Brahmin, at least his citizenship was kept and his last conversation with Paxinou was invaluable.
