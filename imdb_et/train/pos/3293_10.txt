Whenever I was asked to commemorate a song from last year's film, it should be "Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Couple Chalo" in the sense of being sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd. Rafi, Kaif Bhopal, and not to mention cinematography, as a sailboat on a black background and shining stars. The second should be "Chalte Chalte". Pakeezah was Meena Kumar's last film before she died and its duration was visible on the screen. In each picture depicted in the picture, he looks young, but after that he does not. But one actor who didn't change his appearance was late Raj Kumar, who falls in love with him, and especially his feet, after he accidentally entered his train car and after seeing them he leaves a note describing how beautiful they are in Conclusion: Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic the story that, if at all possible, it should be viewed on a big screen just for the sake of cinematographic photography and songs. The stars of the film are Meena's Goblin, Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar and are led by Kamal Amrohi. <br /> <br /> The son of Kamal Amroh has now begun to revive his father's studio by making a comedy film.
