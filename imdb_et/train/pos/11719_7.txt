Elvira, the lover of darkness, is a fun, camp horror comedy, where the fourth wall breaks a few times and jokes often fall under the navel. And Cassandra Peterson's breasts become their own. <br /> <br /> Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is a stacked master who learns that he has inherited his aunt Morgan. So he goes to the small town of Fallwell, which is dominated by the most terrifying monster ever to embrace the earth: morality. The cozy look of Elviras is, of course, too much for plums, but the children of the city get out of their different types of lifestyle. And of course there is evil evil, his uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), who is after Elvira's mothers' book. Look, Elvira is actually a real witch, she just doesn't know it. But what it is, Elvira is a pretty funny movie, although the script doesn't leave much room for improvement. Most laugh comes from the difference between Elvira and good morals, but also a few good visual gags. It's all right, but it never gets any more. All in all, there is a good, deliberate campy, comedy. If you like this thing, it is.
