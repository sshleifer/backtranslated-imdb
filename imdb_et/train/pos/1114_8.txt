And he has shaped the bitter adolescent personality we all had into a corrosive and adult world view. Together, they offer an amazing blend that may be too sharp for some viewers. (Hi Skip. I wish you wouldn't be my brother so I could get you ****!) <br /> <br /> Bernhards is looking for a return from New York to LA, which results in a variety of people trying out all fit badly) for our entertainment, but it is enough for them to turn to a system of "black imperative" values, whose real barometer is whether the black culture will accept it. (It has been a while. Nina Simone recalls. And she has an impressive, firmly built black lover in the movie) A beautiful black girl who seems to allow Sandra's faux dirt to take part in the shows, but eventually she rejects it. <br /> <br /> Just as Catholics feel happy to suffer for Christ's sake, Sandra depicts herself in the suffering black culture where she craves; as if he had value and his rejection. This is the only system of values ​​associated with the film world outside Bernhard's artistic confusion. <br /> <br /> The crowd, whose main questions are racism and money, is refreshing to see one of the two topics that are considered atypical.
