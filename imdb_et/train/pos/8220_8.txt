The fourth "Dirty Harry" series, this film is one of the most despicable, filthy, unlikable, profane, nasty women I've ever seen in the movie "Ray Perkins," played by Audrie Neenan. He is a modern, unpleasant low-life version of the 1945 "Det Sav" character "Ann Savage". <br /> <br /> His unpleasant mouth and rain effects keep me so much out of the way that I never saw the rejection filter that closed him ... and at least some of him! Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood) goes to violence right after ..... in minutes! It happens so often that it is almost ridiculous, but makes a fast moving, entertaining movie a satisfying end, because all the scumbag crooks are eliminated one by one. <br /> <br /> This is a very sophomorphic film that calls our base skin ... ... and connects, sad to say. Most of us want these dirtballs to end, and who does it better than Dirty Harry?
