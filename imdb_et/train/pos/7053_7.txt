Don't Miss "War Inc." a sharply bent satire or a funny comedy filled with curious jokes. It is not like that. <br /> <br /> This is an old-fashioned screw comedy with ridiculously random screws, stock characters (fun performances by John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tome and Hillary Duff) and a direct approach to political content. <br /> <br /> You see, the filmmakers' political points are things that almost the whole country already knows, it's true. Yes, we realize that war-benefiting corporations are corrupt, innocent pigs, political leaders responsible for it are even more inert, and American imperialism has never seen a crasser and more touch than it is now - but none of it is a point. <br /> <br /> Here's the noise they're setting - sometimes in genius ways - as stupid as John Cusack's character (stroke) man with heart) tries to change his life with the help of his wife's journalist who doesn't trust him (Tomei) and a young Middle Eastern star who wants to get her marriage (Duff). Cusack's sister Joan plays his assistant almost comically with enthusiastic quality. Ben Kingsley seemed to me that he wasted his smaller part as a ruthless CIA boss. <br /> <br /> It's all and it works. It's easy fun, but if somehow you don't see reality and you think war is going well and all the people involved are doing a good job and there is no corruption or people in the Middle East, our western cultures want to replace their culture. You may not be funny. <br /> <br /> For all other men, this was a light comedy with a political edge.
