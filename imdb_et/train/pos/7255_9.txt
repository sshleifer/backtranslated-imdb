This is not a movie to watch, at least most of the people I know wouldn't be. <br /> <br /> It is the cruelty of both the body and the mind that warfare quite well, the characters seem plausible, especially since you "read their thoughts", more often than not in books and rarely in films, but very well in the work. I set it aside for "All Silent West" and "Die Br√ºcke" for a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> I wish I could watch it on the screen with the other two films. - But finding that copy seemed pretty hard - it's a shame.
