I testify that I am somewhat torn by the genre of a young child's film that softens the heart of his reluctant guardian. Have I seen enough of them? Baby Boom, Kolya, about a boy, mostly Martha and to some extent also a traveler? assume that this formula is boring. What keeps my focus on the king of the masks was the place's grim: the small town of China in the 1930s. Extreme poverty was the norm, and the children of the girls were considered to be so worthless for the poorer parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to the black market. When Wang discovers his bought son, who he is called "Doggie", is a grandson, he first casts it out, although he has shown a great promise as a legacy heir. Even after he inadvertently takes him back, he has not been kidnapped. Then the film is sharp, showing the lengths that a young street-smart girl had to survive in this society. <br /> <br /> The two leading performances are pious and horrible in their societal context. In Western society, one would expect Wang to be at least angry if he did not achieve more material success. However, Wang accepts his station as an artist with such a low social status that I too. Although Doggie exhibits precious dignity and insidiousness against a modern, suburban child, it is completely believable in childhood, a constant survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage. And after learning that his previous seven owners have been physically and mentally abusive, his fierce affirmation to Wang makes sense. <br /> <br /> Hiding a small town living abroad, two-line nature actors, a surprising plot twists, and of course all heart-paced resolutions contribute to a highly observable movie.
