8 simple rules are a funny show, but it also has some hours of life, especially one ripe lesson about the loss after the loss, which was an episode where Paul died, which was the first episode I've ever seen of an ABC show. The Hennessy clan - mother Cate (Katey Sagal), daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson) and son Rory (Martin Spanjers) - look at each other for guidance and support for Paul's death (John Ritter). ), family patriarch. Cate's parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) give a hand. I am delighted later in the 2nd season of this show when they decided to put David Spade in this show because he had made the NBC series, Just Shoot Me! But everything and all this show is pretty good. This exhibition reminds me of the many classic generations of the 80's and 90's that were previously in ABC.
