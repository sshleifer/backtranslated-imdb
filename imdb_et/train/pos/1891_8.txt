When you see this movie, you begin to understand what a drastically under-utilized asset was late for Dudley Moore. Our archive should have such a dozen movies. He was already a top talent before he went to Hollywood as a comedian and musician. But most of the time he is remembered for being tied to Peter Cook, on television and with one or two indifferent British films. Perhaps the best of them was "Bedazzled". <br /> <br /> He always tended to overshadow Cook, who is jealousy and nonsense, pulling his partnership and enabling Moor to realize his true potential in America. The result is "Arthur". <br /> <br /> It's a really great movie. Moore's cunning comedy as drunk is undeniable. The script is perfect for a lot of fun, almost surreal conversations. There is something so British about him that I am actually surprised that he found such a complaint for American taste. Tommy Cooper, an anarchic comedian after drawing the same fashion, draws empty. It's Moore's almost childish vulnerability that is so cute. <br /> <br /> Liza Minelli and John Guilgud are inclined to play against him, but they still have excellent lining. In particular, John Guilgud provides his sarcastic and acerbic authority, which is the treasure to watch. He always steals any scene in which he provides and earnestly serves his Oscar. Fix me when I'm wrong, but he never played any other comic role. <br /> <br /> There is a movie called "Arthur 2 - On the Rocks". It never reaches the same high level of fun that one gets, but it's still pretty good. Guilgud will only be the hero at the beginning and the ghost. It's darker. And there are some interesting souls looking for. It is disappointing when you look at the first Arthur. <br /> <br /> Hollywood seemed to lose interest in these two trips. Finally he returned to Britain, was abandoned and probably dead. <br /> <br /> But Arthur is an example of what might have been. We can only imagine other great movies he should have done. <br /> <br /> Your sad, Dudley.
