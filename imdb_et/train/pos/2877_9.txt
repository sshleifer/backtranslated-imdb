I don't think I have to tell you this story. Because it has been spoken for years and years. So I just share my feelings. I first saw Cinderella when I was five years old. Since then I was a good Disney child. Animation now seems childish and old-fashioned, but it is now part of your charm. Now, in the era of images created by High School Musical and computer, people seem to have forgotten the genius and magic of the early Disney movies. Fortunately, I was born before that, so I introduced this classics. And it seems that no matter how old I get, I return to this five-year VHS review. What is Disney's real magic.
