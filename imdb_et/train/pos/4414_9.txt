Cuban blood is one of those sleeping films that has a lot to talk about life in a very traditional way. I watched it while I was traveling to Cuba on a cruise to the Caribbean Sea. It describes the life of an 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during a revolution. Not much time is spent on the revolution until the end of the socialist regime and the property of the boy's father. Most of the film is the boy's aging and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some powerful scenes that anyone can communicate with. Class A film with good performance and control. This is a film that tells a story without special effects or big schemes or real twists. It is a film about people and their lives, their mistakes and their triumphs. A good movie to watch many times a year.
