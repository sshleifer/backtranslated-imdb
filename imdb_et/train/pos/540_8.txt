actually ... this "camcorder" effect is just that, it's an effect, pretty good .. (u don't know much about targeting a movie?) is this movie really better than the original, it's a lot of fun to watch, made for the TV, doesn't have to follow any rules. I find it difficult to see number 1 because he kills the first girl, its disturbing. and all the time we routed to Judd Nelson to get away from it, we are a spectator next to him. I hope one day we will see the third cabin next to the lake, but I doubt it. Watching this movie, you will see how real movies have been made, because it's like a movie in a movie. Judd is one of the most frightening crooks, and he is more realistic, he is not just mindless people like other horrors.
