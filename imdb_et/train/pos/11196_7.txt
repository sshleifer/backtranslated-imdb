"One-way" Jack Sander is called because he is a carnival boxer who fights with any audience. When they get one round, they win the prize - a popular way to drive customers to travel art for a long time. Jack is in love with the ticket girl Mabel, although his head is turned quickly when Bob Corby enters to try his chances with Jack. What nobody knows about fighting is that Bob is a champion so he can jack Jack - although he does some work for him. As a result, Bob Jack asks his sparring partner to give up the carnival ring. Later Jack will fix so much that he will also become a legitimate boxer. He is slowly working on his charts until he is almost ready to take Champ. Meanwhile, Champ and Mabel are going to go behind Jack's back - though Mabel is now married to Jack. So, when the final fight is between Jack and Bob, it is very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is he good enough? Does Bob get up against a legitimate rage or prevent his action? Tune in and see. <br /> <br /> This movie was directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and nowadays it seems like a movie known for mystery-temporary films in the 1920s that Hitchcock had no specific genre he directed or wrote (he did so) for this movie). In fact, this film shows Hitchcock's silent style in many ways, because some similar plot appeared in one of his next silences, MANXMAN (also who made Carl Brisson a dignified husband). So, although it seems a lot like the ordinary boxing movie of the day, this great director was not a radical departure - even with its quite formal end. <br /> <br /> Overall, although a bit predictable and Ian Hunter, who plays a boxing game, seems silly, the film works well. Although it is far from perfect, it's nice to look and pack a nice punch.
