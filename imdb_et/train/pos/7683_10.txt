I loved the good times with others. I love reading INTELLIGENT and INSIGHTFUL comments. The writers of this exhibition were fantastic and the actors were outside TALENTED. To answer Strawberry22 (the clearest comment to the other boss and the positive comment) ... What happened was that James was killed in an accident (I believe I was a freight accident or a car accident) and that was the saddest episode (when it first aired and I was a little thing ... it was so sad to me). <br /> <br /> Florida and the kids really get out of the projects and EVEN will become Willona's (Wilnona) neighbors and the last show ended. <br /> <br /> ALL the kids achieved their dreams and found their dream. It was a great ending and I cried because I was happy about them and the show seemed so real that I really believed in their fate. I hope that this end will actually end for many. <br /> <br /> A great show and many other great exhibitions followed, including Benson and The Jeffersons. It was a fantastic period for African-American television and the best writers were fantastic at that time. TV LAND is awesome for memories and I just love it because I can't get the STAND Junk that we look at today. SOMEBODY ... bring back the 1970s and 1980s quickly ... your intelligent viewers are dying here, and we need better material. <br /> <br /> Love, TV LAND original 70's and 80's sitcom junkies (when they sing "ALL in the Family" ... these were the days ......
