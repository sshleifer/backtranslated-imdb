The autobiography on which this film is based is still one of the heart-shaped books I've ever read. It speaks of amazing stories of two sisters who are dedicated and respected as their 70's teachers and dentists and then lived for another 30 years with dignity. Ruby Dee steals the film with her perfect nuanced performance, such as the rebellious "black" Bessie, the dentist. He does not only express his anger, anger and wisdom well; he will tell you exactly where they came from using the word economy. Diahnn Carroll has an older sister, a teacher, but I'm afraid she never believes she is over 100 years old. No matter - the stories are worth it. Amy Madigan is a bit too extreme and intrusive, acting in a perplexing and insecure way in the first half of the film as a Caucasian NY Times reporter. This is also just a little attention. The stories that are all true are attraction, and while the two or three translations are easily damaging, most of them make a fine. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you read all books for all people you recommend. I can't quite but have this TV movie in this rare air, but it really captures enough taste to be very valuable in itself.
