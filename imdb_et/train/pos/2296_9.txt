_Les Acteurs_ is an absurd story of Jean-Pierre Marielle, who is desperately waiting for hot water, a story of meeting with actors, a story of aging actors whose career is slowly less active than before, but a stunning tribute to French actors and their cinema. <br /> <br /> Supports a solid reflection about cinema and exhibition (fourth wall, hidden cameras, playing or not playing), the story of the movie in which most of these famous actors play their role (not to blend in with their camera - no movie not voyeur) is quite vague and follows the participants in a series of episodes that makes the movie quite amusing. As Andr√© Dussolier leaves the film and leaves Josiane Balasko playing his role (great actor, he is fun serious especially when Dussolier in his role laughs), when the actors run on the street, asking for autographs, fighting and rumors, we know the scenes of other scenes, in which each (or others) has played. <br /> <br /> Whoever doesn't know the participants (most of them are at least in their 50s) or do not know French cinema, this movie is less interesting because most of the references are skipped, but it still offers good ways of aging, acting, public life.
