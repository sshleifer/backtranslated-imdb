"What I like about you" is definitely an exhibition that I couldn't wait to see every day. Amanda Bynes is such a great actor and I grew up to see her exhibition: "Amanda's show." She is a very funny person and seems to be on earth. "Holly" is such a similar capable person and has an "out-there" personality. I liked how she always looked around and upside down, so she messed up at times. But it made this exhibition so big. <br /> <br /> I especially loved this example when the "Vince" characters came. Nick Zano is very hot and funny, as well as "Gary", Wesley Jonathan. The whole cast was great, every character had his own personality and charm. Jennie Garth, Allison Munn and Leslie Grossman were all very interesting. I especially loved Lauren; he is the best! He helped show the extra funny and you never know what he does or says next! In general, the show is really nice, but the reason I didn't give it to 10 was that there were no new episodes and the episodes could be longer and deeper.
