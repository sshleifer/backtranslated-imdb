My mother took me out to watch this movie in Christmas 1976. I loved it and I love it now. I know everyone makes Barbra's hair in this, but I think she looks and sounds good! ... And I think I remember a number of women who copied it while watching the permed! The bath scene between Streisand and Kristoferson is also so sexy! Music is also great. It's the 70s Babs at its best!
