Let's start with a few things: zombies do not exist, so the filmmaker would be able to get them WALK, RUN, hell even if he wanted to. This makes this original Zombie movie so good. Everything they did was so damn original. I hate making filmmakers all like Romero, or when fans are waiting for everyone like Romero. Some idiots think zombies should be just like a typical Romero movie, again there are no zombies so the filmmaker can whistle when he wants it. The zombies in this movie are all very good, but NOT that they are not decaying dead bodies as they died of JUST freaking! They are quite confused and full of broken face and blood. One of the coolest scenes was half-cat. It seemed so fucking real when my daughter saw it. This movie got very good reviews from Fangoria and Rue Morgue, so it made me go. I'm glad you listened. They are always right when it comes to the real horror fan taste. 10 out of 10! Go For Rent!
