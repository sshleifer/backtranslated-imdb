I thought this movie was LOL funny. It's a fun, not serious film about one man's twisted views of life, love, and ... Well, ladies, from the lower bus station, to the high quality ... bus stop. " Tim meadows are played by a boy (Leon Phelps) brought up by Hyb Hefner's ancestors in a Playboy-style mansion, surrounded by beautiful porn models and actors. When his "father" throws him out on the street, he must learn to fight for himself, but not only for the chauvinist life he has been taught by his youngsters ... this and pointless, almost mystical charm and stupid. And so begins hijinx! If you have not seen this movie and enjoy a light-hearted, non-stop, comedy / love story, then I recommend renting a "Women's Man".
