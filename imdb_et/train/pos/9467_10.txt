The self-drawn DAN IN REAL LIFE made great comments and thirst for the drama that was well written - thank you to Peter Hedges - and as Steve Carell's stars in the movie, you know that the audience finds like LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, a performance that is very fun and rewarding offering. DAN IN REAL LIFE made this promise. <br /> <br /> The film is so real for many families all over the world who have lost a member and who have been looking for something that will give them magic back before they lose. With Steve Carelli and the wonderful Juliette Binoche, their relationships were so beautiful and written that their scenes were so real about their characters and trips. Cast, set, and story reminded me of DAN IN REAL LIFE when we go to future holidays.
