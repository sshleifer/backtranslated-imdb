At the end of the movie, I still don't know if I liked it or not. This was the case with most reviewers. However, I still feel that the film is worth the effort of 7 efforts. <br /> <br /> For a long time I read a quotation: There are 2 LETTERS, 1. CENTERS AND WRITE. AND 2. THEY WRITE AND READ OUT. though here I feel that GUY Ritchie took so much literally and left all the thinking to the audience. <br /> <br /> I felt this movie was a mixed bag filled with some DEVILS ADUTAATE and FIGHT CLUB. .. <br /> <br /> This is definitely classic: something that nobody understands but appreciates .... <br /> <br /> What I don't understand is why stathom (Jake Green) was a break ( that is how it all started), all the movie riddles and mysteries are groomed except it. <br /> <br /> Well, if you read this review to find a solution to what this movie was all about: I'll post a great midnight when it hits me, and if you still decide to watch this movie, please answer it first ... if you come across a puzzle like "no one ever solved" would you like to try? <br /> <br /> I'd like to
