It's my favorite movie all the time. This is mainly because it is not afraid to get into some very politically incorrect subject matter (such as swinging and women's eligibility) that are not touched by other mainstream films. Nothing seems to be boundless in this film because the director freely develops the story without worrying about the potential insult to the viewer. However, I do not believe that anything was done here just to achieve the value of the shock or the offensive. Sean Young becomes great and brave. Most of the main actors created would not have taken this role or would have asked for some of the larger scripts before it was adopted. Other cast members also do a good job. <br /> <br /> Have you noticed that this movie hasn't appeared on the pay cable because it's a mandatory short run a year after the theaters were hit? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it just does not fit with today's political atmosphere. It seems quite ironic to me that some premium channels now carry soft porn (it gets closer and closer to hardcore porn) but doesn't wear a mainstream movie like "Love Crimes". Unfortunately, although this movie is only 11 years old, it may not be done today. <br /> <br />
