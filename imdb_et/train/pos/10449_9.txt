I had never heard of this movie a few weeks ago, but its concept was of interest to me when I heard it: an American man meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and they spend the night talking together. That was my interest, but I didn't expect it to be great. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece and it is also one of the most romantic films. To my surprise, it was not entirely cynical in the 1990s. It is impossible to talk too much about it, because there is no real plot, so to speak (although there are many things that are very interesting to talk about; it's kind of like my dinner with Andre, where there is a conversation, but it's not just a conversation that is important), but let me just say, look at it. LOOK AT THIS!
