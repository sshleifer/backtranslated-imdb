In Iran, women are not taken to football matches. Officially, this is because they have to be saved from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience. But of course this is sexism. Women are lower people. <br /> <br /> Some brave girls are against it and try to get into the stadium using different tricks. Soldiers will catch them and keep such cages until the police arrive and choose them. <br /> <br /> Despite the madness, this is a movie with a lot of humor. It is also encouraging to see how people always find different ways to fight oppression. You touch while you have a lot of laugh. Good work by director Jafar Panah. This is a heroic comedy in many ways.
