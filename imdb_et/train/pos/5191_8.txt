Scott is right. The best 2-member sword-duel ever put on the film is in the middle of this movie. Sword struggles with multiple fighters are not the best, though quite good. But the fight in the middle is best compared to the Japanese samurai movies. In my opinion, the scenes of Chinese swords have never crossed Japan's entertainment value. Especially in scenes where one man has to fight the group's enemies, the Japanese films look like Lone Wolf and Cub. Although the Japanese cinema duel lasts for a maximum of seconds or minutes, the intensity of their moments made them better. But this is one example of a Chinese sword game crossing Japan. The scene in the middle of this film was a five-minute fight with the most amazing choreography. Other struggles in this film are also good, but even if they do the wonders of this movie, it would get 7 scenes. If you haven't seen it, you have to do it. John Woo is a man.
