It is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists all over the world. Documentary films are diverse and deal with all kinds of concepts, the only thing being shared is the 19th issue (in some cases very small). Some segments are weak, others are very strong; some are political, some are not; some of them are only 9/11, some use nine by September 11th as a subject for people's feelings, emotions and tragedies that are universal; some of them are mainstream, while others are abstract and artistic). This movie is not censored by anyone, so your visions are very raw and powerful. <br /> <br /> This is a very controversial movie, especially for conservative Americans. I think the two segments can really pull the right wings (one from Egypt, where a dead American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber return as spirits; the other from the United Kingdom, which gives an overview of the US-backed US-defeated 11 September 1973 which resulted in 50,000 deaths and terrible atrocities). The Mexican segment was the most powerful, describing the fall of the tower and the resulting death in a living way (you have to believe it). <br /> <br /> Although the end product is uneven, some segments are almost "pointless", but I recommend it. This movie is very difficult to sort because the segments vary everywhere (some weak, some very powerful;). I give this rating to 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and included issues that are usually censored (Mexican segment, UK segment, Japanese segment, Egyptian segment).
