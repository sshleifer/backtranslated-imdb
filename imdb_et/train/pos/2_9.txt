Bromwell High isn't just great. Expertly written and perfectly delivered pupils and teachers in a public school in South London will leave you literally laughing. It is vulgar, provocative, witty and sharp. Characters are a highly cartooned cross-section of British society (or, more precisely, any society). After Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "main characters" have got a better perspective, this is not an example of parody of every imaginary theme. Political correctness strikes the window out of every episode. If you like to show what is not afraid of the fun of every imaginable taboo, Bromwell High won't disappoint!
