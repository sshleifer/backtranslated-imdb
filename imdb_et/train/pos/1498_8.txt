It is a very amusing and sometimes creepy anthology that, if it is a short description in the manuscript department, it will more than compensate for the shortcomings in operational, location and general overpopulation. Its best episodes are the first, where Denholm Elliot plays a character writer of his novel (a perfect example of how to simply pull it out of a pedestrian); third, Christopher Lee as a man who scared his daughter and the latest episode with Late Jon Pertwee as an amazing star of horror movies, who gets more than just a new role in his latest project. The dialogue between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is bright and inspired, both obviously offering the opportunity to really give it away! Cushing is usually the weakest segment, which certainly is not helped by the fact that the woman's wax figure, which she has embedded in the local wax museum, is something other than "beautiful" because we are told she is! There was a need for someone's shocking beauty and instead the woman was given a turtle jaw. Small quibbles aside from this movie and this is a great land house device to have one to catch when you can.
