This movie was recommended by a friend. I never saw an advertisement or a trailer, so I didn't know that Clooney was in it and was not disturbed by the fact that his role was so small. I thought the whole cast was suitable and found the movie pretty enjoyable. An open scene where small crew members stood by the road, whipped and haggard, immediately sought attention. It was a chance to say, "Don't go away, it's not boring," and it wasn't really. It turned out that it was an interesting, frivolous comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you in the end, but when the end came, I felt a little cheated .... just a little bit. The events had to be built up so you think they will continue to build, but at a point that I cannot define, it is a little disappointing. I think I expected a higher peak, but it turned out to be a low key. If you watch the movie with that in mind and you can live without George Clooney's high doses, you should find this flick very fun and worth watching. Now I would like to see the original (Big Deal on Madonna Street), but it is probably rare in the United States.
