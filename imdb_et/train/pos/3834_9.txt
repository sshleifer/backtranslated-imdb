Great movie! Slow: YES. <br /> <br /> ... but original, deeply atmospheric, dark and terrible, totally SURREAL (feels like a nightmare). <br /> <br /> I'd compare it to David Lynch (Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet) style can be mixed with a bit of Barton Fink and Naked Lunch (insects!). Also a little Jodorowski (Fando y Lis) .... <br /> <br /> Add some nights on Earth, Angel Heart and a little Begotten, Pi, (would it be wrong to mention Tetsuo?) Jacob's ladder Barker banned and saloom - what should form with at least dark night concepts ... NUIT NOIRE. <br /> <br /> If you're outdoors in avant-garde and / or surreal cinema (like me) you like it. If you are expecting something other than a movie full of some average plot - try your luck for something else. <br /> <br /> Final words: The plot is very, very strange and unusual, and it's probably # 1 why most people who don't know this movie hate it.
