I loved this movie. I'm not even sure what it is, but I think it was great and should be available on DVD. Women were strangers and still well enough to spend time at the Villa in Italy. In my opinion, the actors did a great job. The characters were all so different and yet clever, which made it work. From time to time there is humor, drama and relationships. It requires 10 lines, but I can no longer think I would say I just robbed until I get 10 lines. So I'm sorry. What else can I say I have seen it last. Looking forward to viewing again, but it is not available.
