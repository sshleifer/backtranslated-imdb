The world is made up of two different mobile types ... There are types of "English patient" who can't be disturbed to enjoy something that isn't high enough to show in PBS, and there are "Happy Gilmore Types for an hour and half the genital ulcers are definitely worth $ 7. <br /> <br /> Certainly there are tons of gray areas but you know which side you are inclined to. If you are an English patient, save your time, save your money and save us all "Oh, this movie is so childish and stupid" comments .I know you enjoy every movie you don't like, and everybody who likes them, but maybe you could only avoid it once. /> <br /> But if you are a lucky Gilmore type ... go see it ... You will find it fun Tim Meadows has created a fun character and Will Farrell will continue to have fun in everything he does. I'm glad you did, and that's OK.
