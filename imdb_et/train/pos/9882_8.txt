At the moment, METOO is a new working day at 16.00 on weekdays, right after "Maverick" and just before "Wild, Wild West" (followed by "Star Trek"). <br /> <br /> I don't know if I've ever seen this episode when it was originally, but I'm really fascinated by it. Unusual, unusual, surreal stories set in the mystical west. "Western Areas" Naked City. <br /> <br /> And the stars are there: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (deceptive Mexico), Young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. (colored Mexico), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson ("World War"), Gloria Talbott ("I got married from Outer Space") <br /> <br /> It ran eight months, over 200 episodes, from January 1959 to December 1965. <br /> <br /> Eric Fleming is quite remarkable as the track boss Gil Favor. never lived with the Samurai honor code and just the right balance between a strong and open hand. I would vote for him every day on his behalf. (PS She was a very interesting biography: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) <br /> <br /> And young Clint Eastwood is quite striking as her impulsive right hand, "Rowdy" Yates. Also a veteran Western actress and country music figure (immortal "one eye, one horn, flying purple people eater") Sheb Wooley is there experienced scout Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes the most appealing character of culinary art you might want as a "wish field". <br /> <br /> And then this is the great song performed by immortal Frankie Laine. (Between this and the "Maverick" theme, I have all day western music that runs through my head.) <br /> <br /> Look forward to all episodes; I'll collect the whole set. The best time (not to mention the moo experience) is always guaranteed, as it looks to see if the boys get their difficulties straight ahead of the commercial. <br /> <br /> Rollin, Rollin Rolls ...
