This movie is for Halloween, what a fun "Christmas story" is for Christmas: both are relatively small budget movies that are not big-stars ... and both are the two absolute and fun movies that are both seasonal CLASSICS !!! "Spaced Invaders" comes from the beginning with warmth and humor, and great stars ... all five funny Martians, Klembecker Real Estate Agent, Russell, Deputy, Vern "fuel dispenser" and so much more! You just have to believe this movie, and like "Christmas Story", it will stay better and better every time you watch it, and every time you get some fun little things !! VERY FINAL TEN!
