Nobody really understands the logic of numbering Italian zombie clips, but ??? honestly? why do we bother? Each Zombie series movie offers great fun, nasty and free gifts, and "Zombi 3" is no exception to this, despite all the production difficulties in shooting. This film started with an interesting project by Lucio Fulci, who had to develop his Zombie 2 success, but it was a typical Bruno Mattei product with more mistakes and stolen ideas from previous films. The scenario is hopelessly unsuccessful and ignores all forms of continuity, every brilliant idea of ​​George A. Romero's "Living Dead Night" and "Frightened" repeats here shamelessly, and exemplary exhibitions are truly unhappy and painful. But all this did not bother me at one point, because the sublime uppermost gore compensates for everything! Based on a secret military base in the Philippines, the scientists completed the Death One bacterial virus and prepared it for transport. After the virus has not been stolen, the infected corpse is destroyed and the zombie ash contaminates the population of the nearby tourist village. The last group of survivors must fight with hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies, as well as soldiers who are white overalls who received instructions to kill everything that is moving in the contaminated area. This film is comparable to Umberto Lenz's "Nightmare City". Really bad ... but incredibly entertaining with fast paced and multi-creative zombie-madness situations. Undead birds were, for example, original, and the entire zombie post-birth sequence in an abandoned hospital was also pretty cool. The notorious scooter scene is not nearly as terrible as it was created, and it belongs perfectly to this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant Italian zombie flick. Recommended for fans; don't forget the negative comments.
