It was so lucky that we saw this fantastic movie at Palm Springs International Film Festival. Upon entering the theater, we were given a small opinion card that could be used for the personal evaluation of our film. Looking at the card, I turned to my wife and said, "How many movies do you think you can judge as good? Only about 5 for me." But looking at the remarkable landscapes of the New York State movie scene, looking at the interaction between Peter Falck and Paul Reiser, I slowly began to hit the film at one time. Certainly it was good, but the actors' totally natural repo and award-winning performance by a man who, unfortunately, is probably remembered instead of a rain-wearing raincoat, made the film to a great level. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, there was little dry eye in the house, and my usual stoic and bright heart melted like Grinchi and I was great. <br /> <br /> This picture is black for anyone with parents. No violence or nudity, but strong language.
