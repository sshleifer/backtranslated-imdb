Beautiful movie, clean in Cassavet style. Gena Rowland gives an excellent result to the falling actress, which is concerned with success, aging, loneliness and alcoholism. He is trying to escape from the ghosts of his subconscious, which is the death observation of a young man. Accepting movies, the human situation, although its general difficulties are the real purpose of the film. The parallel between the theater lines and the film is puzzling: it is as if the stage were a way out of heroin. If all American films could only be top quality, dealing with human relationships at adult level, not trying to feel and standardize, one of the best dramas. 10/10.
