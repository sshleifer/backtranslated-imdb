First of all, I'm not some obsessed with Justin Timberlake's fangirl that he looks great, in fact I'm not even a big fan of Justin, but I like this movie. <br /> <br /> I was working on a video and when I saw this movie with the great pain I never heard, I had to see what it was. I didn't find Justin's behavior so bad, it was clearly the worst of the group, but it's a pretty impressive group where Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott have two names that didn't even make the first credit list. The story is a basic, journalist who discovers corrupt policemen, but I found it well done. The character of L L Cool J was clearly in contradiction but honestly he didn't know what he was finally doing. Morgan Freeman is, as always, a smart tutor he does so well, and as much as I love Kevin SPacey, he was right there. Hi had no substance, but it is Kevin Spacey, he doesn't get anything wrong. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly I thought Dylan McDermott was the best result of killing a cop. Really plausible and truly characteristic, he broke me a few times. <br /> <br /> I was really looking forward to being a lot of joy. Frightening speeches, unreasonable sequences of action, such things, but it was surprisingly well done and I couldn't find any of them. Every shot was thought, it was not a clich√©, pretty sure. <br /> <br /> A general, amazing cast, decent story that kept me interesting and just enough action to jump. I don't know why it didn't appear in theaters, it was better than some big screens. I'd say it's worth it.
