Having run over this movie on Fox's film channel on a lazy Friday afternoon, I can't think of a better way to spend a lazy Friday night, so I'll put my two cents worth. Especially when you consider the absence of user comments. Does every movie, good or bad, deserve more than four comments? And this movie is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> The first thing to keep in mind when looking at April's love is to remember the time he came in, in this case in the late fifties. The films were very happy at that time. The cinemas lacked tragedy, while the screens were full of wide-screen Technicolor films to displace people from the gray glare of the evil media on a TV called television. I don't know how many people were away from the boob tube to see it, but it managed to capture my attention for 97 minutes. <br /> <br /> Teen Idol Pat Boone plays Nick Conover, a young teen was sent to live with his aunt Henryette (Jeanette Nolan) and Uncle Jedi (Arthur O'Connell) in the country where he had put a trial period to steal the car. His aunt and uncle seem to have lost their son (Jed Jr.), so Uncle Jed seems to have lost his life. Aunt Henrietta hopes that the peasant Nick will in some way bring Jedi out of his fear. Such stories as they are, what they are, Jed and Nick don't care too much of course. Jed then continues to meet Templeton's neighbors Fran (Dolores Michaels) and Liz (Shirley Jones). Immediately Jed develops a break for Fran, and of course I don't have to tell you that Liz is developing Jedi crushing. Then there is the question of Uncle Jedi's horse, who has become wild and does not allow anyone to keep him from Jed Jr's death. You can probably do everything that happens from that moment, seeing there are no real surprises. No matter, you still enjoy yourself. <br /> <br /> If you're over pure clean Pat Boone, like the allegedly bad guy, you won't have any problems with the rest of the movie. Considering that Boone is not surprisingly a good Nick to be. Certainly, this role does not require much depth, but it is still a nicely done job if you least expect it. Like Jed, Arthur O'Connell is the ideal choice for his role. At first he gets inaccessible and cold, but when he slowly gets Nicki, we see that he is a really good man. Jeannette Nolan is a lot of fun with Henrietta, who is constantly playing a part between the Jedi and Nick. Shirley Jones takes a break from Rodgers and Hammerstein and gets some opportunities to love us with our song instruments. Like Liz, she is proud to look great, listen great and occasionally quite funny. Dolores Michaels as Fran, who is a bit more wild, is equally fun. <br /> <br /> The best thing about April's Love is that the screen doesn't have any sort of real average character. . Not a real villain in the whole thing. Everything is so harsh that you can't help but enjoy the movie. I really believe it is quite refreshing, sort of like your worries behind you and enjoying your summer time with friends. Think of it as an old Andy Griffith example with a musical number, a little more plot and a wide screen Technicolor. Songs are a mixed bag with title song April Love being the best of them. The other thing I really liked is that they didn't start using the blue screen in the background of horse racing, and they were more fun and interesting about it. In fact, you will find the whole movie beautifully photographed and it was nice to see that they didn't climb in that department. Chemistry between Jones and Boone is good. The best way is to depict the inconvenience of Nick and Jedi, as everyone tries to get respect for others in some way. But sometimes going to Disneyland just needs a nice outing in the park and that's what April Love is all about. <br /> <br /> My degree: B + <br /> <br />
