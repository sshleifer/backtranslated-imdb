and what combination. An excellent singer of two centuries celebrates this underestimated musical together. He writes music, writes lyrics, and both work with Basil Rathbone who can't write because his wife died (in fact he just got fat!). The best scene is the number of the pawnshop, where Bing sings an improvised number, while the swing band gets its instruments out of the hockey. Just wonderful. And this is a rare major role in the Broadway legend, Mary Martin, and she's pretty good. Charley Grapewin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levant (again mania pianist), Charles Lane and Helen Bertram co-star. And who knew Rathbone might be funny?
