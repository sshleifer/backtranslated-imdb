It's a great movie with stars and some great actors. I never stop it. I especially love this scene where Danny Glover's character and Kevin Kline's character named Simon and Mack are together. Kevin Kline is such a natural one and it seems that his heroes are troubled and one that you would often encounter. So it's a very real movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most powerful scenes in the movie is at the beginning of the movie, when Simon arrives at a scene where Mack's car has broken down. The film also has a strong message, and this is unlike the stereotypical message that carries a film where one person preaches to his guts to the audience. Instead, the emotions and situations of the actors give an effective message that is not best suited without the use of words. And finally, Mary McDonell is brilliant as always.
