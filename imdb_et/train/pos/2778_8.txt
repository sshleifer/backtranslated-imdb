I saw it with little expectation and love! Bend it like Beckham is a fairly typical age design from a pretty atypical girl. This is the Parminder Nagra (ER) attack, played by Jess, an English teenager caught between his traditional Indian family and his love for football (it's football for us North Americans). And although he is actually much older than his age, he plays a role in perfection. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about friendship - especially Jess's friendship with Jules (Keira Knightley), who is also his team worker. Family problems, especially his mother, wearing purple nail polish and small bows on her shoes, and who wants Jules to be feminine, wear lace underwear and flirt with boys and fears that playing sports means her daughter is a lesbian. Jules and Jess love to play the game and have problems trying to convince their families to let them follow their dreams. Unfortunately, they both love Joe, their coach (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). The love triangle causes some tension in your friendship. In some places, Bend It gets like Beckham clich√©s. In other places, the scenes are dragging too long and this film could have benefited from more general editing. <br /> <br /> But it was a refreshingly fun movie about growth, cultural clash and football love. It is empowering women, reversing dreams and supporting friends. Funny, Charming and Fun, Bend It Like Beckham is a small movie that could ... and did it. <br /> <br /> Great. 8/10
