The female black was a British made for a TV film that was first broadcast on the BBC in '89 on Christmave Eve and again on '92. I believe it made American television on A&E. It appeared in VHS in the early 90's in the UK, but went out. The US company released it later on DVD, but this version was also sold. According to the author's website, movie rights now belong to someone else and will not be released again and ebay sells informal bootlegs. <br /> <br /> I recently heard about this movie on a message board and had to check it out. I found a copy of this for about 28 bucks. It is certain that this is a fake reader from the seller, although the DVD says, "done in Canada," ha ha. But this is a good copy, and you can't really blame the laptop label release, which is rare, printed and lost in legal disputes. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. This is a period of the 1920s with all the authentic and strange British settings of that time. The black woman is very obvious and dark. In most cases, the film is very low-key but effective and scary. There are no special gore, violence, or much at all in the special effects, but the black woman is still able to create absolutely cool moments. This is a cool classic style movie. The film itself looks like it could have been done in the 1930s, with the exception of color. Without the flash of all modern horror movies, I'm afraid that this movie is always lost in the pearl. For me, it puts me into one of my all-time favorites.
