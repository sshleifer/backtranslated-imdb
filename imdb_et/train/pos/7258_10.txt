I was fortunate to have a DVD copy of this movie recently and has now seen it for the second time. The first time on late night television in Australia was more than 20 years ago, but I could never forget this strange and dark movie. <br /> <br /> Not many people like this kind of movie at all, because it is so unusual - the fact that there is hardly a talkable conversation - we just hear the signs - is just one unusual aspect. <br /> <br /> Looking for a copy of this movie, I found that the producer was dead, the main actor was dead, not kept in any British television or film archive, that it was never published on video or DVD, that television networks around the world trash after their copyright expires in the 80s. When it was first shown on television in Australia, there were no devices to store for consumers. <br /> <br /> In a second look recently, I saw why it was unforgettable. Sometimes, claustrophobic, like Harold Pinter's stage game, is very intense and intolerable. <br /> <br /> Again, if someone wants a copy of this DVD, send me an email and I'm sure we can do something.
