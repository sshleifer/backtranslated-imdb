The best animated movie ever made. This film examines not only the great world of modern animation, which has absolutely amazing effects, but the branches of human mind, soul and philosophy. The story includes a feline family where a big sister dies, the younger brother sees it and rescues her body, but when she wakes up, she stays without a soul. So, two sister cats start their journey to find it. I have many things to do with this journey. World history, the Bible, the life cycle, and every time I watch it, I discover more and more hidden topics and metaphors. If you're not so physiological, I still adore it. Animation is great and creative scenes are on screen. For example, freezing the ocean in time, the god who eats the soup on the ground, is a strange and somewhat SNM repeating Hansel and Gretel. In conclusion, Cat Soup is an absolute remedy for everyone. <br /> <br /> PS is not free for children.
