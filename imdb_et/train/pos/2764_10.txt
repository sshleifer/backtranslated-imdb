On the eighth day God created Georges. But the same thing as on the eighth day does not fit into the week, Georges doesn't fit in today's world: He has Down's syndrome and that's why society is marginalized, he attacked refuge four years ago after his mother's death. He was the only one who loved him. <br /> <br /> Harry is another man who is no longer loved. His wife has left him for reasons he cannot explain. He also loses the love of his daughters when he arrives at the railway station too late to gather two children who wanted to spend the weekend with their father. <br /> <br /> Harry is a very successful businessman. He knows all the rules that allow us to succeed in our modern meritocracy. But he has come to a crisis situation that reaches its peak after the loss of love for his daughters. He has doubts about his life, without any definite results. <br /> <br /> Harry and Georges meet. At first Harry tries to get rid of Georges like everyone else. But Georges can't be shaken. And it will gradually fall to Harry as he needs Georges if he wants to overcome his identity crisis. This is Georges, who opens him new access to the world and makes him look at his life with different eyes. Friendship and the warmth of the person take the place to strive for success. Not surprisingly, Harry is not able to do his job right now. <br /> <br /> Georges will help Harry to recognize his daughters. Even his wife must admit that his fireworks were worth it. However, reintegration in old life is no longer possible. And the new turns out to be something other than a dream that has expired. The camera looks at Harry and Georges from above for over a minute, because they both lie in the grass, just delicious moments. But the same thing that passes the minute is not a long-lasting friendship between the two men, in such a wonderful way. Georges is destroyed by the impossibility of love against the opposite sex and sees no other way out of suicide. Harry turns into a city tramp that asks drivers who are waiting for charity before the traffic lights. <br /> <br /> The film describes modern meritocracy as a catastrophic mechanism that brings positive values ​​such as human warmth or friendship. This is Georges, a Mongolian, who seems to be able to show off a dilemma, but unfortunately his claim is poor. But his failure does not necessarily mean that achieving the desired goal is impossible or not desirable. How he shows us is certainly acceptable, although it requires tremendous will and, above all, the courage to implement radical non-conformism.
