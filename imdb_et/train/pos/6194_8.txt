Henry Fool surprised me. I didn't expect it to entertain or entertain, or as strongly as he did. Fay Grim continues to be surprised because it gives a definite continuation story that doesn't need it. When the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the movie, it becomes blindly aware that it is one of the best queues for a brilliant indie movie. At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back, if not better. <br /> <br /> I'm a little disappointed that Jeff Goldblum's part is so small, but I'm happy he's part of this short time. He is convincing and delightful as an agent of Fulbright. It is also a pleasure for Liam Aiken, who is quite skilful of Ned Grimi, son of Fay and Henry. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joy for so many reasons. I am pleased, for example, to find out that Henry is not really a loser he seems to be (at the end of the fool), and to discover that he is actually a genius ... well, this is really a cute punch stroke. I hope they will make a third ... like the end of the trilogy. It looks like it's not. They should give him Ned Fool Grim and it should be Liam who is looking for his father to confirm his mother's awesome change and to feel close to him as a genius. Assuming, of course, that Fay leaves many of the most important facts about his son for his father. That seems to be the case. I'd buy it. <br /> <br /> Even with more activities, it's still not the case. It's more of a drama and intrigue ... mystery, kind. I often look at it. <br /> <br /> This price is 8.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
