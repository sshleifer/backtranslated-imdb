Even if you don't know anything about Ireland, you must love "My Left Foot" (and especially Daniel Day-Lewis's performance in it). He is playing with brain addiction Christy Brown. Because of this, he has spent most of his life. Even when you try to warn people, they just laugh at him. The light in the darkness is that he has more than one part of his body: his left leg. He uses this interface to paint and write poetry, highlighting it. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan did a great job with this collaboration and later collaboration: "In the Name of Dad" (but "Boxer" was unnecessary). "My Left Foot" may feel you in many ways: sad, hopeful, or something else. But in any case, Daniel Day-Lewis gave a biography here. Great movie in every sense.
