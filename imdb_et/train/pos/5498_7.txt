This documentary has been inspired by RTE and BBC in recent months. Having seen it twice, I would recommend it to anyone interested in the media and documentary. <br /> <br /> Initially, this documentary had to specify the political life of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The Irish team left with their intentions. What happens when they arrive in Venezuela is surprising when they first knock down Chavez and his government's rebel groups (especially Venezuela's oil issues). What we are witnessing to the audience is how the media manipulates the situation and actually supports the overthrow of Chavez, distorting the events that occur above the coup. <br /> <br /> This is really a great documentary and a remarkable part of some novice filmmakers. <br /> <br />
