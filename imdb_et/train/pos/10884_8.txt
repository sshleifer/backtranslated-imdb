in this movie, this movie is actually better than a lot of genre. is that the walnut of a resident who kills a smile is dying, people die, yada yada yada. i really liked the mask that wore.it walnut work is definitely horrible and at least unique (although i haven't looked at every movie ever made), there is something about bad conditions I haven't seen before he finally ends up being new concept as far as i know.i also really liked Mr Disco for the weapon used because most of the murders. genre, but it's a little worry. the film does not take itself seriously, it is something most slasher people suffer, but while watching the movie, I was reminded of an early "Friday" 13th movie that took it seriously. There are some troubles about this movie. In many scenes, the killer suddenly suffers from a single horror icon. This means that his movements and his reactions as he has shot, and how he walked with greater concern, are close to the scene where Mr. mad is more than striking Similarity (actually a complete rip off) to another famous horror titan.and very recent scenes, we have our scumbag again, looking exactly like the 1st horror icon I mentioned. The fact that the last scene is almost complete hang from another icon in the slasher genre. these scenes were weak and irregular (apparently). By the way, the movie is set in Australia, so if you're a mammal Aussie accent for a chick (like me), you're in heaven. if it just might be over yours. Another great thing about this movie: Beautiful Kylie Minogoue (just can't join her) is one of the non-Aussie accents, courtesy of Molly Ringwald. I enjoyed it and I had fun. I have to give "Cut" 8/10, which may be too high for some people.
