Tenshu has been imprisoned and sentenced to death. If he lives in a power outage, government officials give him the opportunity to choose either a power outage or accept some tests. He chooses experimentation and is placed in a large metal cell with a bad asshole who also lived in an electric shock. They have any desire in the room (within reasonable limits), but they cannot leave. After a few days, the meal is reduced to one day and the room temperature is set to 100. After some disturbances that sound more often, they can't sleep. One day their witch comes to their cell (though the glazed part). So what will happen, I'll let you know. I can be in the minority here, but I liked to build it, it was intriguing for me. Now that the payout was half good when it was built, I would have considered it so much higher. <br /> <br /> My degree: C + <br /> <br /> Two Media Blaster DVD sets Add-ons: Disc 1) Director Cutting; Trailers "Versus", "Aragami", "Attack the Station" and "Deadly Outlaw Rekka" Disc 2) Theater cutting; Comments on Hideo Sakaki, Ryuhei Kitamura, Sakaguchi Takuand Tsutomu Takahashi; Cast and Team Interview; Making; Original Trailer; and Promo Teasers
