Forty-something city experts / photography and original Kolchak longtime fans: the Night Stalker series from its early childhood, one aspect not really mentioned, is the amount of city exploration Carl was doing in the series. He always managed to get to another major abandonment, sewer or tunnel. Armed with only his trusted penlight (okay, so he had some missiles in the prima ape episode of the tunnel) and his camera, he never carried out any other gear either to protect himself or make the investigation easier. <br /> <br /> Like many here, I recently purchased a set of two pilot films and a subsequent DVD box for TV shows, and I was slowly watching all the exhibitions. And while I remember looking back at the beginning of the 1970s when they first incited, it was over 30 years ago ... so many of them seem to be new again. Campy, dated and cheesy - but charming and very fun. They just don't do such things these days. Now all the spin-offs of this revived predictable characters and plots are. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, my 16-year-old daughter has been sitting with me to see episodes and is grateful for her (she enjoys the genre). It gives me hope and confidence that the series will continue to develop new generations of fans over the years.
