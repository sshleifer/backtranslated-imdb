Real classic. Beautifully filmed and acted. Opens the Paris area, alive and full of comedy and tragedy. Although the Hotel du Nord area and the hotel itself are still there, it is not gay (in the original sense) and cheerful as it once was. The film is a longing for the past that is lost and sacrificed.
