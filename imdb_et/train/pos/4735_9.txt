I saw a new redubbed and edited version yesterday and loved it. Then I went home and watched it with subtitles and I loved it. I'm ready to see it again. <br /> <br /> I am a strange secret secret identity and what could be a easier way than a pacifist librarian? My favorite ones are my scenes, where he discovers unforgettable spirits for his friends or in his mind. <br /> <br /> Of course, martial arts are stunning. You can really tell a lot about them when you know the HK style. But if you are not ... we stopped the playback briefly and Walker, Texas Ranger. We noticed that after each strike was cut. Not in a black mask. <br /> <br />
