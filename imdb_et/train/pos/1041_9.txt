Watch On the Rhine started as a Broadway game by Lillian Hellman, who wrote the film and saw it open on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still signed in August 1939 with a notorious aggressive pact with Nazi Germany. because Hellman was just a line from the Communist Party, it didn't change a few months later. Lillian actually had time for this job before her time. <br /> <br /> Play Watch on the Rhine ran from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 shows and five players came from Broadway to repeat their roles with Frank Wilson as Butler, Eric Roberts as the youngest son of Lucile Watson as a matriarch and most importantly villain George Coulouris and Paul Lukas. <br /> <br /> In 1943, Lukas won the prize game, winning Oscar, Golden Globe, and New York movie critics for the best actor. Probably, if Tony Awards had been there, he would have won it. Oscar is even more remarkable when you think he was, for Humphrey Bogart Casablanca, Gary Cooper, who has been placed in the bell tower, Mickey Rooney's Human Comedy, and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Each of his competitors had a bigger box of film name than he was. The name of Luke is usually what the Academy gives out to the field. <br /> <br /> Jack Warner knew that, therefore, Mady's Christians have not repeated their Broadway part, and the role of Lukas's wife was given to Bette Davis. Davis took this part not because it was a particularly prominent role for him, but because he believed in the picture and just wanted to associate it. That's the same reason why he made Man who came to dinner a much easier game than that. <br /> <br /> Davis is a late American Supreme Court daughter who married German citizen during Weimar's days. After many years of events on the European continent, Davis Lukas and their three children come to America, which has not yet entered European war. They are welcome by Lucile Watson, who has, of course, rejoiced at her grandchildren meeting. <br /> <br /> The flight of this ointment is a guest of another house, a friend of Davis, who has passed Geraldine Fitzgerald and his wife, George Coulour, who is also a European, Romanian diplomat. Coulouris is a waste and odd, and he smells like a double factor when he suspects Lukash of a fascist background. <br /> <br /> His doubts are quite correct, this is why the family has been their changed vagabond. Lukas fought on the Republican side in Spain and was wounded. His health has not been the same. His family supports him loyally in any decision he makes. These decisions affect all other cast members. <br /> <br /> Adding more to the Broadway game, including some beautiful fascist creatures, was Dashiell Hammett, who was Lillian Hellman's other. Coulouris Playing Cards At the German Embassy, ​​Hammett's work was on the scene with such great types as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders. <br /> <br /> Coulour is really one of the most despicable characters to show when the account is not a Runman list. He was a metaphor for his homeland, who embraced the Nazis with joy and then rejected them without losing Stalingrad. <br /> <br /> Lucile Watson was the best supporting actor in 1943, but lost Katina Paxinou for whom she was paying the toll. Dashiell Hammett was named the best custom scenario and the film itself lost the best picture of this second fascist classic, Casablanca. <br /> <br /> Although it is an object that is firmly seated in these times, watching the Rhine is still looking at a strange fascist message that endlessly repeats itself.
