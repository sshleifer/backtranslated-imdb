"Moonstruck" is a movie that I liked for the first time watching it. I liked it the second time. I loved it for the third time. Now this is one of my favorites of all time. <br /> <br /> Humor is fine but very good. The film offers a lot of heat. The story goes to the old school in Italy's NYC neighborhood. Finding Cher's love is an enjoyable look. This film is by far the best work on Nicholas Cage. The character of the old man is fantastic. It lights up the screen without saying a word. The scene with his dogs on the moon was fantastic. But perhaps the best character is Olympia Dukakis game. <br /> <br /> The movie's climax is a scene where the main characters in the family kitchen have oatmeal for breakfast. Extraordinary direction and wrapping.
