Although I'm not a big fan of musicals, I've loved Fred Astaire's and Ginger Rogers' movies because they're just so much fun. Of course, they can be a bit formal, but even though you know what's going on, they still have a very nice look. Nevertheless, I was a little disappointed with this trip. Part of this was because this film does not have a wonderful supporting cast, as you saw in TOP HAT or HOW TO BE. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Blore, the film seems to be a little missing - especially in the "fun" department. The silly antics of these supporting actors gave other films a charm that you just can't get with FOLLOW THE FLEET. In addition, unlike the traditional Astaire character, it is rather a jerk - if its fat head gets Rogers over and over again. And as a result, it is much more difficult for him or to see that they come together at the end of the film. Although the music is by Irving Berlin, the songs don't seem to be memorable. In fact, none of these songs was so special and I don't remember any of them, even though I just saw the movie. Although it is still a cute and worthy film, there is simply no shine and magic in another movie. Good, but far from great.
