The turning point of "Matadori" is about half through the movie, when Danny, a sophisticated man from Denver, sits on his balcony in a hotel in Mexico, enjoying a quiet moment. Someone knocks on his door and knowing it is Julian, a paid assassin, he refuses to answer. But is he really? Richard Matthard, director of The Matador, presents us the character, Julian Noble, who does not show the qualities to be redeemed. In fact, we've already seen him in action, doing what he does best. When Julian meets Danny at the Camino Real Bar in Mexico, he beans out and tells his new acquaintance what he's actually living. <br /> <br /> Danny, who has come to sell his program to a Mexican company, seems to be competing with the local equipment that seems to be ahead of the deal. Danny is a naive person who falls under the charisma and charm punished by the wiser Julia. Not long ago, on a cold winter night, a murderer will appear on Danny's door, asking him to pay for his friend's return and travel with him to Tucson. At the moment, their secret, which binds them together, is unexpected. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan, acting against the type, makes a great contribution with his unfair Julian Noble. Just in order to look at his hotel lobby while walking in his speedos and boots gives his character the right impression. Greg Kinnear plays the straight part of this odd pair. Hope Davis appears in just a few scenes, leaving us to regret why he didn't stay longer. Philip Baker Hall puts Juliani in touch with his duties. <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard controls the style of his material. The song is by Rolf Kent and David Tattersall's sharp cinematography improves everything.
