It must be one of the most sincere and touching films ever made with children. Though "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Say Anything" provide beautiful images, these films remain unsuitable for sub-blocks and Hollywood discrepancies. This film focuses on watching a purely romantic orchestra. Secondly, you do not doubt that the film leads to the romantic interconnection of these two people. You should almost feel the synergy and chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it's just a pure pleasure to look at them to find them. This film is mostly based on all dialogues. But every conversation between them is very intriguing. What makes it as romantic as it is. How in all the conversations, though they do not really have any critical importance, you can feel the nuances because the two love and trust each other. That's exactly how you dream of meeting this special person. And what makes it so true is that it's not even too fantastic to believe. This can happen if you are confident enough to talk to the person you accidentally noticed. And what freezes on this film is the great background of Vienna, where this film takes place. It just adds to the romantic nirvana the feeling the film offers. And no matter how many times I watch this movie, I don't think I'll ever get tired of it.
