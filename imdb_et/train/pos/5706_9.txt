If this film had only been made a few years later, I'd hit a point or two because the sound quality was pretty bad. Sometimes the movie seemed to be a silent movie in the intermediate scenes (no normal surrounding sounds). But since it was a 1931 and a French film, it is quite forgiving. Especially because it also appears in later French films - by which time sound problems should have been fully developed (for example, in L'Atalante since 1934). <br /> <br /> All but a few minor sound problems This is a lovely little movie about the missing winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it. And while searching, there are many dirty little songs that you can't help but like. A nice charming movie all-in-all.
