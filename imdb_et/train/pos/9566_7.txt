"Home Sweet Home" director Pou-Soi Cheangi's extremely grim criminal drama. Tonly reminded me of Billy Tang's "Run and Kill", though it's not as polished as it is. However, it is tempting, flawed a little chaos for Cambodian loner, Pang (Edison Chen) who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. When he escapes from the scene, he kills a police Sam Sam, a partner who, in order to offend his injuries, adds his dying father, so Sam starts a mad, obsessive manual for Pang, resulting in almost a dozen corpses and relentless violence. There has to be something in the air lately, because I've never seen so many people who beat cellulose out of each other. It's a gloomy and disgusting stuff, so I'm so partial, and I praise its shrinkage. It's visually arresting and the sound is very unique. Dramatically, everything sounds down until every character finds itself screaming in the world of pain. The sub-block added to the bank's sexually abused girl adds the story deep and creates a fourth surprising act with a good grotesque operation.
