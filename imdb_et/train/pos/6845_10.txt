"Dressed to Kill" is definitely one of the best horror / thriller movies ever made. It is a tight, stylish and extremely suspenseful blend of sex and violence. Actress is pretty good, Pino Donaggio's orchestra is unforgettable and there are many surprises Thriller fans are interested. "Killed to Kill" is a mystery of murder involving a sexually frustrated housewife (Angie Dickinson), her teenage son (Keith Gordon), her psychoanalysis (Michael Caine), and a high-calling girl (Nancy Allen). The killer of Simon is a transsexual named Bobbi, who is also one of Caine's patients. The film is full of breathtaking moments: the infamous image of the assassination of elevators is very stylish and pretty gory. Highly recommended.
