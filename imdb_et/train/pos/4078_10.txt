This is one of my favorite films of all time, PERIOD. I can't think of another movie that combines so many nice movie features like this one. This flick has it all: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Good vs. Bad and even some novels (without the innocent "peck" on the cheek between Pazu and Sheeta). Perhaps best, you don't have to be with Mensa to "get it" and enjoy the movie, as you do with some other Miyazaki movies (I don't know about you, but I watch movies to pause thinking). It's just a fun and enjoyable movie that everyone likes, make yourself a favor and buy it. The only sour note is American copying. I found Vander-Geek just annoying. But everything is not gone, the original Japanese version is on two disks and it's rocks! Who cares if you don't understand Japanese? If you can read at the second level, check out the original Japanese recording with English subtitles. You won't regret it.
