It's nice to see movies that have honest feelings. Sissy Spacek is as persuasive as simple, but nice, daughter Robert Farnsworth, who in his last role finally shows what he was a beautiful actor. It's hard to believe it's a David Lynch movie. It's slow and steady, sweet and moving. One of the best if you don't like car, sex and violence.
