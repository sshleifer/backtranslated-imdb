What if Marylin Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe Dimaggio and Senator McCarthy came together for relative relative communication? <br /> <br /> This wonderful novel, clef, never uses the names of the names of the characters so little veils and meaninglessly reveals not only the individuals they need to be, but also what they represent over time. If you are confusing the allegory, or if you like the movies that you have pre-set and crocheted, this movie doesn't like it. It is a demanding opus that rewards the viewer with intelligence at many levels to evaluate it. <br /> <br /> At this time, the strict avoidance of the actual use of real names is being omitted, we see Einstein, who plans to bring a pacifist speech to the UN for nuclear weapons, visited by Marylin Monroe after filming the notorious Seven Year Itch scene that some say that his marriage ended with Joe Dimaggio. They have a lovely synergy, where Einstein stumbles around the innocence of today's greatest sex symbol with appropriate professor clumsiness. <br /> <br /> Enter Senator McCarthy, who thinks Einstein is red. He has decided to issue Einstein's assurances that he will support the activities of the House Unamerican Action Committee, while providing the ultimate weapon for peace. Lisa Joe, a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person who may not be perfectly thrown, like Gary Busey, hates Marylin's exhibit and believes Einstein has become her lover, although Marylin only wants to show Einstein that she understands the special theory of relativity. <br /> <br /> But there's more. <br /> <br /> Like every one of us, these characters also have the deepest fear they reveal one by one. Ultimately, these are the weaknesses that give mankind figures that we can't help but see almost without exception today. Finally, we see the shocking fear of Einstein's vision and the film's statement turns out. This is a powerful and memorable moment. <br /> <br /> Insignificance is one of my top five films. It's absolutely amazing.
