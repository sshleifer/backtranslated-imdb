- a little SPOILER HEREIN! - <br /> <br /> When I looked at "Creep" votes today, I was surprised by so many IMDb users who rated this "1" movie. I mean, what do people expect from this movie? Are there so many people who, despite the film, don't know anything like that? <br /> <br /> "Difficulty" is a HORROR movie and it's pretty good! It means automatically: it has an absurd story that is full of holes, unheard of threats and simple unilateral signs. So why complain about it? Just take a popcorn and cook, sit down comfortably and then ... ... enjoy the death! The first 60 minutes, if there is almost anything other than Kate and a lone subway station, are incredibly frightening. There is intercourse and fear in every corner of the screen and you give some twitches just because there is a flashing neon lamp on your back. (In my opinion, the sound editor did the best job in this movie.) <br /> <br /> When Kate meets her tracker, the quality of the film will fall, but it will still not become a bad film. The second part of the film is not scary at all, but the gore effects are well done and the story is quite well developed. (... as long as you remember that this is a horror movie that you watch, not Discovery Channel!). Just watch the first hour of "Creep" and leave the cinema or turn your TV. You know the rest of the story, isn't it? A bad guy dies and Kate is the only survivor. But even if you watch this movie until its end, you are not disappointed. leave the cinema in the dark at night, go to the next subway station and take the last train home ...
