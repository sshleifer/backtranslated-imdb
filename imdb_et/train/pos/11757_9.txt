Robin Williams and Kurt Russell are playing boys in their 30s who put their marrakes at risk by deciding (Russell somewhat reluctantly) to play their heartbreaking tie with Bakersfield a year later. Williams is ok, but Russell is sure if he is the legendary Taft upside down Remo Hightower. Holly Palance makes a nice and attractive move as a Williams woman who could live without this rematch. The film is worth watching to see the famous Remot in action. Highly recommended.
