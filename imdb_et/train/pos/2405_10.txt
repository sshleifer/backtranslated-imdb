Wow, I can't believe I'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie. <br /> <br /> Although the film itself seemed interesting enough, the real thing that attracted me to it is Matt Lillard, most people probably think he is too caffeine happy or just sucks, but we are the same age as well as parents of the same generation and I've watched this man so many times that he is one of my favorites now. It is one of the few films where he is a big and big constellation in SLC Punk, a big Lillard movie. <br /> <br /> Baiscally is the story of his usual movies, but more twists than anything that starts to go crazy. Another great actor in the film, Vincent D'onofrio, is also a very notorious filmmaker. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she's not too bad, though you know they hired her mainly for her accent and naked scene =) <br /> <br /> This is a jack vs jill vs bob game as everyone wants to benefit, but not to anyone. They are all trying to get each other to kill another and it is waiting for an explosion. Matt shows his true skill as a leading JAcy who initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and wife are playing a couple of art afters who need business because of lack of money. Vince's character is a bit devastated and smooth for the whole film, but it only increases the intensity of the film. <br /> <br /> The left and right surprises are welcome and the end is very non-classic and makes you very calm and happy You may want it. This movie kept me very interesting, besides being Matt, this is a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies. The critic probably doesn't like this movie, but they don't watch movies because they like movies anyway.
