Unsen is made in a style similar to the old Hollywood mysteries as a horror show. The film is somewhat slow, but many strange images keep the movie alive and traceable. The basic idea of ​​something that young girls are climbing in the basement is old, but good performance and production make it worth watching. The film is remarkable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any specific action or special effect. I appreciated it from 8 out of 10.
