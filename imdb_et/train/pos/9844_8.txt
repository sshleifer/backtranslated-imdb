There are very few movies that are as funny as it is. I was fortunate enough to watch this movie theater "reserved" filmmakers like me, so it wasn't so embarrassing to sit there laughing until my jaw was completely painful and my shirt sleeves were all dehydrating my eyes ... <br /> <br /> Sometimes the story was a bit "slow", but it is probably the best - a bit of a break in the passage between running (I almost sat out of the seat ...) was very welcome.
