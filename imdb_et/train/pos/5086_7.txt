When I heard Patrick Swayze finally return to his acting career, I was very happy. I had been waiting for a great Indiana Jones race. What I got was a 4 hour (with ads) epic, which was very slow. The second and third hours could have been abandoned and the story would not have suffered. The end was good (there was no spoiler here) but I still got more. Well, all the guy can do is the prey that Swayze makes "RoadHouse 2" so he can get back into the genre that made him famous. As a fan of your King Solomon's mines, read a book or watch the 1985 version of Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone, which is not very good, but the only and hour and forty minutes of your life went to 4 hours.
