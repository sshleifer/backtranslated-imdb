The key to joy and beauty, the pain of life and the sadness of our lives is our ability to accept that life is essentially what it is, so that we do not continually fight against this single weighty truth. By doing this, we find peace. Elegant in its simplicity, but for most it is so difficult. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the director shows us this truth, but lets us discover it in our own way. It's a beautiful but simple story, more fabel, which is played very well. Watching the actors is more like being in a room with real people than just watching the actors. I'm sorry. The story is about older men. It looks like a real shutdown, right? But nothing can be further from the truth. The American title of this film is a shower, but it is almost the opposite of the big thematic element of the film, which is the bath. I'm still at a loss. Speaking of a story or characters do not make them justice. <br /> <br /> So, I'm just telling you how much I enjoyed watching this movie and how it touched and moved the experience. I was also quite entertaining. I care about the symbols and I care deeply what happened to them. Any story that is the highest form of praise. <br /> <br /> If you were moved by movies like The King Of Masks or Not One Less, make sure you see the shower. Netflix has it and the DVD video and sound quality are great. I looked at it in the original lanquage, well done and well placed in English. <br /> <br />
