This film, though apparently based on the same title film in 1951, released by MGM and starred by Janet Leigh, is still an excellent film. Danny Glover in one of his best productions brings George Knox, his luck to the baseball leader, to a short storm of life. As for this "stacked" movie, how to add Christopher Lloyd (his performance experience and exhibitions through his screen of performances, wonderful actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (third sun sun), Brenda Fricker (charming and well-experienced Irish actress), Tony Danza (yes, even she's good in this movie), Matthew McConaughey (he stole the show in Dazed and Confused, and his role may not be as important in this film, but he got the exposure), Adrien Brody (what I said about Matthew McConaughey goes to Adrien, except Dazed and Confused), some great characters like Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longo (Messmer), Jay O. Sanders (Ranch Wilder), Neal McDonough (Whitt Bass) and an experienced veteran in his latest performance, Ben Johnson , Hank Murphy) and the rest do a great job, plus a great story that draws a lot of beautiful people, I don't care what depressions you have. I loved this movie as a child, and it brings back memories when I look at it today. I need it on a DVD. I recommend it to all parents who are looking for something their children have not seen, and everyone else for that.
