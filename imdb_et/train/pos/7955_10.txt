This is one of the biggest child pet movies that has ever been created. I cry every time I see Shadow screaming "Wait, wait for me Peter!" when the family car pulls away. It's black if you love animals! Best Movie Ever! The film's lines are sometimes stupid. As Sassy says to Chance; "Cat rule and dogs burn!" I could do this without it, but when I was six, I bet I love that line. The style may seem hooked to some, but I like it. Shadow, as an older dog who is preparing to take her, when she's gone, really moves when you think about it. It reminded me of my childhood dog. I think everyone can find their part in "Homeward Bound".
