If you haven't seen it, you don't know what you're not. For the first time you do, you begin to litteralize the painful pain on the floor, which makes you so laugh and probably yourself. <br /> <br /> It's funny. There has been no comic show on this date that I've seen or even been close to. So many classic one liners, stories and segway. <br /> <br /> Drunken uncle in BBQ, Gi Joe, Mr. T, goony goo, ice cream man, you say some of these things to anyone who has seen this show and I put you dollars into dollars so they can't run straight keep the face and smile or break the rest of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> Pure classic !! Shame you don't get it on DVD. <br /> <br /> Rating 10+ of 10
