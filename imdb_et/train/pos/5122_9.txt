# 3 For Young John Travolta Trilogy. She dances in disco, rock 'n' role and state. He leads Houston to find work and love. Gilley is a hot spot and it's a mechanical bull time. Not to slip, I drove a bull in the Nashville club. I recently saw this almost forgotten movie on television and I remember how good it was and how good it was in 1980. This year I wore a black Travolta like a cowboy hat. Debra Winger was her prime minister. She sees stunning at her red peak. Charisma is a lot. Bud and Sissy seem to be the perfect pair, even if they are in the trailer trash. They were just divided because he feels so good back. Urban Cowboy has an amazing soundtrack. Johnny Lee hears that Eagles and Lookin 'For Love have been heard by Lyin' Eyes.
