The monstrous mother-son-duo (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) sucks the virgins' vitality and their latest target is a real but lonely Tanya (Madchen Amick). But these monsters are allergic to cat scratches ... I've never been a fan of amazing, overestimated bestseller, such as King, Koontz or Barker, but this B movie, written by Mr. Dung himself, is not as close as he could watch out. Yes, it is sometimes jaw-frightening, but actually there is a surprisingly impressive touch: a good old-fashioned cemetery, a terrible soundtrack and a candlelight-gothic-house-scene, a mirror that shows the monster form of rogues, and so on. The film is contaminated by Mr Dung's crazy oral cavity and toilet seat obsession with all the tactics to loot fat people, leading to a completely useless rape teacher sub-block, but there are roses among the manure.
