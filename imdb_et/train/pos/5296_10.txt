Absolutely fun. John Waters' respect for the people he loves the most (the Baltimore session) is a twisted little joke that has a lot to watch and laugh at. It's like being released in the kitch museum! I'm not so laughing at a woman's theater as Serial Mom. I loved seeing old friends from Dreamland Days, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, back in front of the Waters camera. The cast is just wonderful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). Uses the best elements of the former Waters cruelties (especially the undervalued polyester) and many new surprises. I was wonderfully sick of me. Thank you, John!
