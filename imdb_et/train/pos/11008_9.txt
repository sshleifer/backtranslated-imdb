The letters I have given to this great film are noteworthy: "... before you see it for the first time," it is indirect. I've never heard of this movie before and it happened all over, because this week (and last) was a very slow rental experience (not very big). I'm not sure how this movie passed me - I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam too. Still, it did. <br /> <br /> This movie is a fantastic example of what to do if you don't have a big budget. It was just the right amount of land and dialogue to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark; enough. The whole movie is you (the viewer) who is trying to calculate lots of turns. I would have given this film the 10/10, but some shots were pretty fake. I don't have too much of this film, but I don't think it deserves a perfect score. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think he's a pretty serious talent. She never sees her beauty (which is difficult), she really takes her roles seriously and doesn't let her look at her through the scenes of complex emotions. And he may also feel cold and even lifeless if necessary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam really makes a fairly geeky corporate rat in the beginning that wants to prove himself. However, as it changes in the film, it's like night and day. I know some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law or other buddies who have become the next James Bond will hate me for that, but Northam would / should / should match this bill. He has lived and cultivated. She has a great debt and a voice. I think he can also be cold when the situation so requires, and also from the ground. <br /> <br /> The big movie and definitely this movie buffer suggests it at least once if you like corporate espionage movies.
