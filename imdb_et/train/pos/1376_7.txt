It seems to be the biography of Claude Monet, but it is actually a very focused story of the relationship between the three adolescents in the French synchronized swimming team. There are no parents or teachers who are not speaking, school and boys are represented by one peripheral figure, hunky Francois, who enters a defined story from time to time and always confuses. <br /> <br /> Pauline Aquart is the youngest of the three, but wants to join a team she admires so much. He's kind of weird. She has not left her adolescent's tumor yet and has long, bone limbs, big legs and talks. He's predictive and sporting those fleshy slippers. After a while, it will grow your appearance and from certain angles it may appear amazingly. <br /> <br /> Adele Haenel is older - more, well, more advanced physically. What a glamorous figure his swimsuit cuts, wiping around, teasing boys, shaking his long blonde hair. But he's not what he looks like. Or is it? I couldn't figure it out completely. French is a long paradox and a short continuity. No wonder Francois always sniffs him. <br /> <br /> The nature of Louse Blachere is not so unclear. He's also in the team, but he's dirty and plain, sensitive and sensitive to Francois. Blachere is a good actor and adds to his character character insecurity. <br /> <br /> The film discusses the relationships between the three intrigues, cheats, hidden feelings and all the other things we associate with young girls who spend a lot of time with each other. This is, of course, a complex issue. It becomes more difficult to gradually develop a homoerotic relationship between Pauline and Adele. Not that you should wait for this to be a soft porn movie. The only nudity we see is far less than turning on, and what little sex is under the covers, sometimes literally. <br /> <br /> I do not think I want to enter the plot or do too much of this analysis, partly because it is more indicative than expressed through activity, partly because it is complicated and partly because I not sure i got it all. <br /> <br /> Let me show you. Okay. Adele is a girl whom others envy. He is also quite far away and happy with himself. Besides, he apparently faces every boy and man in the eyes of any guy who can use it, from a beautiful but foolish Francois to the driver he wants. He desperately talks about his expertise. When Pauline approaches to join a swimming team, Adele uses the boys to communicate. Do you know a higher and more self-conscious narcissist? But then the hungry bitch takes her thin Pauline and reveals to Paul that she is still a virgin. Really? Yes, really. Pauline begins to get closer to Adele and Adele finally admits she wants to get rid of her virgin and would like Pauline to do it for her. Pauline, who is now sexually with Adele, performs the task of weakness. NOW Adele really wants to get this guy, preferably older and more experienced. So he takes Pauline to worship where he dances somewhat until he follows Pauline's powder room. Two girls are standing there looking at each other, and they have not publicly expressed their sexual interest. But Adele is so close that Pauline slowly relaxes her clothes, goes up and kisses Adele on her lips. Adele goes back with a smile and says, "Now, wasn't that bad, was it?", And then walks back to the club. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty close description of what's going on between Pauline and Adele - but what the hell is going on? At first, Adele Paulus treats as an irrelevant child, later as a close friend, finally as a potential lover - and minute Pauline responds, Adele walks satisfied. Does he USE Paul how he uses men? Does it match to Adele to find out that she has another person in the inadvertent servitude? I do not know. <br /> <br /> I am sorry for Louise Blachere as the third member of the trio, with an ordinary and overripe flower, whose expression always refers to discomfort, but who is at least thoroughly heterosexual and the first three to get rid of this noisy virginity, but I left only for space reasons. <br /> <br /> Should you see it? About me. (Just compare it to a typical American film from high school children.) For men, some of whom have never penetrated a woman's mystology, it may give some insight into what is a medium picture.
