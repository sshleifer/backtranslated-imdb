I really enjoyed this movie. Britney is a great example for teenagers and should be more appreciated. This film is about watching your dreams and never giving up what people would do or say to discourage and criticize you. Holly fulfills her dreams like Britney. <br /> <br /> There are times in every life when people value them for what they are not. Watching this movie will help you understand that you are special in your own way and that you should follow your dreams regardless of what happens. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. He never knows how much it means to me. Bravo Britney. You're the biggest !!!
