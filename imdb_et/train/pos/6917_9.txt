This is the story of Winchester rifle model 1873 "The West Gun The Won The West" Winchester 73 was a valuable possession for a fighter, banned, peacekeeper or soldier. India sold its soul on its own ... <br /> <br /> Winchester 73 is the first co-operation between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart, a duo that further develops a higher Western rhythm, adding a new psychological depth to the genre. The story sees Stewart as Lin McAdam, who is pursuing his father's killed man. Going to Dodge City with his trusted friend Johnny Williams {Millard Mitchell}, Lin gets into Henry Brown (Stephen McNally). But when Wyatt Earp {Will Geer} has taken all the guns entering the city, both men cannot capture that they are ready. The men attacked the race to win Winchester 73 rifle, a competition that Lin finally wins. But before he can leave the city with an excellent prize, the Netherlands abandons it, steals a rifle and jumps into the city quickly. As Lin abandons the pursuit of both human and rifle hatred, the rifle changed hands several times, adding every second dimension as the day of counting all approaches. <br /> <br /> The so-called "psychological west" benchmark is that Winchester 73 is basically the story of a human dignified man who is forced to demarcate his madness in his past. Black and white {the only western parts that were landscapes are still breathtaking eyes. The tone is set with the opening scene like Lin and Johnny on the horses, and the silhouette over the hill when they do to Dodge City. It's just a starting point to see Mann use his visions as a run at the same time as the emotional states of his characters. <br /> <br /> Stewart performs one of the best and most intense performances like McAdam, proving that he was one of America's best and most diverse players. Support is not too bad. Shelley Winters is one of the only women in the world, while Mitchell, McNally, Geer and always great Dan Duryea add extra class to the trial. There are even some parts for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, the latter playing Indian brave is too far. <br /> <br /> Originally, the film was a Fritz Lang project that was even running the script. But Lang went away from it, proving that it was a blessing for western fans. As big as the director who was Lang, with Mann and a new script from Borden Chase and Robert Richards, he set the wheels to move to change the genre. Mann & Stewart is produced not only with further efforts but also with their impact. Similar to Budd Boetticher, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller, they were all notes, and for the western purists they were happy to follow the example and carry the psychological torch further. <br /> <br /> A great hit when you return to a box office is Winchester 73's superb movie that still brings a modern era. 9.5 / 10
