I've never seen four hours as fast as I saw this movie. This film restores Hamlet power and art that should always have been. Even those oh-so famous calls are made in new and inventive ways. And most are incredible, Brannagh is the brightest star. This is the role of his charisma, power and command that defines the film. Completing a full and complete version fulfills so many holes and gives the tragedy a new appreciation regardless of length. Waiting for the dark, dark, clich√© of the castle, we are treated with a rich party of eyes. The only darkness comes from Hamlet, as it should. It's worth your time, all four hours.
