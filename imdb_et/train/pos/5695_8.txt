Some movies can survive almost originally - "Wonderland" is definitely one of those movies. The script manages to throw everything down to a fever, but it does not make it inconsistent. The speed of this thriller has not been chosen to cover the weak script, but rather to reflect the drug-related reality. Most symbols are constantly on the edge and often because they are rather ugly personalities. Val Kilmer has described John Holmes as a hustler who can manipulate and control. Not offended by Kilmer, but his Holmes version seems to be able to control drastically weak. However, it is amazing. Compared to Kilmer's "Hollywood" roles, such as "Holy", he seems to have a lot of home in indie clips. </Amend> Women, especially women, are particularly different. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow have limited time with their male counterparts, but they are all fantastic. In addition to Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott, they give their roles strange, stunning energy. mind. Yes, the story revolves around John Holmes, but it doesn't literally have a professional career. Basically, this movie is a mystery of murder and as such - it's great. <br /> <br /> RATING: 7.5 out of 10
