When I first saw this movie, it was VHS-Video long ago. I liked this movie because it was funny and exciting. A few years ago, I saw another movie called: * Andy Colby's incredible adventure * In this movie, there were some of the lost kingdom * wizards used. They called this movie "The Fox Conqueror". I started looking for the "KOR" -Movie for years, because I wanted to see the whole movie, not just the parts used in * Andy Colby * -Movie. No store could rent this Kor-Movie and no shop knew this movie. For many years I looked at my old VHS birds that I had at home, and what a miracle ... I had this movie at home for many years, but the film had a different title because it has 3 or 4 titles in Germany. So I was happy to find this tape at home and this time I had a lot more time to watch the basket conqueror again. The music is great during the film, but the best part of filming with music is the moment the KOR gets drunk through the green forest. There was some magic in the background of music. I like Bo Svenson and the boy who played Simon in the movie. Both did their job very well. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 26.10.2004. Thank you for reading my comment.
