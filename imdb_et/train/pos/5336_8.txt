I like this movie because there are no movies like prime time in Australia. I must say that this is one of the best serious films that describe the differences between Hong Kong and mainland China. It really shows that there is discomfort between the two, but it only gets better when HK learns mandarin. It also showed how the Indie-rock scene exists in mainland China, and that Chinese people know how to play guitar and get a house! Who said that China is not ready for rock music? Daniel Wu is absolutely brilliant, with a clean and crisp voice, honestly operating and full chick magnet. I recommend this movie to those who don't know much about Asian people to clean themselves from typical Western stereotypes, and people who just love Chinese / Asian cinema like me. Look!
