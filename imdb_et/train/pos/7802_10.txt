I was electrified when I saw it for the first time in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko has gone to the movie, but his resonance of courage and wisdom is not forgotten. I didn't do it in 1993 in South Africa. It is also largely a story of friendship and loyalty. When I was in South Africa and listened to the audience in Natal's Nikos Sikelel iAfrica, my hair stood out. There is much to learn from all the peoples.
