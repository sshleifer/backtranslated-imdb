Amazing documentary. In recent years, it has been seen a few times on the original page and DVD. I was shocked that it was not even the best documentary for the Oscar in 2002 when it appeared. No other documentary is even close. <br /> <br /> This was recently on television at the 5th anniversary, but I was left with the segment "where they are now" at the end, except when I got tony running now <br /> <br /> I've seen some criticism of making documentaries on this list. I don't see how it could have been done. They had less than six months to assemble and get air. The DVD contains more material and background. <br /> <br /> I am also surprised that, according to IMDb.com, the brother has not had projects for four years. What have they done?
