This movie is one of those nostalgia things with me and I never expect anyone to "get", but I'm happy if I want it and someone enjoys it. My late father HATED Arthur Askey, but this movie was what he really enjoyed and his consistent enthusiasm for "The Ghost Train" and "Old Ted" Olmes for me as a child. Years later, I look at it every time and again, enjoying it. I don't always know if it's not the same, but I'm never disappointed. There's plenty to enjoy. The train order is truly inspired when Askey and Murdoch irritate the arrogant male passenger. Then the whole part of the station is amazing, so much you have to keep up. Yes, it is dated and full of British-sized accents and plots of war (based on Arnold Ridley's original game of fame of father's army!), But full of marvelous character performances, including Kathleen Harrison's dark spinster. The atmosphere is as close as the Arthur Askey can get. It is available inexpensively because in the UK, there are chips on the DVD to meet yourself. It is perfect for Saturday / Sunday morning or any day on a lazy afternoon for light entertainment. Thank you ... <br /> <br /> OLD MOVIES can be a good movie!
