Full Moon High (1981) 3 of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Roz Kelly <br /> <br /> Tony (Arkin) is your average normal high school boy. Preaping a great homecoming game, girlfriend trouble and growing hair in strange places you know plain. But the hair of strange places gets out of control when a trip to his father's country (YES! McMahon) leaves him in the evil case of the Fergists. Now it is disastrous to walk the world forever as a werewolf, how does Adam get girls? <br /> <br /> "Full Moon High" doesn't often speak, but it's a foolish and fun fright. Larry Cohen (The Stuff) contains so many gags as maybe a writer / director. Ark (H20: Halloween, 20 years later) shows a good role in history. If you happen to be a fan, like "Airplane" and "Student Organizations" then I think you have fun with this woman-fan.
