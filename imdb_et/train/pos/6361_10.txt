I've been waiting for this movie to open for several months. As a huge fan of Jim Carrey, I just saw how he would affect Seuss' Grinch himself and make his character. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie was pure magic. Carrey is the master of his trade and no one would have played this role perfectly as he did. There was a lot of fun for both adults and children, and this movie will definitely be a timeless classic for anyone who can enjoy in the coming years. I already have views of my young girls who sit year after year to watch this video again and I will certainly look at her and laugh when I first saw it. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this movie, Jim Carrey, wrote over it and I don't think it would have come together without him. But supportive cast was charming and entertaining in itself, especially the admirable Taylor Momsen, who was the perfect foil for Carrey's antics. The designed design, the musical result and the costumes offered their hands to a magical, fabulous final product and I believe that all the parties involved can be proud. <br /> <br /> It's not an easy task to turn a 22-minute cartoon into a classic full-length live movie, but Howard has succeeded in flying colors. For those critics who disagree, your hearts may be 2 small too small.
