Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfectly as a middle class couple who want to build their dream house. It all starts with reasonable plans and expectations, both of which bite countless complications and initial budget explosions. be sure to entertain fans with stars or late 1940s in Hollywood comedy style. Strict highlighting comes when the contractor passes all the expenses that must be quite excessive for the 1948 audience. When he leaves, he confirms to his client (Grant) that he may be able to get a $ 100.00 reduction ... or at least $ 50.00 ... but certainly $ 25.00. Fun!
