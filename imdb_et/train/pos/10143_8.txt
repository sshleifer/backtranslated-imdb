It was a great episode, one of the best of both seasons. For a change to the right horror, a story that is as far away as the average MOH episode, is such a thing. His husband's wife is almost dead in the tragic car wreck he was driving. His airbag was working, he's not. She is burned down under recognition (big makeup btw) and is not given much opportunity to live without a full skin graft. BUT, even in a coma, he will die, but will bring modern technology, and when he dies in a few minutes, his ghost will be very enthusiastic in spirit. Naturally, there are carnivores, as well as some extreme killings, as well as some very sexy scenes. What more could you ask? Well, not much, because this child has everything and a very satirical ending that should smile for most viewers. I just loved the direction of Rob Schmidt (wrong turn), he has a great horror. Great episode, this is the one I definitely buy.
