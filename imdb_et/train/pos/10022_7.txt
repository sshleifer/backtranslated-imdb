Aro Tolbukhin burned seven people in Guatemala during the 1970s. He also reported that he had murdered another 16 people (he killed pregnant women, and then put them on fire). <br /> <br /> This movie is a documentary that portrays Aro's personality through a series of interviews with people who knew about it and, based on the actual facts, received the scenes played by the actors. <br /> <br /> "Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious job, so analytical, it's not sick at all. Such a terrible testimony of how a childhood trauma can turn into a human monster. <br /> <br /> * My price: 7/10
