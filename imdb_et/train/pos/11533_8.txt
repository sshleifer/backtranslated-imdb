This film, which begins with the interesting opening of two hot blondes, getting it less driver, at the back of a moving vehicle, is a pretty peculiar little personality. Seven cast (although one girl is not talking about body, which is unfortunate because deaths are already so small as everything is), everything is very hot because our story focuses on teenagers in the desert (an odd but effective choice where wild rides black Gloves and Jeans - This is preceded by many vehicle-inspired sliders ("The Trip", "Joy Ride", "Jeepers Creepers"), where the killer vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist, the killer himself is quite horrible, and we find solace in Jennifer McAllister's extremely pleasant heroine (see the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in black, while our benevolent heroine sport event is so small and covered with stones as it may be.) Bill Crain is doing some great things with his camera, some clean tricks on the screen and casting his absolute best In low quantities, there is enough gore to please gore fans and enough R&D for a couple of girls who would like to R&D fans for us All in all, this flip is very underestimated and has been widely searched in the film world because it is quite rare on video. Highly recommended.
