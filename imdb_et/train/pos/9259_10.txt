It was easy and so nice. I think the whole sense of gender segregation in a society that may be bitter was shown very delicately. There was a bitter humper in it. The fact that most of the participants were not professionals made the film more tangible and realistic. There was also a "documentary" for the film. The best scenes were what all the girls who were watching listened passionately to the soldier who was supposed to keep an eye on them by delivering the game. If you are Iranian, familiar with the cheerful and dancing streets after winning the game, you will be filled with national pride !! If you are not Iran, you still love it!
