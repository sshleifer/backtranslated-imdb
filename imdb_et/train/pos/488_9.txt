Some of the enjoyment of this movie was due to the fact that I knew nothing more about it than playing with John Turturro and Emily Watson (two good reasons to watch), a periodical piece and a chess engaging. All that was before me was completely unexpected. That's why I don't give much more. Suffice it to say that Turturro is great as an eccentric, obsessive, and deeply vulnerable male-genius and Em suits him if he is a strong-minded woman. It is more like love and obsession than a respectable board game and after I was gradually pulled out in the first half of the year, it became completely weighty. And I don't want to stop anyone.
