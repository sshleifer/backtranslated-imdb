Eddie Murphy brought me a laugh at my ass with this HBO staging comedy show. I love her impressions of Mr. T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden "The Honeymooners", Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson. Goony Goo Goo is also funny. I saw it for the first time when it came out in 1984. I laughed so hard, I almost fell off my chair. I think it's very funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy, when she was on Saturday Night Live, made me laugh so hard that she was one of the best people coming out on Saturday Night Live. "Eddie Murphy Delirious" is his best standing "Eddie Murphy Raw". <br /> <br /> I give "Eddie Murphy Delirious" 2 thumb and 10/10 stars.
