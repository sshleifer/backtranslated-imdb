This is a story that could have happened somewhere really, given the right circumstances. Street entertainer trying to hear the famous opera star and friendship. An aging entertainer finds / buys a man's child who goes through his art. From there, we observe them through the rigorous rivers of these complex but free rivers. Traveling with the city, it fills and has a certain reputation. Despite the times and influences, man is kind and good. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, performers are first-class, especially Xu Zhu, who represents a street performer. The child (Renying Zhou) is beautiful and honestly strong and has well-known prejudices. Both the protagonists, with the support of Master Liang, a singing opera singer (interesting androgynous Zhao Zhigang), paint a very interesting story about forgiveness, sorrow and love. Some have mentioned the similarities of this film with BA WANG BIE JI (FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE); but this film cannot stand by itself, any similarity is at best far away. <br /> <br /> My only feature with MASKITE KING is the end. It was weak, cliche, and about as fine as a butterfly. The audience was already packed with what was unnecessary manipulation? What a shame. To bring an exquisite film that only give an emotional (and corn) to sin. To be honest, it made the film a good thing instead of the classic. This, aside from the king's king, is still worth the time. I was delighted that Shaw Brothers are still producing good movies. Highly recommended.
