This is overwhelmingly one of my favorites at American Pie Spin, mainly because in most others the main character (one young Stiflers) always seems unrealistic. For example, AP: Naked Mile. You have a teenage boy surrounded by naked college chicks, and he's got one especially hot at his footprint to get rid of his innocence problem, and he finishes in the middle of the deeds and rides a horse to sleep with his girlfriend. he gave him "freedom" over the weekend. I appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole thing, but let us be realistic; most people who watch these movies are not looking for a particularly romantic story. <br /> <br /> Considering that the last installment seems to understand who the audience is and the good old Erik Stifler seems to be waking up and smelling the roses and, as always, lends the humor of his "completely natural" eyebrow to the equation and puts this new movie on below.
