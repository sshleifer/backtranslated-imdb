Taking into account the opposite situation in 2009, where we have a black president, this film is of great historical importance. As a value for entertainment, I found this film to be both interesting and contradictory. Of course, I took the blatant racism of this time, but I also found music and dance incredibly. It is also quite cool to see that Sammy Davis Jr is such a very young child actor. He plays Rufus Jones, a young boy whom his Mammy comforts. He has said, "Why a day you might be president." It was so ridiculous in 1933 that it was mocked and thought to be loving, charming and funny. Most of the movie is a series of fantasy about what the government would be like a black man. They depict government seats as a reviving baptist church. <br /> <br /> The fact was that one day I stumbled upon this film. It pulled me in. It's really well done and very fun. I believe that if we can look beyond racism, we will see this film for all that it brings to us. In fact, understand that the black president is not only ridiculous, but is normal, but makes the film more relevant. It clearly marks the current time of our collective consciousness.
