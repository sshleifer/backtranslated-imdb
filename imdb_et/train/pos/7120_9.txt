Most of the war films made in the US during World War II were very fun to watch, but suffered in reality due to serious gaps, as they were produced more propaganda to raise spirits at home than anything else. I don't knock these films because many of them are still very traceable. But because they don't have reality so often, they have a really big film. An ideal example was John Garfield's Air Force - where B-17 takes almost half of the Japanese Air Force! But the pride of the navy is a welcome departure - an appreciation of the high marks to portray a true story reasonably accurately. When I first saw this movie, I thought it wasn't a real story because it seemed too unlikely to be true. But after further investigation, I found that this was an amazing story of two men who did so much to earn a prize. This is one case where real life seemed really amazing!
