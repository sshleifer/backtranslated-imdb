It is nice to see that Shane Meadows is already having an international impact - LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT shares many topics with ROMEO BRASS: an ambiguous class identity that is over the job, but far below average, unhinged father, abandoned city milieu, adult feeling of failure, barely concealed fascism that supports modern city life. <br /> <br /> But when Meadows is an expert-formist, Mariage trades in pictures and her coolly-crafted, subtly surrealistic, black-and-white, gloomy themes that Meadows-like, veers from a high carnival to a tragedy within seconds. <br /> <br /> There are long and clich√©s, but the Poems are convincingly crazy, a common person with the usual ambitions whose attempts to realize them are dangerous; individual kits - popcorn / pidgeon explosions; Best in marriage order after TIME AND COUNTRY - succeed in grabbing despair.
