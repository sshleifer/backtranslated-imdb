After a number of extremely good ratings for SUPERB, I was very pleased with the film. The film was dark, moving, anger, pain, guilt and a very convincing demon. <br /> <br /> I was originally expecting a lot of special effects, and like hugging a lover, it blew me away with that fine and righteousness. Brian, I've blown up with my art again, telling the story and taking care of the special effects. You're going far, my friend. I'm definitely the president of your fan club. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari, the best actor award, was the number one choice. You did Jr Lopez as a child compared to Kasadya. :) <br /> <br /> Generally, story, high-quality filming and fantastic effect, it was fantastic. I just want it to be longer. I am looking forward to The Dreamless with extremely high expectations,
