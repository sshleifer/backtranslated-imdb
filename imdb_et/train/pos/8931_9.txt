Intruder (L'Intrus), directed by Clair Denis, is the release of the film. It follows its spirit through time, space, and character. There may be a plot, but what I understand is that I pulled out the description of the Netflix DVD sleeve. To be honest, it is probably better to know something about the movie before watching the movie, because then the viewer can leave everything and all expectations. The film requires the viewer to think, but would also deplore the fact that he does not get a complete understanding. <br /> <br /> Human heart is the mystery of the movie. Every picture doubts its role, nature and form. The heart is the intruder, the viewer and the intruder of Louis. Louis's character is played by Michel Subor with this kind of peace and mystery. Frankly, anyone could have played the character of Louis when he has a misleading, ready and comfortable heart. But Subor is here; he becomes a movie, his identity is inseparable from it. Many of the pictures in the film that I think are moving around their outputs, vocals, but mostly physical. the shape he refuses. "Surreal" has been the term used to describe this film, but "quasi-realistic" is a more appropriate term. Nothing in the film does exist outside the possibilities of reality; A simple, all-round score confirms the link between heartbeat and low light in music. Watch the movie to see the consequences of seizing the verse and freedom.
