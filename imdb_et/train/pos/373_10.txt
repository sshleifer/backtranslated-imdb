this movie is such a moving and amazing job. I saw it in the theater when it came out, but I was only 13 years old and didn't really "get it" ... I saw it again when I was 20 years old (of course, in the video and I now own it) & was just blown . Steven Spielberg created a great movie that keeps you going from start to finish. I've also read the book, but there is only something in the movie that really brings life. casting, acting, music, costume, landscape, everything, it's just wonderful. you laugh, you cry, you rejoice ... it brings out every imaginable emotion. this is one of his best works and should not be missed!
