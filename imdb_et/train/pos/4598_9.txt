This is one of Jackies' best films, which he has without the opera Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, which has one of the best openings in every movie and it will continue in the way Jackie shows some high quality tricks. in the middle it becomes a bit slow, but it appears in the last 25 minutes in the movie, and the final credits show what crazy stupid jackie chan is just to keep us movie addicts happy
