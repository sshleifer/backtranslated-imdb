it has been one of the most beautiful portraits I've ever seen on the screen. Andy Goldsworthy is a person who is extinct. he sees the land and nature with such admiration and respect that it is primitive in a good sense. His purity, honesty and goodness breathe clearly when you look at it as simple but full of living artwork. I was surprised how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he took his end. sometimes premature, but his Scottish sense of humor perfectly covers his disappointments. The film is elegantly shooting and contains the same stream of Goldsworthy art. it combines nature and art in a minimal way, as it is in itself. Fred Frith's score is organic enough to mix it all up without disturbing the naturalistic sound. it is generally great in every aspect of the work. it has no limits within the age range.
