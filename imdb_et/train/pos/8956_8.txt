I watched this movie after practical magic and the older film was much better. I liked how the lighting, makeup and costumes changed when Gillian's story changed. The motives of Jimmy Stewart did not do much for me in this film, but I think they served in the Gillian character reserve. I was also struck by Nicky's and Gillian's motives - just as if the director wanted her to appear feminine and Gillian appear as masculine. Nicky makes gestures when he shows Redlich's powers especially to me. I've never thought that warlocks would be feminine, so it was an interesting way to contrast their characters.
