Even with the tired film model that was the cycle of nature and man, which dominated so predominantly in the 1970s, the anxiously barely short, even somewhat effective (though fun for the reasons he did not intend). It's rude. Apparently, these ants that are near the inn have worn poisonous waste for decades and have now adapted to poisonous bites - hundreds of these bites are deadly. Watching some of the celebrity actors in small black spots is terribly funny in non-so good but very bad ways. So many scenes are looking ridiculously: the boy who tries to overthrow the attack, Suzanne Sommers wept in bed, Robert Foxworth and Lynda George at dinner, breathing through the wallpaper, Bernie Casey walking and the list goes on and on. The threat shown extends from ants crawling ants to black lines across the walls. Casting a film is not bad on paper, but none of these actors believe in the material. Poor Myrna Loy must sit in this wheelchair with this horror. I hope he found the good for the money, because it is obvious that this was the only reason why the woman would be in this mess about her descent. Although this is a rather bad film, it is traceable - once for me, and has many of these seventy bad movie qualities - the actors who are familiar with television and the frightened nature who gave up the revenge of nature are tortured. This time, one must influence his hand in the ants. Really quite terrible.
