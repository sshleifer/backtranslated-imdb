I know this is a Power-Rangers trick and designed for 7-year-olds, but why did they really take the film seriously? If they intend to write a plot with a crayon, they have at least a clue to make it a fool. It's kind of fun when you look at it. We have a typical family full of cliched characters (a father's war veteran who lost his wife and blames herself for LOLOL), airy kids trying to fill a stereotype, but can't do a terrible act and a ridiculously frightening bondage with no purpose at the film but fill camera space. Funny things! <br /> <br /> But a real big moment will come to an end when a war-father and a bad-acting criminal try to make a sword fight, but then they realize that no one can do it (probably because there is no room for the budget for choreographers), then they come out with this American Gladiator Type setting. LOL. <br /> <br /> 1/10 rating because they are trying to deal with it seriously.
