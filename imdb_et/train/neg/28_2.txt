This movie is terrible. You don't have to read this review anymore. If you are planning to watch it, it is enough to say - don't (if you don't learn how not to do a good movie). <br /> <br /> Actress is terrible ... serious amateur hour. Throughout the film, I thought it was interesting that they found someone who talks and looks like Michael Madsen to find out it's actually him! New low, even for him! <br /> <br /> The plot is terrible. People who claim to be original or good have probably never seen a proper movie before. Even with Hollywood action keys, it's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it! Go instead to run - at least you don't feel like killing yourself.
