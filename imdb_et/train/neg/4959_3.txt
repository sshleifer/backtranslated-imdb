Remember that in the 90's good animated animated exhibition? What did people praise? What can people of all ages appreciate? One that showed Batman as a real detective, rather than being a Hull spot? Who had the villains could be involved? One with real motive attacks? <br /> <br /> Well, Warner Bros. So it's a dreck. <br /> <br /> Do these people know anything about batman? Have they even been watching the batman comic before? Do they know that Batman is "detective"? Connecting 2 tips doesn't make you detective! It makes you a somewhat intelligent monkey. <br /> <br /> This is the basic layout of the episode: <br /> <br /> Penguin steals something. "Opening a Credit". Batman finds a dead donation from where he is. Batman goes there and goes in trouble. Commercial. Batman finds it obviously / foolishly. Penguin escapes. Penguin does something obvious. Batman follows. They do kung-fu (by the way, and I mean ALL knowing kung-fu for some reason). Batman penguin. he's fighting. goes to archaic. (Note: this is usually any crap for every episode) <br /> <br /> Well, as you have noticed, Batman is not a big detective. "Joker left this cotton candy on the ground, maybe he's in an old amusement park!" Yes, maybe he was the last 6 times. <br /> <br /> And I've already mentioned it, but everyone knows KUNG-FU! DO NOT PENGUIN! What do they think? (probably because it's from people who made this Jackie Chan animated series) <br /> <br /> What really upsets it is that the show is just an action. No smarts. Missing. If batman needs thinking, he uses technology, then do some kung-fu. <br /> <br /> But don't forget the villains. Afterall what would be batman without his rogueside gallery? <br /> <br /> Well, first, I have to say for originality. I don't think other batman mediums would have seen jokers and fear locked monkeys, a migrant like emo, and poison ivy as a minor (which is confusing if you think his sexuality doesn't have to be his main strength?) <Br / > <br /> What's more, each character is now a 2-dimensional, stereotypical cramp. <br /> <br /> Killer Croc wants to flood Gotham without reason. <br /> <br /> Man-Bat is a powerful hungry scientist who has somewhat unexplained bats. <br /> <br /> Penguin just wants to steal everything. Without reason. <br /> <br /> Attention to the pattern here? <br /> <br /> But the most offensive must be Mr. Freeze. <br /> <br /> Do you remember Emmy's award-winning "Heart of Ice" episode from Batman: Animated Series? Who gave Mr. Freeze's motives for his crimes? This episode that was so good that it was used in comics with its original back story (crazy scientist)? What made her a victim, with a purpose? Hell, even Batman & Robin admitted using it as P. Freezes' origin in this P.O.S. in the movie. <br /> <br /> Well, this series says "F # ck," and makes Freeze a jeweler before the accident, just for his wealth, then freezes and gives him the chance to do cold things. He then steals the jewelry for no reason, saying sh 't lines like "Ice Day". <br /> <br /> Maybe they did for Batman and Robin. <br /> <br /> But hey, look bright. This series does something for you in Sweden, which means you are a good person. Good for you.
