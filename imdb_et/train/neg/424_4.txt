Yesterday was Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the US and other countries, and I went to watch DisneyNature's full feature "Earth" movie. I think, like car manufacturers, Disney is trying to convince them that they care about the planet. Maybe they care about the planet, I don't know, but I don't think it justifies a special entity with the word "nature". I know my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse and who am I to say one year of my personal feelings about Disney? <br /> <br /> Apart from incredible cinematography, it was a typical Disney disappointment for me. Previously, half a dozen Disney movie trailers, with Disney clich√© ("biography", "style"), over-dramatic music, recycled film material (Disney claims "40% new movie"). I even started thinking that the story of James Earl Jones is a little boring. I like James Earl Jones, but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman, who makes every Warner Brothers narrative, begins to wear thin. I really think Disney bought the BBC's natural photography, which was so remarkable, they felt they were selling themselves when they hit the orchestra's music and recognizable sound. <br /> <br /> And what is Disney's obsession with breastfeeding and killing of predators? There were half a dozen such scenes that, along with their full-fledged youngsters, were on their throat. I think Disney has to admit that animals have a rich and interesting life in life and death that draws attention to film-oriented teens dragged by their parents to the film. I was also aware of how Disney was unable to understand well that people had something to do with climate change. Are they afraid of such small minorities that they think it is still a controversial topic? <br /> <br /> I recommend deleting it and renting a Blue Planet on Netflix. Natural movies are now best seen by the British.
