This is one of the worst-written movies I've ever had to sit on. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing new - but it's a comic, so who cares if it's nice and fun? <br /> <br /> I'm not going as deep as testimonials, or I'm here all day (except to say there's no one; characters change personality when it's comfortable on the plot), but someone who wrote the script and the visual direction should be denied access to both the pencil and the paper. Thumbs down? I'd vote for my thumbs. <br /> <br /> "Object / object narrowing. Cut back close to character. The character gives a conscious look that the viewer does not even understand. Repeat this several times with different items / props." <br /> <br /> "Make it not to ignore the characters on all the huge rocks that float around, fall into each other, usually ruin all the time and that could kill them all at any time - but make them stop and fear when they see a harmless, almost pastoral green stone in the distance. "<br /> <br /> The whole thing is a long sequence of events, actions, and behaviors that are just for the convenience of the writer to save him from thinking or trying to write the story correctly <br /> <br /> This is a plan for CG cartoons 9 except that he has no Ed Wood storm factor to have fun watching. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor: Spend your Pixar movie budget.
