OK, but is this a good movie? Well, not really, I don't think so much to recommend. I found it very slow, tedious, in fact, it's predictable pretty much through, and through number one and two were somewhat predictable, but not so much. I thought this movie was occasionally quite combed, which I didn't really think that series and character fit. he is a decent enough actor but I felt he was playing his character too up. I think it fits the film's tone that would have been nice if I had liked the movie. Arnold Vosloo returns to title role, but little work has been done in this film. The character hasn't really developed as I had hoped. Well. That's just my opinion. it's not quite bad, it's pretty bad. I vote for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
