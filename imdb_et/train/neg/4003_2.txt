Great disappointment. It was one of the best British criminal dramas / detective exhibitions of the 90s, which has developed the exciting title of Scotland's Robbie Coltrane. But this one-off is a little add-on and maybe will inevitably suffer a downturn due to an increase in expectations if the preferred show returns after a long break. Coltrane doesn't really do much, much more attention is paid to an uninteresting killer, and what he has to do seems to be almost boring. The story of a former soldier is written by books and the attempt to renew us from Coltrane's family seems easy. Perhaps if the writers had a whole series of them in one hour, they would have written it deeper. As it is, skip it and look at the old Cracker 90's, which is much better.
