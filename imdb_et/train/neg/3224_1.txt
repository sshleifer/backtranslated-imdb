When I was a child, I remember watching it when I visited our "Uncle" Phil friend. We're back! The story of Dinosaur is a silly comic from a dinosaur called Rex (expressed by the wonderful John Goodman). He tells the story of a toddler's dinosaur about how dinosaurs came back to Earth. He explains that he was part of what brought them back with his friends. The doctor / professor of this film, a villain, thought he might have been responsible for them, but I don't care about him. Children may like it, but personally it is just too cheesy. John Goodman was probably the only decent thing. Poor!
