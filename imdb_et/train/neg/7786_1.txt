I should never have seen this movie. The style of filming can be considered artistic, but for me it is considered to be migraine-inducing. I think it might have been an interesting plot, but since I couldn't look at it for a long time, I missed a lot. Blinking pictures and filming motion stopped my brain. I stopped in the meantime and won't come back the second time. I think if I were my beacon alone in the dark and rushed in the evening, it might just be a ticket ... PS Not sure if the lighthouse / movie style can be considered a spoiler, but I don't want to be in the black list on my first review;)
