-They include a spoiler ... but believe me, this movie violates itself from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I went to this movie with great expectations. It was my own fault. So far I was too much in stock at Steve Carelli's record. 40-year-old virgin ... Little Miss Sunshine ... Occupation. And I also made a mistake for IMDb and 7.5 user ratings before going to the movie. It has always been a very good predictor in the past, but lately it has definitely been out. The last time I felt this embarrassed and this great effort in the movie theater was "Blue Steel" in 1990. <br /> <br /> This flick started from beginning to end. The script was a buggy material. Awful writing whole. "Murder of Love"? "Love is the ability"? Who wrote this devil suffers the same misery that hit American Beauty writer (s) ... trying too hard waaaaayyyyyy. The whole flick was with the Peppered Three Company, like a terrific and lively shower. Or a pointless / confusing aerobics scene. Or a terrible laundry room scene. True, if you think that something serious and / or real is happening, they will cast one of these terrible moments. And it happens over and over again. <br /> <br /> What is Carell's character? Man meets in the bookstore somewhat flat and is suddenly in love? Let's face it. Their conversation sucked. They both had to say goodbye after a few minutes. Pay attention to the initial conversation if you have the misfortune of watching this movie .... The character of Carelli is trying to say something that is completely random and un-funny (I think the exact line was "once when I was a boy" ... it it is serious), but both laugh so hard that coffee starts to run out of its nose. The actors themselves saw they were hurt, wondering why they were directed to do what they did. <br /> <br /> Back to IMDb ... you have to figure out to keep the movie ad team out of this site. I know it is impossible, but it is painfully obvious that the first 20 evaluations / reviews were posted by a 12-year-old or a studio-hired flunk. Check out Family Stone's rating ... if it is in the middle of the 5th century, it must be 2 ... and it pushes it.
