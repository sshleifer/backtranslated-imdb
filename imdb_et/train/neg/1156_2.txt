Watching Tenants have been an interesting experience for me. This is the first movie I've ever seen, where I've gone through speed (not) in action - and I can generally look at everything from strenuous movies to Serbo-Croatian indie and find them interesting. <br /> <br Tenants are frustratingly slow and overpriced. One of the main problems with the script is the lack of realistic character dialogue, except for the set pieces, where the characters "collide" in a highly structured environment (to do this, the film needed to be more conceptually familiar with what it didn't do). This leads to a lack of real character development; everyone looks two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Worse, Bill Spear, namely Snoop Dogg. I found her character is very uncomfortable and very uncomfortable. At one point I even stopped the movie because I was so annoyed that the character was aggressive, violent and monotonous, the absence of any other layer of personality besides the reactive switch (which will eventually become predictable) and I desperately wanted him to have some salvation properties. But one reason for this jar can be the blurry time zone of the film (supposedly 70s, seems and seems more early noughties). If it were more firmly fixed in the 70s, its character might be more sensitive. <br /> <br /> The film's lighting was also inconvenient. To the end, the soundtrack tries to provide a particular jazz-infused atmosphere that simply didn't come out, mainly because the kit was too well lit. <br /> <br /> Tenants, for me, are an incredible movie. It does not represent real people and does not offer interesting ways of race, identity or writer's life, be they white or black. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, I came to realize that this project needed David Lynch; his fearful, clastrophic and obsessive look and feel would have raised both the actors and the script something very remarkable.
