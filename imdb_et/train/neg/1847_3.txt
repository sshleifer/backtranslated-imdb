SCHIZOPHRENIAC: MOST MANGLER is another example of what happens when you get a lot of uninvited people to make an "extreme" horror movie. Any action, production, storyline, FX, etc ... go out of the window to create a "shock value". Now, don't get me wrong - I consider myself a "shock" movie and slider / gorier / nastier expert, the better - but it's still nice to see some of the talent included in SOMEONE's movie. <br /> <br /> SCHIZOPHRENIAC crowns Harry Russo's life - drug addictive exhibition that takes orders to kill his ventriloquist dummy Rubberneck. He continues with some spies who kill whores and other casual people, and screams how much he hates "hoo-uhs" (this is "whores" for those who don't speak the New York item ...) and how he wants to rape them fucked . There is little weak necrophil scenes, very little gore and a little nudity to get things mixed up, but something that hasn't been seen in a better movie ... <br /> <br /> The only redeeming thing I find is this slow motion movie headmaster Harry often (involuntarily?) having fun screaming fast. She goes on and wants her to kill everyone and make them fucked and it will become pretty comical after some time. In fact, I am almost tempted to believe that this movie should be a homo-erotic undertones, where all the talk of the ass and the constant images of Harry run around. To be honest, this is the joke in this movie, some chicks that show T-and-A (and some full-length, good measurements). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is a bit amusing as a one-time clock, but I can only recommend it to those who want to say they watched a movie called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: WHORE MANGLER. To be honest - the title is by far the best trash ... Great 3.5 / 10
