We loved Rock and Jack Black School. We couldn't wait to watch this movie. It was the only time in my life that the film was so bad that I wanted to go out. My husband hated it too. The only funny parts were trailers. My husband and I wanted to stand outside the cinema and tell people to save money. Writing was terrible. It was every terrible stereotype of the Spanish people who should be completely offended. The film wasn't that long, but it seemed to us forever. People in the theater were as restless and quiet as the drying of the paint. I was staying with my husband because I was sure there might be some redeeming parts, but it wasn't there. Save money and time.
