I see people writing how big this movie was. It was terrible! Action was at the best possible level. It made a lot of money because teenage girls went to watch the movie 7 times in the theaters of Leonardo. When the hell did they get the money? Anyway, I wanted to know more about Titanic; why he sank, which ran through the thoughts of many people; maybe even a little conspiracy. Does anyone realize that some people didn't even get on board because there was a fire on the board before he even took off? No, you are not, because everything you see is a rich girl who falls into the hands of a poor boy and he paints him naked (did this nasty junk at least tell you that the movie was stupid?). <br /> <br /> However, I shouted during one scene. Scene when they showed the ship's filling water. It seemed like the pool water! I think this movie made all that money and they couldn't even really see the ocean water? incredible ... <br /> <br /> Ohhh band played when the ship sank. Just ridiculous. It was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor was "in reality".
