In a word: embarrassing. It was later recommended to read some articles about the philosophical meanings of this film, but having sat through the film for 115 minutes and slowly split under the swollen symbolism and flowing oppression of the stage, it seemed better to simply announce his reactions to the film. After all, who's going to watch the movie with the curriculum? And that flick was annoying. Lead actor Claude Laydu, who is opening the film until its end, carries the same weary and tedious torture mask that it is practically indistinguishable from the movie's eternal, harsh voice. Filming on top of each other could have worked better than listening to the audience, as they basically say: Ambricourt's priest is a sad person. The story of a persecuted priest who is trying to help a wealthy family in trouble does nothing to make his characters far from interesting or sympathetic, because the family is a host of unpleasant strangers, and the priest himself, like a self-inflicted pest. In the last 30 minutes, some breathtaking message about grace and one man's suffering, which is equivalent to other people, is recommended, but thanks to all the sufferers of Laydu and the indefinite subtext of Robert Bresson's script, I felt everything, finally, it's over, let's be some ice cream. Interesting fans of Bresson fanatics Paul Schrader to see how many elements characterize and configure Schrader in their scripts and movies, especially "Taxidriver", "Raging Bull" and "Light Sleeper".
