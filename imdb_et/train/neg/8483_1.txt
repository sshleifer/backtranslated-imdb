I usually only write movies that I really hated or really liked. And as you think there are many stars, I didn't like it. By now I expect you to have read or maybe even seen a movie, so I skip this summary. Let's break it down, pros and cons: <br /> <br /> Cons: Definition: The premise was created interesting. The use of Chaos theory as a theme was interesting. But it wasn't done as well. Correct me when I'm wrong, but it seems to me that the chaos theory was one that was wrong. The film's event seemed more like a coincidence than something. I think the Butterfly effect was represented by the whole "God (s) cause the tsunami to return." However, the presentation is really sloppy. Some people call it intelligent, but it just seems to be another trained film. <br /> <br /> Story: Is it just me or does it seem that Kamal just threw it together to give him an excuse to play ten roles? The plot is extremely busy; Govind continued the vial as many times as lost in the accident (his friend just shuffled the vial with a packet sent to India, the crazy old woman just happens to throw the vial into the idol, half molded just happens to unexpectedly meet in the same hospital and happened to the idol just to mix with the famous singer's fame.) <Br /> <br /> CGI: Oh God, CGI. It was even worse than jaw 3 and sucked special effects. Immediately I could tell which parts were animated. Even my ten-year-old cousin knows that underwater cars don't seem like that. <br /> <br /> Stunts: Yes, I now have no realistic scenes in Tamil movies, but the stunts were terrible and pulled me away. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that they did a better job than expected. I thought Kamal was playing with people with similar skin tones, so both fake white boys and the fake Japanese Aikido boy caught me. But it was still pretty bad, I can easily tell you what the masks were. <br /> <br /> Songs: Music was in many cases disturbing and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Asin: His character was the most disturbing in the movie. He was loud, ditsy and obsessed with this idol. I found myself wanting to die. difference between a vial of chocolate and a deadly virus. And then, the former CIA agent who is after drawing the vial is towards India. Instead of following it immediately, he first marries a dancer. Famous Punjab singer with cancer control in a third world small town hospital when he got the best treatment. What's more, he is put on a throat ball. You think he's being killed, but instead the magic bullet has cleared his tumor. You read this right, BULLET knocked out the tumor. <br /> <br /> Pros ... The Naidu Character: The only pleasant part of the movie was his comedy.
