There are so many comments on this movie, but I found them misleading. This is a corner-up, over-exploitable scenario where a normal person becomes a visible cause of a criminal partner against someone else's sex. The boy meets the girl. The girl keeps the boy in something at the gun point something ridiculous. The boy is interesting. <br /> <br /> You know the drill: The antagonist turns out to be a wild, free spirit instead of sociopaths ... Put some wisdom in words with Alice Drummond and you have a recipe for love. Sheedy is "is he crazy or just needs hugging?" The role of the breakfast club is simply leading. And all that's left is the movie's truly strange turkey.
