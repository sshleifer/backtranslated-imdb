What can I say about this movie except "can't see it". I waited and waited and waited for something (or something) to happen and it just didn't come. Amazingly, two people are walking around, setting one of the most filling times for a movie. What are they doing? Will they solve the mystery? Do they collect clues? Maybe it's just hard to say. At the end of the movie after decoding many radio signals (unclearly on some PET monitors) and this guy gives some lectures, the graph is finally revealed and canceled as soon as possible. Some foreigners want to return to the utopia of their home world and are so happy that they want to blow up on earth (I don't think they like sharing wealth). I think they finished filming and saw their 35-minute work or art (garbage!) And decided that they would give the editing team this 88-minute film. Look at your threat, it's not even funny, because it's so bad, it's just bad.
