This is a terrible production by Bartleby, though not, as the other reviewer did, because it is "unclear", but because this version does not preserve the spirit of the book. It tells the story almost painfully. Looking at it, I took the pages of my book and followed those that aren't so fun when dealing with adaptation. Rather, look at Bartleby's 2001 version of Crispin Glover. This version, albeit humorous, brings new details to the film while retaining the novel spirit. Spirit is important, not the peculiarities of things, the names of the character, and the costumes. The difference between these film versions is like night and day, annoying and fun. This version is a lesson about what can go wrong if adaptation is done poorly, painfully, spiritually.
