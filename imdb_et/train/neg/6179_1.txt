This movie is the second worst film I've ever seen (the first is Ghost Rider). There is absolutely no plot, climax, conflict or other important detail in the story. This "film" is basically just one excuse for Toby Keith to show his male side and "the hard guy he really is". Watching this movie, I wasted my time. The best part should be the end credits. When I was Ebert or Roper, I would have cut my thumbs and threw them at the manufacturers. Whoever in the right sense gave Toby Keith the opportunity to act in a feature film is obviously the same spiritual level as his. In conclusion, don't waste your time watching this movie, it may be the only thing you regret.
