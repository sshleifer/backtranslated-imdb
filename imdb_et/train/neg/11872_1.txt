The only way this is a family drama is when parents explain everything wrong with their message. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: They eat a deer after a year and kill it after eating after the mother's killing and at first trying to take responsibility for their actions. They blame the bear and the deer for "wrong" eating when they do not undertake to use adequate locks and gardens, or even learn to shoot, not twice for the redemption of animals and letting them shoot.
