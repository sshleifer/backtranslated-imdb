This film is so bad and worsens in every imaginable way. This is not just a bad act and a script, nor is that one flat and perverted time looking at it. What really changes this film to its stigma is the obvious struggle that writers and producers make with the film to try and make fun of it. The replacement of Jean Reno's successor is old and learned on the first film of their lesson that they would add a new girl to be married. Almost all the original extras and gags are returning, but this time it makes me look out of my nests because it is a good film waste. Torture and shots of continuous camera shots in any scene of this movie can be put into violent convolutions by the viewer. This second film takes the successful original and pulls it out of the coffin and parades on the public pitch, and wrongly worsens not only the original idea and its legacy, but also our intelligence. This film, unlike the firewood, was unable to fly because it had not returned to the plot with the "necklace" in the principals. There is no script because it was probably written and added daily. No attention to camera or frames. Bad lighting and special effects made for this. This film does not even go to the film of 101 mainstream students. It was a huge losing investment and it seemed that no one had the power to put this unnatural cruel error out of our suffering. This movie has one good part ... your end! This movie is the worst movie of all time, finally "Howard The Duck" is no longer a goose.
