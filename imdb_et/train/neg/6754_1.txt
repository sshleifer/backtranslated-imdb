The only reason I am disturbing commenting on this movie is to save all your life for 97 minutes and maybe your money. <br /> <br /> I bought it for renting Â£ 3.00, it seemed interesting, so I took the opportunity. <br /> <br /> In a few minutes after turning it on, I realized I made a mistake. The entire mold must be stored until the winter and then thrown into the nearest fire where they could meet more of their nature. <br /> <br /> For Devin Hamilton (writer and director), he should have unfortunately been supposed to have done it before he made this garbage. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie when you see it running in stores. <br /> <br /> 1/10
