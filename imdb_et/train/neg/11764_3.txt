I have to say that I was really looking forward to watching this movie and found a new life in it that would separate it from the most dull and over-crafted Mexican films. I have no idea why I trusted Sex, Pudor y Lagrimas, to have a freshness and confidence in our non-existent industry injection. Maybe it was because the soundtrack (which I listened to before the movie was seen) sounded different from the others, maybe it was because he dared to add newer faces (except Demian Bichir, who is always a favorite of Mexican film directors) and allegedly engaged a modern social behavior script might have been because the photography I saw on trailers was bright and realistic instead of theater. The film turned out to be a great crowd entertainment and a great backlog. What Serrano is actually doing here is the very old "sex battle", as "all people are the same" and "why all women ..."; blah, blah, blah. There is nothing new about it, not even that it uses so much common ground and clichés that it ultimately captures itself without leaving a valuable reflex of a woman's / man's condition. Filled with a regular tramp audience, like safe gags about the clichés I used to talk about (those who always work, always) and screaming performances (that's a good thing about the movie in its context) .. and I mean, literally, shouting. For the first time, more convincing Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir players are more pathetic than Serrano. I do not agree completely with Serrano, they should not have dealt with this way only to serve his lesson as marionettes ... he made sure that we received his message and completely destroyed their roles, which were the only strong foundations on which this story could have been to be. Anyway, this is a very fun movie from time to time and you probably have a good time to see it (if you agree to manipulate it).
