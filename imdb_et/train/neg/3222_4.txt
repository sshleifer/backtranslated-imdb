I was very disappointed with this 1970 film based on the story of Bernard Malamud. In principle, this is a story about the fulfillment of life due to possible redemption, racial prejudice and distrust. <br /> <br /> The black Jewish angel is sent to help the troubled rag and his critically ill woman. When Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) only believes in an angel (Belafonte), his wife Fanny (Ida Kaminska) returns. The problem is that Morris has basically given up life and just refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel. <br /> <br /> If he believes it will improve Fanny, but eventually he has doubts and Fanny will suffer. It would have been great if the last scene had been translated into English when Fanny, who was dying, spoke to Morris. <br /> <br /> Jan Kadar, who led Miss Kaminska successfully at the excellent stage of the Oscar announced in the 1966s. The main street shop also directs this movie. In the film, Kaminska mostly cuts the bed and his kindness in his speech does not convey the desperate situation he is facing. She still calls her daughter Ruthie, who did not hear them without getting married to the Jewish religion. For most movies, he doesn't understand Angel's appearance in his apartment. <br /> <br /> The pharmacy scene is confusing and the scene where Angel's girl travels to Belafonte in her apartment is memorable, but all too short. <br /> <br /> We don't know why Belafonte is in danger and why he's dead. <br /> <br /> Those who watch this movie must be depressed and desperate from the theater.
