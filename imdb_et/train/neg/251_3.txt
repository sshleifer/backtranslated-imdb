I was so excited to see this movie after this week's book. My 13 year old son is waiting for it. I rented it and went down to enjoy the classical holiday that lived on the screen. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was disappointed. This film was more of a book than forgiving. George C. Scott is a great actor, but it seemed he was only about 20% of the time. For the rest of the time he was pretty flat. <br /> <br /> I understand that it was made in '84, pre-CG effects, mostly. But it seemed to be a very B-film quality, especially a meeting with Jacob Marley. The biggest disappointment was that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Spirit Christmas Present takes the Scrooge into the world whirlwind, observing people in the most difficult situations that still have Christian time and light. <br /> <br /> I testify that Mr Scott did a good job at the end of the "reformed" Scrooge. It was a refreshing idea. <br /> <br /> I would like Bob Cratch to be a bit more wretched and inferior. And Tiny Tim ... oh don't even start with the bad kids actors ...
