This film was promising: my favorite actor in the historical drama of the War of Independence. It had memories of "Dances With Wolves" for big prairies, Indians, military struggles and "Barry Lyndon" for British and candlelight atmosphere ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is terrible: the story is not constantly (paragraphs) 5 months later ";" 3 years later ") and romance is so ridiculous that it is hard to believe: America is a great country, but characters against each other; Above all, wait for the end and you will understand how to kill the story (imagine the same "Titanic"). <br /> <br /> Sometimes a brilliant movie maker saves a bad script. Unfortunately, Hisson is bad. She's already committed to "Greystoke" and I found the same mistakes again: dynamics in scenes, editing, evaluating: it's long, boring, flat .... <br /> <br /> I knew this movie was Pacino Career Disaster: Now I understand. Finally, this last film for 2006 is for me this year's vein: painful ...
