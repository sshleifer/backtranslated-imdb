This movie is really boring. It was banned in Chinese cinema and I see why. It is not because it criticizes the Communist regime, but simply because the film is so low quality. I'd never want to watch this money. I love the movies Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimo and I am disappointed that such a bad film can come out of China. It seems that this audience ignores and the director seems to have made the film himself. The images of a person standing here who do nothing up to a minute are fun and there are many. Cinematography and video quality are incredibly bad. I watched this movie on the Net and it seems like people really like this movie. The only explanation that I have is that some movie films think that if the movie is not in English, it is automatically good. I see no reason why people would like it. it is not an art film that is a waste of celluloid.
