... which is not exactly a ringtone confirmation. In general, "DinoCroc" was a much better film. Of course, in this film, Matt Borlenghi played a full bag-bag that spent the whole film crying for his little brother, which DinoCroc eats. However, the special effects of "DinoCroc" were better, the plot features were better and performance improved. There are problems with "Blood Surf" - 1. The killer crocodile looks like a child model with a retractable jaw. 2) The plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. gets a shipwreck on a devastated island, where they come across a stupid group of stupid Filipino natives trying to force a group of women. What a complete 15-minute movie. And 3) not enough croc time. "Blood Surf" is a couple of redeeming qualities - the actors are quite attractive and Matt Borlenghi eats at the end of the movie. But if you are in your graveyard and have enough time to watch one of Matt Borlenghi's / killer crocodile movie, leave it out and come up with DinoCroc instead.
