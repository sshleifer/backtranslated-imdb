I didn't think this movie was worth anything bad, bad behavior, except Janine Turner, fantasy, stupid plot, buggy husband and unfair divorce settings. If you have never seen this movie, it doesn't even bother to be worth it. The only thing that was good was that Janine Turner did a good job. Terry's wife is stuck in a smart ass defender who has won many cases and even murderers murderers. She thinks she's so smart, but she's really just a nut. Her best friend communicates with her husband and puts her on. Nice girl. Yes, he is a real peach, not. She's not a day at the beach.
