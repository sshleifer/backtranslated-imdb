If it were 0, it would be. It's a terrifying wood that works for a boring, hitting pace, a drunken corner of exploitation, and sophomoric pseudolesbian titillation, which is only added for the sake of sad viewers, this is a movie disaster. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable because from the start it is absolutely certain what happens to all the characters and how the plot starts. Bored, abnormal from beginning to pathetic and gloomy, it takes every single presence in this movie wasted, and the backlog of talents excavated for this turkey is destroyed. <br /> <br /> If you want something to look at, look at one of Ilsa's movies, because it is relentless and a little bit childlike titling. At least they are unpopular and in the forefront of what they are trying to do. How something that was terribly bad for a rating of over 5 years is a miracle how people with no taste or remarkable standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious purposes. <br /> <br /> It is not scary, it is not interesting and above all it does not create a word in some sense. In my opinion, this is a crime; it is a crime that such a terribly offensive and incompetent bin is ever provided and has the resources that come to light, and even more so the tragedy that it is still protected by some shamefully misleading viewers. <br /> <br /> Even Elvira's cheerful personality and jokes cannot soften the shock that this scary movie image has. Avoid it at all costs.
