Don't watch this movie when you value your mind. At the end of our collective viewing, I and my friends thought we lost 5% of our brains during our course. The only person who was involved in doing what was not clinically crazy was a set designer. <br /> <br /> Most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth. Now I understand that instead of this movie, which is a feeling of irritation, there is deep hatred in me. I hate this movie so much, very much. <br /> <br /> Some may say that this movie is not meant to be serious. If only it did not take itself seriously. But it is. The plot is a warmed-up version of the Blade Runner-esque universe covered with bad rubber suits that are so common in bad dinosaur films. Dialogue is not only gentle and meaningless, but often painful. Whoopee Goldberg doesn't even try, but the voice of George Newbern as Theodore Rex is like the nails of the soul. And whether his Julia Landua is once again a British accent or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) as a bursting Commissioner, then the growing disbelief and disappointment will sink. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie only to anyone who wants to see the depth of stupidity where humanity can fall.
