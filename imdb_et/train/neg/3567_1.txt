This male Louis (Dale Midkiff), mother Rachel (Denise Crosby), 10-year-old Eileen (Blaze Berdalh and about 3-year-old Gage (Miko Hughes)) is moving into this beautiful Maine house - it seems to be aware of what rumbles along the road in her house in front of every 90 seconds! The neighbor along the way (wonderful Fred Gwynne) makes them home ... and shows them a pet cemetery where the kids bury their pets. is a sacred land that can bring the dead to life ... but the dead will come back from the nasty. <br /> <br /> "" DEFINITE SPOILERS ** Stephen King's novel was good - it was long but it evolved into characters and situations that made you worry about what happened. and violence. Animals are killed with a camera (I know it is counterfeit, but it is still reluctant); half-kidnapped and his cage hit during a funeral (completely sick scene), he is back in life and attacks and kills people, including his mother (I don't know how a three-year-old was able to hang him); A ghostly runner (don't ask) is trying to help the family for some reason ... The movie just works for an audience that moves every merciful death or violence on the face. It just goes on to shock you. ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> There is no help in action. Midkiff is just as terrible as Dad - he is beautiful and buff, but completely empty. Crosby is not much better. Two children are just annoying. Only Gwynne saves this image with its effortlessly good action. <br /> <br /> This picture shows complete contempt for an audience that takes great jumps and has characters with stunningly stupid things (especially at the end of Midchiff). This film (inexplicably) was a huge ticket office in 1989, which made it even worse in 1992. I saw it in the theater theater and disturbed how the audience rejoiced in the violence and what I just saw. Ill reluctant horror movie. 1 all the way. <br /> <br /> If you think it's all over and can't get worse, Ramones will sing the song title !!!!!! ("I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery"). Really beyond faith.
