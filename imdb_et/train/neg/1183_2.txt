That and immoral stories left my mouth in bad taste. It seems to me that Borowczyk is sexual, and these two movies are warning stories about what happens when you have sex. It's not very well done as a film - some actors are really irrelevant (for example, an "American" woman with a French accent). The unexpected flip-flop of a young woman is not interested in the interests of marriage (if it seems that it should have been the other way around) and the aunt's unexpected young man's secret does not make sense - they have not been explained at all. I also didn't like how the daughter's relationship with black was presented as an indicator of family perversion or self-confidence. The central idea, the idea that this "sexy beast" is, if you live in the woods, could have been the basis for a perverted but fun story, but instead it is simply a nasty sex-negative, moral game.
