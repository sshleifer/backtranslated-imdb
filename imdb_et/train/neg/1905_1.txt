I am one of the biggest fans of quiet comics and I have probably reviewed more Buster Keaton movies for IMDb than any other person. Every movie he made from the beginning of his career to the beginning of the 1930s, with only two exceptions, has been reviewed so you can say I'm a big fan. That's why I found this episode so painful and hard to see. I loved this man's movies and thought "Buster, how are you?!". Well, now that I think about it, I think I can understand why Buster Keaton played this TWILIGHT ZONE in a godly episode. He had lost much of his fortune after the dirty divorce in the early 1930s, and his film career was over. Now, in the 1960s, Keaton needed money and loved the recovery of his popularity, so he hitched himself to someone who wanted to pay - it appeared in the beach movies and the big series episode. The biggest problem with the episode is that it is just terribly written and Buster deserves much better. The show should be funny, but it is not, and instead of respecting silent films, it's just a painful look - especially Keaton, who put this stupid journey and all the bad stuffs to hit. Take your advantage, NEXT ONE - this is a pale imitation of the size that was once Keaton's career !!!
