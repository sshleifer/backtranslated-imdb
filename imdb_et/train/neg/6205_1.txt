So they jumped on violence and have been sick. Well, violence is the best thing I am afraid of, but unfortunately, the characters have not developed enough to understand why they are going to their (completely predictable) rampage. This movie has a really terrible script. We will never get the chance to get to know Robert and his actions will end up being pathetic. Operation is not much better either, the worst is a TV cook and a school teacher. The direction is clumsy, with enough tempo to sleep. And what on earth is the school's film project? Maybe a movie comment? Using a newsletter during a climatic murder is ridiculous. These men probably think they are intellectuals but are hopelessly out of their depths. How did they get the great Yorgos Arvanid in the countryside to illuminate it. I never know. And how they got the money to do it first is an even greater secret. Absolutely terrible outside understanding.
