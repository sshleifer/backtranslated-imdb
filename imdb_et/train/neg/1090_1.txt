it was the most pointless film I've ever seen since there was no plot and the actors didn't seem to care. 90% of the film had no plot, I laughed so much that my ribs began to sore. a little where old men were ridiculous to catch Robert Duvall. the director's level does not involve a lot of rainfall in the noir film and the nonsense close-ups of the main character. it is an unsuccessful attempt to create a ripple thriller and instead alienates the viewer from inconsistent scenes. Because it is based on John Grisham's "Manuscript", I do not read it as one of my film adaptation books, as it does not show any intercourse or engagement in films such as "company" or "umbrella".
