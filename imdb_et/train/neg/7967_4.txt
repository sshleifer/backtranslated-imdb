I may not be an enormous admirer of the original "Creepshow", but the sequel to this trash is that the anthology looks like perfection! And I think I'm going to wait for that one more. Five years after its predecessors, George Romero returns to the EC Comic-style track, and at this trip, Steve King writes a three-reading scenario. Although the direction is given to Michael Gornick. The film is mostly uneven in this regard with Gornick's uneven brushes. But most of the guilty should go to Romero's terribly static and unbearably harsh script (especially those dialogues that pass the first and last story). Moral messages (which mostly came from a sour heap) simply took over black humor. Oh, it was painful and the same can be said about the live rotten music accompanying the picture. By loosely linking these three stories (Old Chief Woodhead, The Raft and The Hitchhiker), it is a pleasantly curious and effective surrounding story made in the form of nostalgia (80s) animation. I liked this segment rather than glowing light. <br /> <br /> # The First Story "The Old Chief Woodenhead" sees two older owners (George Kennedy & Dorothy Lamour) from a general store in a dead local community at Dead River. Allow you to rob and finally kill a few points that die in Hollywood. In front of the store is a wooden figure from the Indian chief who lives to get their death. <br /> <br /> - Listen to George Kennedy's wafer .. And whip for 10 minutes, how he's committed to his "big" community. What a nice funny time. Well, just like Kennedy's calls, this is one monotonous colorless and redundant item that never makes a good assumption. The scary script is normal and the formats are suitable. These two factors really added my headache. When an Indian lives and turns to himself, the gons will meet very quickly (though tough) with death in the right way. The effects were praiseworthy, but what about this free-flowing hair. How would Hollywood get back to this haircut? Ugh! <br /> <br /> The second story "Raft" follows a group of smokers and yahoo teenagers who are moving into a lonely lake. After swimming in a lake in the middle of the lake, they are trapped on the platform because there is a malicious looking creature in the water. <br /> <br /> - It's much better now, much better. What begins when your main teenagers run is mysteriously creepy, full of tense and claustrophobic tension. And it does not pull out the flash of nudity or stupid splashes. Quite sick it is and it also goes to your sense of humor. Surprisingly, the ironic end is a beautiful touch. Individual performances are acceptable without a huge indication. Gornicki's direction collides with the nasty and rather foolish. In this case, the worrying music score aroused the right chords. The lake mud-like creature (as many have mentioned) looks like a icky black sheet (yes, you read it right!), Floating in the water. <br /> <br /> # Finally, number 3 ends with "The Hitchhiker". A rich but sexually absent woman is after her husband's gigologist, but she runs late. Thinking about some of the ideas that need to explain his delay, he slips off the road and accidentally hits the hockey player. Instead of checking or getting help, he drives out in the hope that he will come home. Soon the dead body of the dead hitchhiker has been intimidated by him. <br /> <br /> - Not terrible, but I really didn't get this ridiculously ridiculous exercise at all. Compared to the first two numbers, it was so different and tried to harden the bone instead. Lois Chiles was in the lead, but constant insurances and small conversations with him became mercilessly aggravating and even tired. Live make-up effects are well visible and dripping with vision. When it hits a hybrid, it becomes hectic, chewy and overflowing. From there we hear endlessly the repetition and repetition of our supposedly dead sweat player? and repeat the line: "Thank you for the lady!" This happens every time he decides to go over him. Is the dead sweetheart a little politely. <br /> <br /> In general, the second short story "The Raft" and the unpleasantly well-thought-out effect, which adds to the extremely poor succession.
