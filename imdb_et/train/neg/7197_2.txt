OKAY. I think the TV show is kind of cute and it always has some kind of lesson. So, if my kids decided to see this movie, I decided to tag. I'd like to stay home and watch TV shows. <br /> <br /> The fact that humor is stupid and unoriginal is the least problem with this film. Beside the plot there is none, the characters seem to exist in vacuum and the worst, Gadget has no lesson. It seems that Disney took all the things that made the Inspector widget work on the TV and threw them all. To be fair, my younger child (8 years old) liked the film, but the older (10-year-old) came foolishly (he was too old for young people's humor, but too young for adult humor). br /> <br /> In general, I like Disney movies, but it's one mile away. In a very narrow age group (say 7 to 9) this is OK, but all others must forget it.
