It is somewhat peculiar that a story placed in Oslo, where a large part of the local population is from the Asian background, does not see any Asian or African people, not even the extra. This fact probably describes the Norwegian race in general. - Still. <br /> <br /> NO SPOILERS - IN BRIEF INTRODUCTION: <br /> <br /> A friend in Oslo represents four young people living in Oslo. There are two young men who are not able to lead their lives seriously, and it can be said that film can be non-existent and avoid responsibility - a sort of fear to grow. Narrative games on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models. Quite a clich√©. Although the story is a little funny, the actor is good, and if the "young person" can sort out the "crazy" situation of the characters and the complicated love relationships, I can't find this story or signs very credible. Polished and incomplete. This movie uses all the tricks that the classic audience likes to make an entertaining movie with as much intellectual depth as "Friends" (yes, what is shown on the TV). <br /> <br /> Has the Norwegian film finally found its identity? pleasantly known in American style. <br /> <br /> How to watch Lukas Moodysson's Tillsammans (together).
