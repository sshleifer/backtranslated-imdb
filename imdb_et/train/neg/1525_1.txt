I watched it over the weekend afternoon because there was just something else, it would have been more fun to chew my legs and probably less painful. I invite someone to look at it to see if the film can be convincingly terrible, it was definitely deliberate. I ran from any pointless sense of humor that was carried out in such a childish, misunderstanding, poorly executed way that it was incredible. This is the movie that makes Spiceworld like Goodfellas, I think I'm exaggerated? Well give him time and think again. Terrible, totally terrible. If it wasn't a prank, the director and someone else responsible for it should be removed and forced to watch immediately after watching the movie.
