I feel blessed to have what is known as the worst film by Steven Seagal. I knew I was something special when Steven opened his mouth and someone else's voice came out. In the middle of the film, my eyes began to hurt and I was dropped out of my chair with almost uncontrollable laughter. <br /> <br /> Steven is Steven (with a constantly changing voice) and absolutely unbelievable in his role (as always). Who the hell will let people force the tails to the tails of the bad wrapping pony? She always writes to women with totally unbelievable love interests for at least 20 years from her younger. Supporting actors look like they've been made in the dark - btw, did they shoot this movie in the dark, just with lighting lamps? <br /> <br /> It's really terrible in every sense. Invite all your friends and make it a social event - it's really special.
