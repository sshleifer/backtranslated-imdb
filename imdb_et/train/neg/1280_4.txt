When I saw the name of this movie, I always thought it was musical. Like "Harvey Girls". This is not. It's a pudding that has been boiled over, hit the ceiling of the kitchen. There is no music and no period, but thoroughly unlikely. <br /> <br /> It begins with the patriarch James Woods, who tells his three daughters to the eldest, a little child who grows up to Barbara Stanwyck, that he must keep his last name so we think it will be an historic intergenerational story. And this is a short time. Then the story of a cold-hearted Stanwycki fight against lawyer George Brent will change. Why is he so dead? Why else? When we learned the strange setback of Stanwyck, he had ever thought he could marry so much money (both for his sisters and himself). He was struck by someone he was supposed to be a companion who was actually Brent lawyer. <br /> <br /> No one thinks the child to whom it was is an eight-year-old young man at home. , is - well, you know ... They were in a hurry to marry and in a very short time they were together, he was prepared. <br /> <br /> One of his sisters is in love with the painter Gig Young, played by Gig Young. Another sister is trying to take her away. Etc, etc. <br /> <br /> It's a gentle, relaxing mess - well done, but without logic or credibility.
