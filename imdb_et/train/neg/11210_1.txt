I read John Everingham's story years ago in Reader's Digest and I remember thinking about what a great movie would be. And that would probably have been when Michael Landon never got his hands. I'm worried that Landon was one of the worst actors in the world, and his artistic license went up, as is his "Little House" series of massacres at the massacre. Due to the lack of a better word, it is frightening, the sloppy scenario and the Landon bag are more than it should. <br /> <br /> This movie reflects Everingham's story as much as "Little House On The Prairie" reflects on books being "based". This is just another vehicle that shows the terrible hair of Landons.
