Russell Hopton acted in many films until his death in 1945. He led only 2 and "Black Gold" was one (the second was also from 1936). Frankie Darro was sometimes in the presence of an abrasive screen, but he played a good baby. He was clearly quite popular in the "fast" ring - he made so many films. In it, he plays the old oil-rich son who is convinced that he will hit the oil very quickly. <br /> <br /> J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) tries to convince the old man to sell, because he knows that he is knocking oil at any moment. Geologist, Henry, comes to the scene and helps Fishtail's father. He also convinces "Fishtail" to attend school regularly. Henryl is on the eye of Cynthia, a beautiful teacher. It was Gloria Shea's last film - she had started her career with Olive Sheana's "Glorifying of American Girl" (1929). "Fishtail" father is killed when the track is sabotaged and Henry has decided to bring Anderson and his crowns to court. When Henry is kidnapped, Anderson tries to persuade "Fishtail" to sell his oil lease. It all ends well with oil strikes and "Fishtail" military school. <br /> <br /> It's good for the rainy day.
