We rented five films for the five-week weekend and looked at it for the first time. All I can say is that there was no place to go, but after that viewing. It was pointless and vulgar. Harvey Keitel's manuscript must be easy to write - just spell a word for every three words. Andie McDowell is surprisingly good in the characteristic roll, but the film has nothing to suggest.
