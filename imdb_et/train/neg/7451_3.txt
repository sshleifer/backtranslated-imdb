Sorry, not good. <br /> <br /> It's getting interested but losing the movie in minutes. <br /> <br /> It doesn't help much that any traditionally big player (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto, etc.) really does get a good result. <br /> <br /> It may be that I saw a duplicate version (in German), but the character of Dennis Quaid was particularly woody and annoying, and Danny Glover doesn't really make an incredible cable. What's more, the character of Jared Leto does not really contribute to the story at all (except for the recording of one protagonist's life at one point, but this scene is first and foremost necessary for a submarine wiper ;-) <br /> <br /> Talking about unnecessary scenes - the main complaint is really confusing and a Clich√© Tale: Detective (Of course!) Must solve a personal thing with a scraper and is (of course!) Suspended from his official duties. his personal impediment. Killer (of course!) * Wants * to watch and play a cat-mouse game for his opponent for years ... I don't know how many movies are being built on a similar plot - most of them are better, however, the plot has many holes and lots of incredible and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute at all (eg to a truck stopping place or a car on the edge of a rock, etc.). .) <br /> <br /> The end of the end is trying to be original and exciting but completely unsuccessful on these issues. We've seen a lot * better * finals with a similar ultimate-battle-on-train-in-a-for-for-winter-landscape setup ... Finally, it's allegedly moving reunion parent and child ... at least.
