Where to start ... Oh yes, Message to bad men: When you first found the person you have been following (to kill), which provided for the crime you committed, do not spend time talking to him so that he could have another chance to escape . Victim Notification: When the thugs speak and argue, use the "RUN AWAY" option, do not sit there and watch them until you hear the noise. Message to Director: If someone has a 5 or 10 minute head in a car or at the start of a walk, the bad guys can't get their heels or bumpers right now! time and movement don't work that way. It would also be nice to think that a woman does not have to (4) brutally kill men in order to afford the opportunity to abuse at home.
