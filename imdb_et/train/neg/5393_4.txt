I am a fan of Shakespeare and I appreciate what Ken Branagh has done to bring Shakespeare back to the new generation of viewers. However, this film is unable to present the general intentions of the game with ridiculous musical sequences. Add to that, when Alicia Silverstone stumbles over the dialogue (reminiscent of Keanu Reeves's Much Ado About Nothing) and other badly cast roles, it's all equal to the stamina's endurance.
