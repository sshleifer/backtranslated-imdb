SPOILER ALERT In this general and forgotten feature film, Lorenzo Lamas makes his usual tough boy / beautiful boy and his future real life ex Kathleen Kinmont is the ass who puts Alexa on a hot chick. OJ Simpson is a detective who moves from his lost brilliant public person. Translation: Cable TV Filler. There is not enough skin to categorize it for joy. <br /> <br /> The script has some opening holes. Best / worst moment: in one jar scene, the EU partner expresses his reluctance to grumble. The EU replies that some bodies are quite hot or words for that. This vague necrophilic reference is sufficiently offensive; but in the light of the murders committed after the release of this film, it is truly terrible and thus entertaining inadvertently and terribly. I was so surprised that I laughed until the champagne came out of my nose. Now it's a blame for pleasure. BC
