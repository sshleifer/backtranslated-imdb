well after i look at it, i can say that this is not the worst film ever made, yes people are worse about it, there are some good points in the movie, you look at drunken teenagers with terrible deaths, and cute looking rats who eat some science experiment and get a grotesque, huge sail carrier, a karma doctor, and yes a girl's underwear that has absolutely no shame, "lolls," I couldn't personally wait for the rat to eat those drunken stupid, I was a rooted rat, it was a good premise that the first part of the movie was interesting when it was scientifically studied on rats, and a little bit of a story back, but I think it was destroyed when the dark soldered horny teens play ,, the rat in my mind, the one who is lost, his the name is Brenda, was so fake, has to be a cGi rat, it looked like a beaver who was dressed in beaver, it was pretty buggy, flat, but not totally terrible ,,
