Laughed a lot - because it is so incredibly bad - excuse people, but certainly one of the worst movies I've seen ... I know it's a small budget, but anyway: actors act like playing soap, dialogues are absolutely crappy and the last time I saw such odd pictures was in the trash of a youth video festival ten years ago. I really appreciate that people gather together and come in cheap movies, but at least some quality should be achieved. But at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the movie were quiet and they looked good - and the score was really worth it. The DVD cover promised a lot, but it is by far the best that this movie offers ...
