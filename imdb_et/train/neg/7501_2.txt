I went to this film, waiting for a short film about Sami Son's impact on society. I did not expect Spike Lee to force me into more racial tension, mobility or the inability of a common citizen to make a choice under the pressure the peers make. Lee has given an extreme opinion. <br /> <br /> The whole film could have been more effective if the 90-minute format had more focus, less tangential sub-plots. <br /> <br /> Don't even bother to rent a video if you are not passionate about Spike Lee; in this case, the theater is worth it. It's not a lively movie.
