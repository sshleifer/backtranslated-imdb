This is probably the most boring film in history. I was really looking forward to the movie, where actor / director Roman Polanski gave. I think I see three Amigos rather than ever watching this movie again. It went straight from the DVD player directly to the garbage. I'm sorry for those who probably liked this movie, but you also liked New Coke. I'm sorry to see why someone enjoyed this movie, it's slow, boring and has no real plot. You wait 105 minutes for the movie to start. I understand it was done in 1976, but it was a bad television era. Thanks to god disco and three companies, stop-stop glasses and Bay City rolls have passed. Oh just my thoughts.
