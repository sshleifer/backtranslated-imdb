I'm pretty sure this was a film ever made. If you can't laugh at a 13-year-old boy to laugh at humor, you should give up comedy forever. Unfortunately, Joan Rivers chose differently. The film is full of predictable gags (some of them racist) and very unpleasant jokes. Especially memorable is the scene where the doctor talks about the leader, the rabbit is dead and he is pregnant (as I write it, I can't believe it was actually a movie scene). The man rushes to the doctor's rabbit on the desk and tries to give it to the mouth. ROTFLMAO! NO! Punch a line that can tell you how bad things in this movie are "I knew I should be on top." ha ha ha ha ah ugh ........
