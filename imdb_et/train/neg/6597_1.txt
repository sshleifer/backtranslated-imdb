This is much worse than the terrible Laurel and Hardy cartoons of the 1960s. They were terrible, but at least they were Stan and Ollie's revival. New audiences discovered a couple of comedy genes and cartoons were clergy garbage geared to the interests of children. Had to wait. But even trying to rationalize this work ... I can't even think of the word. I'm sure the creators hoped it would inspire another Laurel and Hardy revival, but you can't inspire the past with interestingly low and uncomfortable cartoons about what made the original so appealing. Impressionists (I call them hesitate to act) make Vega's act, and that's where it belongs. The plot is even flimsier than in the old days, trying to stretch out two-reel ideas. If this movie was someone's first contact with Laurel and Hardy at REAL, then I'm sure the viewer will lose the reputation of the original duo when the age is gone. The only movie I hate less is that I wear my own picture. And you know that these filmmakers were basically the same and Stan and Ollie.
