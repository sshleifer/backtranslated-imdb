Wow. I thought it might be pointless, but it was even worse than I imagined! Sometimes I like to watch a good "auto-crash" movie: those that are so bad that you can't watch it because you want to see how bad they can get. This is really the only reason I can leave my television - the morbid charm. It was not so exemplary that it was only mediocre or a little worse than waiting for this pain, but a prerequisite and a plot that shouldn't have looked like a daylight. The script is also encouraging. As for cinematography, did anyone notice that they used a "curtain-drawing" segue, like the old 50-TV shows ... but without irony? At first I thought they should be joking, but the film takes it too seriously to use it in language. Don't even ask for a score ... the only high point is Morcheeba's last song. I think they wanted to leave people for their $ 8 ... glad I saw it on TV !!!!! Just stupid! I don't know if for that reason Timothy Hutton has had a hard time finding a lot of work recently? I think if you don't expect a lot and want to look at a useless thriller, it would be better if you spend the evening cutting your toenails, so it deserves 2.
