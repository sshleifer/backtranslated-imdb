I can't show most of the reality and it's the worst thing with the Paris Hilton and it's his company. But how many seasons do you have now? After watching the exhibition, I wouldn't want to work on my ego and everyone and I think there are more entertainment valves when looking at color drying. <br /> <br /> I just want to hear one person and say, "Donald I give up and take some of my money and buy a decent hairstyle." I see that he is even trying to buy WWE fame in wrestling. I hope he gets in so I no longer have to see my miserable face. It must be sad to want fame so bad and without talents and to make yourself an effort to buy it. I'd give it a negative sign if I could, but it gets 1 and it doesn't deserve it.
