I tried to restart the movie twice. I put it in three machines to see what was wrong. Did Steven Seagal's voice change? Did she die during filming and the studio must copy the sound to someone who doesn't even like her? Or was the DVD sound destroyed? After about 10 minutes you will finally hear the actress's actual voice. Although most of the movie is recorded in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> I would be ashamed to give a copy of this movie to Goodwill if I embraced a copy of it. I rented it, but I never do it. I'll check this database before renting my movies, all of which were (more or less) good movies. You usually knew what you got when you watch Steven Seagal. I think it's no longer.
