Make Ace! You just made a cool, harshly intriguing story about necrophilic cannibal into a soft, soft drama. Obviously, a movie called Dahmer would be one of two types: horror or documentary? It was neither. It was not closer to any detailed fact (in fact it was not at all a substance). It wasn't really poisonous or scary or even trying to be very disturbing. (As you should have tried!) What the hell did this writer / director think? Here is one of the most realistic examples of killing sick sera, and we get badly fired, badly-acting gay-bar roofs, and long drag-and-seek alone in your older parent's house. I think Jacobson was actually trying to present (or invent) j.Dahmer's soft side.
