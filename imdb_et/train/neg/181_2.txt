Ah, local Mexican Channel 5 Every day, at 14:00, they incite Horror's films from the 70s to the early 2000s. It was a "Back Cabin by Lake" movie that yesterday aired. I'm sorry for seeing it. <br /> <br /> The original "Cabin By The Lake" was regularly a popular low budget carrier and it was good. The problem is that this sequel is terrible, not even inadvertently funny and tries to mimic the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in the sense of the word. <br /> <br /> The film of some points looks like a soap opera, because it's an absurd dialogue, cinematography, and direction. <br /> <br /> My advice is to avoid it at all costs. This is a movie that no one should watch. Not even for mediocre filmmakers. <br /> <br /> You are alerted.
