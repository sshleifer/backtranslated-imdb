The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect it to be and nothing else. Of course, this is not an Oscar nominated film, it's just pure entertainment that you can just lose in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot is essentially a group of nationally guarded trainees fighting against the notorious mutated hillbill on their last day in the desert. They are simply fighting the whole movie to the extent that it contains a lot of violence (which is basically the whole movie) because blood and bold are constantly flying around the whole thing, and another graphic rape scene that is unnecessarily thrown to shock the audience. <br /> <br /> I would give the mountains the eyes of 10 out of 10 for pure entertainment and only. Even though I even found myself watching my watch more and more, because the film went on because it started to drag, because he continued to reach the audience with a graphical gateway and occasionally jump into the scene to make the audience stay awake. Hills Have Eyes II is just decent entertainment, something that takes time, as boring, and nothing else. <br /> <br /> 4/10
