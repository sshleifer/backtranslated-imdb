I saw "Paris Je T'Aime" because my friend really wanted to see it, so I went with him. I went, I was indifferent to the film, but I left the theater that I really regretted that in two hours my life was sitting through this cold production. The "stories" are almost completely forgotten, except for the fact that most of them were terrible. What do Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara do to Paris? The endless parade of American actors definitely gave this French film a non-French feeling. The clichés about Paris were endless. Yes, most of them played with the clichés of Paris, but spent so much time amusing French clichés, and they unfortunately once again promoted them. Yes, Paris is a city of love. We get it. The worst segments were: Wes Craven Head (Oscar Wilde); one with Nick Nolte; mime one (worst?); hair products one; one with Juliette Binoche (Willem Dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of Paris?); vampire (when I mean Paris, I mean Elijah Wood). Natalie Portman, who really seemed to be a Mentos van and it was stupid (a blind young man should know that Portman played a role when he called him). On and on. It seemed endless. <br /> <br /> I also didn't like Coen Bros. It really plays with those Paris clichés, but I couldn't find it funny. Just annoying. The Gus Van Sant one was interesting, but it was so small (and the punchline was obvious) to barely record it. <br /> <br /> There were only two "successful" segments and they were one about an immigrant babysitter who leaves his child in kindergarten only for babysitting a rich woman. Nice irony there. And a segment of Africa who is clinging. This is the best segment of the whole movie, but this segment has nothing to do with Paris. The story could have happened in any city around the world. <br /> <br /> The last segment of the medieval woman was also interesting, but the base was bad. They wanted to celebrate their limited understanding of French, but the segment remained open. <br /> <br /> The whole project felt forced. Almost like the French government supported this film to promote tourism. All in all, only about 10-15 minutes of interesting things, "Paris Je T'Aime" was a terrible movie experience.
