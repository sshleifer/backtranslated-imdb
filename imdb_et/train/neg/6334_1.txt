I saw this movie in 1979, I was 17 or 18 when it appeared. The theater was at the beginning of the film, or 1/4 full. Ten minutes of filmmaking with me and a friend who saw me with the movie were the only two people in the theater. The film was really weird and had no plot or reason for the script, and people demanded their money back. We decided to stay with ENTIRE. Why tolerate such torture? ... that's why. We wanted to be true film critics ... to have a standard that would support all the other movies, it's hard to justify that you've seen the best movie (a 10) they always do something better. But it's easy that all the other movies have ever been made from the worst movie (and that's the best ... the best). There may be other movies that really qualify for 1, but I haven't seen them yet. I now support all the movies I see on its worst ... I am a true film critic ... he's.
