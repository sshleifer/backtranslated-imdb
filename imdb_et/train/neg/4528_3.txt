This Worldwide was a cheap man's version of what NWA's Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett campaigns did in the "Big 3" stations localized during the wrestling race in the 1980s during the local morning / afternoon. When Ted Turner got the Crockett's NWA version, he made the World Championship wrestling and continued all NWA references together. NWA World Wide and NWA Pro wrestling was labeled with the WCW logo and moved away from the Disney / MGM studio in Orlando, Florida, and eventually became examples of WCW Nitro, Thunder and Saturday Night. Worldwide was officially the last WCW program under Turner to encourage Vince McMahon and WWF WCW to buy over the weekend. Today, the entire NWA World Wide / WCW worldwide videotape archive, along with the entire NWA / WCW videotape library, is generally linked to WWE's headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.
