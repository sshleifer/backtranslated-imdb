Okay, let me remember the new word: polyphobia: Fear of polyamorphic relationships. This is another long line of the film that begins with titrating about an audience of about thirty, only to turn a dime and go all the way about how it is so necessary and the only moral thing to find a monogamous solution. Only one person in a thousand understands that he can love more than one person, and that director is not one of them. Bleh. <br /> <br /> Mark your words: After a few decades, polyphobia can be as big as homophobia, but I think who was too close to understanding it? First time: the producers of this movie. And so much like it. Why even make a ridiculously conservative and old-fashioned film? Based on the fact that we are guaranteed finite, it neglects the fact that we live in an age where monogamy becomes a successive monogamy, which in turn becomes swirling and polyamoric. Open your eyes, people, please! <br /> <br /> This is a disappointing chick chick. (But fucking, I have to say, Heather Graham is the cutest thing in life.) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
