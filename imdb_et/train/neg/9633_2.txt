Is Rich, Sick Elizabeth Taylor Treats Angel to Death on Her Island Fortress in the Mediterranean, or does she just move - or more precisely - excessive - as usual? In fact, both are director Joseph Losey's wandering, crooked crap called "Boom", which is titled in a lush and luxurious environment, is almost ready to explode. Richard Burton climbs without calling Taylor; She dresses her in a samurai dress with a curtain. Although the picture is quite deadly when viewed from the widescreen, even Liz 'Dick-philes' failure (the "hell of stars" attitude towards the ego-mad of his 60s film career) is here). Nonsense, confusing, and crazy, "Boom" is a disaster - although the scriptwriter Tennessee Williams, who adapted his failed game "Milk Tray Not Ending Here", was quite fond of it! * from ****
