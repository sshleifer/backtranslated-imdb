The potential of this film was much greater than it was. But it is not only able to achieve it, but at the same time it also highlights the malicious self-righteous sermon. <br /> <br /> John Cusack is even flatter than the midnight of a good and evil garden. The difference is that this time he should have a southern accent that he loses several times for each scene. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino is doing his shtick, but he shines through this movie and pays for it. He's good, as usual, but hardly called. <br /> <br /> By supporting a woman's romantic interest, that story is little if any. The story tells us that the enchanting "who really cares" story where Cusack is a self-evident mayor boy who just has to look for "the right thing." <br /> <br /> People do not. At the end, Cusack's character loses all credibility, without which it is preaching and nausea. The final scene makes the penultimate fool deep. It's also completely inaccurate, but I don't get into the law. <br /> <br /> It's bad, by number film. It seems interesting in the first 40 minutes and then it is really preaching, propelative and in itself the right movie in the last hour. Better than a nonsense nonsense as a bunch of garbage.
