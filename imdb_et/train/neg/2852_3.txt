This is very unpleasant when the film is slippery. I tried it because he celebrates Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, two good actors, and because the plot's line - the mob's boss is released from the spiritual institution - sounded promising. The film is paid for comedy, sorta. What we have is an infinite number of images - you should give punishment - dimly lit and elegant people, as somewhat surreal, interiors, shooting each other - head, stomach, knee, legs, heart (no part of it) seems to be anatomy an inevitable and secret dialogue, some of which are probably humorous in a postmodern way. The Goldblum dialog for the entire movie fits on a 3x5 card and carries one facial expression - a sardonic smile. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines are doing the best. Burt Reynolds makes a head. The credit list is Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but I somehow missed them (a good move on my part). The whole thing is cold, sterile, mechanical and unpleasant; I think the heir is "Pulp Fiction", "Fargo" and "Natural Born Killers". If you liked them, you probably like it.
