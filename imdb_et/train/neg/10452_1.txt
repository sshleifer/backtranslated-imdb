I saw at 10:00. shows and I have to say that this movie was nothing special. Although I did not leave the theater behind my time (because I do not pay any more for movies), I did not actually find any redemption features. <br /> <br /> There was a couple of lines and one that made me smile, but mostly it seemed that the film was made up of younger robbing fan services (remembering more than the age when this movie was rated R) by the male audience. The fan service seemed uneven and rather distracting. I know you all want to hear that Samuel L. says about his infamous line, but let's face it, it's a great leap for a very small fee. The only really terrible part of the film was the CG, which looked very digitized and didn't see the live action on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now I'm a reasonable man, I knew I could go to the theater so I didn't see "Casablanka", and I'm at least grateful that this movie is an original idea (albietanane) and no sort of transformation or franchise. But frankly, if you are not part of a cult, you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing a movie for a few weeks or a few months to rent it.
