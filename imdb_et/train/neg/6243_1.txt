Don't drink cool help. <br /> <br /> This is an opinion that is hidden in documentary. And to call it "truth" is just plain nonsense. The debate on global warming is far from over and it will be over when eco-zombies begin to admit a mountain of evidence that is in conflict with their beloved theory. Just Google "Global Warming" and "Hoax" or "Junk Science" and you will find river information that pushes around almost every link in the logic chain used by Gore sites. The reason people educate themselves is the catastrophic economic impact of global warming prevention measures. Wake up people. Anyone with a computer, little time and common sense can find many reasons why this theory is not even plausible. Don't just read articles that support your current opinions, read everything you can find. In fact, there is no need for a thorough analysis. There are just too many alternative ways to prove that theory is even the most basic of scientific credibility. In fact, it is so incredible that it can be one of the biggest mistakes in human existence. It is time for people to speak against such propaganda and it is time for people to admit to themselves and others that you can be both a conservationist and a prominent conclusion that the hysteria of global warming is a great lie.
