Well, here we have another RollVideo movie. Despite the fatigue reversal of the sexes, it was worth watching. But it is not. In earlier reviews, I think I have made a statement about the decline in the overall enjoyment of the 80s end of Haim's films. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> "One of the girls" is about a high school child (Corey Haim) who is trying to avoid her temptation by dressing up the girl and going to another school. She joins the cheerleading team and makes friends with her cheerleader Marie (Nicole Eggert). Obviously, she can't keep her career too long. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was a complete mess and it wasn't even funny. But most of the reviews seem to suggest that fans of Alan Morrisette or teen sex queen Nicole Eggert are the only ones who would like to see it. If you are looking for a good Haim function (or role-changing comedy), look beyond 1989. This is about the point that Haimi's career densities.
