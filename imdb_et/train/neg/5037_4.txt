Plot = Melissa is a new girl in town, she is fifteen years old and her birthday is one week. Because Melissa is beautiful, every city boy wants to connect with her, but few who can mysteriously die. To be honest, the real reason I wanted to watch this movie is that Dana Kimmel from Friday 13th to 3rd was what wasn't the right reason to rush and watch the movie. When I started to look at it, I realized that "Sweet Sixteen" is not a very good slasher, it's really boring and boring and just isn't going anywhere. In just over an hour, only three murders have occurred, and the story has not really developed in any way. <br /> <br /> The film has been nicely captured with pretty nice photography and good leadership, but like many other slasher 80s, the film is sometimes in the dark. The action is pretty good, but Melissa's character is easy to understand, even though she is a full bitch. <br /> <br /> The story isn't completely garbage, but it's just too boring to interest you, the only things that interest me were Melissa, who was stunned, and Dana Kimmel, whose real sweet and sweet in it in the movie. <br /> <br /> Everything is quite dull slasher that doesn't go anywhere. does not recommend it to Slasher fans.
