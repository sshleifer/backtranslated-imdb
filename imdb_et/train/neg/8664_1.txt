It's just a movie joke, they lost me already in the opening plan (Spoilerwarning) a dangerous creature kills another creature in their cage, it is followed by a scientist who works there on the monitor and thinks what he does, well what he does. to the cage to check things out omg as a fool these writers think that people have come that is the same as jumping in a fish tank with a big white shark because it ate your goldfish ... pretty useless and even worse And i'm not even talking pain because they are not worth the effort. why they didn't unleash a man who wrote that there is a mystery to me right now ..... And that stupid fool will continue the whole movie. The only good thing about these small budget films is better than average. Cg. If these things don't bother, then look at it, but warn me if your IQ is over 60 likely to hate it.
