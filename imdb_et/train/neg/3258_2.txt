DOC SAVAGE: BRONZE MAN (1 outta 5 stars) In the 30s, the adventurous hero and his five assistants, all experts in some field areas, allow them to fight evil. It was a pretty hockey series ... but nice to read when I was a teenager. I knew they made a 70's film version starring Ron (Tarzan) Ely ... but I could never see it. She never played in theaters where I lived and was never shown on TV. Now that I've finally seen the movie, I understand why. The plot and the character will never be treated seriously ... this is any language and excitement ... like the old Batman TV series ... just without funny benefits ... or visual elegance. Corny dialogue, cheesy special effects, stupid stereotypes, crummy action scenes and bad, bad acting. In fact, I find it fascinating in what's wrong ... what could they have thought? Arnold Schwarzenegger was proclaimed in the head of today's remake ... but I don't imagine it would have been much better.
