At the end of the movie, I asked myself, "Is this a worse film I've ever seen, or is it a worse movie I've ever seen?". And the answer is ... In fact, after that movie and thinking a little about its meaning, you can't just find any meaning and you only remember two rape scenes that are incredibly brutal and useless. It seems to me that the President tried to bring this issue to the crowd: "What are the crimes against the horror of war and destruction?" because I noticed two terrible scenes that are directly related to war and its horrors (during the first scene there is a girl raped by screaming and at the same time you hear a speech by President Bush about the necessity of starting a war) and in the second arena there are three criminals The sword-captured images were directly from World War II archival photographs, but in fact I couldn't think of its relative difficulty. the two different types of horror I did was too shocked by what I just saw and felt.
