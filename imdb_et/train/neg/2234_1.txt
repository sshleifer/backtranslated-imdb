I bought this DVD for Â£ 1 and now I understand why. The exhibition was the worst I've seen for a long time. Lighting and sound are at best dirty. The plot does not make sense even if it is sober (WARNING: I do not recommend watching this movie as sober.) This film seems to be looking at a home that can't get out much. It is really shameful that all the very small funds spent on this project went to this kind of waste, looking forward to seeing if any of those who were threatened have a career, except for eva longoria, who is the only star of this film. it wasn't obviously a bad stick hit. I'm sorry that none of this criticism seems constructive, but I say one thing to James Cahill, don't try it again. Squirlyemi with "Good Lack in Good Departments".
