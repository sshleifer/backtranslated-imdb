John Huston's wise was the more terrible misrepresentation of Flannery O'Connor's book than I could have imagined. This movie was disgusting for a musical score that was more suitable for Rockford's episode of music (and you don't, "which was done for the purpose, you just don't get it" for me!). and I was expecting a pleasant experience, but the misrepresentation of southern characters from a ridiculously cheating southern pull to lottery, a comedic way of depicting their faith, was unforgivable, just to the end of what was absolutely free of any character, in every place where O'Connor's book "South" actors depicting "South" policemen can also eat smoked hot dogs on the streets of NYC and quote the godfather.Whoever redeems the actor is Ned Beatty's lively and dead representation of Hoover Shoates, a religious artist who hears Moate's Christ Church and sees the dollar O'Connor's powerful book is all you need egum in its creepy, religious submerged jubilee of a seemingly inanimate "faith" frame. Huston's film is a shameful look at the author's intentions, as I and most of his fans understand when I'm so bold to say it. Although I admit that I can't exactly know what the author wanted to pass on, I have a lot of affection for her and her works that she would like to be a fan. If I looked at the exact blood that Mr Huston probably did, I would have thrown it in the trash. For Flannery's sake and for me I will forgive you, John Huston. Forget ... it takes time.
