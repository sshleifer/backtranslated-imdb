This is one of those terrible, sexually explicit B movies that couldn't be played near the theater. Women run in a dressed "bunny" outfit, an extremely greasy woman is hit by many tasty jokes and they all work in a messy old man's restaurant with an odd son (Jim Hanks, of course Tom's brother) whom he wants to "put". Hanks is actually kind of good, but this movie doesn't go anywhere and makes no sense. You should wonder why it was even done? However, due to Hank's performance and some entertaining moments (but not more than a few), he got 10 stars "2". I think I was nice.
