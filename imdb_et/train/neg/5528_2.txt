For this movie that only works in 61 minutes and nothing like this on TV, I decided to pop the Zombies rebellion onto the DVD. Even when I realized the era he had come from, I was very disappointed. It started with the strange optimum quality of the opening criterion (what - without music without music?) And then with rather slow moving opening sequences. Gosh, I thought the zombies of the movie - even in the 1930s - would NOT be chills (White Zombie, with Bela Lugosi, certainly), but it had nothing. Zero. It was hardly even dramatic (except for a few moments where burnt eyes were on top of the movie to show someone's sensation). Like an equally boring king of zombies, this film can be an interesting curiosity, but nothing else.
