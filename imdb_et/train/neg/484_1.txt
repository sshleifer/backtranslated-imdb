I was nasty about this movie. No, not because of graphical sexual scenes, but because it destroyed Artemisia's Gentilesch image. There is not much truth in this film about him and his art. It shows one of the works of art he did (Judith Beheading Holofernese), but shows that it has been recognized in a rape trial if he did not paint his first Judit one year after the trial. <br /> <br /> I don't know if you understood this movie, probably not, Tas wasn't a noble character. She RAPED Artemisia. It was not love, it was rape. He did not claim to accept rape for rape to stop him during torture. According to rape certificates, he continued to argue that he did not know that Artemisia (named the relative) did not know he was over and over again "That's true". <br /> <br /> I encourage you all to go out and find the true Artemisia and see what it really is. Don't support all your knowledge about this fancy movie. I encourage you to do some research, Artemisiael is really an interesting story behind him and an amazing work of art. <br /> <br /> Don't see the movie, but find the true story of Artemisia.
