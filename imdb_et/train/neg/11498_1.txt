Gadar is one of Bollywood's worst overpriced movies. Director Anil Sharma, who prefers to make a time-related movie, gives a garbage movie. The songs were boring and not the kind of song you want to listen to in your car in full. Sunny Deol is famous for making films where he himself wins 100 bad guys. He even hits a metal prison door (India) and strikes a moving car far (Teesri Aankh). I can give you another 50 examples of the shameful activities of Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people already know it. Sunny gives a pathetic result, repeating the same role. A man who claims to fight for his countries using violence. Amisha Patel's hands are dead sexy with an amazing body that I love bone. But even he couldn't save the movie from the disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes, as he usually does, there is no movie. Maybe he's playing a Muslim, but he's not in the movie. In general, this is a bad show all the time, I'm sure it will appeal to some people who love to see the Bollywood actress beat 100 men. Leave me alone.
