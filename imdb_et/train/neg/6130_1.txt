In the early 1980s Kurt Thomas was a hero in the United States. Inevitably, the men in his position offer film tasks that exist only to exploit it. I have no idea what Thomas had paid for making this movie, but I have to pay a big bunch of money to agree that I'm a movie. The film is obviously derived from "Enter The Dragon" as well as most martial arts pictures. Instead of the actual martial arts alone, they prepare an absurd new martial art, which one critic accurately described as "a cross between Kung Fu and a break dance". A gymnast (of course Thomas) is hired to save some women from penetrating fortress, but every room has a proportion that is exactly what Thomas needs for a spouse for the bad. Of course, he fights his way against the leading cable and of course has a fictional struggle, the end of which will surprise only those who have never seen the Marshal movie. There are touches that are pleasing to nostalgic types, especially the hairstyles of Thomas and many male hairstylists. But the only reason for watching this movie is if you have an outrage against Kurt Thomas, who now wants him never to be filmed.
