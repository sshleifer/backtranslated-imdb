Unlike others, I refuse this regrettable pretext for a film that is a triumphant substance in the style (I don't want to give a bad name to the style). However, this is the most appropriate description that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> A pointless, unpleasant, and ultimately pointless attack on the eyes and ears, "Wonderland" only leaves us thinking about why the film was made and who rightly gave the green light to this harsh and confusing confusion. The biography of John Holmes biography? A study of who the man was, why he went to business and how it affected him? Great. Connected to be convincing, definitely entertaining. Bound to be enlightening and exciting about a million levels (and I have zero interest in porn). <br /> <br /> But the confusing, violent, Rashomon-style study of some of the murders with Holmes was linked to her after a career ended? Who the hell cares about? What knowledge do we get? This film ignores the most interesting aspect of John Holmes' life - that he was a porn star! "Wonderland" can also be anybody: the fact that the main character is the most famous male adult film star in history is almost irrelevant. <br /> <br /> To make a thousand times worse, the image is downloaded with jerkoff tricks - annoying machine gun editing, sloppy Dogme-95 camera work, unnecessary split-screen graphics and animation, etc. the director (and I use the term loosely) has thrown up twelve techniques from other films and has decided to call a confused film, including: "Narc" or "Traffic" in trendy, bleached furniture or "Minority Report"; "Natural born killers" or "28 days later;" frantic, often incomprehensible film-air-cutting style; "Goodfellas" or "Blow;" Velvet Goldmine "or" Autofocus "or" Catch Me If You Can. "The list goes on and on. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie. "Wonderland Avenue" had been around for years, and if the context of the murders is more pronounced than the murders themselves, I think it could have worked. If the murders (and Holmes's increasing involvement in LA-type types) signaled the end of a career or the end of the 70s , I think the film would have had a meaning, it could have been a goal. As it is - pointless. Nonsense. Who cares about how much prospects the public has of murders unknown? The case is not famous enough to value this careful study. < br /> <br /> This movie should have been the third act of "The John Holmes Story. That's it. Period. And it could have worked. What is it? Oh, right, right, they didn't want to talk about the traditional rise and down They didn't want to do "Boogie Nights" or "Goodfellas" or "Star 80" or "Autofocus". They wanted their film to be different. Well, in one sense, they managed to succeed. There is a big difference between these films and "Wonderland". The difference is good for these films. <br /> <br />
