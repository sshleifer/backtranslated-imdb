If you've seen Sholay 1975, don't look at this movie. If you haven't seen Sholay in 1975, go to WATCH IT. But don't watch this movie. This film has all the ingredients that might have gone wrong with Sholay's remake. <br /> <br /> Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays the most psycho-evil role (probably only a 40-minute roll that shouldn't be burned). If you remove the rest of the movie and just watch your character play, it would still be worth it. But like Insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal doesn't do justice to his talents. Ajay Devgan (Heero) is the most common and the only reason I think they put Prashant Raji Raj's role as he has a striking resemblance to his young days with Amitabh. Sushmita Sen carries her well with grace and make-up. But the prize for "ECONOMIC AND ANOTHER ROLE" must go to Nisha Kothar. He succeeds in worsening his activity at such a level that even high school drama would have crossed his performance. <br /> <br /> If you have a mortal enemy, take him to this movie. :)
