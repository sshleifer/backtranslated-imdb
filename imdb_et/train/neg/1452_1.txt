1919 - 1933 In Germany, it hardly seems to be the capital of the Czech Republic after World War II. Sorry, this is the capital of the Czech Republic and it's 2003 as funny. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most terrible movies in the nearest past. Rohm is almost taller than Adolf and he looks so damn, Göring looks like 40 when he's just 23 and "Führer" always seems to be 56. And buildings, people, even buildings are sometimes young. Especially in 1919, almost new houses in Germany (WWI does not reach German cities!). No crumbled plaster! Then Reichstagsbuilding. There have never been city canyons around this building. And it may sound like a miracle to you: in 1933, the Greater Berlin fire truck owns many vehicles that contain engines, some of which are even record players, but not a hand pump. <br /> <br /> One last thing: Which PLAYMOBIL Castle was in the queue? For me it was "Adolf's Adventures in Wonderland".
