There is no doubt that the worst film I've seen for a long time. I was going to end because there must be something here, but not. Plots associated with non-completion of plots speak to the point of being; a dialogue that should be on the street is just a hackney; characters never represent beyond; the pieces are cliched. Worse still, given its co-director, photography is only so-called. <br /> <br /> Comments elsewhere that raise it with Get Carter, Long Good Friday, or Kaspar Hauser are missing the way; The lives of the holidays are not innovations, let alone their depth and shade. In short, their craft. A ruthless editor is likely to cut it to a 30-minute short, but as it stands, it is a sixth-form film project realized on a million-pound scale; rambling and swelling in your complaints. Because it got funding (definitely only because of Rankin's name), while other small films are fighting for cash, the British film industry is frustrating.
