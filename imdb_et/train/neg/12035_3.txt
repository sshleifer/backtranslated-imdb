I was expecting it to be much better. I love Tim Burton's work, so I was really happy to see these online short films. Well, they weren't at all what I expected. <br /> <br /> I don't know exactly what I like. I think they're just bubbles. Sound disturbs me and most of the symbols, although I liked Roy Toxic Boy and Stainboy. <br /> <br /> Match Girl's episode probably seems to me the most, although it was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> I don't like how some characters die. Similar to how a girl in the game basically set up a fuel station, or how a girl who celebrates, died in general. Roy's death was surprisingly fun. Death by car refresher. Very original ;-) It made me so laugh ... <br /> <br /> There are some things that are not suitable for children. Just some language and gore. That's all I have to say! 3/10
