It was a weird movie. It started pretty good. A strong soundtrack behind flash images Gore and Mayhem, like our psychopath, did their thing. <br /> <br /> Next comes her "falling down" here I could say I was for a real cheesy "B" movie. Poor performance, I mean, how hard is it to keep a gun and behave like a cop? These men couldn't. After our psychopath death, we get the opening credit and the movie starts ... <br /> <br /> From that moment on, the big boobs, the occasional vagina and the badly made death scenes are working badly. br /> <br /> That said I gave the movie to four because, despite his mistakes, he was sort of frightening, which I just couldn't shake completely. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie, but I have to admit that I have worse.
