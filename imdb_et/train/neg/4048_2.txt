Maybe not, but it's terrible. Even this awesome pain can't save it. I know it started quite funny, but it seemed as if the downhill fell as they jumped into the generals' house. Bill Murray turned to be a quick, humorous guy who shouted things on people in the street, just not funny, as he tried too hard to be funny. His character stole a weapon (RV? Come ...) and arrives at a national hero after the invasion of another country and killing God knows how many soldiers to laugh. One good idea is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the US Army and shows how arrogant and glamorous they really are, though inadvertently. In fact, I felt angry that such a propaganda mess could really be released.
