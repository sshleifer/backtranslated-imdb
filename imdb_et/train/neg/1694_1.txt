This film may seem like a scary ad, but the real movie was the reason to vomit. It is below average (even lower) and there is no plot. I mean, every house can make you feel scared and sure, a dead Japanese woman scares you out, but what? Make a movie that is attractive to observers and not just show intimidated people and some hair (a dead Japanese woman). Do you say "awful hanging of Samara (Ring)"? Don't start with a "dead child". Even this scary! So what? She has a cat and she can mimic it, a great striking thing! Just bury the poor zombies and save lives that may be damaged by Grudge! 1/10! Yuck! >. <
