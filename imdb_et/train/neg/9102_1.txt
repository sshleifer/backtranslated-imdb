I was ready to go with the original _Cruel Intentions ._. It went with the plot and stayed with the characters of his favorite musicians. But in my opinion, this film was a paltry rehash that had essentially the same story and clear choices. I didn't care about what happened to them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons, not CI) is the characters and their relationships, not the events themselves. I wasn't clear before I read IMDB that this movie was supposed to be a prequel, especially since the title contains the number "2", I was waiting for a sequel, but then I decided it must be a companion. First of all, I must say that this movie read to me at least, like Les Liasons' soft porn version. I wasn't impressed.
