I just have to add if someone actually reads it and has not yet scored. These other reviewers don't joke, it's really the worst color film you'll probably ever see. When the movie started, I couldn't believe something like it really would be in the world. <br /> <br /> They don't just say it when they say it looks like a home movie. It's really. Like the "director", the camcorder took a hi8 camcorder (before DV cameras and a non-linear editing of the computer), no other equipment (lights, audio equipment, etc.) seized some good looking students and went out to shoot. No script, but do it when he passed. <br /> <br /> When I looked at it, it was on my mono TV, so I only have one channel (to the left of the right speaker). First I thought I was wrong. The film remained silent until someone spoke for a few minutes. I got up and went to another channel and suddenly I heard music and sound effects, but then it couldn't be heard. They recorded sound on different bloody channels! I mean, there are movies that can be funny to watch, so bad they're good, such a thing. I'm not sure this is one of them. I mean, I admit I'm a bit of a budding filmmaker. And seeing bad movies makes you just go there and PROVE can do it better. But looking at it made me angry about who did it. I thought the chick was hot and was disappointed with the shortness of her bath picture. A bit of T and A would have raised the score to 3 or 4. But unfortunately not. If you want to make a movie, but it's beaten, throw some free. Worked on behalf of Roger Corman.
