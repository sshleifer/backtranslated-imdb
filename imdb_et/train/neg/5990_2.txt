I still haven't seen it all; it is currently working with a cable, and I seem to continue in the middle of it. My main reason is that I'm a fan of Bill Paxton; he is a pretty good actor and has consistently done a good job during his career. The other thing is that even though there is never a fan of the old series, I liked Thunderbirds' ships and effects. Derek Meddings was the best in business during the sixties and seventies and his international lifeboats are excellent. The current team has done an excellent job of translating their work on the big screen. <br /> <br /> HOW ... <br /> <br /> This is one flat story. Children are asked to drive it, and although they do a decent job, it is difficult to stop their infidelity, especially if you have an eight-year-old son traveling with T2, a huge multi-tonne transport with all the aerodynamics. Buick. Everywhere you look, you see the Ford logo. Product placement is up here and it's annoying. Ben Kingsley does a good job like Hood, but he can only play a single dimension. If you can receive a movie with very thin features, Thunderbirds is a fun and enjoyable journey. Just don't look at the machine that drives it. <br /> <br /> ADDENDUM: I finally got a look at all this and it is worse than I thought. The action is fairly evenly bad, and although the effect is quite good, the story of many views has become cheese. The overwhelming product placement of Ford is annoying and children, as central characters, speak of my other nerves. Like The Avengers, if you ignore the source material, it is tolerable. But not very much. See the original exhibition and see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Word for advice from Jon Frakes. Take an in-service training course at the Director Guild. You can do it better, old friend. <br /> <br /> Second footnote ... <br /> <br /> I saw it again. Last night. Telemundos. Prohibited Spanish, comic comedy sound effects. And yes, I came around in the middle of Ben, Ron and Sophia in their struggle on Tracy Island. <br /> <br /> I didn't think the flat film would have been worse, but it was. It was embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br /> If it were done directly, there would be no rescue work for kids, language-in-cheek jokes, it could have worked. As it is, it's just one of the beloved childhood joy that has been destroyed.
