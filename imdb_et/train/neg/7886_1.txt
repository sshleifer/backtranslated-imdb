I have nothing against religious movies. Religious people need to say something on Saturday night, I think. But what really pulls me out is when writing a DVD box doesn't show it to a potential viewer. Turning off religious propaganda as entertainment is NOT cool, and even if I was a religious person, I would agree with most other posters here, this film was confusing. Poorly managed, poorly acted, poorly edited, and soundtrack was fun. Counterfeit accents were terrible, the characters were mostly stereotypes, and consistency was out of the window. The only reason we sat down on this flat time was that it was too late to watch another movie. We should just go to bed. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no redemption features of this movie unless you are a religious type who instantly affirms something that proclaims your beliefs to unbelievers, even if it is a trash. If you don't, beware of this at all costs. Don't try to write a box.
