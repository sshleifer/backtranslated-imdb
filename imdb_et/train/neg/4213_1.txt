Wow, I'm a big fan of Henry VIII / Tudor era and well, that was .... interesting. The only one I watched was one of Aragon's Catherine. And wow ... just wow. I've seen bad before, but it reached new heights. When Catherine played the actor was a dumb .. crying? he's neighbors and screaming and I have to admit that I repeated several times ... many, many times .... funny, funny stuff. The only person who even showed some talented slip was an actor playing Anne Boleyni (perhaps there may be biases, but I am a bit obsessed with Anne Boleyn, she was a really exciting woman, read her up, it's worth it!) I've also read a lot about Tudor from time to time and I think the characters were not very sharp, they were all very stereotypical. Watch this movie only when you are ready to watch a very important time period and the life of the people involved is a laugh.
