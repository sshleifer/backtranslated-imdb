We are not a naked Emperor's fairy tale. We can admit the truth about what we see without being stupid, admit that this exhibition is simply incomprehensible in many aspects and that it is clear that much of it was created from pure intuition without a real concept. Well, probably many people like such things. I do not. I prefer well thought out and planned exhibitions. And I also admit that this exhibition is very serious for my taste and boredom - those love and drug stories ... There are so many exciting soaps (Dallas nt), but Twin Peaks doesn't get my attention. I don't care about these people except Cooper and Gordon Cole.
