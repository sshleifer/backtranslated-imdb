I saw this movie long ago ... fortunately it was free. I have to be one of the twenty people who saw it in the movie theater. I don't remember a whole bunch of it, but I remember I was very bored, the plot didn't make sense, and when I came out of the theater, the only thing I could say, at least for now, I know what the worst movie I ever saw. I just had one thing to bother: when they get to the temperature, if they go to the sun small enough for people to survive, why can't they turn it into a comfortable temperature instead of warm and sweating? How stupid do they think we are?
