This movie was terrible and offensive to the viewer. Stupid script, bad casting, endless boredom. <br /> <br /> In the Hollywood tradition, the US government is always shown to be evil. Communist-sympathetic nitwits in Hollywood, most of whom are stupid as well as rocks, the love of a single nut tree Eugene McCarthy, and as the leader of his great movement. The truth is that at that time he was considered an extraordinary character who used legitimate concern for the Soviet Communists to gain political benefit. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the US brought all these evil Nazis. Like Werner VonBraun, without which we would not have room. He really loved being American and became a great value for the state. And it is still irony that Hollywood fools, many without education, who live in the presence of fantasy, still believe that the government should go all out. and give us all we want. And yet, it is the same government that they constantly portray as perfect evil in such films.
