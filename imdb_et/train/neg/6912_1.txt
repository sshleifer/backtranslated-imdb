The only reason I even gave out 10 is that 10 of the zero stakes were not allowed. It was the biggest waste of time I've ever suffered. In about 75 minutes you will have a BASIC ACTIVITY (and I do not mean that as well as KILLER in NERD, which was very terrible) and a plot that is not only ridiculous but also absolutely nothing to do with the massacre. The reason I even rented this rice package was that there was a massacre in the title. This means that only one movie was killed in the whole movie and it was flat. You spend more time watching the children over bullying and making the factory. Speaking of a child, the actor of a small boy is probably the most irritating child actor from the tomb house by the house. Did I mention that this is also a video? If you want to spend money and throw your life in one hour, look at it always. But if you enjoy your hard-earned dollars and time, you get lost as far as you can.
