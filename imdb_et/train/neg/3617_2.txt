Really, very bad film. A psychotic person escapes from the shelter. Three years later, he kills a professor of sociology at the end of the scene. Yesterday one semester (hey, this is the name card said) is a new professor of sociology at school. He collaborates with his friends with another professor of sociology working there and starts a second professor. Students are bored as we are. <br /> <br /> There are many title cards that show how much time has passed. Scenes are quite short and cut to a different character somewhere else, so there's little progress. Many scenes include signs that walk and speak, sit and speak, and serve little purpose. Despite the passage of time, many characters always wear the same outfit. Sometimes the unclear interaction of time, when we see the body a second time, we ask ourselves: how long has this body been there? And at least one of the dead people doesn't seem to be missed. <br /> <br /> The killer can kill one person when he grabs his chest, the other grabs him on his feet and the other, forehead on his forehead. Is his knife poisoned or something? <br /> <br /> The cover of the video box has a cheerleader: there is no movie in the movie. There is a photo on the back cover where someone has finished the cover and the dress threatens the dormitory of a group of women. The red redhead in the photo is in the movie, but no one wear such a dress and no such scene. The killer is strictly one.
