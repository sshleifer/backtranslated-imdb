From the beginning you know how this movie ends. It's so full of clich√©s that your typical NRA member doesn't like this movie. I'll give him 2 out of 10 just because of William Benton's behavior. I can't believe people voted for this movie 6+. It is so biased towards a "certain point of view" (as a thief ...). People are not born bad. Nor were they born good. They were born with pure slate. It's society, parents, and education that make them who they are. And if they take the wrong turn, somewhere on the line, this is definitely not an American punishment system that can get them back! Anyway, avoid this movie like a plague. I bet you have better things in your time than wasting it on pieces. <br /> <br />
