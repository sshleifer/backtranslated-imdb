I gave this 4 stars because it has many interesting topics, many of which have already been mentioned here. From domestic violence, sexuality and many taboos there. Outside the gate, I really wouldn't call this horror as much as I would have made it. <br /> <br /> It's grim, frustrating and hopeless. Although I don't mind less than a fun ending, I'm really very tired of the "people sucking" clich√©s that are at the heart of every movie. I know that today no free arts degree can be obtained without the change of self-dignity as a member of human dignity, but how is the writer / director when we pretend we are different than everyone else in the package and note that the people who kill INIMRACE are evil! Now that you read it and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out, find the lake and swim your hands tired. So you're not going to drive the next movie or write the next book that tells me I have to die to live. It's silly, not thoughtful and boring.
