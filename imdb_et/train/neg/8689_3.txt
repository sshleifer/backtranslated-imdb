The main problem with Power is that it can also contain meaningless characters and sub-blocks that do not add anything to the movie. After a while it gets boring, sitting waiting for scenes that don't connect to find something that moves the movie forward. Probably they could all be left out by developing the character, but all of them are re-used from earlier movie scenes or just plain flat and uninteresting. Snow never gives enough time to let any blossoming pain blossom. He should have cut some characters (hackman, wife) and focus more on others (Billings). It could have been a big, difficult political thriller with a mess, a mess that loses any message of bad writing and action in the sea, something that amazed me with the lie. Even Gene Hackman's performance was not par. Denzel Washington is the only real observer here. Gere and others have done much better elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet has to go back to a harsh person who showed that he did it in the 1970s (i.e. Serpico), and finishes the event with "12 Angry Men" and "Fail Safe". It hasn't worked for Sidney yet, and it probably won't ever. leave the band's drama to Altman. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> * / * * * *
