Cinema thematic headquarters since its inception is a genre that includes seductive women, whose tricks and means are tempting susceptible men not only to their weapons, but also to terrible situations that usually only endanger men's victims, and the uncertainty whether non-tempers are forced to take their medication , and here, Susan Lucci acts as a siren, although her acting pieces, mainly from the descent of the soap opera, are inadequate to make her performance credible. Isabelle (Lucci), a constant wife of venture capital Stewart Collins (John O'Hurley), starts lovingly having fun with the hunter Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff), just for him, but Richard's heartfelt question is probably foolish for his lover if he uses his glory by involving him in a risky plot that finishes the murderous intent scheme. When Davis is convinced that innocent Isabelle is the victim of physical abuse led by his wife, he desperately tries to rid him of what he feels is a marriage trick that he can help himself to believe that the only clear solution to his difficulty is found in a primitive essay , which hires a professional assassin who is abducting the allegedly violent Stewart. After being hit by a man in Collins, a few police detective Joe Grifas and Dean McDermott became more and more curious about Isabelle's possible involvement in the crime, while the reality falls on robbed Richard, who may have to pay a more expensive price in return for his inamorate maneuvering. Lucci and Kasnoff are appropriately surrendered to a viable secret pair, each of which gives a reading that makes boredom rather than a charming pile, but O'Hurley and McDermott offer a strong move in both the hackneyed and unique trends and design elements. The Fremantle DVD, which is largely slip-free, which depicts a man wearing a seductress spell, benefits from visual and audio quality, and while no additional features are offered, the higher-than-average product quality increases operator efforts.
