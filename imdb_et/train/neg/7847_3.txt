Until recently, I have anticipated this movie so much and I foretold that I almost had to see it. Well, having just seen it today, the 5.8 rating is perfectly understandable. I think if you expect something so that it becomes imperative, it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course there are eyes in the mountains 2. It is a very cool and well-developed story that is well connected to the actual product, but the whole thing is so self-evident that it is so difficult to follow. And if it wasn't for Wes Craven's film production, it would have nothing to do with the original remake. But the whole thing makes you "Should it be horror or comedy?" because there are lots of ridiculous, randomly placed moments and stupid linings (IE "There's a hand sh ** er!" or "You motherfu ** er! I'll kill you all b ** tches sons! remind me even how bad it was. <br /> <br /> STORYLINE: (this part includes a spoiler, be careful!) The movie starts with a woman who gives birth to a mutant baby and then the screen goes black when the movie's title comes out, and the monologue Then we go to the office where the war veterans' dummies are randomly placed. The people who are looking for mutants are tracking the audible alarm box and all die! After opening this tone, you are expecting more training in military recruitment in Baghdad, as the master parades them "good work" stupid ", is the last training day in New York, the desert where the last THHE was left to use they were busy. In the end, things go wrong, people die and ... I have to tell you more? t now I have a goldfish sighting that forces me to sit here and write it. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with THHE2 is that it just doesn't work. There is no feedback here, and the end is pretty safe ... but twisted! It's stupid, that's it. I'm pretty sure the Ultra Super Director's Cut with the holographic cover and The Hills Have Eyes 3 presents all of its alternative endings, but I'm not sure if I care. <br /> <br /> So, if you loved the first THHE so much, it is almost a sin you can't see, anyway, look at it. But if otherwise, then Avoid at all costs. It's for your own good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
