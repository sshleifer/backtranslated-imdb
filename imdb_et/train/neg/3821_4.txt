What is the most offensive film? "Cries and Whispers" Gynecological Nightmare? Fassbinder Acid Psychodrames? Is the last house on the left? I'm sure this part of the film-loving public that links their masts to the good ship Buster Keaton is just one answer - one of his sound films. <br /> <br /> I don't know what a little bit of my soul in this movie was like - Keaton's intricate and expansive physical art landing innocent; the painful hesitation of this masterful filmmaker with dialogue - not that he does not have a cute, comic voice or that he can't make a dialogue funny; it's just that the studio doesn't seem to have taken enough of her, and so she seems to have tried to remember her lines before she arrives, which only makes her - Keaton, not her character, seems silly; Or is it a humiliation to see that Keaton has been hit by a sexy farce when she has given us some of the richest romantic disappointments? No, I know what was most annoying - I had to watch Buster Keaton, the biggest comedian in the cinema, sit aside to watch Jimmy Durante, who made his schtick. It's horror like what gives Dantes composer in Inferno. <br /> <br /> MGM seems to have become a curious idea that the best way to customize Keaton's sound was to make him Marx Brother, with verbal pedantry, complicated, annoying "clowning", shambolic slapstick, theatrical performance, triumph through chaos and Thelma Todd. Keaton was not just such a comic, and where Groucho's malicious language and gleeful opportunism could do the work of this plot, the Buster's socially renowned professor can't do it, he's too learned and predictable. <br /> <br /> What you need Buster needed to be tested like Lang 'M' or Rene Clair; He would never have tried to block the ascent of Chaplin. If a film, such as "General" is spoken - talking about trains - the loss becomes even clearer. <br /> <br /> And the thing is that this film is not so bad on flat patches - there is a great shock when the camera on the bus leaves Keaton at the railway station alone; and emptying, if barely original, is at least more lively than before. There is something Keaton slows down the plot that needs all the necessary zipper. <br /> <br /> Here is the film about loneliness, emotionally paralyzing sequence, the stunning effect of education, etc. The best way to evaluate this film is to look not at Professor TZ Post's narrative, but at the emasculated genius Buster Keaton, who is trapped in a mediocrity prison that is confused with the new technology that is misled by malicious destiny (in this case, the studio), maintaining stoic grace. That's what it saw, it becomes a kind of masterpiece.
