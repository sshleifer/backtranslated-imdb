From the time when the cinema-loving universe introduced the name George A. Romero, the word "zombie" is automatically linked to horror images and non-stop actions steeped in blood. It's safe to say that his "Dead Night of Life" was a zombie movie, as we know it now. However, in the early years of the cinema, the assumption of reorganized corpses was only used in slow, almost operational minority psychological thrillers. Jacques Tourneur's "I Walked with the Zombie" is a great example and so is the "White Zombie" starring Bela Lugosi. This "zombie rebellion" could have been another example, but unfortunately this failure is a whole line and easily one of the annoying movies I've ever seen. Terrible action, a very poorly written scenario and a complete lack of atmosphere and tension! The film lasts only 65 minutes and in the first half of the year, completely stupid love story intrigues and unonciting monologues are wasted. The layout of Angkor, the legendary city of Cambodia, could certainly have led to a more powerful story, but everything we ever see is internal. The main actor (Dorothy Stone, a blonde with a textbook with curly hair and ugly nose) excited me enormously and I hoped that the frightening undead would suddenly appear somewhere. Unhappy again? If you manage to fight yourself in 60 difficult minutes, you can pay a pretty decent final. However, it is too small to make a positive assessment of this film, not to mention the recommendation. Avoid! This is the type of movie you should see only if you saw everything else.
