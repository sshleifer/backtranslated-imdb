Run away from this movie. Even according to B-film standards, this movie is terrible. It is also insidious about his subject. The main point is that people who reject society and have no respect are cool and worthy of admiration. People who treat others with respect are losers. Guncrazy is a film that speaks much better about this movie than it is, look at it. <br /> <br /> No ordinary child does what Trent does. State Troopers do not work as they see this movie, etc. Seeing this movie makes you understand why writers use a silver-gold click. Mija is a totally insecure whore who, yes, has had a terrible life. But he is such a terrible person that the audience cannot identify with. <br /> <br /> Normally, one thing you can recommend a movie is not. This is a ridiculous film that offends the person trying to identify with the main characters. Working according to the B-film standards is sufficient and the direction does not provide anything new or interesting.
