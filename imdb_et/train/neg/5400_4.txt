This is just a short inflatable gene festival based on the story of Stephen King. Two tabloid rapporteurs, one flavored (Miguel Ferrer) and one not so achieved (Julie Entwisle), believe that the serial killer (Michael H. Moss) may actually be a vampire. Strangely, the stranger of today's blood often doesn't naturally make its way, but through black Cessna, she is looking for her victims. Gore gets really frightening when the movie goes to its foolish place. Remember, Mr. King had nothing to do with this movie. I admit it is a little scary at night.
