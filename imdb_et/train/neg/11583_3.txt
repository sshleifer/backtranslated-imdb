This film introduces quite a few characters and their relationships in the first half hour. None of them are of any interest or positive response. I was waiting for the intrigues to begin, hoping things would get better and arrived until the bitter end, but there was no reward for that. <br /> <br /> If you want to synops, look elsewhere. It is worth nothing to me. Not that the story was so bad, I think you could say I had problems with the script - i.e. I thought it was stupid. Look at the credit, which shows that there is pretty strong cast here, unused. Most of the old pros in this flick do good jobs; participants I didn't see before I particularly liked Deborah Kara Unger. That's all I can say well about this picture.
