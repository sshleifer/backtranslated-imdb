The original show was so much better. They should have left. This movie killed the whole idea. It was boring, too dramatic and funny parts were too far to relax. This movie really seemed too hard to be serious, and it was certainly not what I wanted to do. Not to mention that for a long time, the same thing was over and over again. So, sorry, Tyler Perry, but try the next time more. This movie is just boring and not so funny. Sorry. The 4/10 stars have it. <br /> <br /> Jay Addison
