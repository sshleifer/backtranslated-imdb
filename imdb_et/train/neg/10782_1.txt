the only scenes that made me laugh, where those who walked with Christopher (crazy filmmaker) were the first hours of the rest of the movie. So nothing happens. jones douglas is really overacting.julia roberts is doing routine work on a former unsightly duck (yes yes!) neighbor's girlfriend (where did i see it before?) who gets a guy. what would happen to the main characters.
