From the beginning of the film, the feeling that the director tries to portray something I want to say is that instead of dictating the style of film creation, he has gone the opposite way, he was the kind of movement he wanted to do and wrote the story. And it has been very badly failed in it. I think he was trying to make a stylish movie. Anyway, I think this movie is a complete waste of time and effort. According to the director's credit, he knows the media with which he works, what I am trying to say is that I have seen inferior films. Here at least the director knows how to maintain the continuity of the film. Participants have also produced a decent result.
