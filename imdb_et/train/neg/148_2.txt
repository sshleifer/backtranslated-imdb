I'm in Iraq right now, working hard to watch movies. We also have access to many pirated films, this pearl came with 11 other films, and it's just the worst I've seen for a long time. I've seen some other insights that argue that this film doesn't take itself too seriously, but really, I think it's covered for being horrible. It's not the cheek of the tongue, the writers really thought they'd fix the Blade movie. This movie is just one notch of the Vampire Assassin, which, if you haven't seen it, recommend. At least this movie is so incredibly bad that you laugh harder than you thought it was possible. That's right if it's never with redeeming qualities. from bad behavior to clich√© visual (ie, credit opening), adobe premiere special effects. they didn't even get the blanks for the guns that might be related to the places shot with the film, but if you use the effects, make them accurate. as cast, it seems they just went to the tae bo class and took the first, not ugly chick, who walked out. Again, like Ron Hall in Vampire Assassin, don't let the folks go, they can't. There is also a comment that it is "returning old vampire films" ... no, that is not. That's exactly what all the new vampire films are. Buffy Vampire Slayer, Blade, Underworld, they're all about super-star fighting vampires. This is the newest vampire genre with bad blood, fake screaming and exciting actors. probably everyone who has made a good review of it is somehow connected to a movie or a cast of friends. But what I care about was 33 cents. Anyway, someone in the first semester of film school decided to make a movie, I'll give them credit because it's better than I could do. Of course I also know that I can't make movies so I'm not trying. I know how to watch movies, however. I work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, I've seen many thousands of years when I was here and it was so bad that I was hoping for a boomer until the time was gone.
