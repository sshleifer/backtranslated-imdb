This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Dealing with good actors does not meet the film's expectations. The most dramatic thing about this film is the music that captures the film: compensates for the bad and confusing story of well-known good actors, loud and dramatic music. It doesn't change the fact that it's a very boring movie to watch. Earned 1 point.
