The main premise of cinematography, 3 young lady wrecking her car and still staying with a horrible family. Looking at 36 minutes of intent to chase EU cars with a bronze white white sedan. YAWN. <br /> <br /> Old lady with hot and cold dementia controlling her daughter ... YAWN <br /> <br /> 23 minutes of eating - YAWN Trying to find out what the hell they eat ... OK here can be a drinking game ... quick - YAWN <br /> <br /> Free shower scenes ... OK I got my interest for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Totally random and uninspired killings ... YAWN <br /> <br /> End ... dude! this psycho has failed - why can't the rest of the movie be in the last 5 minutes ... unfortunately this is - my advice - move on in the last five minutes and watch it and then put the player in something good - for me I'm going to sleep.
