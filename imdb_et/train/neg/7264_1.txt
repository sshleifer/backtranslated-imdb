Just another movie that uses free male nudity; terrible action, plus the scenes of love are the sexiest I've ever seen (and it's not for me the idea of ​​two young men's love because I'm gay). <br /> <br Again, Julian Hernandez, like Mil Nubes de pazis, led an incredibly pretentious movie story that gives enough argument for about five minutes for a short film, but can do a two-hour movie ... And this time the Mexican gay community doesn't even talk about racism and Trading! God is gracious for us!
