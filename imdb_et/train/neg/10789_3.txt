If you expect a lot to see in the Altikolar bath, as the label is proven, you are very disappointed that the film contains nothing more than Altistok's populist style in relation to the most famous issues such as sex, marriage and cheating. A lot of nudity, which seems to be somewhere and has no connection, indicates that Altıoklar failed to "try something new" as he has quoted. For many sex jokes, it seems that Altıoklar had fallen for the famous words "selling sex". I was hoping to see a very good story with a very good narrative technique. Ultimately, I found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and looked at the experimental, but still much more focused on the popularity of Altıcker.
