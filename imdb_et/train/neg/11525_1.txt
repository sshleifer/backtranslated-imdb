Just terrible! Why don't you use real participants? Look, this must end! Stop using non-participants! If you want some kind of credibility or any message sent through these low budget movies, please use God's love to use real actors! Most work for free ... don't do it! Now back to my comment ... anyway, humor was lower than the bathroom variety and was not funny on every level. As for quality ... on one scene that is filmed on a public transport bus, you see the reflection of the crew ... guess what? It was one man who looked like a Sony Camcorder and probably not even his. Well, I assume that the only audience in this movie is people who have gore fetish ... and it wasn't even a good gore.
