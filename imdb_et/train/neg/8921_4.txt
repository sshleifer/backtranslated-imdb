Afro-American female Scrooge's premise in a modern, troubled city was inspired, but there is nothing else in this movie. Here is Mrs Scrooge's evil banker, who takes advantage of the workers and clients of large poor and black workers. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. The problem is that the story's roots don't change that movie in the urban environment well, and the script can't update. Also, the constant message of sharing and giving is so endless that the audience gets tired of it before the end of it. It's a movie that doesn't know when to stop. The title role of giving talented Cicely Tyson gives too strong a result and sometimes it is difficult to understand. The Charles Dickens novel has been adapted so many times, it is difficult to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant, despite its very relevant message.
