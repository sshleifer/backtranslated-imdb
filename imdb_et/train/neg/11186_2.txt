I wanted to watch this movie, but one strange ridiculous scene forced me to turn it off. The characters don't seem to react. Think about it: Heath Ledger walks in the evening (through my cemetery) when he is attacked by the spirits he controls. When this challenge is over, he walks calmly and meets a friend who saw it all. When asked what would happen, he gently says "attacked by demons, something serious." As if it were just a little more exciting than a flat tire. <br /> <br /> I shut it down when they ask for something - a demon or something, I stopped taking care of a quion ion. The answer can be rented out from someone who has the energy of his death, and the priestly watch, which seems to be a vague resentment when the man is pulled up and hung, and they ask their exhausting, dead body question. 0 stars ****.
