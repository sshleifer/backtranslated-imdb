I saw this movie with some Indian friends on Christmas Day. A quick summary of this movie must be AVOID. JP Dutta wrote, directed, produced and edited this film and did well on any of these works. <br /> <br /> The film talks about Pakistan's attempt in 1999 to catch some of Kashmir's disputed region in India. The allegation is based on the hint of the film about the difficulties that the Indian army had released from the Pakistani troops - who were occupied with high ground. But instead of telling what has been a compelling and heroic story, all this film makes the Indian army look ridiculous and stupid, which I know is not right. <br /> <br /> I was looking at this film almost completely for an Indian audience who was very patriotic and apparently wanted this movie, but also found themselves laughing at scenes that were not meant to be funny. <br /> <br /> The script was exhausting. This gave the impression that Mr Dutta did not know anything about how the army was operating and used bad military films to get a reference. The result is a script that is meaningless and repetitive. <br /> <br /> Most principals did not act, but given the script given to them, I find it difficult to criticize them too much. As for support, I can say that I hope they were amateurs. <br /> <br /> Also, editing was pretty bad. It was quite difficult to keep track of what was going on for a long time, and the music would suddenly change the scene. <br /> <br /> Good things: Cinematography was pretty good, although it was a little painful that the film didn't change color (color balance is often very different in scenes). Some of the songs on the film were also quite enjoyable - at least one and a half verses at least. Unfortunately, they went to LOT for longer than they should have. <br /> <br /> And the worst crime? This confusion is four hours long. It is enough here for a good editor to squeeze a nearly 1.5-2 hour movie. Unfortunately, a good editor did not work with this movie.
