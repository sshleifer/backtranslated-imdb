You saw that movie was running on TCM. Many of the film-related problems came out of what I saw. First, there were no adults aged 10 years or older. There were continuity problems in several parts of the film, and for some reason the youngest son seemed to be the oldest in the actor's 10 years. <br /> <br /> The copy I saw was missing in about 20 minutes, with at least a big difference between a black screen. It is too bad, because even though the script remained undesirable, both Bergman & Russell made a fine in their roles. It's a shame that a big piece is missing, but what's here is traceable. <br /> <br /> I just wish it was all intact. The point of the script is not that the Bergman character is sent out when the children are small, but then they get back when they are adults? Some timeline doesn't make sense either. There is a similar stock market crisis in 1929, but children are growing up to fight in World War I. All the people who support this movie are doing well. Just do not know what was the lack of 20 films that I did not see because it was missing.
