I still can't believe how bad this movie was. If I wasn't a mass victim, I don't know if I would have survived the viewing. It would seem to cost about $ 1,000, but it wasn't the money that put them down. Action was terrible - not only bad, 3. graders could read the lines better. Secondly, the only reason to watch this movie is skin and it is really lacking on this flick. We can't even see the most attractive buffs in the buffs. Well, better luck next time eh?
