I'm working on a Horror Classics 50 movie collection and ZOMBIES REVOLT is one of the set's films. I look at them with my soon-to-seven-year-old daughter, who makes most of these films ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I had great hopes for ZOMBIES REVOLT after watching the white Zombie, which is indeed so much a forerunner that it is the main element of the cinema (think Clive Barker's Serpent and Rainbow and James Bond Live and Let Die at the funeral, NOT Night of Living Dead). <br /> <br /> Although the title contains the word "zombies", it is a bit more like a triangle of love that includes an anthropologist Armand Louque, hit by Claire Duval; who in turn is taken with a companion to Clifford Grayson. What a horror event, my daughter stayed asleep halfway. <br /> <br /> It was a real difficult time for those who worked for them - allies or the ax; but I think it is not really important. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see Bela Lugos this movie credit; but of course they were his eyes (from White Zombie) who served the zombie peace of mind.
