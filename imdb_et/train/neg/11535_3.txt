Gillian Anderson is a lofty, motivated, career woman who chooses Danny Dyer for a fun night. After a stupid accident in rural areas, they are brutally attacked. After recovery and after the opportunity to meet one of the attackers, their thoughts turn to revenge ... <br /> <br /> I thought "straight ends" were terrible. Violent, brutal, misogynous and unpleasant. If I didn't like the phrase a lot, I would call "Straightheads" video nasty. Certainly, on the dark days of the 1980s, there was just a movie that wouldn't have released any budget. Frankly, I don't know how "Straightheads" got out of the cinema. <br /> <br /> I'm not a bride. I do not mind sex and violence in the film, but they must be married to a film that has a) good plot or b) good characterization, or c) preferably both. "Straight ends" could not. There is no progress in the picture or the characters, and too much has not been explained and spoken. Luckily, straight ends went somewhere fast. It was only 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> It was disgraceful, because here was an interesting movie germ, especially interesting in the last third. How often do I say it, but it could have been good if it was done properly. What a shame. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they hid something with this movie. Especially he is very underestimated (and still is particularly suitable). <br /> <br /> If you would like to see a good British revenge movie, rent or buy Shane Meadows' Dead Man's Shoes. It's a little masterpiece. Last weekend I should have seen her "It's England". Ce sera ...
