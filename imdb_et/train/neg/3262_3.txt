I was happy to meet George Pal (and I still have my DS TMOB poster with autograph) right after release and asked him why he chose the "camp" movie. Before she replied, two studio flies and lectures were taken on how the studio "knew best" and how "no one takes such a movie seriously". I had read Bantam's reprints for a couple of years thanks to a friend (ComiCon's participants in the 1970s recall Blackhawk and his band? I was with him for a couple of years) and they had more hopes than we had The fleas insisted that no high adventure would ever be taken seriously, so "camp "Making the only way. Several other fans jumped to me, listening as well as possible. At the end of the small event, Pal came to us and apologized for having done more and better things. <br /> <br /> STAR WARS spread the lies and after a year of Pal's death, Spielberg and Lucas proved that Doc Savage could have been the next big movie franchise ... if it hadn't been flacks. <br /> <br /> Clear Doc's memory or history and the movie would have been worth 6/10 ratings as something other than a meaningless popcorn vendor. <br /> <br /> But the destruction of this heritage was not only an abomination as a child's crib. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage can still come to the screen and live inevitably when compared to Indiana Jones, but it must be done seriously and seriously to demand the hope of the first American superhero. <br /> <br /> SIDENOTS: Yes, there was another script for ARILENEM'S RIGHT, and it is much more serious. Yes, they were taken at the same time, but most of the shots and participants were created very little. And yes, there is one Ron Ely sheet that jumped over the brick and blows something over its shoulder with a specially built bronze gun. Ely wears a white shirt with a bronze-shaped button in the trash and the words "DOC SAVAGE: EVILENEY OF EVIL ... Coming next Summer!" POSTSCRIPT: If anyone knows who is the studio flacks accompanying George Pal in 1975, the idiots for San Diego were beaten and called the idiots they are. At that time, they made dorkknob and Fu Manchut stripes and canvas canvas and wore a Paramount portfolio.
