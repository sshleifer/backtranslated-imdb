I found basically that Eden's curve was very poorly constructed, making it hard to see. However, there is something I have to say about how the director took something about the atmosphere of the early 1970s when choosing settings and clothes. "Back to Earth" philosophy and interest in sexual exploration and drugs, which was not dramatically decadent, as depicted in many of the later 70's versions, was right, as was "not asking" the pseudo-East Coast intellectual brotherhood Liberty, except that I would have thought it was a school in New England rather than one in Virginia, where I imagine that a "good boy" mentality still dominated even such elite schools like this one. The other thing I appreciated and could relate to is that homosexuality was not so much related to bats or queen queens, and I appreciated some homosexual roles that were not related to their terribly overwhelmed images. I felt it was very unfortunate that in the 80s, "gay culture" from the streets of Castro and Christopher was a certain standard form that defined the movement and left out a huge number of men who were more modest in their lifestyle. I appreciated the film mainly as a way to remember the more natural way we were from our sexuality and personal relationships without a "scene".
