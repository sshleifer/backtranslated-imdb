What happened during World War I in New Zealand when American troops were there? <br /> <br /> This terrible story of the four sisters was really pathetic to look at. Can you imagine Joan Fontaine being poured out as Sandra Dee's parent? Fontaine looked more like a mother. Even more fun was that Fontaine got pregnant in the movie. <br /> <br /> Piper Laurie and Paul Newman, who showed up so much on the screen in chemistry 4 years later, have no scene in this movie. Laurie plays another sister who goes to Wellington to tramp there, despite being married. Woe to her when her husband returns to war. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons is a widow and finds a lot of romance with Paul Newman. There's even romance for the young Miss Dee. <br /> <br /> There is little or no picture. Are they trying to say that everything is fair in love and war? If they are, they did a bad job of selling it. <br /> <br /> The conflict of interest with Newman and Simmons has been quickly eliminated. That should have been the terrible disappointment of 1957.
