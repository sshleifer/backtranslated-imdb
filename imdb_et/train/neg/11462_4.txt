I generally like monster movies. Even if they are incredible and stupid. But for this movie, it's hard if it's so unlikely and silly AND trying to take it seriously at the same time. Like in a really nice way. <br /> <br /> Although the idea is somewhat factual, as Orcas is known for killing large white sharks, it's really hard to find this fear when I can't help but just see angry Shamoo destroy things. Especially that one scene where a building exploded in making Orca ... and when it explodes, the thing pops out of the water and it seemed I was looking at Sea World's exhibition with fireworks. In addition, they kill a lot of frightening moments before they even suggest that they are going to happen. In addition, JAWS takes a couple of steps. It's like "hey look, we're factual and we can offer better reasons why Orca is attacking". <br /> <br /> Yes, of course ignoring your anger **** logic. But JAWS had one thing your movie didn't. It's terrible. Yes, it's unlikely. Yes, it is somewhat terrible. But frankly, factual or not, Killer Shark is almost as scary as big white. And the bad test of character development and writing hurts it more. Even the revenge of the JAWS is revenge.
