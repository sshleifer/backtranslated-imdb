This film has a part of its negative comments and I have to agree with those who consider it to be one of the worst films. True, most of the films made on the basis of the king's works are pretty bad, but it goes beyond the scary area. There is no one scary moment in this, if you don't think it's stupid. This is a typical King's garbage - sold myths that were not reasonable at first, blended with obvious and belabored so-called "scares" that are about as shocking as PeeWee's playhouse (which is at least fun). It's full of ridiculous moments, the least of which is the character of Alice Krige. When he goes to rampage and starts robbing the old Batman TV show as a villain, it is so absurd to be sick. All the people who were in this place (including John Land) are happy that they still have a career. But the most absurd part is to have cat costumes that look like a cheap rubber outfit that someone bought a K-trunk. The best part of the film is the appearance of some real cats who are actually acting on the film.
