Actor Ruth Roman's actual philanthropic gesture to attract soldiers who arrive and travel to the Korean War at the San Francisco Air Base launched this perfect Warner Brose salad against patriotism and song. Many celebrities make guest performances, while the romance of loving hatred develops between the stars and the body of a green and thin air force (Ron Hagerthy, who looks like he should deliver newspapers on his bike). It seems that the Corporal is deceiving the actor to deceive him to be on the battlefield when he is actually part of the airplane carrier who travels to and from Honolulu (you think he would be lucky enough to be in danger, but he acts like most childish women in the 1950s films). Doris Day is about thirty minutes, and her special ridiculous and happy song numbers are the most enjoyable. Roman is also here, looking glamorous, while James Cagney entertains his screen person and Gordon MacRae sings his beautiful baritone. Jane Wyman also sings hospital bed linen, followed by Doris Day, causing the idea: "Were they out of stock?" For unwanted viewers, there is an interesting setback for another time and place. Nonetheless, low-level production and simply sufficient technical aspects make Starlift a strictly second bill. * 1/2 from ****
