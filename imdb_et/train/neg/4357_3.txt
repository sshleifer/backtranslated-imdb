A group of friends are facing a family of harsh cannibals, while it is a beautiful German country. <br /> <br /> The concept of the 'mutant cannibal family' is almost as old as the mountains that are indoors. Often calling home so that any driver who tries to boost the soul's momentum must impress something quite special. With Barricade, Timo Rose is trying to give the worn routine a teutonic twist by moving his activity in the Black Forest and giving him German low budget spraying. The result is a very bloody but completely unigenous endeavor, which, thanks to some terrible decision-making processes, is almost fictitious, especially the elimination of the use of fancy filters and irritating editing techniques. <br /> <br /> Timo Rose did not decide to use every sneaker trick offered by her editing program, but Barricade could have been a reasonably fun gore-fest: her inexperienced casting is doing quite well; the bloody action is suitably abdominal pain; and there are one or two fears and even some awesome crappy moments. All this is completely destroyed by terrible work, dirty editing and visual trimming, which has made the film so inexplicably popular for today's filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I give Barricade 3 to 10 purely extreme gores containing a nice scene where the boy is forced to drink acid, loads of nasty wounds caused by various sharp tools, and some pretty decent shotguns .
