Unknown discombobulated Turkey, a mix of anti-Nazi music (!!), pre-war American and Agatha Christie, who are breaking one big and big problem: it's deadly sleepless. In addition to single-digit I.Q. The plot and the dialogue, "Lady ..." the most amazing aspect is berserk casting. Gene Wilder (co-author and co-author) tries to do all this: she plays romantic leadership (with her appearance !! and her age! She and Woody Allen should start a club of married, non-reflective parents) and she tries to be moving and funny and embarrassing and clever and try to sing and dance and succeed NONE !! Mel Brooks dropped a blow from his good days. <br /> <br /> After a while I thought I had myopia, because all the people in the movie say that Cherry Jones is this pretty hot chick and that Michael Cumpsty is the impossibly beautiful slave !! A man who plays Claire Bloom's male secretary is a seemingly hairy thin actor as sexy as a chair and it is the passion of two leading ladies! Mike Starri's top gateway, the most incompetent, most fanatic policeman you ever saw, is worth counting the 10 most terrible shows in the history of recent films. The most sad note is to see the magnificent Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa, who have been completely unsuccessful and attacked. At least I hope that both stars paid their bills home (and then fired their agents). No wonder Sukowa marveled at her return to Germany after seeing what Hollywood had saved her !! <br /> <br /> If you want to see how really bad the movie will be. director, look at it - otherwise leave it !!! - 1/10
