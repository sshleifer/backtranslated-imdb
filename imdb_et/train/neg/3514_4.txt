Philip. K. Dick's film. And it's a decent person. Better than Paycheck (Woo) and this abomination, called the Minority Report (Spielberg). But it does, it turns a little too much to me, turning and cheese. On the side of the film I was already afraid of such an end, and I was sorry for that. But this does not mean that the film is not worth the time. No, not at all. The first half (as many have already commented on) is fantastic. There are some parts where you will doubt whether the director wanted to send a message that showmanship is very important in the future (we do such things because of the bright things we can) or simply combine. However, paranoia exists and also feels "common." Good.
