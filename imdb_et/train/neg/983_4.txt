When Marlene Dietrich was poisoned by a post box in 1938, it was one of the few actors mentioned in the job descriptions, films like the Garden of God. The way the film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to see and be so intuitive is boring outside of me. Also, how Marlene, when she tried to widen her choice and not play a sex shot, missed such an old-fashioned story that is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Allah's Garden, one of the first films in modern technology, was a novel by Robert Hitchens at the beginning of the century, who then worked with the game to adapt to Mary Anderson, who ran from 1911 to 12. He then got two silent screen adjustments. The story tells a monk who is driving out of the monastery in French Tunisia to see what he has forgotten in the world. She runs like a disguised woman who was single and spent her main years caring for a sick parent. He is now traveling in the desert, and two meet on the train. <br /> <br /> The woman is of course Marlene and the kidnapped monk is Charles Boyer. I'm not sure what David O. Selznick was saying about this story. Someone, like Ingrid Bergman, could have been delicious for this audience. But you can bet that the publicity of the 1936 film, when they put their money down for the ticket, saw that they see Marlene as a contemporary Salome, not the saint of its title. The public was still remembered by Rudolph Valentino and you can bet that it was a romance and seduction of the desert they were expecting. <br /> <br /> For monks, you must remember that they are self-supporting in their monasteries, and especially one bottle of special wine from which Boyer is going to be a secret. The monastery must rethink its economics when Boyer leaves. The monks are sincerely a godly group, but they have the right to be a little worried about their own interests, Charles Waldron. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there are many religious explosions here with a couple of wires that are not really suitable for parts. Especially Marlene Dietrich. I'd look at this movie for a special color of the Cochincha and forget about the plot.
