This movie was nasty. They should be warned that a sadist disgusting writer is trying to give himself a name before being arrested one and a half hours as a criminal. What is garbage? Abuse of people's time, energy abuse and waste of any educational system that taught him to read and write. Talia you're a sick demented loser. Your psychiatrist needs stronger medicines for your problem. <br /> <br /> The action and graph did not give me any choice but to speed up the garbage in the middle. I came across a scene that was unreasonable. If you want to learn how to shock people, see Larry Clark's movie. I lost all of this movie's "respect for my support". How could actors or actors sit in a session, while such large images of human behavior appear psycho-like? I'm sorry for all the participants in this scene. I think the devil now knows who is the writer of this movie; congratulations on your attention.
