After a promising first 25 minutes, making you feel warm, you're pretty sure it's a great romantic comedy. Then the film gets worse. <br /> <br /> A warm feeling can still be there, but as others have said: The plot becomes so incredible and artificial that it is almost impossible to see. <br /> <br /> The movie is being accelerated and you get the impression that you have transmitted it quickly or that the manufacturers decided to fit it in less than 1 hour and had to cut out a lot of scenes. <br /> <br /> Realism is not an end in itself, but as a viewer I am quite convinced that this comedy is not intentionally unrealistic, but just happens. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, this film has a few nice interiors and, despite the bad script, I think the actors' performances are mostly good. If I could only assess the first 25 minutes, I would probably give it eight. As of now, it gets four. ... And that's great! <br /> <br /> If you are a baby of romantic comedies, you probably have a great time. If not, I would recommend that you look at something else.
