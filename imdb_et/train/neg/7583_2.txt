David Lea's worst film. Even "what we serve" was not as bad as it was. Typically, a film with a very good reputation has at least some redemption qualities, so you understand why it can be considered classic. But after looking at it, I just couldn't get that chick so much even in 1945! I did not want to act, a rigid top lip of British motifs, a story, a script (which can be quite funny at times, but totally unusual) and a soundtrack. Elvira's character is designed to be attractive and attractive, but in fact it was ugly and had a strange and tedious voice. Just another movie that has convinced me not to trust the film's reputation. Another very overrated British classic class.
