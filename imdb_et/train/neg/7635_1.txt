I fully agree with the review by the Variety Reviewer that the film is never as funny, lively or insightful about the creative process as its premise is justified. Narratively, this messy and lighting is really problematic. If the film should be character-like, poor lighting does not improve performance and sometimes facial expressions are difficult to follow. Many non-South Africans have difficulties in following the English language spoken in the film, and some of the local humor is lost in the process. Last year I watched it at the Cape Town World Cinema Festival. The film's comments and reactions ranged from unobtrusive and dull to the welcome departure from movies from our painful past. Unfortunately, Bunny Chow, as a new wave in South Africa, does not remember the bright lights, but some remarkable films about our apartheid history are indeed valued in our best 110-year film history. Not surprisingly, the movie disappeared from Cape Town cinemas just two weeks after its release and most of Durban and Gauteng cinemas. It is clearly limited among the South African population.
