I've never thought I'd see the movie worse than "Add Picard Is Famous," but it came close. As was repeatedly commented, it was predictable; after five minutes in the movie you know, it has failed in the result. This movie refers to / drapes everything from "Something Mary" to "Pink Panther's Revenge". Writer Greg Glienna (meet with parents) needs new material. <br /> <br /> The only twist is the boy-boy / police officer caught by the internal affairs, but even this opportunity is wasted. Many Seattle Space Needle shots are needed to hide the obvious Canadian film scene. Some of the worst rides in car scenes, where almost no attempt was made to hide the fact that the car was pulled out of the city through a trailer. Geez, at least turn the wheel or put in the brakes from time to time. Selma Blair is an inert and short discount. $ 3M for Jason Lee, what? I think it wins the skateboard! <br /> <br /> So here, who should see this movie: fans of Bee Gees who want to hear two actors singing "Islands on Stream" badly; People who don't get Julia Styles enough. 1/10
