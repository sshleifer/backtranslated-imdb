The concept of Sarafina seems to be a sound that is away from the musical point of view. He tries to combine an innovative African music story that describes the terrible conditions and the atmosphere that black people were forced to hold during the film's setting. The contradictions between both elements are too prominent and the film never justifies such swift exchanges between anniversary and terror. If it were just a drama reflecting these conditions, it could have been a good movie, but the scenes shot by the soldiers did not sit right next to the songs. <br /> <br /> In addition to the weak assumption that performance is not the best, Goldberg gives the average score as well as the rest. Generally disappointing. <br /> <br /> 3/10
