Richard Dix is ​​a big, not very nice industrial company that has almost been dead. When she takes a vacation that her doctors recommend to her, can she find happiness in her life in recent months? Well, he's probably better than he ignores WHISTLER VOORI. <br /> <br /> This entry by William Castle contains some great moments (introducing and depicting Richard Dix's life through the newspaper Kane) and some intriguing drawings in the final rolls. Dix's performance is generally pretty good. Unfortunately, this is not the case simply because no one buys them to behave the way they do. The film also moves from a dark (and exciting start) almost to a joyous 30th film, such as a midsection (full of nice urban ethnic types who don't mind being rich) and back to a complicated noir plot. it is a decent film - it is worth watching - but it took a little more time to create a couple of characters and a female driver that could satisfy her role.
