First of all, this movie starts really foolish: a 10-year-old girl playing in a moving vehicle decides to have her mother's eyes covered with funny hands and then a terrible accident killing her mother .... duh .... I'm sorry 10 -year-old is not so stupid. The rest of the movie doesn't improve. After the mother's death on the planet's 10-year vision, her father's family moves to Genoa, Italy, where she has to teach at a local university, but here she is not speaking an Italian word! Then, in the small town, there are "visions" of the mother (who killed him) and often of the following night's fears, always, always at the end of his father, who keeps him and encodes. Then we are forced to watch that family exist and then find and then hug and then cry and disappear and then find (followed by more hugging and crying, of course) until I actually wanted some kind of natural disaster just to wipe all those coats of unknown people out of the planet. Don't get me wrong because I love indies, but indie about stupid people (and I mean really stupid) is just ridiculous and pointless. It is really a shame that this film was based on weak characters that were in such slow-down scenarios, because that location was interesting.
