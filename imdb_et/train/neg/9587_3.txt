Holiday in the 1950s (London) Soho and Future People. Cultural novel based. <br /> <br /> Julian Temple is a video director. No more, no less. Give him $ 15 million and he'll make you $ 15 million of pop-video. Here he forgets that two minutes with people who can't really act is one thing - just two hours? What he meant. Besides, who is the audience? Who cares about a book that was well remembered when it came back. A normal London story about having a chancer. <br /> <br /> What does this movie really do? Oh, I know the third-rate songs that sound like they were on the ground. David Bowie chronicles the title of the film a couple of times and it is highlighted. The Soundtrack album is a clay pigeon material. <br /> <br /> However, one good thing is. A good holiday for the Soho period. Shame that they couldn't imagine anything.
