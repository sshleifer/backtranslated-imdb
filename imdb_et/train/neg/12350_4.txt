Hmmm ... where to start? How did a serious actor like Demi Moore participate in such a mess? "First Blood" may be rated as a bull *** t, but this type of nonsense is just a Rambo with tits, point. Of course, if you are interested in crapstory (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be a part of NAVY seals), which is the most stupid clich√© one I think then say "GI Jane" is a great movie. Viggo Mortensen's presentation made this film tolerable, but for hell, I don't think Demi Moore is Rambo (especially not the last, useless, in 30 minutes). Ridley Scott does not deserve credit for making this film, which is designed for women with equal rights, it is just the American army's brain-free propaganda and, to make it more attractive, they fell to Moore. Amazing movie.
