It was not enjoyable to watch. Frank puts all his dreams back into the burner and gets the usual (boring!) Job, so his stepfather can go to school, but his stepfather decides that he will do a humiliating documentary instead. The documentary filmmaker should direct the camera and simply shoot, not manipulate and comment on sneakers. The bitterness of the filmmaker and the resentment of his father's father are obvious. And sad. The goal seems to be that Frank appears stupid and miserable, rather than being the most human of the 3 people he represents. really is. It left me with an intense mind to the filmmaker.
