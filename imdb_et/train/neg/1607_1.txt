This "documentary" is a proof that talents are used for medium purposes. The fact that it is financed by the Venezuelan Government gives it a lack of legitimacy to seek the truth about what really happened in April 2002 in Venezuela on terrible terrible days. /> <br /> There are ways to lie and the leaders of this stuff are both inactivity and knowledge. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan political process is too complicated for foreign audiences to easily understand and use it. For example, * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * show pro-Ch치vez protesters who shoot at an empty street (what the hell did they do?), Saying they didn't kill anyone, but didn't bother displaying all of our visions here, opposition protesters (and journalists) who is "dead" on the other side of the street dead or injured. They cannot explain why the political police chopper was the only one who was allowed to fly over Caracas that day, and did nothing to make the snipers that were on the roofs of all the buildings near the Presidential Palace were ineffective. have security measures to guard the president. A few days after the "coup", the National Assembly (our Congress) asked the chief of the responsible military guard why they did not act against the snipers and said, "because they weren't for the President to accept," is it not a confession? <br /> <br /> There's so much more that the highest army said Ch치vez had left and two days later he said he'd been lying because it's "politics" and nowadays Ch치vez is the Minister of Internal Affairs. <br /> <br /> It would take me thousands of words to explain all the lies in this "documentary" made to sell the world. a good old Hugo Ch치vez picture of the poor and bad rich opposition who want him at all costs, when the truth is that 60-70% of people refuse to take their government and this percentage also includes the poor. > <br /> I hope that those who have seen and bought it will see a different version made by the b y Venezuelan group of people showing at least 30 lies. <br /> <br /> Nazi propaganda has come back!
