Scary Movie 2 was a serious disappointment. Just referring to films such as Mission Impossible 2 does not bring comedy. The film opens up funny enough for the white people who play the great use of James Woods and Andy Richter. Unfortunately, the film tends to be there. Action is terrible. Tori Spelling looks and works completely. The film seems to be hacked and is surprisingly slow. Some of the longer ghosts in this snail-pace movie, which included the joints and the previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie, were fun for everyone in my theater. Fortunately, stopping the movie after 83 minutes is shockingly endless. (I say shocking, because the end doesn't even try to end with humor) I don't know what else to say except it is a sloppy rushed step that made Miramax more money on the back of peaceful teenagers. In general, the film is very badly made.
