I do not recommend this if you do not want David Copperfield and you want to complete a set. There are some good results (such as Uriah Heep) and well-managed moments (eg beating), but in general it is compared to the 1999 BBC version, as well as previous versions. <br /> <br /> The story has unexplained changes that really don't make a big difference unless it's possible to hide it (stolen jewelery is an example). The American cast was badly chosen: Sally Field is a good actor, but he is wrong when Betsy Trotwood and his English accent are just a little better than Dick Van Dyke's chef. I see why Michael Richards was chosen to play Mr. Micawber; however, it hugs it too much and becomes irritating. He also talks about his line of accent that goes beyond the eccentric and simply becomes superfluous. Anthony Andrews is threatening Mr Murdstone, but soon he hopes he will leave black leather and tie David to his mother's rail (although this is perhaps partly Dickens' fault). <br /> <br /> I got this newspaper for free. It helped to pass on Sunday afternoon, but I felt disappointed at the end
