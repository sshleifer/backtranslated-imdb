You don't think such a movie would be good and it is not. It's not a budget, a highly violent zombie movie that has been shot with a bad-looking camera ... and it's fun. Apparently, the actors have never acted before and show off their horrible fun reading. No visual image. The small plot I found was that the government's attempt to escape and a group of zombies seem to be terrorizing a couple of families. Gore effects are actually some of the worst I've seen. It seems that the gore effects that all body parts attacked in the meat industry include many scenes of zombies that break people and eat their organs. It's a funny and sick movie and it's about as bad as every movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 90 minutes.
