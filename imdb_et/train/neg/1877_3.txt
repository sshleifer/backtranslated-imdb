I haven't seen "Henry Fool," but after watching "Fay Grim" I'm not sure if I want to. Perhaps Hartley is trying to be an "anti-thriller" director - he certainly succeeded with this boss. Based on an official description --- the woman discovers that her deceased manuscript contains material that could endanger national security - I was expecting a tense geopolitical drama. Instead, I got a weak structure, a funny dialogue, flabby testimonials, a twisted plot, and "often," which often shifts, suggesting that Hartley changed the script according to his mood at any time. I can hang for a long time with a frustrating and hard-to-follow plot (eg "Duplicity") because I think the open ends will eventually come together. Even if they do not or do, but they leave persistent questions (eg "Duplicity"), sharp writing and action may be of interest. But to the side of "Fay Grim" I came to a deadly understanding - I didn't know what was going on and I didn't care. Too bad because I like Parker Posey, who reduced here working with an absurd part, asking him to morifida indifferently, stranger and indifferent, helpless mother harshly, international "players" who are capable of psychologic with terrorists. It is also bad for casting. Jeff Goldblum can be very good, but he can't go beyond making CIA operational. He sees his role almost as uncomfortably as I was watching him. His CIA sidekick is worse; she looks like a "American Idol" quarter festival refugee (is it really young CIA agents who have big hair cease on their foreheads?). Then there is the age of the characters. Goldblum was 54 when he made "Fay Grim"; Thomas Jay Ryan, who plays "Henry Fool", was 44. Nor was it done or seemed older than their real age. But the main point of the story is that they served as CIA agents in Nicaragua in the "70s." Goldblum's character would have been in his 20's; Henry Fool would have been a teenager. Was Hartley "peculiar" or lazy? Problems are too large to list ...
