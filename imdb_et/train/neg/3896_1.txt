Well. Astronaut Steve West sits in a plastic capsule, noting that "you have not lived until you have seen the sunset through Saturn's rings," while the visible midday sunlight flows through the window, if suddenly it is nose bleeding. Next, the West is home to some secret hospital, a melting gelatinous mass that gets frightening and causes a thick nurse to pass through a fake glass door. Apparently, the West will become "stronger in fusion", which makes this hopelessly purple and intertwined moan as much meaning as anything. Then, the army brass that looks like Coleman Francis (the director of many bad moovies) tries to cover up the information, but the goo man runs around killing everything he sees because he melts. He attacks an older couple because he melts. He makes one terrible actress with yelling and meaningless help for about 10 minutes as he melts. He melts because he melts. Dirty Rick Baker has had to be a star star, but they just look out. The film is badly fired and it all seems so dark and confusing that it is very difficult to do what it is - not to help. MooCow says who cut this cheese? : = 8P ps - "Didn't you get any crackers?"
