It may be the worst show I've ever seen. Despite the tasting of sitcom on Hitler, it's not just funny or fun. It is very similar to the 1950s sitcom in its cornball humor and established situations, but although it may be well done as I Love Lucy, it is not just funny here. I think the exhibition was based around the novelty "look, it's Hitler as a worshiper of sitcom", but it fell completely. The man who plays Hitler is so hammy that it's hard to sit alone. I don't know what the network might have thought it would be a good idea for the air. I thought there was a tasteless show in America, but the British could win this time. America would never incite Hitler's command, even though we had this exhibition from the secret diary of Desmond Pfeiffer, a Lincoln slave. You will probably never see this example because it was just one episode and will probably never be published on DVD.
