Particularly dull drama, which is a very young Roddy McDowall who trains a wild horse, titled Flicka, and is the only reason to watch a movie. It is covered with blaring, frightening music and a weighted Schmaltzy dialogue, one of those endless movies that will lead you to a boring headache. The Naffly titled "Thunderhead, the son of Flicka", where McDowall is attacking the next generation of winds, is somewhat better than the original, but the pace is still slow, and the score will continue, though there are at least one or two scenes that do not create a coma.
