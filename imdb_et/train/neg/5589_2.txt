I remember that Richard Burton's character seemed so desperately lost, and I remember how his motives didn't change for me. In short, I remember "Circle of Two" because it was so phenomenally terrible. <br /> <br /> This movie came out at a time when America was going through a rather disturbing era for teenagers with unhealthy or slanted angles. sexuality. Recall "Blue Lagoon" (and other Brooke Shields outrages), "Lipstick", "Little Darlings", "Beau Family" and other films that were like sexually, especially adults. As a teenager of this time, I found obsession with the 70's and 80's sexual overdoses, unconsciously done in an uneven environment, with the exception of everything, so to speak. <br /> <br /> "The two-sided ring is neither feasible nor unnecessarily prurient, such as the" Blue Lagoon. "In fact, it deals with the question of love between the young and the old when it totally fails, but to be honest, it is one of those movies you never see * did you not see it for the first time because it was so terrible, nobody would want this garbage ever to be redistributed.
