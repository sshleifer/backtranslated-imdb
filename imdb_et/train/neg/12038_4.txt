Is there anything in this movie. There are only strange short scenes where I didn't know what hell is going to happen, so it doesn't matter. This movie is so boring that it hurts, and it comes from someone who likes it when the movies are made. Confused? And I was watching this mess after that. What was Donald Sutherland because he missed it completely. And what about the "pedophile" movie at the beginning of the scene. Can make someone sleep! 4/10
