It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's as much as I can say. It starts with a good atmosphere; the hospital is suitably sterile and alienating, the mood is set to "eerie". And then ... something. Well, nothing. Just something that obviously doesn't fit ... and no effort has been made to find out the connection between the odd and yet not particularly scary critters and the hospital they have taken over. I mean, come on, biker duds? Some bands watched Gwari too little. suppress an Afghan-covered couch, disassemble your belt, listen to cheap beer (probably Schlitz) and watch the game. Honestly, I've seen far more powerful trucks. On trucks. Drink coffee. WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Scary! <br /> <br /> Other monsters are even more tricky and even less intimidating. The videos on the DVD have at least explained their presence in the hospital ... they probably just accidentally open up in places, play some bits of "metal" and cause people a bit dead. There are some good special effects and action that is not terribly terrible because there is no proper writing in writing is nothing here. It's just a background noise movie.
