Question: How does a civic leader communicate with a director like immigration? Answer: Changing the parable of this existential alienation. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are already in the early 90s, just after the break-up of the Eastern Bloc and the subsequent floods of immigrants in the European Union, and what better way to deal with this issue than making a film about an existentially-middle-class middle-class journalist, existentially alienated politician, his existentially alienated rich woman and so on. <br /> <br /> In the background, immigrants require political refuge near an unspecified village in Greece. I think Angelopoulos can show some social awareness by dealing with existential upper classes. I honestly mean that the scene where some of the top military army wrestles the cause of their destiny sent enough of their daughter to study in London to dress you up. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it can't be so bad Angelopoulos is a master of film art, right? Wrong. It is now when his manners are becoming too artificial, like a photo filtered in Photoshop. His usual tricks are shown: blurry windows, blurred lights, weird weddings, a walk along the river and yellow water-covered people. Mastroian also breaks a new foundation for most dreams. Avoid really. Go to your early films.
