This grainy film has a cult and one of the oral features you just saw. Maybe it's hard to believe, but in the southwest of Arkansas, Fouke, there is a rural community who knows the legend. This story is spoken in the documentary style told by Vern Stierman and filmed in real places where real people are talked about. Legend changes tell, but in the late 1960s and most of the 70s, the area around Fouke visited a Bigfoot-like creature who drove along Boggy Creek. Long legs with three toes and 7 feet in length caused periodic damage and frightened the "beebebers" in most communities. I personally passed the small bridge of Boggy Creek in 1974 and yes, the hair on the back of my neck rose. Of course it was about 1 hour rain. By the time I reached Shreveport, I smiled.
