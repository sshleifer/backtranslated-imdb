Are you kidding ?! An exhibition that highlights someone who opens the crates and envelopes? How talented do you have to do that? It may be able to eat, but it is not present in the painful production of this half-hour abdominal pain. I know he has the Martha-Stewart empire. So Warren Buffett, but I don't see him with fake knockers that open the crusts and Alpo. <br /> <br /> He has a nephew named ... Brycer. Brycer? Don't tell someone who is a silly name. <br /> <br /> More time is spent on "board games" than real cooking. Who is such a time?! Silicon should be on a spatula, not on my TV. This exhibition should be on the Cartoon Network, not on the Food Network.
