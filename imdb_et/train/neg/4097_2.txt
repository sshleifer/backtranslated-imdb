The bad news is that it is still terrible. I gave it to 2 because sometimes it seems that some of the kitchy parodies are funny. <br /> <br /> It should be better than "Mulva, Zombie Ass Kicker" and success should be rewarded. Or maybe I drunk heavily when I looked at it and generous. No matter, "2" is it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that it's pretty fast. It takes elements from most of Kill Bill I & II's main topics and fights scenes, captures them, slips them down, directs dialogue, and makes all the confusion about an hour in a really horrifying amateur video. <br /> <br /> You want to enjoy this much if you want to enjoy it. And get this DVD back to the video store on time! You really hate yourself if you have to pay a late fee.
