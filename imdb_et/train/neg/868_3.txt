Instead, go to the zoo, grab some peanuts and eat the monkeys. Monkeys are funny. People with Amnesia who don't speak much just sit there with their eyes, not so funny. <br /> <br /> Black Comedy? There's no black person in it and there's no funny thing about it. <br /> <br /> Walmart buys these things somehow and puts them on his dollar shelf. It is unmarked. I think they took the topless scene. Maybe they have taken out other things, who knows? All we know is that whatever they took out, there's nothing more. <br /> <br /> The exhibition was OK for me. There are many pointless things. It should be a city? It should be a great lake? If it's so hot in the church, people are driving, why are they wearing all the coats?
