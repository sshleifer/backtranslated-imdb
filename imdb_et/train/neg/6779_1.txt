There is a high level of expectation when you sit down to watch comedy under Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer. These expectations grow as the film is directed by Stanley Donen, whose comic touch was so obvious, for example, DAMN YANKEES !, BEDAZZLED, and CHARADE. In the first five minutes, these expectations seem to be fulfilled and then? Something. What should be a light comedy, lead to the lead, with a heavy hand melodrama, where it is cumbersome to be. <br /> <br /> Relative newcomer Suzy Parker is often criticized for his actions or lack of it. in this movie, but in a movie where even the big Cary Grant often appears flat and wood, Parker is unfairly attacked. Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day would not even be as bright a light as to have changed the success of this curving, terrible and utterly meaningless script that pulls the gap and pulls the viewer's interest and patience down. <br /> <br The rest, especially Ray Walston, is trying to breathe life for a while, but the terrible script is out of life. Desperate, anxious attempt to drag a semi-ridiculous smile from the last moments of the film, adds harm to the insult. <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing more than a great disappointment at all levels.
