I have read some comments about this movie and I can only assume that some people are easily entertained. This movie is nothing. It is so badly written, directed and behaved that it hardly gives the impression. The characters speak in the dialogue with the clich√©s and the situation is absolutely unbelievable. While this can make it fun and fun, it is not that everything is so inanimate that the film becomes boring. It's like Lee Rose decided to write about a drama woman fighting for her sexuality, but then she didn't allow the studio department to tell a real life. This film can go to the encyclopedia as a standard live-life TV movie.
