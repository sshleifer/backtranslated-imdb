I just can't believe the number of people who compared it to the first film. This made me leave a comment! It's just an obvious attempt to make the first movie a success. Dialogue is terrible and something like authentic or persuasive than the original film. <br /> <br /> The story is ridiculous, the ridiculous depiction of the French police and the Doyle characterization at the first movie. br /> <br /> How many drug superiors do you think personally go to the docks to see the shipment? The ease with which Doyle finds his dude is simply pathetic. Like all the French police just drinking coffee until Doyle rises from America and does some REAL police work. What a joke. Try to go abroad and discover the biggest cuts in your place with a travel map and some tourist pages. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Truly terrible sequel, anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy.
