Elizabeth Rohm was the weakest actor in all laws and procedures. ADA and its actions are even worse here. His attempts at Texas accent are amateur and unreal. Nor can he call out the intense emotions needed to play the kidnapped mother's mother; from time to time, when her daughter is lost, she can only sound vaguely annoyed as if she doesn't remember where she left her keys. <br /> <br /> This is an important real story, so it's too bad that the terrible act of a leading actress disturbs the message so much. The rest of the majority is talented enough, but they simply cannot overcome the Rohm's tendency to simply place it on a particularly thick southern run, when actual action is needed.
