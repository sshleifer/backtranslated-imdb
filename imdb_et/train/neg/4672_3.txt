There are some beautiful sets on this film and Albert Finney does a good job like a ruthless father. The movie failed because Jennifer Jason Leigh is too nervous for her daughter and is not suitable for any Olivia De Havilland who is much more nuanced and mature. The feminist inclined conclusion of the film also contradicts the conclusion of a novel by the novel of the Washington Square, author Henry James, in some of his other novels fabulously feminism. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this movie very disappointing.
