The premise of the film has been explained, and if you are so far off, I'm not pretending to be a filmmaker. That said, my own opinion of the film is quite small. I am a fan of Takashi Miike, but it goes to his non-major work with DOA 2 and 3 and some other (many) work. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be free to move because it is Takash's movie and nothing Takash can be wrong. This is the approach of universities to cinema. The rest of us find and the hour and a half the boy screams without a real reason to be completely annoying (and yes, it takes away from the movie), the pace of the film almost reaches the level of rigomortis and acts ... well ... hmmm. <br /> <br /> If one is a Takashi fan, you can see it regardless of your interests. It lacks any originality (see endless story), or any character formation from the leader figure in the form of a conflict, except for the rather superficial. <br /> <br /> As noted, this is the first movie Miike has written together, but that does not mean that what we expect is Miike's personality. on the screen. All we get is some symbols of Miike's pictures of the photographer's director. <br /> <br /> The film had the potential to be great. It is not difficult to ride a ferret. But it seemed to have come to the ground. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is if you just get to Miike to go with some standards like Gozu, Ichi and Audition. Then film your works like Blue's Harp, Fudoh, rainy dog, Chinese birds.
