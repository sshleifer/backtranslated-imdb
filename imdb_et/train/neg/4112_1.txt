I think if they did some money, make that perfect bomb. I have to go to the film industry. I wiped my ass on toilet paper and made one better script. See if the boy runs through the tunnel, they used the same 30-foot tunnel OVER and OVER and OVER again and never changed the stupid location of HANGING lighting. <br /> <br /> I think when I get to THRILL meeting with the director of this GEM movie, I think I'll pick him up and start off with his LOAFERS. <br /> <br /> I think I have to fuck now
