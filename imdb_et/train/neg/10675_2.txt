You must show that if the letters are incorrectly listed in the opening letters, you are not on time (the credit is read by "Cuba Gooding, J.R."). Some nice car chasing, shooting, beating, if everything you want is an action, because the relationship that exists is at best weak and incredible. The motivations of the characters, especially at the end of Gooding, are worse than incredible, they are irrational if they are not hopelessly confused. All I think is that Andy Cheng must be a really nice guy to get a lot of good players in this unpleasant project (he doesn't get anything from them all, is he?).
