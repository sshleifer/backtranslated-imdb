You saw this movie recently and hoped for more hope. Not so much did he build up a director who hadn't made cinematic release before, but rather cast it. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (Brian De Palma's masterpiece, Body double, lead role) have played great films. But not together, and that fact hasn't changed exactly because of this. <br /> <br /> The film is incredible, very predictable and cliche. The only thing that can make it easy to attract is the choice of places where it is made. In my humble opinion: don't waste your time on it.
