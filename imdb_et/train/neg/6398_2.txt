The beginning of the 80s of Richard Pryor, which ran on the street in the event of a fire, must somehow influence him. He jokes when he laughs. He seems to have done something about his chosen projects. The toy is about the sheep she ever chose, and I think you're the other one. <br /> <br /> A movie where a white man buys his son's black man? Nice little political injustice before you had such a thing. That's how Richard gets all sentimental, which made me finally end. I wanted to see Pryor get along with this brat, instead it becomes a misunderstood child. At least Gleason had his moments. Ignore it and see Pryor Gene Wilder or some of his 70's. It's a waste of any movie watcher's time!
