Think of the "stage game". It's worth seeing at Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye. Make Melvyn DOuglas "Ghost Story" with this movie Melvyn DOuglas. Are there vampires open in this "Bavarian" village or is there a more natural, albeit equally sinful explanation? Dwight Frye is a red herring Herman, considered to be particularly moral. It's fun to look at your various facial expressions in what is really the nature of the stock. Much does not happen for a long time, but then we find that Atwill's smoking doctor is a real murderer. There is too much comic relief, but it is the same for the course of this era. Fay Wray looks really good.
