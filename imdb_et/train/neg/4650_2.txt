I had hoped and hoped that this film would be entertained by British creative British characters from the 1950s and pleasant photography. Unfortunately, I found myself glued for the wrong reasons - I couldn't believe how terrible it was. I have to watch thousands of old movies and I am always ready to support them because they are products of their time, but it was really hard. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, the big problem is that he doesn't seem to know what he wants to be: gentle romantic comedy, sloppy comedy or musical. I was a little gobsmacked when Jeannie Carson suddenly broke the song for about 15 minutes! It is not plausible at all, neither does it tell itself or the fact that Daisy never has any threat. Other aspects that did not give credibility included singer Donald Sinden as a singer (a singer on behalf of God!), The fact that he has Diana Dors for a fianc√©e and does not seem to be the least interesting (I mean, Diana) Dors! Come on!) And the ridiculous scene of the song publisher's office. The whole thing is stupid in a stupid way. <br /> <br /> If I had to choose a favorite scene, it would start with this wonderful actor Wilfred Lawson - after that all went down the big road.
