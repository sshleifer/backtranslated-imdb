I'm short and point. This film was offensive to any room temperature IQ. Excuse Liberals, Feminists, etc. No woman is ever a seal. They may forget about the draft or the fight. It won't happen. You see how hard it is to understand or accept it, men and women are physically different. Regardless of whether it is 2007, reality cannot change things so that people cannot hurt their feelings. Men can't give birth or breastfeed their children (Oh-Ma forgot about San Francisco). <br /> <br /> Woman has no physical strength to be equal to men in combat or other physically challenging situations. How many women play in the NFL or NHL? Finally, I couldn't bleed hell if what I was just writing would bother you. Come to think - if it bothers you, it just warms my heart. I didn't write one thing that wasn't the truth. This silly film is nothing but comedy and what it is.
