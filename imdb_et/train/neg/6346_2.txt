This movie smells! You want to get back two extra hours to complete it. Turnstiles, w / Gwyenth Paltrow and director Peter How did what Melinda & Melinda was trying to do much better. This film was smart, witty and well-functioning. I took care of what happened to both Gwyence - or rather to the characters he played - as well as the productions to support the production were fantastic. <br /> <br /> If Melinda and Melinda are tiring, then dialogue will take place and I can care less about any of these people - least Melinda. One Melinda is so dysfunctional - her first glass of wine is at 10:00 - and so melodramatic she's ridiculous, not comic. 2. Melinda is good but forgotten. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's earlier ensemble films worked because I think he spent time on the scenario and the actors were talented. One part of this movie is that he wrote this scenario within two months. And while Chloe Sevigny is talented - they are not around him, not enough to have a healthy presence. The film ends with Chloe Sevigny and a number of other people you know you've seen in other movies, but you can't quite remember what.
