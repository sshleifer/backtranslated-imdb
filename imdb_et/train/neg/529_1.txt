This is undoubtedly the most offensive "chick flick" I've seen in years, if ever. Writing and characterizing are both stereotypes that film is a parody. Before we went to the theater for five minutes and went into this disaster for five minutes, the following topics were subjected to: solving the baby solves all your problems, "the types of performers" are miserable confusion and musicians can't be good mothers when they throw their dreams for a more traditional lifestyle. What is the waste of talented and some beautiful sets and costumes. When Natasha Richardson told Toni Collette that if she lived more in life, she would - quake - "alone!" I can't believe that this movie made a theater release. This is a kind of fare that awaits them from "female" cable TVs, which I always go in the direction of surfing the channels. I'm a woman and over 35 years old, so I should be in the target audience of this movie, but the boy, "evening" is unable to reach his target.
