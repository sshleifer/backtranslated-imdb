It sets Hollyoaks' actors as a royal company of Shakespeare. This movie is a jaw if it's terrible. Turning the DVD player was not an adequate course of action. I want to find the people responsible for this disaster and defeat them around the face. I'll never get that back in time. Never. How can you create such a banal, boring and breathless film? I couldn't think of an activity that would alleviate tedium. It is extremely difficult to write the necessary ten lines for such a shameful cinema. The more you can say than to repeat when the really terrible act. Please avoid.
