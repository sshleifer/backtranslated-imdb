It's quite simple. Friends are a very basic comedy of humor, aimed at teenagers and young adults with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> It is also painfully obvious that they are finally desperately trying to do the last 10 seasons, most likely they could say they beat Seinfeld in 9 seasons. The problem is that Seinfeld had 9 great seasons of great seasons, Friends were (and I am very generous here) at most 5 or 6 OK seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons. <br /> <br /> It became a soap opera with recycled humor and recycled character traits that weren't so good to get started, then worsened 100 times when you saw them. I find it so hard to understand why people appreciate it. It's really terrible.
