I'm a fan of Matthew Modine, but the film I got on the cable is completely harmless. I see that the scriptwriter and the director were the same, so there was no one to control their worst instincts. No surprise, no original line and no original character. Goldfish was basically the most sensible character. That's all a waste of this talent. Given how expensive it is to film in New York these days, I have to think about how it got first. And if you wonder why I looked at it at all, it came after the movie I like on the cable and I left it when I was working on the computer. This is not a very demanding picture!
