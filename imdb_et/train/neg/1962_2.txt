The only frightening thing about this film is the idea that one who did it can follow. <br /> <br /> The Tooth Fairy was just awful from start to finish. It seems to have been a badly-acting children's film that got confused: "Wzzi Oz" witch melting and happy children end up with some bad gore effect and sweating. except to be murdered in some ways. The sister of two brothers, the reader of Cherry aura and Mrs McDonald, doesn't make any sense in the film - they could have included them in the main stories of interest, but apparently they couldn't be disturbed. People who watch the movie know that characters are there for some bloody death scene, but they are at least TRY and have a small plot for them. Generally speaking, the story is weak, insecure behavior resulting from the desire that they all eat witches. <br /> <br /> Add a weak plot and weak action (kids are especially wooden) and the movie ends completely. If only MST3K could have gone ...
