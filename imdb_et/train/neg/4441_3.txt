"The triumph of love" shows that all Comédie-Français authors who use Shakespeare's hidden dress are worth it. Or maybe something like Marivaux, a playwright inspired by Commedia Dell Arte, which Brittannica says, has been lost when she translated: "Her sensuous feel and smart word game became known as marivaudage." <br /> <br /> Although Mira Sorvin has three threefold romance fun, his trouser "Figaro married" was not even for Cherubino. <br /> <br /> Herky-jerking is annoying and it just seems to show you a lot of time for every long call. <br /> <br /> The best was Fiona Shaw as a silly spinster, as well as costumes. <br /> <br /> Visions of the audience and closing the curtain speech that all artifacts are really not helpful. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 29.02.2002)
