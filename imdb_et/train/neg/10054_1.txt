I'm not the only one who admires the first Superman movie, a movie that Richard Donner died masterfully. I am not alone in Richard Lester's Superman 2 ... which brings us to the same movie by Richard Donner, but unfortunately it is an absolute abomination. <br /> <br /> The Superman World is one where disbelief is needed at high doses, but Superman 2 goes too far from things. It doesn't matter who led Superman 2 because the script offends the intelligence of the first grader. In a sense, there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act as they are, unlike the original superman. With or without his authority, Superman's strength (or lack thereof) is the least plausible. There is too much to criticize, so I'm not worried. I condemn this movie ... maybe the version of Lester's impact image is more suitable for the moronic script that this movie is based on. Super-Duper bad.
