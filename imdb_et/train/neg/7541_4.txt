a big secret, but the movie goes down the hill. The beginning is a promising car wreck and the woman and her daughter are burned alive in front of Edward's police officer. He is traumatized and seen as popping pills. The mysterious letter turns to an old girlfriend, asking for help in finding her missing daughter. So Ed travels mainly to a female island. They don't like outsiders. A lot of filler is when Ed showed the girl looking around. It made the movie too long. Eventually, he gets a little better when we learn about the crazy rituals a woman performs, and finally the plan to despise Edward. <br /> <br /> Generally not a well written story and too long. <br /> <br /> DAY: I'll miss it.
