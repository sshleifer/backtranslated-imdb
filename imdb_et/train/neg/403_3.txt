Another violent, angry fantasy from Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a puzzle: it is hard to say whether he takes the impulses of his variety seriously, with sardonic intent, or is completely oblivious. It also seems completely unaware that all the glorious visual images of the world (and some of its outstanding ones) cannot hide the story, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to manage moral bankruptcy. Bacon is usually a pleasant actor who occasionally shows his "Wild Wild", trying to compensate for his boy's appearance; however, given the material, Bacon is not nearly hate enough to force. Other leaders are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, neither of whom are talented enough to create a solid impression, and who is forced to engage in dialogue, tortures themselves. The climax is the study of overweight and disbelief must be truly stopped.
