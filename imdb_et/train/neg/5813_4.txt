Tierney is an authentic harsh man, but a film error from a conventionally competent RKO damages his influence at every turn. The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson's ten stones dinner. Just read the times when Tierney's incredible car companions absorb each other's excuse for their evasive and violent acts. The old clich√© of this "only happens in the movies" applies here to the shovel. Then there is a boy who plays a guard who seems to have been mistaken for cozy toilet comedy, destroying the threatening mood of the process. Static one-room kits do not help, nor does Feist's obvious sense of material. Then add the final car search, both in imagination and profitability, and the results are pretty flat. In fact, the film only rises in station-house scenes, where hard-held police officers discover the hidden power of gas station attendants with innocent views. Too bad that Tieney's career has never really gelled. I gather that it was largely due to the fact that it was both a tough guy who was off the screen and a sleazy scratching after another. His ice-cold way and the clarity of emotions remind me of Lee Marvin's harsh guy. Anyway, this project would have been a radio show, but as a promising noir-headed movie, it's a disappointment.
