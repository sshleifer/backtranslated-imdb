This movie was a mess. It was absolutely the worst editing I've ever seen. It was almost at the end of the scene when the writer wanted to go commercial and the filmmaker added another black screen to fulfill the writer's dream. <br /> <br /> Under dirty directions and editing, there was something good. A good idea, a weighty spark. But somewhere it went wrong. <br /> <br /> The story is about a quasi-psychic priest who tries to solve some murders. The first thing that is hard to bite is Richard Grieco as a priest. Well, this part does not require him to be a good priest and he succeeds quite well. Another problem is Dennis Hopper as a crazy bad guy. She always plays a mad bad guy. Very ho hum. <br /> <br /> Oh, I got the idea that maybe all the funny, terrible editing and disconnected plot tried to add a sense of confusion experienced by character (Grieco). And just to prove that it was alive, they rolled credit cards. Not a good sign for every movie. <br /> <br />
