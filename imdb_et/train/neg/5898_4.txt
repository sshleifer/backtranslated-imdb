Basically take the concept of every Asian horror ghost and blast it into one and get that movie. The story goes like this: A number of college children receive voicemails from their phones that predict their death. Some of the s *** are in the spirits, which, if you have seen some Asian ghost film, is not scary right now. This movie was quite disturbing because it is a very cliché. This is the same horse, a different film. <br /> <br /> The show was pretty good. Unfortunately, the actors are put in a very good position so we haven't seen anything in the past. The two leading actions did a definite job. <br /> <br /> As far as it is, there is not much. We get a cool sequence that includes a head twisting (I don't know how else to explain it), but it was cut off so you don't see anything but the final result. Sometimes you see some blood, including covered weapons and a zombie (which really looked cool, but I can add), but this movie is not too bloody. <br /> <br /> The movie's fears are small and widespread, and it's not really scary. Sometimes you get some horrible pictures, but for me it is not enough. It's nothing but Ring, Ju-On or Dark Water, and none of them was afraid of me. It's really a fall (and most Asian horror movies) that if it doesn't offer fears, it's not that good. <br /> <br /> As for leadership, Takashi Miike still did a good job. He seemed a little tame in this movie compared to his earlier films, but he still portrays a lot of his confusion he has become famous for. Many pictures were much like Miike (including a scene with a bunch of dead fetuses) and the last 15-20 minutes seemed much more Miike than the rest of the movie. Still the exclusive unoriginality of the film. <br /> <br /> I recommend it only to people who are big in Asian horror movies (even if you are, I recommend much better) or big Miike fans. The warning to those who want to get into Miiko is not his best job. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 4 because it's just mediocre. Perhaps, if it appeared 4 or 5 years ago, it may be worth a higher rating. <br /> <br /> I would also like to really b **** on the Asian fiction movies. How is it when it's an Asian horror film that automatically assumes it's good here (USA)? Many of these films are equivalent in Japan to what Scream, Urban Legends, and I know what you were here in the 90s last summer. Once you've seen them, you've seen them all. And many of these films rely too much on fears and images that if it doesn't give them the fear they foretold, they just aren't so good and nothing would change. More Asian horror movies must be more like Audition and A Tale of Two Sisters, two movies that if they don't intimidate or intimidate you, at least they have great stories, action, direction, cinematography and more. . Two movies that are not just big fears, but great movies in general. More Asian horror films have to be such a cliché, "" The ghost just wanted to find, so it went to kill people through their phone / video tape / house / electrical appliance / water pipes / google search engine / vibrator / groceries. "/ etc."
