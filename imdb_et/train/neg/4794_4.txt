Why watch it? There is only one reason and it is for John Saxon's size. I love his action. My most favorite games are Nightmare On Elm Street 1.3 and 7 as Nancy's father's cop, black Christmas policeman and From Dusk Till Dawn again as a policeman. When I watched the video output from my local mall, I came across the movie Zombie Death House and I threw it back quickly, but before the move I noticed that John Saxon was not only the actor of this movie, but the first time I've ever heard of a director. It was interesting to me (also a cheap $ 9.00 price tag) and I had to do it. When I arrived at home, I realized that this film did not live with other Saxon works, even by its action, which may be confusing due to the extra strain on leadership. But it wasn't just his other mammals. It seemed as if they had all been pulled out of the last porn and said now that you really needed to act. The film even looks at 80s porn. I can't recommend this movie to casual viewers in good faith, but if you're a fan of the 80s who stayed in the culture of that age, being late or being a fan of the film, if it is. Even if you dig John Saxon like me.
