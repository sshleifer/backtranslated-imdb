I have to admit that I'm a big fan of this show, so you need to know how frustrated I was when I watched this movie. First, the plot was terrible, I thought it was more interesting than seeing Arnold's fathers, or something more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, the maniac wants to destroy Arnold's house, between many other places, so many people are trying to stop it. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the plot was not so bad at the end, but what really grew up was the steps Arnold and his friends made to stop this mania, they become friends of spies; they drive by bus (video game, for God's sake) and get worse, they make super-moves on the bus, things that many people had already tried and died, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga, they are video game experts. <br /> <br /> Frankly, my mother, my sister, even I was very disappointed to watch this movie because it was the worst way to end a really good comic. I have to admit that I enjoyed "Hey Arnold!", This was one of my favorite films on Nickelodeon, but after this crap, I'm not sure if I look at "Hey Arnold!" I used it in the past. <br /> <br /> Another thing, Nickelodeon, with the enormous number of dynamites I can assure you that not one simple street would explode, I think the whole city could explode with it, oh, and please if all your future movies are good caricatures would be like this, don't do more movies, give bad criticism to cartoons that were good before. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I think it was the worst way to finish this show, transforming a good show into a movie.
