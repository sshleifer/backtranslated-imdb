OK, me and a friend who rented it a few days ago because we want to watch b-movies because we do it ourselves. Anyway, the coat contained blood and strange naked girls with fangs and stuff ... and Tom Savini! This movie isn't just possible! Is it? wrong! It just seems like such waste! There was no story, the dialogue was terrible (was anyone there? X 1000 !!!), the characters were ... well, they didn't really have any personality ... The effects were terrible .. and they were with them long artistic shots of scary people, who run around without doing anything .. with extreme eyes and things? We sat the whole movie, waiting for something ... something to happen ... but no ... "oh, here's the nymphs! Big! Oh .. they can ... again ... and now the violence! OK ... nothing really does not happen ... again ... oh, now they run around ... and close-ups of the eyes ... again ... oh, heres Tom Savin! Oh ... he died ... right ... OK, maybe something cool or even interesting .. no .. oh! yes! broken head! end ... oh crap .. "And finally, since i'm so full of myself. I'll tell you that! Give me a parent, six actresses, a weird looking house, Tom Savin, a couple of naked girls with toes and buckets, and I can make the coolest movie you've ever seen ... I made zero-budget films for two days with better results , better functioning and a better script than that ... what does this guy of John do? Making cold movies is easy! It could have been so big ... I'm very upset!
