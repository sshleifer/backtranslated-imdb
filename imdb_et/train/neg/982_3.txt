The real star of this ridiculous story is a brilliant technical color. Visual vision of the eye, the film does not stimulate the mind and heart. First of all, I was interested in Dietrich and Boyer leaving religion to "find" the power of their love. The following is a great disappointment. Boyer is the only real actor of production and one knows his torture. Dietrich's amazing wardrobe expresses his performance - sometimes his face is scary - an unknown mask. As a monster, Boyer kept the monastery's fluid formula (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreus) - when he leaves his "marriage to God", his colleagues' reaction reacts to the persistent shock and fear of organized religion. The viewer feels that Boyer was out of his past. However, the next trip is too predictable.
