I've never seen any of Spike Lee's earlier films because their trailers were not in my interests. I've seen and admired the work of Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster and have multiple DVDs. However, I was completely disappointed with this movie. If this film refers to Spike Lee's leadership ability, my advice would be to "get a job" and stop wasting time and talent for others. I wonder if some other IMDb commentators watched the same movie I saw. I can assume that, on the basis of their wretched beautiful reviews, respect for these Spike Lee has blinded them to the banal nature of this work. I only paid $ 2.50 in the "second run" theater and I still felt I was wasting my money. <br /> <br /> IMDb "Trivia" page says everything ....... <br /> <br /> * "39-day picture" - How can you wait for a big short while you're planning a big Budget "Blockbuster" (as media hype promised)? No wonder there was such a weak force at all. <br /> <br /> * "Ron Howard began to lead the movie for the first time ..." - Maybe he made the project fair, giving more time to do so, of course. Although writing was cruel, the assumption had some advantages. <br /> <br /> OK! maybe not. I'm sorry! This film was so widespread with evil clich√©, unlikely scenes and bad testimonies that maybe he couldn't do much. (Hey Ron! Be sure to thank Russell ... Good speech!) <br /> <br /> * "Jodie Foster filmed her part in three weeks." - And it showed! His portrayal of the "fixer" who made people's problems was as incredible as the script he gave. Did he even want to be there? <br /> <br /> Other Soups: <br /> <br /> * How many bank robbers were going to the door and informed the policeman of the uniform that they are inside the bank and would be better off ... or else? <br /> <br /> * When "Detective Frazier" (Denzel Washington) reaches the bank to check for dead bodies, how many bank robbers without a gun would have been "policeman" (much less "let" policeman) back to the door, allowing the policeman to walk behind him? <br /> <br /> * Det. Frazier later claimed that he had given the robber "all the reasons to shoot me." Why didn't he even try his face in a short struggle It could have got the answer he was looking for ... a robber would have shot him to avoid later identification, and why did he take "Steve, Stevie, Steve-O" (a robber accomplice) for so long to come and help? <br /> <br /> * I understand that these were not your usual bank robbers, they had a different agenda and they didn't want to hurt anyone, but the police had no reason to think they weren't there. Why when two bad guys step in did you want to "get hold of the pizzas?" (First, how many robbers would have come out without the hostage? Is it Spike Lee's version of NY City or SNL?). Removing them would have reduced the numbers of bad people, rolled their plans, and the rest of the robbers would probably have given up. If not, there would be at least fewer bad guys there. (Give SWAT something to do, or send them home!) <br /> <br /> * Which police department in this country would have allowed Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to just bleed directly to the bank and discuss with robbers that she would not disclose them first? He had no authority, non-governmental powers; and besides, it was already a "hostage" situation ... add another one? <br /> <br /> * Why wouldn't the bank's chief executive (Christopher Plummer) destroy the blame? long time ago? Screw the sentimentality! The diamonds he could have sold. <br /> <br /> * Who was this "schmuck" (character, not actress) with a Jersey accent that comfortably, voluntarily and said she knew the recording was "100% Albanian" but she didn't get it talk ..... SIR! Take your hand! And her ex-wife! What was "schlump", he was !!! Both were absolutely unbelievable. <br /> <br /> * When questioning a suspect why Det. Frazier constantly harasses people who apparently were not part of the thrills? (S.t. - saying to an elderly woman that she could go, and then she couldn't, she couldn't; she couldn't?) Give me a break! <br /> <br /> * Who, after seeing the bank robbers, insisted that the hostages placed on the jumpers could not conclude that their escape plan also included a bank outrage that pretends to be some hostages? <br /> <br /> * At the end of the movie, there was a wrong wall in the delivery chamber behind Clive Owens for a "week" ... where did these materials come from? (Drywall and studs). They also had to assume that they cut the sewer so that he could get rid of it. Did the Bank's employees not complain about the smell throughout the week? Hi! <br /> <br /> * After such a break; since the documents "had" fallen into the hands of a robber, what "references" did Mrs. White expect from the Director General of the Bank, seeing that she was now the target of blackmail due to her failure? <br /> <br /> * And last but not least, what is "Electric Glide", what did Denzel do? HOW TO STUP! Was it supposed to show his "decision" to bring these men to justice? He looked more like a man who jumped while driving a car, trying to avoid bowel movement! "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Other than mediocre line; bad script; bad behavior; and general bad management ... yada, yada, yada. <br /> <br /> Hopefully this will give the movie enough insight to help others decide whether to waste their money or not! <br /> <br />
