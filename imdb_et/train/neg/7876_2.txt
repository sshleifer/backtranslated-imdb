In the panel discussion that I attended after watching the film, the filmmakers noted that it should not be seen as a film but a provocative of thought. Well, the only thoughts made to me were the waste of watching the movie. The tricks of the film (documentary style, futuristic device) were confusing about what was to be a thoughtful study of abortion debate. This film illustrates the problem when people try to use the film as a platform for their political views - usually a very boring film that proclaims to the choir.
