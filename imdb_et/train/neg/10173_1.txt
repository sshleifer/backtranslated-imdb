Not surprisingly, most of them wanted to never make this movie. It's just ridiculous and embarrassing to look. Bad actors reading fun lines, while glossy classic showrooms are constantly running into the canteen, which looks more like Disneyland's attraction. Students talk to a robbed principal about trying to stop them from forming a bronze civil war. Watts riots cast ... ugh ... 10 ?? Dermot Mulroney tries not to hit when he looks out for Mary Hartman with the most annoying smile as "Mr. Sardonicus." Noah Wyle reads Bob Dylan's lyrics to a wicked teacher with a swinging pointer and a very bad face. Drunken virgin Rick Schroder sits dirty, strangling schoolgirl dresses in leopard stretching pants and walks "Shindig", sings terribly away the key and makes it big in music. And who wrote this convincing dialogue: "I'm going to Burkley and wear flowers in my hair "...." I think I found someone who buys a sticky woody! "...." These people are "animals"! "" These people are my "family", as Shirelles sing "Mama Said". Oh brother, that's a mess. It's like "Reefer Madness" in the 60's, except it's funny.
