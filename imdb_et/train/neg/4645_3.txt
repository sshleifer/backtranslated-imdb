Belmondo is a tough cop. He goes to the drug dealer for a long time (Henry Silva, usually a big villain, playing "Sharky machine", but here he is clearly duplicated and therefore lacks ordinary charisma). He goes to exciting places in Paris and Marseille, asks for some names, wins some people, gets names, goes into mysterious places, asks for more names, wins more people, etc. after punch. It seems that the people who did it were no other purpose than to create the French equivalent of "Dirty Harry". 50-year-old Belmondo is beginning to do some good tricks; In addition to these, Le Marginal is a violent, episodic, subtle, low and forgotten cop.
