Actor Patty Duke wrote an insightful, funny, rough fermented book about his career as an actor, his crazy blanket of love-life, and his manic depressive episodes and suicide attempts that almost put him off the good. With this rich material (and Patty playing in the final act), one might think that a cracked TV director, such as Gilbert Cates, could put it all on the film, but "Call Me Anna" is a pale shadow of the Duke's autobiography. For those who haven't read the book, they don't suck out a sketchy narrative (jumping ahead of time), we can never get our camps with what's going on, and the production seems to be a small budget. The actors are uneven and the end result of Duke's take-up does not pay off - the fake reality of the film is so thick at the moment that Patty cannot bring stability to the scenario. Manufacturers seem to be sincere (and conscious) to lead the film with Duke's ultimate diagnosis and spiritual freedom, but they left many dramatic opportunities in the process.
