Okay, I think I'm gonna get the whole shaking, gorilla-style filming method, but unfortunately I think gorilla could have made a better movie ... This thing was just a mess. Bad action, bad leadership, bad story and terrible cinematography. How this garbage was released I never know, but it is and unfortunately I watched it. "The Five Across The Eyes", a team led by Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd) in Tennessee, I assume it should be similar to a "Blair Witch" -type film, but it remains short ... Okay, this nose dives into the rock. I was really embarrassed for the young women I am sure he was allowed to have a Hollywood stardom, but I came across a heap of this manure. Dialogue is ridiculous and deepens you when you listen to it. How it should be frightening, there is another mystery, because nothing is far from scary, except that I looked at it ... Try it in size: 5 and 5 is your way to math and beat her ass ... "End ". Unfortunately, it went on (and on) for a further 95 minutes of meaningless stupidity ... <br /> <br /> I saw it for free and wanted my money back.
