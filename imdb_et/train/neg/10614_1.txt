This is the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies. It is passed on as an art film, but it is really a trash. It is one to redeem the quality of a beautiful tango dance, but it cannot make up for Sally Potter's disgustingly obvious tribute to himself. The plot of this movie is non-existent and I guarantee you will finally laugh. Especially where he starts singing. This is completely unrealistic.
