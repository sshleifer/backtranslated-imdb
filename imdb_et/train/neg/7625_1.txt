This is your only spoiler warning. What is the sad state of our cinema as an unprofessional junk, as it is considered "worthy of the Oscar". <br /> <br /> I divide the material into three levels. The first is a production theater. Here the viewer is standing and power is based on the power of the actor and most important writer. A good playwright is better than a good scriptwriter because he knows the ways of words better. The best actors know how to create the imagination that the barren stage can't show. <br /> <br /> Another level is film. In this environment, a weaker writer can be used, but the viewer does not sit in one place all the time. In the context of the film, in addition to visual poetry, you can take on the characteristics of visual poetry and meaning. In addition, the film can manipulate everyday elements such as sound and color that are almost surreal. <br /> <br /> The final level is literature. In this context, the author depicts everything, translates the paper and reads the reader again. More in detail, you can go to the novel if it is conceivable for a film studio. <br /> <br /> That's why adjustments can be made, but never down. Upgrades are never better than the main movie (see the local bookstore dime-dozen), while the film can't deliver the same power as the original book (Catch-22 and LotR). Movies can rarely be played and you can always play movies. <br /> <br /> As for 'Last Picture View', it fails. This is a movie that should stay on stage because the director is too stupid to shoot everything right. The characters speak the same and act the same way, it is pure void. Add an unpleasant soundtrack to it and you have a completely non-slip film. <br /> <br /> I saw about 20 other wannabe thespians in my high school drama class. The instructor looked at the film from sadness. The sad thing is how such standing work is considered depressing when the material itself is fun. If it had been colored, the scenes of impotence, the pool, and the old whore would be considered great comedy. See what Lucas did with American Graffiti in a few years. <br /> <br /> The American secondary education system must start teaching the film rather than trying to teach the film. Two visually powerful films: Apocalypse and Barry Lyndon. Take them, not that. This is the last thing I want to see. 1/5.
