Considering that this movie was put together in less than a year, it can be explained by its brevity (81 minutes, including the final credit, so about 76 minutes of the actual movie). But what he can't explain is the lack of humor that the previous film had. <br /> <br /> Gags are fast and sometimes even funny. The only real funny parts are Nike basketball spots, James Woods' imagination of Max Van Sydow's exorcist character, and all the scattered pieces and pieces in the film. Very unpleasant was Charlie's start of angels, which, like the first Scary Movie and Matrix spin off scene, basically revived the scene without much humor. <br /> <br /> Today's youngsters may not be able to associate the 70's classic supernatural horror films, such as the exorcist, and perhaps the 80's Poltergeist et. al. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, Scary Movie 3 will take the time to put together spoofers to make them more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> One thing is that the film has more than the last promising young actor Anna Faris (whom I admit it was a sequel). Just for casting and acting, I'll give "3" to this movie "3".
