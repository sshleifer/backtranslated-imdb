The classic digitized film footage for the actor who makes Keanu "I'm so tree that I could be plank me" Reeves looks like an Oscar winner who bites this movie (no red). The best thing about this is that in segment 2, there is an IRAT box (which of the three seemed to be the strongest story and "twist"). I wish I spent Â£ 3.99, which cost me something like erm .... Natural Born Killers: Director Cut. If you buy it, you are really frustrated, do yourself a favor and avoid it like a plague. If you are looking for something amateurish and actors who are more wood than 2x4 then go ahead. But if you want the werewolves to look out of the way, like the canines, Wolfen, Romasanta: werewolf wolf.
