Get your Frankenstein flick, inject some Reanimator (but not good parts) and you have Doctor Hackenstein. Surely this is obviously inspired by the above-mentioned films, but it is never something special. <br /> <br /> The scientist accidentally kills his wife so that the whole movie takes place overnight when he tries to restore his wife. To revive his wife, he decides to organize parts of the body of some women who have become stranded and randomly decide to stay with him. <br /> <br /> I can't really say it's bad or management. Everything here is just too standard. What small experiments are actually working with humor (see the scene when Hackenstein hides his deaf assistant, because he would undoubtedly be very upset if he saw him linking a woman and a needle), but this movie is not desirable enough. The music is decent, the blood is decent and the cast is pretty good. And for half a time, I was even entertaining this movie. But I didn't feel that it was more than a waste of time. Avoid. Try trying Frankenhooker.
