Here is a similar overview for me. This movie sucks from start to finish. I threw the screen on popcorn and used myself for entertainment at la MSF2000. The plot depends on random events and is based on stupidity from people who should be smart. Lead drops for a man and it doesn't happen to him that he can get stuck? And is he rich ?? And he is a famous psychologist ????? Come on, people. He enters the bar at the most comfortable moment when everyone is put together to talk about joining him? It was so staged that it seemed that the face was even a half-minded film viewer. A rainy man would be offended. I also admit that I despise the Mameti dialogue with a passion that some people have for meat-eaters, war-fighters and fur-makers. My hate is so complete that it is against logic. But I'll give it off. The fact that it shouldn't really be heard is good. I don't care. It's all about SAME. Mamet cannot create characters; Everything she can do is desperately out of her voice through different actors. No wonder his actors are so woody. They are confused that everything is the same. (But his later films are getting better.)
