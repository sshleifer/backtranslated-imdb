It is seemingly a film of several grief. As such, it should move viewers and make them emphatic about the situation of the main characters. But its irritating postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible. The camera constantly switches from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to another, creating an unpleasant and inseparable effect. Most of the symbols seem to be a living goalless, unstructured life held together by their professional responsibilities. (Likewise, the credibility that a man who has just given what is likely to be a death penalty will happily rejoice with the sex romp of the woman he just met). The story (if there is a storyline) is hard to follow. Overall, the overall impact is quite disappointing. Despite this, it is generally good and some scenes are quite powerful.
