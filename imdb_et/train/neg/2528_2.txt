Van is a feel for a good movie man who tries to attract girls to his new old to attract them. The only thing this film has failed is just van fadi in the US in the late 1970s. It seems to have been done entirely by the amateurs. It's a trash, but I loved it! I have to admit I'm a fan of the 70s trash! I hope this will make the bottom 100 of IMDB! <br /> <br /> 2
