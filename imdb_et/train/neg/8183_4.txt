It is quite dark, related to code violation, theft, etc. of World War II. The way it works is what I was waiting for from the participants in this MGM "B". <br /> <br /> One great caution. Jean Rogers, who did such an excellent job playing the very sexy Dale Arden in the first two Flash Gordon series, is terrible in this movie. His character is extremely annoying. She will never let her do the extra work. We should believe that, at the height of the World War, which would obviously be the Top Secret code system, it is simply allowed to enter and leave its chosen office, although it has no official function. From this point of view, I am sorry that I have ever watched this movie. It has forever changed my understanding of Mrs Rogers. Talentwise is extremely light. Lee Bowman is his usual, which means he is just enough. <br /> <br />
