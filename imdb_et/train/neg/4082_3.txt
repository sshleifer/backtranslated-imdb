This movie was just a painful look ... not in good dramatic ways that make you feel like a well-developed character in dramatic situations (yes, I did pretty much the last sentence when I passed), but just an absolute boring five over two hours. Now, you all think I'm just one of the unknown reviewers who don't respect Shakespeare or "artistic filmmaking" ... well, you would be wrong in both parts. I love Shakespeare's works, especially the tragedies of Rome and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth and Hamlet, and I've been watching a lot of "arthouse" movies like surreal and well-made Eraserhead and Fellini 8 1/2. .. but it was a little over two hours lost in translating from Shakespeare, WAY too much nudity (I can understand artistic nudity in some scenes ... but not every other movie !!!! NOT to read !!!) and basically just over-teeth filmmaking . I had great expectations for this film, that it was "very artistic" and was the Shakespeare's Tempest customization ... but it was just an extreme fall. I just gave this movie ONLY because Sir John Gielgudi's acting presence (which surpassed all the names of this movie) and the cinematic / set design, because it made many scenes like the look of paintings ... But this movie would be much better when JUST is a painting underneath a roll of text. True disappointment ... maybe if Zeffirell had been headed by a director, it would have been much better. But this is one audience, many others can enjoy it much more than I do. If you can't find it in any nearby video store (this isn't currently on DVD), don't try to go too far to find it ... it's not really worth it.
