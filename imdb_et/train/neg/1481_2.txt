Did they use all their budgets, payments, or what?!? <br /> <br /> Sound effects, background music, and general editing were so bad that you think some 12-year-olds want to do most of the actors were good, given the script ... "innocent virgin" really played their part. <br /> <br /> The mutants seem to really cool down and it really could have been a really cool flick with a better brain behind the wheel ... but unfortunately it is not for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> Turn left better than this movie and these guys didn't. t even money! Good thing I didn't rent a movie myself!
