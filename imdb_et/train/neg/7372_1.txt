I'm so confused. I've been a 25-year-old Seagal fan. I've seen all of his films and many of them dozens of times. I can only describe this movie as "odd". Steven Seagal shares the script's writing and credit, but I really have a hard time believing that she will choose her voice over so many lines, with a thin, tiny glittering voice. What I can't do is if they had to copy SOME from their ranks, why does his own voice appear in the rest? I hope Seagal will age like our rest. But in this movie, Seagal barely bothered with the same trembling, self-confidence, cruelty, magic, and sex appeal she just showed us in all of her previous films. What I found most lacking was his spicy, confident attitude and a bad ass that so easily shifts into this divine smile. Where is your face's attitude and charm, which made it such a huge star? I hope that this film does not refer to what Seagal has to offer us - if so, his lifetime fans have to admit that Seagal, which we all knew and loved, has disappeared.
