This movie was not impressive. It was originally called Sin Eater, and it should have been in this way, given that it was spoken about in the last half of the film. I'm not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the movie had to do for the rest. It was very slow and what was the choice of Robocop (Peter Weller) as one of the main players. It was a sad point. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would say that you would check if you are in things that deal with Catholic religion, but do not expect exorcism or stigmatism from this film. Surely it will flop in a few days and the word will come out.
