Rama Rao made very beautiful films in the 1980s, but he seems to be a filmmaker who cannot mature with changing times, styles and fashion. He's like the same old-fashioned filmmaking style. <br /> <br /> The actors are also not bad, not good. Anil Kapoor usually acts convincingly on two roles of her father and son, but the faulty script often makes her funny and pathetic. Rekha is good, but then - he is always good, and here he is nothing more. He does the best he can, but he always does it. All in all, there's nothing big. Raveena is OK, which means normal, not bad, not good, nothing. <br /> <br /> This movie is melodic, sometimes stupid. Maybe it's a late movie? Well, even then it would still be below the standard. The script is terrible, the movie is superfluous and the story goes somewhere. It seems like a film made in the early 1990s, but the script makes it even older, the style is similar to the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend if you are not a big fan of the main players.
