This is correct. Film written, directed and produced by Fred Tepper and the family. (Fred should have felt better by working with "Titantic" and "Dogma" kits.) <br /> <br /> So, the plot. There are some scientists and some wild rails and a hot chick with big fake breasts. They are all very bad in their workplace, including a hot chick (whom I think it should be a photographer, but who cares because he has bikini). One of the forest registers commented that scientists are "professional people", which is good because it would be terrible if they were professional grills or jellybeans or Ewoks. some strange monkey-like bones, and no one even mentioned that the bones could be the infamous Bigfoot. They just travel around and one of the attackers strikes stubbornly. We all hope that he will die soon (with his sister who was supposed to be cute naive but really really annoying). Then, they * sigh *, find Sasqui ... I mean, Ape-like Animal Burial Ground. Of course, it is not mentioned that it can simply be the bones of the big feet they ... ... I think scientists and forest trails just don't think about things like this. get really angry and kill all the people we don't like, chase other losers and bury their big aunt Muriel and cousin Josh (who died in an unfortunate trout accident) again. <br /> <br /> Insipid, boring dialogue (I repeated several times), inane plot, unlikable characters, bad CGI (man monkey suit would look better) and act that just wasn't very good to all add up to the movie i didn't look again. <br /> <br /> You look at it; it is good for some unintentional laugh.
