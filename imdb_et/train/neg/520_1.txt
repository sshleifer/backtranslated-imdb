After counting the use of f, oh, about 22 times in the first 10 minutes of the movie, we listened to some very bad actors who were on the wife and the horse, and acted pretty much like the 12-year-old boys were naughty together, well, we turned it off. Strong embarrassment and perverse reliance on humor is a sure sign of the loser Hollywood movie, a product of unimaginable and non-talented writers. <br /> <br /> We gave him a second chance, I was sure that it would improve. No dice. Later, my boyfriend missed the rest of the movie when it got better, still dice. <br /> <br /> The main character was a cool bike. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend anyone except maybe immature adolescents, or frat boys.
