The only thing worse than surfers without waves is a movie about surfers without waves. For viewers who love to surf this movie, this is a gigantic disappointment, as the total number of minutes of surfing signs reaches three. <br /> <br /> The story is part of life about beach surfers who do not expect this perfect wave, but any wave at all. J.C. (Sean Pertwee) is an aging super surfer flirting with his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). Just as she finds that the woman she loves has grown up, the three older surfing groups have risen up and convinced her to hit the beach, looking for beasts in Bone Yard. The problem is that there are no waves until the end of the film, so most of the story scatters the order of divergent divergent beach events. <br /> <br /> The actor is mostly mediocre. Sean Pertwee has some comic moments, but most of the time he was acting daily. Ewan McGregor was a man who deals with a natural man who is the most interesting and peculiar character of a bunch. Peter Gunn Terryna probably made a more fun performance, turning his body into a constant sight. Catherine Zeta-Jones was sexy as usual, but her character didn't really have enough meat to show a lot of action. <br /> <br /> There's not really much to comment on here. I appreciated it 3/10. It's a real beach palm.
