Grand National Studios, where James Cagney worked with his brothers Warner during a contractual dispute, produced something to be sung. In B studio he made two films, neither of which was high on Cagney's credit. <br /> <br /> One big cinematic loss is that Jimmy Cagney made so few movies that used his terrific dance skills. The two that come to mind right now are Yankee Doodle Dandy and Footlight Parade. The two smaller movies are The West Point's story and never steal anything small. Cagney himself said he had never watched anything, but his musicals retired. So why did he do so little? Well, that was all wrong. Something on the plot to be singing is a janitor who has performed for a band that has discovered and given a movie contract. Gene Lockhart and William Frawley have played the usual complications of studio head boss and mutual journalists. His contract requires a marriage clause so that Cagney and the band's singer Evelyn Daw will get married. Then we get a complication of advertising-based studio romance with the leading lady Mona Barrie. I think you can understand where it goes. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing thing is something about the dance number for Cagney. She dances briefly at the beginning and end of the movie and nothing in the middle. Evelyn Daw had a nice singing voice and a ham sandwich charisma. He got musical numbers as they were. I am sure that the film-keeping public paid the tickets to see Cagney's dance. <br /> <br /> Besides giving dance numbers, a female dance partner would have been nice. She danced well with Ruby Keeler at Footlight Parade and Virginia Mayo and Doris Day at West Point Story. Wasn't Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell, or Ruby Keeler available? <br /> <br /> There were no memorable songs. And Daw's voice is also waisted. She has the voice of Jeanette MacDonald's soprano, which was so inappropriate with a rocking strap. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder Cagney went back to Warner Brothers. But they should have given him some decent musicals.
