It is incredible that a script as a cliche and completely absurd can make any screen even small. The dialogue in this film makes Catwoman as a classic of high culture. Billy Zane plays a harmonious play of a bad ass, embodying Elvis, gunslinging, a martial arts master who plays the life of a former football player, turning to a gambling addict played by the "Next Action Star" winner of NBC's craptastic show. His performance is as cold as ice and not cool. "The Movie" takes place in Vegan, and as people play poker there, the writers felt that it was the perfect place for a film about a man who is trying to survive for 24 hours, an omnipotent, wealthy gambler who has offered his $ 2.4 million target when he can do it through the day. And so the wolf changes. A wolf with impressive explosions, construction settings, filthy cinematography, and one-liner words that include the word "bet" or "play". The female winner is also mixed, but why don't I know. Oh, but don't worry about the "NAS" fans that losers will also make their memorable lights. The end of surprise ends when you love predictability or plagiarism. Joel Silver should evaluate his decision to sell even more. I wish he could give me these two hours back.
