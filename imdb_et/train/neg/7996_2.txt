Is there a book entitled "How to make a movie between every person and nature"? If not, Ants would provide excellent source material for the killer's insect chapter. Ants does not have any originality that can be found within a 100-minute running time. I think Ants is the most surprising thing that they really stretched the film for 100 minutes. Setting up, characters, different sub-lines, death scenes, and the way ants are presented have been done many times before? and in most cases much better. It is amazing that so many of these Rampage films were made in the 1970s because they are all basically the same film. <br /> <br /> And can anyone please tell me what Myrna Loy does in the name of God for this movie monkey? A woman who is talented and stylish when Loy had served better than Ants as one of her latest films.
