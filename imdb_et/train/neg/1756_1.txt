Back in the years (so it was reported), the two most loved characters in the sitcom history began to get together in television - and went straight down there. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) meet in New York after a long alienation and the lives of each other. What a new concept! But sad to associate, there is nothing to talk about (not to mention making a movie) in the intervening years of any of them. So, the contents of the script itself throws out one of the old plots of equipment after the other (usually it has to be related to older women in the workplace), but there is no full peculiar charm and complexity that made the original winner. Supporting cast is instantly forgotten, humor is non-existent, and the chemistry Moore and Harper once had together is gone. Moore allegedly stopped this project for years, waiting for the right script before. If it was what he considered "right", what on earth was he down? It is not the age of the characters who do it (time inevitably passes on), but the almost complete absence of imagination, which is brutally disregarded by the elements that made the series work. At one time, it was meant to be a pilot, but obviously it was not able to create the interests of potential sponsors. Or among potential target groups on this issue. Quickly and graciously forgotten, the film is travesty and offensive to the classic.
