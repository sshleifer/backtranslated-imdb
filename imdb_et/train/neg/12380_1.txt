The creativity of this film has disappeared from the beginning, when writers and directors left a good story to replace only the terrible special effects. This film seemed to be focused on amusing children, but could not even achieve it. Many small, low-budget films have the potential to become a big movie, but this movie is not near it. Fortunately, this is another film that is easy to make and easy to forget. This movie was probably an opportunity for the participants to make a little money on the side until their real chance came to a real film. Anyone with respect for movies should avoid this movie at all costs.
