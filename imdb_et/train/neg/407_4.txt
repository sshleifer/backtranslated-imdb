I love special effects and recognize new technologies that make science literature real. The special effects of this movie are very good. I've seen most of this movie because it has been inciting the HBO in the last few months. I have to admit that I can skip a couple of scenes, but I've usually entered movies and have seen some scenes more than once. But every time I see a "Hollow Man", I feel depressed, almost like a "movie noir". I'm not sure why; Perhaps it is that I do not want Kevin Bacon to be evil and disappointment in it. But I think it's a witness to how he is ruthlessly evil. Regardless of this, I can recommend this movie to excitement (although some parts are moving slowly), but I do not recommend young people under the age of 14 (maybe 12 if they are mature).
