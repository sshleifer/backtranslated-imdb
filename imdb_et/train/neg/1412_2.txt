When watching this movie, I came up with a movie script called "Making 10 Items or Less": <br /> <br /> Manufacturer: I have good news and bad news. The good news is that we get Morgan Freeman! <br /> <br /> Writer: It's great! But what's the bad news? <br /> <br /> Manufacturer: We can only afford one day. I think we have to get someone else. <br /> <br /> Writer: So we'll hire him for one day. The film is one and a half hours long. The working day is eight hours. I can't see the problem. <br /> <br /> Producer: But ... he has to spend time on character. <br /> <br /> Writer: So we have a player who is essentially himself. <br /> <br /> Producer: But he still has to understand his motivation and all that. You're not saying we have to play with a big-name actor who makes a low-budget movie, are you? <br /> <br /> Writer: Why Not? <br /> <br /> Manufacturer: It's ridiculous! But good, at least we have Morgan Freeman in our movie. And I think we also have to make a movie in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Writer: Of course. <br /> <br /> Manufacturer: This script is hit. We'd better make money. Just in case Morgan Freeman's character has Wal-Mart or Target or one of those stores, so at least someone wants to sell DVDs. <br /> <br /> Writer: Sure thing! <br /> <br /> Producer: Wait more ... what is this small bod with "ten or less" expression paths? <br /> <br /> Writer: Oh, I think it's pretty weird. But we can't change this title! <br /> <br /> I doubt that my script actually resembles reality, but then didn't do "10 or less". This is a case of good behavior, but bad writing, and I hate to see it. When you watch an independent movie, you expect it to try to convey a certain message. I think they'd be tired of the old tired "don't let anything back down" that has been done in much better movies with death. In any case, "10 records or less" was the only message "Look! Look at Morgan Freeman!"
