Watching this movie made me constantly thinking; Why are they breaking this problem? Slowly slow the car slowly! In "Speed", writers thought at least why the car could not stop ... <br /> <br /> There is not much good to say about this movie; all the usual narrative clich√©s make their appearance, the actors are very bad, the story is a leak as a sieve, and so on. This makes it a waste of time and money. <br /> <br />
