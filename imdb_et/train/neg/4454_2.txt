First, some backgrounds; I am English and have lived in London all my life. I've been to many games in The Den and most other London club locations. I am familiar with the type of person involved in hooliganism and I know how they work and how they speak. It must be said that this is a bad and bad film. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unreal movies I've ever seen. I spent most of the movie embarrassing. I felt like I should write a mini-review because I felt I had to bring a couple of things out. the filmmakers took the whole slang thing too far and made it stupid. Unfortunately, there are hooligan types, but the ones you see on Green Street are rather parodies. b) An actor who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam), unfortunately, seemed like "English" or "Cockney" as Osama Bin Laden. He's north of Newcastle and I'm just amazed that no other participant can stand by his face - how we should take him seriously. Why they just didn't get anyone from East London to play this part are over me. I could have made myself "work up", hehe. c) Mr. Frodo. I mean, how can I assume I will take Elijah Wood seriously, who will hit people twice and who are really nasty hooligans. He'd be dead. It's easy. Honestly (British) watching this movie was hard. I'm pretty sure this movie will bombard here in the UK. This can be a little better in the states because the Americans just don't know (or care) how inaccurate they are. <br /> <br /> Please, my American and foreign friends, do not believe this mess word. Yes, these companies exist, but all of this is extremely underground and hush hush and to a lesser extent. The movie is only 2 because they were filming some of London. Usually, they try to do these things in Cardiff (Wales) or do something about it and wait for us not to notice it.
