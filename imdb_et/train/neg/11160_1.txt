Such "inspirational" saccharin is sick enough. He telegraphs his feelings as the greatest semaphore on earth. It removes its interpretation and sense from the audience by making choices. The great finish is in the newest orchestra that should work like a jumper cable on a dead car; I think you need to feel that kind of encouragement if you're stupid enough to watch the movie as easily as cute. Streep glows and you don't know if it really has a sense of depth on the screen or if it's just --- a screen that is turned on and off like light. Because I can't see for my life how he could find such a movie. Even if it is based on a real story and inspirational, I'm sure gaming, exercise, and performance will play like a tertiary television film or a high school high school drama.
