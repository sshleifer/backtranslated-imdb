First, this plot is so bloated - the girl wants to do it, everyone loves her, the girl intervenes, everything seems lost, the girl pulls out, everyone loves her again, and so on. heroine, single parent's worries, and it's so predictable that you can talk to it practically. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I hate how they distribute classical music. They send a message that all the people involved in classical music are dense and nervous and close - in fact, the quote does not remember exactly, but I remember the movie at one point, says Holly: "Why do they have to be so upright ... so classic?" offensive, how to label classic music this way. Thirdly, I've been to it for tens of times, but the only reason I can think about making this movie is advertising Britney Spears. there is no point at all. And yes, while the actor who depicted Holly (I'm not sure if it was really his song or not) was pretty good, it wasn't as amazing as they did - especially when he was a waistband. He was always oversupply. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars.
