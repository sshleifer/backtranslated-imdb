Collected (edited) with dead body parts (deleted scenes) from corpses (Anchorman), Frankenstein Monster (Wake Up, Ron Burgundy) is definitely not eye-eyes (something you'd ever look twice ... maybe even once For this question.) <br /> <br /> More often than a third-party narrator makes the relativeness of WURB scenes relevant. What is even more worrying is that the WURB characters are in contradiction with the versions we had at the end of Anchorman (the opening story tells us that WURB is happening right after the original.) At the end of Anchorman, Burgundy had grown after the movie started and had a hybrid coordinator / lover. In this movie, he is back to his immature ants with Veronica's speech. A constantly evolving story involves a clan of kidnapping a film without a reason called an alarm clock. These scenes are almost painful to sit on. This part was demolished from Anchorman's original scripts. <br /> <br /> Most of the other scenes related to our Channel 4 news team are clearly alternate / deleted by Anchorman scenes. They go to the same party as the original, the same original group that attacks a woman from the team, and the same stage of the game that Veronica was reporting against. <br /> <br /> Burgundy will restart its first date with a driveway overlooking San Diego and dinner at his favorite club in Tinos. Neither character mentions that they have traveled on the spot before, and when Burgundy travels to Tinos with Veronica, he introduces it as they never had before. Oh, and they wear the same clothes as the starting date. <br /> <br /> However, I have to give filmmakers some credit - even if WURB is nothing more than a smart way to play deleted scenes related to narration. It is weaker between the two Ron Burgundy creators. Looking back at it, Anchorman is pretty happy he's got up from WURB. You're stylish, IMDb. Thanks for stopping.
