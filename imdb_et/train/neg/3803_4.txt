The film seems to be scattered and generally poorly written. The scenario moves as if 10 different people wrote and none of them communicate. Obviously they wanted a page from the Miracle of the 34th Street (original) movie, but it is done so poorly that the film breaks down. This film is only for the very young, and even those who write wrote little about the baseball. For example: <br /> <br /> ?? If the angels have died in the last place, the owner does not seem to care, nor has he been disturbed by the fact that his manager just got into the fight with his pitcher? GAME? or that he was trying to play the team's game live with the listener. But if the team is one game that wins the division winning, it gets out of shape (a story of a 6-year-old) that the driver gets help from a child who claims to see a real angel. What looks worse? Eliminating growing violence from a control leader whose team has lost 15 consecutive times? Or a winning coach who works too little in the center and helps raise the children? The owner's reaction doesn't make sense. And she has moved to Maggie and her "out of the clich√©s from the ground" to change the newspaper conference. <br /> <br /> ?? Angels should play against the White Sox at the last weekend of the Division, but at the end of the game, the announcer says the angels "won the pennant". , not the title of the regular season section. <br /> <br />? Whitt Bass, the goofball trophy is the original and wins a game that breaks the streak of angels? Mel Clark (Tony Danza) is told by his ninth brother that he has thrown 156 places in a low-ranking ball game. Typically, in low-end games, the pitch is lower than this, usually around 80-90. <br /> <br /> The "AL" angel finally says "the championship must be won independently," although he and his angels have manipulated and confirmed the whole second half of the season. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, because there are many other examples where the story is poorly written. <br /> <br /> For younger children (under 10 years old) this movie may be fun. Too bad ?? correctly, it could have been classic. This is wrong and it is a forgotten mess that lives forever on UHF / cable Saturday morning.
