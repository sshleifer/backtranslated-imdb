St. Elmo's fire does not affect the life of the university at all (most of us at all). Why did that garbage even happen? Who can actually be involved with it? Who lives like these signs? I really regret that the participants have to deal with such a terrible script. In this movie, there are some talented young actors who have done a good job elsewhere. It had to be a whole joke for them. <br /> <br /> I found this "movie" offensive to my intelligence. The only pleasure I got is to hope that Sir John Hughes had a good smile when he saw the same year's screening where he released his breakfast club in a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Don't do the same thing I did when I looked at it because you enjoy 80's movies. In fact, it is offensive to the genre.
