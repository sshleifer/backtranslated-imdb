the author of the book should not have the same title to use his name for this movie. when you read the book, this film takes the actual events of the book and its spirit so liberally that there seems to be little in common in the film and the book, except for the title and some superficial details. the film adds something in terms of artistic value to the literary achievement of the book itself. <br /> <br /> For those who haven't read the book: You're also disappointed. Not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace, it does nothing more than it slowly moves (for example, the formation of a character). some viewers can later enjoy some of the graphic lesbian love scenes in the movie, but you can also look at an example that is special for those they show in Therese and Isabelle - its quite annoying and not imaginative.
