There is no way of avoiding a comparison between a cat's hat and The Grinch who stole a Christmas so we take that part out of the way. First of all, let me start by saying that I think Grinch was an underrated and invaluable film. The cat was ... well, just terrible. <br /> <br /> Jim Carey was thrown off because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and he is relentlessly devoted to injustice. Mike Myers fell back on his old trick bag. Why, why, why Mike Myers? Children can be less cared for and Austin Powers demographics are not going to spy on this movie. So, what was the thinking of the studio? <br /> <br /> The cat was probably associated with Linda Richmond. Could we talk? Why the New York Accent? Not fully consistent with what dr. Seuss has ever written. Myers was even allowed to go sneak in his Scottish shtick. I don't know how many different voices the director and the studio tried before they just gave up and said, "as long as you don't say the Fahklempt", you can keep the pressure. "Meyers never felt any comfort in costume, make-up, or dialogue. <br /> <br /> The jokes that were few were inappropriate and old. except for a rim shot, and it wouldn't have helped. <br /> <br /> The same people who created "Whoville" "were obviously in the hands of creating a city and" Cat "houses. Sets and props were very tempting, giving the viewer the imminent disturbance of poor writing, direction, and Myers. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston had some fun. Dakota Fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware that she was in a movie based on dr. Seuss classic, and remained true to the genre. <br /> <br /> Call the SPCA. This cat must be castrated and never reproduced again. Please, please, no sequel.
