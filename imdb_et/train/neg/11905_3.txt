Wenders has a tendency to be disappointed repeatedly as he hit it with "Paris Texas". <br /> <br /> Land of runsa is no exception. Taking into account the fact that I expected the average average movie before I went, Wender's ambitions always look better than him. It's taken grated now for her movies to be hard on hand and bombastic. <br /> <br /> I wasn't sure if I watched a comedy that looked at the Middle America or some thriller. The result of Diehl's character is completely predictable. It is also an intense annoyance that Wender has called for many of the scenes to be stratified by rock. She covered her script and directed holes in jazzing scenes. <br /> <br /> I am sure many people find the film's resonance and resonance, but frankly, this cumbersome and didactic effort only tells Wenders that he was Sam in "Paris Texas" Sheppard at his disposal with great help. Yes, it was Wender's best and he should now realize he needs a good scriptwriter. His last 15 years movies + were a complete mess.
