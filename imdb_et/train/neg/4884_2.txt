Criminally Insane 2 has been added to Satan's Black Wedding / Criminally Insane's new DVD, and it's a good thing too, because when I've seen the movie and know there's a sequel (especially something that is as unclear as it is), I'm always curious. I have been curious now and I will never follow it. Most of the CI2 is nothing more than a return to CI and Ethel's sleeping material, remembering pleasant memories. Thanks to Proposition 13, he was released from Napa (do not know if he saw that he was there?) And sent a half-house led by a nice old lady that Ethel immediately took the word "grandmother". It's all filmed with a camcorder so the picture and sound are quite pathetic and even a couple of "rolls". Of course, Ethel does his thing, which is to send any one between him and the food, especially the boy who knows one of his regrets and extends his dessert. You also need to think about the house of any murderer with a large drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and a rat poison under the kitchen sink. Guess this is all misleading "trust". If you liked or disliked the offender, there is no reason to look at it after curiosity. One wonders why its creators even plagued. 2 out of 10.
