Most movies that I can easily sit around, even if I don't like the movie. I am a person who knows great movies, even if I don't like the genre. This is the first movie I couldn't watch. Cat's Hat is the worst film I've ever seen - and I've seen many movies. Acting is OK (Myers are good as a cat, it's just that she's really annoying). The strange songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the audience's children. The plot pulls on and on and viewers have to suffer through poor dialogue. "Witty" parental remarks are disgusting, not funny (I remember some awful comments about the garden hoe that are compared, well, some people call "ho"). Although the film is really short, it seemed forever. Don't waste your time. I know the little children who hated this movie. If children can't do that, I don't know how adults get. I would like to understand more about this movie, but I don't even feel more than writing this time ever since. I hated it! So ultimately don't spend 90 minutes of your life watching it! Watch a good movie! <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars - the lowest overview I've ever given to a movie.
