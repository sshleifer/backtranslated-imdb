Claire Denise's films seem to be divided into two categories: violent and bloody or quiet and intimate. "L'Intrus" definitely belongs to the first category, but it is not as terrible as "Trouble Every Day" or "J'a pas sommeil." <br /> <br /> Now that I saw "Chocolat," I made this point to see every new movie Denis. And I'm always disappointed. "L'Intrus" was no exception. He hasn't made the movie personal yet and moved his first. <br /> <br /> You get a lot of Denis regular: older but still great Béatrice Dalle, who seems to be in the movie just to show her full lips, a gap between teeth, her big crack and a couple of nice coats; black man "Trouble Every Day" and "J'ai pas sommeil", Grégoire Colin and this Lithuanian or Russian girl. The character of Michel Subor was interesting enough, but the camera was so long for him that I got angry with the hair of this furry foreskin, hanging from his forehead and relieved when I think he was finally cut off somewhere in Korea. <br /> <br /> There were certainly some activities - terrible murders, searching for a son - and there might even be a plot, but one view wasn't enough to figure it out, and two views I'm afraid it's a question . On the one hand, the score was tough and confusing (like "Beau Travail"). Secondly, the seasons became too sharp, leaving you even more confused about what is happening. There were a couple of real shots, and if you liked the "Friday night" with pictures of heavy fabrics and beds, you can understand the aesthetics of "L'Intrus". Otherwise, be clear. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in French and it is possible that I missed something important. But Denis's dialogue in the film is rarely more than five pages, double-spaced and full of stock. In "Chocolat" silence is sublime; "L'Intrus," it's just boring.
