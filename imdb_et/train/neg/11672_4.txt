Three writers tried to customize the novel by Jane Stanton's Hitchcock tube, but this television movie has finally injected too much melodrama and just doesn't know when to give up. The struggling artist Meg Tilly finds himself unexpectedly rich with mysterious Ellen Burstyn, who wants to paint a wall painting on his unused ballroom wall. After the last gathering there - the fire of Ellen's daughter - Tilly decides on her artistic theme, never dreams that the daughter died mysteriously before the function even began, nor that she and the deceased wore a striking resemblance! Two great actors offer their services to an incredible yarn that does not carry a careful check that does not fit any lady with emotional intensity. Burstyn's role-players in the camp, while Tilly stays with a dreamy eye routine. Honestly, anger and betrayal have been blamed for only one sequential film (morning after the mural ends). The rest is piffle.
