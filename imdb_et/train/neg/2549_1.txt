my friend bought a movie 5? (it is not even 1 cent worth) because they wrote it was like an American pie. but we must soon find out that the American pie is the way to mess. it is not even a comedy, but rather a really bad documentary. not only the story is bad, the picture and the sound also absorb. they put some alcohol, chicks, dwarfs and drunken teenagers. and the result is a disaster. if you see that this movie is not buying, spend something different and better. if you are torturing yourself, don't call your friend / s if you really hate and want to get rid of them.
