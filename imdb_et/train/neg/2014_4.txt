I remember loving this example when I was a child. I thought the helicopter was the coolest thing I've seen. It was highly advanced for this time. It can displace the enemy fire, make all kinds of acrobatics in the air and take almost everything off. Now I'm going back and looking at it today and I'm amazed at how tough this show really is. Cast members are hardly convincing, there are many cheesy moments and fighting scenes are incredibly fake looking. And almost every end has the same helicopter anti-theft, the obvious recovery of which is of higher quality. Many films seem to come from the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> Airwolf essentially has the same theme as the Knight Rider, except for the choice car is a helicopter instead of a car. After watching a few episodes, I found that I was bored. However, I love theme music.
