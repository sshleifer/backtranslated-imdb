Where to start? This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. Editing is the worst, the sound effects were terrible, and sound editing was loose. Most of the film can be crappy shock effects, where the background is confusing talking. I had to beat my volume completely, just what's going on ... and what did I have to hear? Probably one of the worst scripts. I can't believe people made green for this movie. It makes me think I can box a box, send it to producers and then get me a movie for money. <br /> <br /> Dolph, was the usual, Dolph. There is nothing else to say. The roses were bad, the main characters were bad and the film was smelly. If you really want to know what to do when you are writing, directing or editing a movie, check it out!
