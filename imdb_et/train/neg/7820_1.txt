or: It's a bird? This is a plane? No, look ... It's a disaster! or: There is no need to look for heaven. <br /> <br /> Or: (... OK, that's enough.) If the singer tried to make a romantic titanic movie to break the record, he couldn't. The structure of SR is not able to do this, a dark and limited color scheme (I would call it "wishi-washi"), boring ordinary dialogue, clown with advanced foreign technology, lost fun and magic, and the like. totally disappointing. <br /> <br /> It just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> The main thing, like Superman, is that he is a superhero. It's the core, the most important thing. <br /> <br /> The love and sad depressive Supersoftie lost can only be a maximum of 2:40 behind the Superman movie, not all the time. Because it is no longer a superman or superhero movie. It's like (and in this case a very bad and boring) social study where every 30 minutes a person travels. <br /> <br /> It's a big difference. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke. The holy skywalker, this is Superman, so let us supervillains, superaction and most important thing, Superfun. <br /> <br /> We want entertainment! Singer if you want to do 2:40 long soul love trouble drama lost and unfortunately people? Then take the usual human characters and make a yentl remake. <br /> <br /> They say: Superman returns. And then, the supersadlysoftie stands in the door. <br /> <br /> Maybe the singer has tried to kill the legend without kryptonite, but one bad movie can't do it. Don't give up, they're planning a sequel ... <br /> <br /> The next time the singer (and Warner Brothers) is making a superhero movie, not a depressive super-flat soap, or let him be. Superhero film means colorful fantasy with lots of fun and magic. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover. Yes, technically all kinds, yes, there are many small talks, some jokes, views, scenes, etc., but the only thing all these worst pieces are in common is their poor quality. br /> <br /> It is nothing more than a super boring patchwork and one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> A ridiculous electoral strategy (throw them at the young, so we can continue in the next 25 years) gives the rest. Kate Bosworth plays a 22-year-old adult, he looks like 19. Superman was full of five years, so he slept with him 6 years ago, so he was 16 years old (looking like 13) and a daily planetary reporter, wrote "I spend the night with superman ". Warner Brothers, it's too much. <br /> <br /> Routh is not so bad, he's playing a bit of wood, but the whole movie is wooden, so ...?! Temporary Heads were marched and sometimes posing. For the rest, forget about it. Even cosmic, it's not his landscape. <br /> <br /> Reeve / Hackman / Kidder worked so easy, fun. What is the difference. <br /> <br /> Jesus is finally ridiculous. What the hell should it be? The problem is here, they mean that serious, not a joke. The next time Spiderman or Batman or Ironman falls and rises like Jesus or angels? Or they talk directly to God. Why not ? They are superheroes who save lives every day. So at least one talking to God every week should be possible ... Oh my God. <br /> For Warner's brothers, this highly depressive flick is probably the biggest disaster in history. Not just for money. <br /> <br /> I understand how difficult it was to create and transport some messages or feelings, but single, missing and unfortunately people are not new and thousands of movies or TV shows did it better, in very old or new ones like magnolia . And flying frogs were more impressive than this flying super woman, sorry, superman of course. <br /> <br /> Singer and WB, it's just nothing. In fact, it is even more than nothing, it's like a black hole that destroys the passion (comic / superhero) against movies and steals us for three hours of our lives. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Smilla's little brother. (Very angry and green like a lot)
