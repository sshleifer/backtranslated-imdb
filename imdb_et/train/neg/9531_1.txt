It's a cruel movie. Two demented young women tortured and tortured a middle-aged man. There is not much to give in relation to a plot or spoiler. I only comment that the end is the most unpleasant part of slipping. Much of the film includes Locke and a camp that is maliciously stapling while psychically stacking the camera. Add to it a soundtrack that repeats over and over again, including the voivillian song "Expensive Old Dad", which refers to an inquisitive quality that the viewer never sees. The music is annoying first, then the viewer gets worse than the torture shown on the screen. Here's a topic for young people who are amok that is understandable as a reaction to the 60s, but made a little imagination or style. Avoid it!
