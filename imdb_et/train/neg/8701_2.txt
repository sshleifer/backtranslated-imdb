This is probably one of the worst "want to be a low budget hit" to be credited to a dinosaur expert. The film is so predictable that you could go away, eat yourself for dinner, go to the phone or whatever and when you come back, you know exactly what happened. Special effects are so poor that you would have thought that Lego bricks were used and "super fast" dinosaurs were so disgraceful that it makes pet dogs a super predator. The actor is over cooked. They're trying so hard, but there are not enough characters behind them to get into the characters and the scientist ... Yeah, we know exactly what happens to the blonde chick in glasses. Stereotypical was created for such films. If you want to watch this movie, I suggest that you do not have such a serious mood, as apparently the cast and the team. And if you are really in the dinosaurs and you know everything in the world about them, don't look at it, you can break the screen - the facts are so far away.
