Let me start by saying that I will not try to put too many spoilers. Usually I enjoy Robin Williams movies, but this pearl was not one of them. It was a bill as an arresting thriller. The night listener was nothing but. To be dull, there were 6 people on the opening day of the theater, 2 out of good reasons. In my opinion, the film was poorly written and directed. Action was fine, but there was nothing to do again. The film talks about a storyteller who reads a good book of a dead child. But * enter the spooky here * no one can control the presence of children. So Williams goes to Wisconsin to try and find the author, but all he gets is excuses for headaches and boys. That's all there. You wait about one and a half hours and the movie ends. It had so much excitement and chills as a dental office. The homosexual basis or record did not have a story at all, and the film had little embarrassment, but it seemed that there was some reason and little sense. All in all, I really can't write a proper review of this movie because it was nothing, it was as exciting as drying. I gave it to 2 because what was worth was right and was not led by Uwe Boll.
