Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman this show doesn't show her at all. The character is not even far from pleasant and it is not a situation where you think "oh he's such an ib * tch I love him" just "he's such an ab * tch." This character is just an ordinary old fair, which means that b * tch.Sarah seems to be barely wearing this exhibition because he is the only semi-funny one. The mood, the dialogue is all so damn bored and dry it is like Grandfather's listening continues and the marbles he collects as a child. <br /> <br /> The Sarah Silverman program is so incredibly boring that I was thinking of changing the channel to watch old marriage repetitions with children. it's funny because the characters are both "immoral" and "rude". I'm sorry, but I can't find any anger, bitter, loser anger, bitter life angry with humor and a bright cork display. his annoying as hell sister and gay friends who sound like Keanu Reeves, where there is a cold somewhere near funny.I can't show it, although generally I find that Sarah Silverman is "I love her because she is such ab * tch character "like Rock of Rock and most of her upright. I think this show is boring, characters who think they are average and say and make things a shock, eg. a constant cube, diarrhea and a general smile $. Sarah Silverman's program is trying to be funny and fails if she needs to laugh or better writers. Some have compared it with South Park, but it's not even close. views on Sarah Silverman's program and not become a tedious troll, which means you don't see me ab * tch and constantly posting things like "This show sucks" and "Why hasn't it been canceled yet". like Sarah Silverman's program, if you enjoy it.
