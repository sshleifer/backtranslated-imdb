I'm in the past looking at pretty poor movies, but what the hell did they think about making this movie. If the production team became zombies when they got the idea, because you must be dead in the brain to find a pleasant pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> I am the fan of the most genres and I enjoy "Shoot 'em up games, but connecting game scenes from the game made it ridiculous and unobtrusive. <br /> <br /> As most have already said, there was hardly any script and operation was weak. I don't waste my time describing it. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates this movie over 4 must be part of a production company or Sega, otherwise they will have a very difficult entertainment concept. <Br>> <br /> I have to say that I was more annoyed by the video shop that gave me the thumb that led me to rent it. Thank God I had another movie to restore some of my beliefs to movies. <br /> <br /> The comic guy would be right when he said, "The worst movie ever!"
