I had been waiting for Grendel, a book written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. It was based on Beowul's epic, but was talked about a monster. Whatever you think of Gardner's book, Beowoul's epic film should not be Grendel if he doesn't speak more about a monster than a few pathetic scenes where the CG monster is shown as something other than a modified Predator. <br /> <br /> In addition, writers should punish the original story by turning it so badly and contributing to the ongoing growing ignorance of mass television listeners across the US. <br /> <br /> A typical Hollywood to get this wrong. Very disappointing and a waste of time.
