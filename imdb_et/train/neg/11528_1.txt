Who has written this "nice" post must be a friend of their boys. It's bad even in the home wrestling. In fact, it is not even a wrestling in the backyard, it is a couple of men who trample each other on a trampoline. Every boy is about 45 pounds wet and there is no one ounce of entertainment value. It's just some dull kids who even give the yard a bad name, if it's possible. If you want to see some fun backyard wrestling, then accept Backyard Wrestling A Pleasure for Pain. It stands for the 2 biggest names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh. These guys are good. They have indeed gone to get them, and they have become a professionally trained "real" wrestler. They went right and are better. I recommend checking these 2 men. MDogg is crazy and out of the hook. So don't waste your time or money on this dirty DVD, there are "better" backyard videos.
