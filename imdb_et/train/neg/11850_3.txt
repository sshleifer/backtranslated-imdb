"Rival journalists Pat Morgan (Ginger Rogers) and Ted Rand (Lyle Talbot) always try to shovel each other for stories about the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his deaths after listening to his penthouse with two rival journalists, but joining efforts to resolve the crime and write story of how many apartment dwellers will die, "according to a summary of DVD sleeves. <br /> <br /> The follow-up of the Thirteenth Guest has little to do with the previous film; it is not a sequel, as has been concluded. Mrs Rogers continues to develop her skills. Mr. Talbot adds some humor to his characterization. They are a pleasant team, the plot is interesting and mysterious; but the resulting movie is very boring. Opening and closing is amazing. Long-term rollover of plot development points is at its peak. <br /> <br /> *** Communion at Night (1933) Albert Ray ~ Ginger Rogers, Lyle Talbot, Harvey Clark
