I liked this movie when I looked at the list, but after I looked at it, I have to admit that I felt a little disappointed. The main problem with this movie is that the actors can't keep that movie on their own. Why? Due to bad script. While Dillon, Lane, and Jones are catching this movie on the second level, there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too common. So for the fans of Matt Dillon, it's a traceable film, like the beautiful Diane Lane lovers. Legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great, but it's not a movie for him; below its level. So if you get this big pain, look at it, but don't expect anything big or extraordinary. The only thing you remember about this flick is the scenes of Diane Lane; the rest of it is very forgotten.
