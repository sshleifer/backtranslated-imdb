Sorry about your companion to the neighbors of Nevada City, but that's bad. <br /> <br /> Brian must have too much botox because he had very little facial expression throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Alice looked like she was on the board that was on her back. He was rigid throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I looked at both Alice and Brian, and I was surprised to see a wide range of work. I would have thought they were first year students. <br /> <br /> Ed Asner and Peter Jason carried the film honestly with their torture and simplicity on every line. Ed has certainly not lost charisma. I wish I had time to meet when he was here. <br /> <br /> I love snow scenes and shop and church scenes because I've been there. I'll make Nevada City my home and I was looking forward to the premiere. I was sad disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sorry.
