This TV movie shows that there are bad films. The only reason I saw it was KTMA covered with MST3K. This is the Super Bowl in New Orleans. But football is not played or seen behind the scenes basically nothing. Nothing has changed with this movie's many characters. I really don't know why I watched it.
