The first part of this movie is pure joy. The novel. Funny. Wonderful performances. For the same woman, a close brother and sister living near Manhattan are! Grown up. Bright. Funny. The more you could ask. As a romantic comedy, it will refresh. He leads the unexplored territory. And then it breaks down. <br /> <br /> It goes from universal adult comedy to the upcoming event that has taken place several times in the future. What a disappointment. As a human film, it begins with such a promise. Why a movie such a pedestrian "I am who I am". Heather Graham jumping into the air to celebrate "finding his happiness" confirms the film's last part of banality. <br /> <br /> It might have been different. It could have been magical. It was the same old age.
