I can't believe I was looking forward to it. It starts with OK. This film pushes the boundaries of reality far! At least the first one was somewhat realistic. It lashes off the first film and even mentions the Joshua project. Anyone who knows something about computers hates this movie. However, it has one good message, SEE YOURSELF!

However, some of the actions are very bad. The script was at some point OK and completely confused elsewhere. This movie plays comfortably every five minutes. As I said, I can't believe I looked more. I think I'll come to the original to land ... Q
