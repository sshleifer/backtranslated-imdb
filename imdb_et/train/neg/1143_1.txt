Even 20 years later, Ninja's mission emerges from the worst movie I've ever been able to sit on. The Scandinavian ninjas are quietly entering the scene, reluctantly shooting noisy sub-machine guns from abandonment and then quietly leaving. How do we find these silent invisible assassins? Just watch the crusts and the smoke! A painfully bad dialogue (or was it great and just badly translated?), Not in Asia, which was visible cast, and a total of 3 Asians in the stunt team. The plot is ridiculous, it does pretty much non-existent - then the ninja can't act again! Save yourself - avoid any cost!
