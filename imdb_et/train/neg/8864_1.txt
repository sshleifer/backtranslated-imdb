Having looked at it, I had a little respect for Christopher Lee (it's over time). This movie was the perfect garbage. First, they tried to restore the first end, which was "incredibly" from the start, with an incredibly bad make-up. Then they try to make this fucking excuse the porn movie of werewolves! The plot sucks and the whole movie is just VERY !!!! The wolf victim's brother from the first film (from that point of view, decided to be Dee Wallace Stone) competing with Lee and another woman to destroy a group of human children led by Sybil Danning, who seems to be naked it is not even worth renting (if you don't want to spend on your time and money.). Try to catch it instead of cable. It would be so fragmented that it might actually make sense.
