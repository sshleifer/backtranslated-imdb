I don't know what you're breathing, but please stop. This movie was a complete trash. <br /> <br /> Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister was lovable, cute, cute, loving and very fun to watch. He had this innocence, but at the same time he was strong. <br /> <br /> This new boy, Alex? Like all hell! Just a dirty ripoff is trying to match Culkin's charm and grace, leaving it unhappy. <br /> <br /> villain, complete crap. Harry and Marv were so fun on the screen team. They were comedies, they were humorous and just made Culkin's introduction even more, which is a good villain. These men, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, are absolutely perfect for their roles. On the other hand, there are 4 new idiots in 3 that just crumble and try again to use the charisma and duo-charm of the first villain. Not to say they were terrible, but they were not memorable or even really entertaining. Indeed, more on the cold side. <br /> <br /> Then we got the real movies. Parts 1 and 2, classic. Memorable. Ideal to look around Christmas and bring you a great Christmas feeling and bring out so much emotion. It makes you fall in love with the story and take care of the characters. Just, memorable and close to masterpieces. Part 3? Cattle masterpiece. Helps say. <br /> <br /> All and all, I don't know why people like it. I think people really don't know what a good movie is. In this filthy sequel to rip-off, more unrealistic traps and a stupid new protagonist guy that I wish robbers would at least win the mess out. <br /> <br /> Run, run this garbage. And you can't even start with part 4!
