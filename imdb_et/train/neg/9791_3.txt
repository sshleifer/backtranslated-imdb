In principle, it is a couple who wants to have another child. At the host institution, they meet with the mouse (Stuart) and they decide to accept it. If you think it's stupid, keep it because it gets worse. <br /> <br /> Stuart arrives at his new home, where he is treated as a human child. (Free Me!) The rest is pretty common for cliché, family problems, jealousy of the older "brother", and finally all the issues are solved and they are all "happy family". It is boring and worn because it is also the most blunt and complicated. <br /> <br /> I don't know if the director believed he was creative by clicking on the keyboard. or he just tried to fill the minutes, but he renewed the clichés boredly exhausted. <br /> <br /> Then why did I give 3, not zero? For a family cat who loves Stuart as much as "brother". And because of some funny concerts where Stuart uses his small size well. <br /> <br /> Overall, I believe that film works well when: a. Stuart was a PET and not a "brother". b. It was a funny concert, like Stuart, who tried to get over the cat, and left out boring clichés that were not even suitable for anyone else.
