As far as I can tell you, in spite of the previous comments on other comments, this movie is currently available on DVD. I found it just a few weeks ago. <br /> <br /> It's a Value on a DVD label and I paid a total of 98 cents plus taxes. I found it in a 98 cent shop between plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks. Now, are you not the people who broke the beau's coup to the super-duper Swedish limited edition edition, as if they were? I thought so. <br /> <br /> This movie was really worth 98 cents. 99 cents, I can claim you. But clearly worth 98 cents. And remember that you say what you pay for. For movies only.
