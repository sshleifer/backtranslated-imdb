being one of the "stars" of this movie, I may not have a common understanding, I know quite a bit about what was there for the first time ... and ended up on the screen. I remember seeing the original section of "incoming football" and I was very pleased. it was funny, sexy, filthy, all the main requirements for the car. You must remember that it was fired and shot out before the rest ... Animal House, Porky etc, so this flick was in its own way indeed ahead of its time. for some reason the film was given to major distributors who edited half of the original movie, and then edited (should I say "blended?"). fat guy, goat-headed people ... what the hell was all about ?! I am sure it was still put in R&D, but it was so slow, it caused something that happened before that to crush and hurt. but all this is a pleasant memory for me ... especially that I can say that the worst movie I've ever seen ... I'm!
