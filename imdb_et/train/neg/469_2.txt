Mad Magazine can have a lot of crazy people doing this job ... but obviously there was someone who made sense when editing the power-this-celluloid ... el crapo, the plot is incredibly thin and stupid ... and the only reason he gets ten out of ten is that Stacy Nelkin takes off some of his clothes and we get a nice hillside ... .. and I feel bad for Ron Leibman and Tom Poston, who are talented actors who shouldn't have been in this ... movie ... at least Mr Leibman have cajons refusing to put his name on the movie ... and he comes out. .. copies of this thing are on Mad's starting line ... if you can find it, grab it, because it's probably worth it ... it's the only thing about this movie that's worth something ... and IMDb.com -I Remind People ... It is not possible to spoil this movie someone ... the creators broke it ...
