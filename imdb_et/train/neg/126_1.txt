"I'm curious: yellow" is a striking and pretentious steaming bowl. It does not matter what the political views are, because the film cannot be taken seriously at any level. As for the assertion that front male nudity is an automatic NC-17, this is not true. I've seen R-rated movies with men's nudity. Allow them to offer only a few short views, but where are R-rated movies with vulgar and sliding badges? Somewhere because they don't exist. The same goes for those dirty cables that show: schlongs come up in the wind, but not in sight. And those pretentious indie films like The Brown Bunny, where we treat Vincent Gallo's creeping john, but not the pink mark that is visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying for starvation (the so-called double standard), the mental mind should take into account one inevitably clear anatomical difference between men and women: if the actors are naked, they are not shown to genitals, and the same cannot be said by man. In fact, you don't see ancient genital vision in American film at all in pornography or explicit eroticism. This supposed double standard is a less double standard than the truly frustrating ability to reach the inside of women's bodies in culture.
