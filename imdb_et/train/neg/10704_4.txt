It's Die Hard to meet Cliffhanger when the ski center is restricted by terrorists and it's up to one cop, Jack (Crackerjack), to stop it. <br /> <br /> A B-action movie that borrows from other movies and is pretty good with pretty good action, a ridiculous plot (as always in these films) and three fine stars. Thomas Ian Griffith as a policeman and Nastya Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you don't like stupid B-action movies, it's not for you.
