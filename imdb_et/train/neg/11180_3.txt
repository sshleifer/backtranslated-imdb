The only good thing about "The People I Know" is that it is a great example of the movies that Al Pacino should avoid. When I first turned off, I had the way Pacino tried to portray the Georgian accent; sometimes it was weak and unpleasant, while in other segments it seemed too redundant. The dialogue and the characteristic interaction were terrible with a weak plot. The supportive light made the film an extremely perfect job to keep the movie interesting and I still didn't see any signs of a strong plot within an hour. The general story is a real drill, and I had to hit myself a few times to keep myself awake. <br /> <br /> This movie definitely suffered you ... avoiding at all costs.
