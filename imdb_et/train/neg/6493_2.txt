Oh dear ... as an Englishman and a small part of Wales, Anthony Hopkins industry fan ...... I'm still very disappointed. <br /> <br /> You see that I was someone who hoped for better. So my comments are "straw in the wind". But that's not the thing? - I do not have a tent that grinds the commercial value of the work. I, a full-fledged, full-fledged member, watch a movie that has to be transported to another place. Yes, stop trust for a short time. But not to enter into a complete unbelievable state. <br /> <br /> If it had been unknown by the author and the director, I think this "production" would have been forgotten. Unfortunately, it was not, and I was widespread and confused. Having seen some rave comments in the course of this work, I am weakly concerned .... <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm trying to look at each movie on my own without a pretext. Regardless of the reputation of the author, director, studio or even its content. <br /> <br /> My advice, so much before me: don't write and direct the same production. It's dangerous. Movies must be moderated to maintain a similarity of credibility. <br /> <br /> As they say in school reports, "Could and get better ..."
