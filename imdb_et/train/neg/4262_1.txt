It's just the worst movie I've ever seen. It ranges from 2+ hours and the box art was completely misleading. My friends and I rent it because we thought it was a poor guy 300. You know, laugh and joke. There is nothing like a movie, just pain. Then the film starts and they speak a different language. We think, "Oh, that's just the beginning." But, no, it's filming a movie and getting more like a boring book that you had to read in a classroom where nothing literally happens in hours, and the battle scenes compete against 2 kids fighting on the playground. Omit Cinematography, and this movie belongs to the trash. Such films lead to the world we see in Wall-E, which, by the way, was a good film.
