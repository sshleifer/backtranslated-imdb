I'm really surprised that this movie gets that sort of sequence! I've never seen such a bad movie for years. Omg this was a very bad movie. Splatter, not enough to describe unnecessary (almost funny) blood scenes). If you don't like hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) .. it's still 10 times worse. The story reminds me of RL Stine goosebumps. <br /> <br /> I can't say what works because the script was so terrible. Clich√© all the time. (why do I have to write 10? I've never understood it.) <br /> <br /> == Here are the spoilers == <br /> <br /> The story is about a butcher who kills people all the time in the subway. We are talking about thousands of killings and nobody knows about it. In fact, these people are just lost. And there is a good man who is trying to solve the mystery (we don't have a mystery because we know a bad boy from the beginning) and as usual, no one believes him! what a surprise! Ultimately, he puts the meat industry clothes on the killer butcher and fights death!
