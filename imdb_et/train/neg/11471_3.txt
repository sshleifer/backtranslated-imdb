Is it a coincidence that Orca was made two years after jaws? Orca is not exactly "hanging the jaws" but it is obvious that he tried to make Jaws a success. First of all, in my opinion, Orca was a bad film, not terrible, but definitely not good, average best. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically a male whale (orca) after seeing your companion and the unborn calf looking for a revenge killed by the fisherman. I couldn't watch this movie again. The direction of this film is bad and, compared to jaws, it seems that the director, the producers and the writers were almost talented. <br /> <br /> For the actors, it was very average and plausible, but the real characters are not at least a bit pleasant. The effects were right at the right time and the footage of the killer whale seemed pretty good. <br /> <br /> Violence is confusing, bloody and not recommended for more sensitive people. Music is superfluous and very strong, drowning in sound effects and irritating at times. I hated how they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale (killer whales do not fit with just one family, as depicted in Orcas). <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was, in my opinion, bad / bad because of the reasons listed above. Some people appreciate this movie more in terms of animal and human revenge, so I'm not going to start this movie and I understand why some people like it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 10 (but this term may have 5/10)
