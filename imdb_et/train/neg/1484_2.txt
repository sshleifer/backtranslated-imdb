please don't rent or even think about buying this movie. they don't even have the option to rent a red box that would cost $ 1 and think its value is less than that. it was because Jenna Jameson is in the movie lol between 2-5 min.i give credit that the film had hot chicks and quite a bit of nudity but besides that you can also buy another d horror movie with the same thing someone you Ginger Lynn has more time in this film than Jenna and is not even on the front cover of the film or on her behalf. I suggest people watch zombie removers because you see Jenna almost all the time in the movie and nude mostly this movie is a big disappointment and such a big waste of time.
