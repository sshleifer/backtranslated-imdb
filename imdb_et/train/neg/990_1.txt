Don't waste your time or money on this movie. My roommate rented it because he thought it was another film called Descent (flick for some passengers trapped in the cave). so we decided to look at it to think it wasn't that bad. It was. I can't believe that this movie has actually been produced and released to the public. It was so terrible that it was almost like an accident where you want to look, but you just can't do it. I feel honestly emotionally in love. It was a semi-low budget movie where a college girl gets a boy she gets acquainted with all the extracts. And not really good. I went out of the rape of a woman for rape to feel almost bad. Almost. All in all, there is a terrible film that was definitely caused by NC-17. Don't waste your money. And don't let your kids watch it.
