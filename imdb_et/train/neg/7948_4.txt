The "seventh character" borrows a lot of "Rosemary baby" and "apple" (it actually combines two stories). Even its title resembles Bergman's "seventh seal". <br /> <br /> However, it starts well enough, with all the fears scattered across the earth, and parallel - a somewhat distinctive plot that Moore's husband is trying to save a poor boy (who killed his parents who were brother and sister) death penalty. time, both Christian and Jewish religions are called to salvation (including the migrating Jew), which sometimes makes the lines unintentionally funny (have you ever been in Sunday school? But they taught me that God is love!). IMHO scene, is a short dialogue between priest John Heard, who does not seem to be serious, too bad that he was not given a major part because his retrospective act is invaluable and a young Jew. <br /> <br /> Demi Moore probably registered the same wish as his former husband Bruce Willis: saving the world.
