This movie seemed good - good casting, an evergreen theme and explosive opening. It went downhill from there. Why was it filmed with the camera? It shakes, judges, part captures scenes and just mixes the viewer. Bad choice. If this were not enough, worst memory editing would require a stunned viewer - this is mandatory if you want to enjoy it at all. And then it is the worst sin. After the viewer has exhausted all kinds of unlikely and unlikely scenarios, they roll credit without exposing the gap - to the end - to profitability - as what the hell's motive was? How can you expect to succeed when the thrillers are over? Doh! This film had a great promise, and it ended the mud in the face of the plant. What a waste of effort. The poor efforts of the writer and director.
