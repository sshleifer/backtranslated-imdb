# 1 Vampires vs People <br /> <br /> # 2 Primary respondents to the Military Rebound Attack for dangerous, unknown vampire attacks. <br /> <br /> # 3 Sexy female vampire "good guys". <br /> <br /> # 4 Much gore and action. <br /> <br /> There are four (4) main plot devices that can help you decide if you want to watch this movie. If you want all four, then the next plot device may not stop you ... <br /> <br /> # 5 Outside. <br /> <br /> This last one almost got me too, but I'm glad I was watching. The horrible direct-video horror of the battle is the Sci-Fi channel Halloween marathon ... this movie is the breath of fresh air. It's against other Sci-Fi channels and even another Vampire movie against Natassia (who gives Uwe Boll's money?).
