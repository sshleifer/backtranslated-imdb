Can a fake landscape destroy the image? You don't think so, but that's for me. Listen, I have a lot of movies from the classical era, and I know a lot, except, for example, drivers who steer fixed cars in front of the screen, and so on. After shooting counterfeit landscapes, fake mountains and flowers, as seen in the "brigade", it is offensive for some time. <br /> <br /> As for music entertainment, it is always subjective. What one person likes, the other may not be that it should not be a big part of the film's evaluation (whether someone likes songs). I can break this movie for songs, dances, novels and characters in the 1950s, but it was the 50s and many people liked it. Musicals did very well in the 50s. I liked the 30's and 40's with big taps. It was touched until the end of the 1950s and this new thing - which I can stand - was. Does this make it a tough film? No. That's just one thing I didn't really care about. <br /> <br /> Despite the good performance, good director and high expectation, this movie was bombarded with a box and with me. I would have liked it more, being a dreamer myself and this is a nice part of this story. I'm not a cynical type and a nice city and nice people who make me feel terrible. Why couldn't I contact this movie? Part of it was dancing. I don't care about things that replaced the tap on the dance screen. But - no - the thing brought me out what this production is. There was no Scotland, not a highland, but a hockey background that saw it and it changed me almost from the beginning. Rate one point for today's realism, where they "mostly go".
