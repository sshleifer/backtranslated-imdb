Thank you for killing the franchise with Turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This film sucks as many levels as pathetic. The first VAMPIRES were fun, but this small budget recovery ring makes me awake. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi (poor man Kevin Bacon) rides around Mexico with a surfboard with a hidden section where his vampire kills Antonio Antonio Banderas guitarist in DESPERADO. She climbs the way along some "hunters" (including the annoying feminist infected girl who takes the pills to remain a vampire), and they decided to stop some female captain's vampire, who is not given any background and so we can take care of her efforts (walk in the sunlight, stealing the Black Cross and presenting a ritual to enable it to do so). If you've seen the first VAMPIRES, you've already seen it and done a lot better. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter has recently been responsible for many bad films. Frankly, I think he has passed his main and inability to do another horror. The only decent film he has done is because THE LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. Everything else is complete crap, until up to the incredibly cheap looking and slowed berries of GHOSTE ... and now its cellulose waste. Where are more awards like ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), NEW YORK ESCAPE and THING? <br /> <br /> Carpenter crony Wallace proves that he can't write out a paper bag - a script packed with original lift, harsh and recycled gags. Did I mention that I hated every character in the movie? There was no memorable character in the whole movie. How does this happen? There is nothing to recommend in this movie. Even a DVD presentation is not good; the menu looks awful. <br /> <br /> For comparison, JASON X: "WEDNESDAY IN 13TH" was a masterpiece. Now that you make a sequel and (re) struggle with franchise, ladies and germs, and create an exciting DVD menu.
