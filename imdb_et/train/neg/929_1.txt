My wife and I like to rent really stupid horror / sci-fi movies and laugh with them with my friends. We saw it in fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to your netflix list. Now, when I say this movie is terrible, I mean it well. All of this, the actor, the camera work, the story, the costumes, is just that funny and low budget, but it makes it so good. I think, in one scene, the actors saw that they were actually in place. I really hope that the one who made this movie was not serious when they did, because if they were, it would be sad. If you want to watch really stupid horror movies, just make them fun, then I recommend it.
