Every movie that Brooke Shields goes out of the fund is both anomaly and horror. Shields is actually only bad because he is youthful, inexperienced and obviously well run by his co-founder. Peter Fonda is bad because well because he's bad. I liked it later years in Ulee's gold, but he is terrible to the Lord above. Not someone else would be good. There is no performance (outside the joy of Henry Fonda), which is even satisfactory. I've never seen this movie with many bad performances. With Luke Askew, the main cable, it is clear that this is due to poor dialogue and direction, because he has done a good job in the past. But his partner, played by Ted Markland, is an embarrassing ham. Writing is just bloody terrible and the actors can't be blamed for the terrible things they have to say. But they say so badly! Editing and direction are worse than pedestrians. Scenes are kept for too long without a dramatic reason or cut off before the effect of the scene is realized. This picture was much worse than I thought and would have been completely forgotten (and probably never made) without the participation of a couple of famous names. One bright spot: The Grand Canyon's cinematic art is subtle, capturing the beauty of this area, with even the big screen Imax's productions not quite well done. And finally, is it a bad version of a paper tree with a nice father-daughter couple, or it's a bad version of Pretty Baby with a much more romantic relationship between forty and 13 years old. It refers to most of the latter as the first and is therefore quite disturbing.
