Robert Colomb has two full-time jobs. He is known worldwide as a globetrotting TV reporter. Less well-known, but equally powerful is its use as a full-time filer. <br /> <br /> I saw Vivre pour Vivre in English dubbed "Live for Life". Life! At least three women seem to be in Robert's life: one on the way out, one on his way, and a deceived woman at home. This will help Robert be a liar. Among his most useful lies are "I'll call you tomorrow" and "My job took longer than planned." He spends a lot of time and money on planes, trains and hotel rooms for his connections. You don't know if this guy is banging his pants. Some may find their life exciting, but I thought it was annoying. His associates, including his wife Catherine, are all attractive and recommended women. But his lifestyle is so harsh and he's so deceptive, you don't know if he enjoys it all. <br /> <br /> Adding to Tedium is a significant frame that does not transmit a plot. There are sections with no dialogue or only a French dialog. We see documentaries about wars, torture and training of troops with real-time action. When Robert flies back from Africa, we wait and wait for the plane to land and taxi to the airport terminal. <br /> <br /> Annie Girardot is a performer in this movie. He was the most interesting character and he played it perfectly. It was also nice to see Candice Bergen at the beginning of her career. I can't find a mistake in Yves Montand's action, which was basically an immoral dust. <br /> <br /> I had some new technique from Claude Lelouch. In the hotel room scene, the camera is placed around the room, as Robert and his lover claim. We will look at them briefly while passing through each room. In the second scene of the train sleeping place, Robert is in the upper bunker, while his wife is lower. Robert gives some important but frightening news to his wife, but we hear only those parts because of the train break. I felt that her husband could not accept the word because of the shocking nature of the news. I also enjoyed the exciting safari scenes in Africa. These scenes and Amsterdam's cinematography were excellent. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie as part of the Congress Library Project. I mentioned fifty: 50 significant films that have been forgotten for 50 years. As I can best identify, this movie, like the other 40 I have identified, hasn't been in the video, in television shows, or in the US since its initial release. I think it deserves to be available again. <br /> <br />
