this film is made for the Asian / Chinese market, focusing on fans of Jay Chou, one of Asia's largest music stars. <br /> <br /> Jay Chou is a very talented singer / singer. He is mediocre as an actor, although he appeared in several large budgets ("the original D", "Golden Flower Curse"). Amazingly, he won the "D" gold prize for both the Golden Horse (Taiwan) and Hong Kong for the first time. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast is very well chosen, which basically calls all of China. Cast, including many famous film / TV actors, singers, even sports commentator (Huang Jianxiang from China). But they were not given enough time to show their talents. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake is that Chu took over the position of both director and writer. He is known as the creation of low and brainless movies based on non-binding scripts. Owing to their weak leadership and lay stories, all the talented cast, fancy vision effects and production cash tones were wasted. <br /> <br /> But the terrible movie was successfully over $ 10 million, maybe even more Asia, which made it one of Asia's largest ticket offices. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: You can watch this movie only if you want to see how money and talents are wasted or if you are just accompanied by your kids who are Jay Chou fans.
