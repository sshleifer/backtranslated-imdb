I give credit when the credit is due, and I say Linda Fiorentino gives a good result as a hard drinking actor who does what he wants. She's dirty, sassy, ​​hard-wearing and very sexy; it is much better than this film deserves. <br /> <br /> But that's IT. This troublesome movie is a fragmented mess, trying to be a stalker-thriller, a murder thriller, a story of loyalty and betrayal, and a steamy erotic thriller. The film, my friends, is not the least exciting. <br /> <br /> For example, who thought it was desirable to be a leading man, C. Thomas Howelli? He's not ugly, but to cry out loud, it seems that the goddess of Fiorentino's tough biscuits gets it with a kindergarten teacher. Howell has no authority to act as a leader or a presence on the screen. <br /> <br /> The script is the worst aspect of the movie. There is no tension, because Fiorentino's character gets hesitant phone calls, there is no secret about his guilt in the accusation of being in the movie, no sense of freedom, because Fiorentino wisely gets his obstacles removed from Howell. <br /> <br /> Look at Adam Ant and Issac Hayes' interesting but badly made prayers and one really good sex between Scene Howell and Fiorentino. In addition, my first impulse would be to put this unfortunate trash down and rent something else.
