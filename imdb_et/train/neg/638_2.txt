Good Earth is perhaps the most boring film I've ever seen in my life. The plot is slow and missing. Operation is a bordered comic. Although I love Paul Muni, I can now say that I have seen a movie that doesn't do its true power. The only saving grace I found with this film is the value of its production. The use of hundreds of additions to the entire film creates a very credible and interesting environment. The beautiful effects that were used to create the illusion of millions of wasps are also easily sold and at the same time revolutionary. Other than the production value, I can say a little about what is good or fun about this movie.
