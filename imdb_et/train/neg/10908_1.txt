Nothing in this movie is funny. I thought that the premise that gives man the libido of randy ram was interesting and should make some laugh. ERROR! It's just not funny in the movie. For example, a funny protagonist who carries heat in the middle of a goat peasant is funny. They're the best in a movie with a movie, and it's just funny. <br /> <br /> We all know that dogs eat anything, anywhere, anytime. The main character does it all, everywhere, always, not funny. It becomes a clich√©. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is, in my opinion, acceptable in this role. That's why I mean he's not a bad actor, but with rotten material it's hard to comment on quality. Third Haskell, the other half of HUMAN-romantic leaders (is counting the number of animals that the main character is interested in romantic leaders?), It seems embarrassing for the whole thing, and it should be. He seems to be acting in a vacuum, separated from all other film actors. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if you want a tasty, dull, repetitive material to taste.
