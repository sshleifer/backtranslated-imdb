If you want to watch a good movie about how women can fight against a sexual attack, this is not a movie you want to watch. It was a social comment about the woman who was the victim and fought back. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson turns the tables to the attacker. Instead of a criminal justice system, the victim uses vigilance. It essentially removes the court system. The film "The accused" was a much better film because the victim uses the court system and wins. What does "descent" mean to the victims that they should use violence? Is the victim a better prosecutor? No !!!
