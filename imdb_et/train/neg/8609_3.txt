When you saw Rodney Dangerfield's earlier films and performances, you can recognize the many jokes that have been made in this strange piece. Written as a sitcom, this movie did not hit any pleasant chord throughout, from self-help doctor played aways to sexy-like-chopped liver Molly Shannon to "I fat, and so funny" by John Linette. These five women themselves are pleasant enough, and if it had been an action-adventure series pilot, he could have worked. Instead, it looks like a male fantasy that strives hard not to be politically wrong.
