Vodka Lemon is a charming but extremely uneven Armin film that delights some and wears others. Though the film is fairly well designed, it lacks real "zing" based on the many scenes that seem normal to a smart art house viewer. The film contains a handful of outstanding film shine, but unfortunately they deserve a film worthy of their genius. Too dark to be in the dark comedy and in the light to be a serious drama, Vodka Lemon is uncomfortable for many views and ultimately bad. You can laugh, but these moments are little and far between landscapes washed with snow and seemingly endless bus rides. The great effort that ultimately took place in the absence of narrative cohesion.
