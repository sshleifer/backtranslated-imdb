Don't get the impression from other authors that this film smells if it is ambivalent to the Japanese whaling industry (which is not morally worse than the US meat industry or Scottish haggis), it smells like a pretense, sorting out from its own guffi, which becomes a bad art of contemporary art name. This means that there are some stunning images, but if you use your imagination, the average bus ride is stunning, so it's not worth seeing it. The film happens very slowly and often comes with a soundtrack that sounds like a cat that is gutted, and then when you think it's over, it starts again. I saw it in a Rome porn movie, which was taken at the weekend to show the work of Barney's film, which is an amazing and clever way to get back that was once local flirt. Brigade, but if trendy young things and slightly older bearded Bjork fans were honest, they could all have been more fun if they just showed one porn!
