The film is a bit annoying. This is mostly a silent film, a large part of which is a number of voice transmissions. Making such a silent movie is not such a bad idea, but one of those movies where the lack of dialogue and repetitive early scenes makes it just annoying. You don't understand the reason for Tedi until the picture, and it's too late. For the first 40 minutes of a movie, some Mexican soft porn is a slow piece and unimaginable soft porn in it. Later the first 40-minute style begins in the film, but it's too late because by then the audience will be lost. The Mexican National Autonomous University has a nice location. I've often wondered why there aren't more movies out there. The university town is built on the edge of lava fields, which gives the university town a great resistance. My biggest problem with the film is that the director / writer has made the film the way he wanted to see it, no matter how the viewer who doesn't know the story is watching it. You can't ignore the audience when you talk about the story.
