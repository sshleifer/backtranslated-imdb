However, giving the budget and time constraints of serial production serves BATMAN AND ROBIN close to the bottom of each "clearing" list without the style, imagination and atmosphere of its predecessor, the 1944. BATMAN. <br /> <br /> Producer Sam Katzman was known as "The King of Quickies" and, like his manager Spencer Bennett, it seemed faster and more efficient than excitement. (Unfortunately, this team also produced two series of Superman, starring Kirk Alyn, with sticky flying animation, canned music, and dull supporters.) Opening each chapter offers delicious things: thoroughly nasty headlines ("Robin Saves Batman," Batman vs Wizard " mechanical music that beats, and our two heroes, who stumble toward the camera, confused or have trouble seeing their cheap Halloween masks. Batman's needle, along with his fucking pigs and eagle beak, is so bad that the stuntman needs to adjust this fight during scenes. His "utility strap" is a wrinkled fabric that has no compartment from which he can still pull the blower and the oxygen tube at critical moments. <br /> <br /> In any case, the leading players have failed, Robert Lowery has little charm or individuality elegance like Bruce Wayne and it doesn't cut a particularly dynamic figure like Batman, he gives the impression he's somewhere else! l, like Robin, has considerable difficulties in dealing with his limited dialogue. He's too old for this part, even the older stuntman who fills him. Lowery and Duncan are just as exciting as the tired businessmen who want to drink without the costume, without one ounce of chemistry between Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft in 1943. <br /> <br /> Although the series was not known to develop the character, the earlier BATMAN managed to play a more energetic casting. It offers groups that go through the movements, not that the filmmakers give a lot of support. None of the hoodlums stand out and are driven by one of the most boring crooks ever, The Wizard. (Big name!) In fact, someone who drives a curtain, a towel, and a bag is headed by a double-headed voice that tries desperately to ring. "The main suspects" - the eccentric professor, radio broadcasting - are just annoying. <br /> <br /> Even the comic book "Regular" created is superfluous. It is difficult to distinguish a lot of romance between Vicki Vale and Bruce Wayne. Despite the dangers he faces, Vicki shows practically no emotions. Commissioner Gordon is not too bright. Unlike the previous series, Alfred Butler is simply walking, with the most important line being "Mr Wayne's Residence". These are props for a stretched, tricky, incompatible plot that is even sparser, unique, repetitive for music and amateur product development. The exterior of the Wayne Manor resembles a suburban middle-class home in every sitcom, which is the inexpensive interior of a roadside motel. Batcave is an office that desperately needs renovation. (Costumes are kept in rolls in the closet!) <br /> <br /> It is a shame that the filmmakers couldn't do more to create an exciting adventure. Although the presence of two serials on a DVD is a plus for any serious "Batfan", the box should not be flawed with great illustrations. They collect more of the authentic comic book than all 15 BATMAN and ROBIN chapters. <br /> <br /> It's good news - it's not the 1997 version!
