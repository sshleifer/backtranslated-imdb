I voted for this movie because it looks like all Greenaway outputs. But it was her normal sex "art" sex and pretentious crap. I know a lot of people like this movie but I grew tired of it very soon. It is certainly not for everyone. The widespread McGregor obviously took part in the beliefs of faith, but he should not actually waste his time. I hate someone being sent to a pseudo-corner, but please ..... !!! On the plus side, it is very attractive visually and I enjoyed the music but didn't see it to the end and I can't say it's for many movies. I usually look at the whole thing, but it's unbearable!
