Three Russian-speaking aristocrats are absorbed by the Monte Carlo decadence, despite having reached the last franc. In order to support their rich lifestyle, three counterfeit services are used and the casino uses comments hoping to exchange a counterfeit currency jackpot. US Ambassador Andrew Hughes arrives in Monaco with his wife, Helen, and three decide to make friends, hoping for financial support. One of the three Russians, Count Sergius Karamzin, intends to go further, continually moving towards Helen, while being disappointed by a county servant who loves Sergius. Finally, the facts are against three aristocrats. Obviously, Von Stroheim tried to convey the message (with the stupidity of American women and the wrong behavior of the aristocrats), not to tell the story, and the film can really bring modern audiences like me, just by doing. Even an actor in a good sense later in EvS, like greed and wedding in March, is here in the mill. The film could have used a variety of improvements. Assessment, 3.
