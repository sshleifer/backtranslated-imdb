A stupid and just strange movie from a child who is traumatized when he finds Santa is not real (???). She grows up and becomes an adult (Brandon Maggart) who makes naughty or beautiful lists of people. One Christmas holiday clicks and tries to kill funny people dressed in Santa. <br /> <br /> Bored and just bad killer Santa movie. If you're looking for gore, it's not here. Only a few murders are shown and they are not very wrong. Most of the movie just includes Brandon Maggart, who speaks to himself and slowly crazy. The script is empty, acting dreadful, and it will lead to what looked at me on the jaws on television. Seriously, I had to roll back the tape and watch it again to make sure I was not hallucinating! Really a bad ending. <br /> <br /> If you want to rent a scary Christmas color "Black Christmas" (original 70s version - NOT a terrible remake). Avoid it at all costs.
