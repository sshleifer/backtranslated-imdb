At first it seemed that the film was working great, had the characters' profiles ... the graphic seemed to be in the right direction ... but as the film progressed, it seemed that the director focused on the wrong things. ..when much of the movie was changed. Character identities became worse in the film. There also seemed to be many indirect meanings - in other words, they had things in the film that did not fit the film itself. And the title ... no where the movie title fits the movie ... I think the title works previews .... The actors did well what they had ..... if they had a better director and writer, maybe it would be worked better. But it wasn't. So now a terrible movie has come out on Friday. My opinion! .... don't waste your time or money.
