How could the leader of the Altman experience expect that we would spend time, or take care of what happens, with a leading character who is neurotic, whiner, jerk, who has no redeeming qualities - this is the central puzzle of this. very confusing work. A terrible trash can. In addition to this debilitating deficiency, the plot line needs serious concentration.

This last theme is the core of the film: it is the director's self-esteem with deep contempt for the taste, values ​​and intelligence of the viewer. It is very unusual for Mr Altman. <br /> <br /> Patrick Watson
