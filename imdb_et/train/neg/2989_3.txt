Although this comment is very small among the 80+, I feel I have to say something about it. I am not a film reviewer who pays attention to the value of production, thoughtful dialogue or brilliant action and leadership. However, I argue that this film sucks. I don't know why I don't like it ... I mean it's almost everything I want from horror film: blood, resentment, involuntary humor, and so on. According to this evidence, it should be my favorite. However, Zombie 3 is a movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many things that make you scream on the screen. Like when a girl leaves the military when their car breaks down to find water (it doesn't break anything, don't worry). He walks about what I see as an abandoned hotel or something. Didn't he see the friggin lake in the middle of the building? Yes, he's looking for water and crossing the lake. Why? Cuz he wants to know why people (who have not been abandoned there) don't answer him when he says, "Is anyone there?" Oh, it's just a small, insignificant piece of the big picture I've painted. <br /> <br /> However, this is why I gave this movie to more than 1 star. This is one of those films where you forget how bad it really is, as I have a couple of times, you want to look at it again, because it is so overwhelming in every aspect. I called it the blood in the first paragraph, but this film doesn't have blood, it's the gore of the ocean. It also has pretty strange creatures: a zombie-baby (adult-sized hand) and a magically flying head that only names two. <br /> <br /> Do you know when you try to think of the worst and most exciting movies ever made, and you came up with 50's of science fiction movies? I believe Zombie 3 and such films should be like that. It has all the elements: scientists claiming with the government, warnings about the apocalypse of the radio, armies fighting monsters, and so on. This is the 80's plan 9! While I am not saying it is a waste of money, if you want to buy it, just wait for the worst. And if you find that the worst is waiting for the undervaluation of Zombie 3, it's not that bad. Actually like this, I don't say it's impossible. <br /> <br /> Don't think I hate this movie, I don't ... really. Oh, P.S. Killing Birds (aka Zombie 5) rules! (Just blew my credibility?)
