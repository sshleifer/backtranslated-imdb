In the 1990s, conversations began to sprout left and right. Each network had one, and they all lacked originality. Lake Ricky was another show for the mother of an obese hooker with a Marlboro cigarette, which breastfeeded one of her dozens of illiterate children while skiing. English and the other cornerstones of humanity where it is destroyed are existence. Titltes ranges from Girl to Pigeon Head and so on. How would anyone want to see this clean and complete garbage? Has our society really changed anything more than a number of mountains and dead blows? People who appeared in this exhibition were in the trash. The people who looked at this example were in the trash. Anyone who wants to see this example or put it on a DVD is TRASH. People do not know why Americans are becoming tremendous pigs and over-greasy jobs, even to get jobs, it shows that it's OK that it's 500 pounds overweight and has 12-year-old girls like prostitutes. Such a trash on the TV has destroyed morality.
