What has become our dear Ramu on earth? Is it the same man who made Sarkari, Satya and Comapny? I don't want to believe it. When AAG was Ramu's most ambitious project, he has clearly risen to the high rock he has risen, giving the industry some of the greatest work of some time. This film falls like a brick. I started to leave the theater, but I was forced to sit down because I couldn't take my car to the parking lot before others left. Otherwise, nothing would have made me miss. <br /> <br /> This movie is not close to Sholay. It doesn't even come a few miles away. I believe Ramu loves Godfather more than Sholay, because Sarkar was a classic job. I read Ramu's interview a few days ago, where the interviewer said that Ram was not sleeping for more than 4 hours a day, not even stretching. I fully agree with this now, because his lack of sleep is likely to cost the film. <br /> <br /> There is no force in the presentation. Amitabh Bachchan doesn't even look scary. He looked at the more terrifying pair of posters and wallpapers I saw earlier. Rama's favorite Nisha Kothari did a fantastic job in Sarkar because he didn't have many dialogues (actually, if I remember clearly). He opened the mouth of this film and found a place in history. The new man who plays the role of Jai seems to be obviously beautiful but did not lead Jai at all. I can't go ... Im sorry ... my pain is too big for me to manage now. <br /> <br /> During the movie, I promised myself to look back at the original Sholay again to see it still. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: terrible movie. The media and critics are going to make Ramu goose. And just to remind all readers once again, I'm one of the biggest fans of Ramu, and even I can't save him for this act.
