Friz Freleng's "Speedy Gonzalez" was another comic who wore the title character for "Two Tails" by Robert McKimson. On this comic, Speedy has been a small creature with a big gold tooth, but due to his second appearance, the famous design was already adopted. Despite the much more beautiful view, Speedy never developed as a sign. The big hat, the tremendous speed and the bad Mexican accent is not a classic character, and it's pretty much all that Speedy has ever had with him. Nonetheless, the spicy little mouse turned out to be very popular and noticed in many short shorts, including some of the last days of the studio in really abysmal movies. Although these early short shorts are better than those later fractures that he was often (rather strange) associated with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired, based on predictable gags, usually based on similar pursuit formulas. In this independent episode, another mouse recruits Speedy cheese to steal from a local factory, a cat that Sylvester watches for. Although it brings weight to the character, the role of Sylvester here could be as easy as any other generic cat. His personality strikes his forced predictable. unwanted role of follower. It was always a problem with Tweety's caricatures, but Speedy, even because of his despicable scare and the obvious impossibility of catching him, is even a troublesome opponent. Poor old Sylvester would be forced to appear next to Speedy for many years. Despite having followed a fairly basic formula and a little laughing, "Speedy Gonzalez" won the Oscar, and the unwanted star was born.
