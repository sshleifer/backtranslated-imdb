"True" story of three girls going to the wild in Connecticut and getting into the woods maniac. This is a movie that would have been thirty years ago in the United States in a shift in driving. Not much of what the film is working on for its low budget mixed results. The film is traceable but not at all scary (blame the way some scenes of attack do it). This is a movie you probably forget when you do it. The odds are that you never think of seeing it unless someone handed it to you and says, "Here look at" what happened to me. If you are given a copy, give it back, the film is not worth it to be seen even if it is traceable.
