Gods ... where to start. I can only last for the first 10 minutes before I turn it off. Apart from the actor who plays Robin Hood himself, the rest were terrible. And I can only stretch the suspension of unbelief until now. <br /> <br /> When I opened the first episode, I lost how many mistakes, plot holes and terrible costumes. It started with some poor peasants who were trying to fool their family. Everything well and good. At the same time, the poorer razor must be deaf, because a handful of soldiers, pulling in the horse, were able to bypass him about 10 feet. <br /> <br /> When he works out, he goes, if he has 10 feet behind him, to a shot where you don't see them at all, immediately followed by about 20 feet. Then he runs to a bush and is immediately handled by two soldiers who just a few seconds before they rode on the horse, tens of feet behind. <br /> <br /> The soldiers are so painfully obvious with the cloth they were trying to do, like on the ground, and failed unhappy. Not to mention that the armor "armor" is about 5 in size for a poor man. Seriously, he looks like he is a small child wearing his father's excessive armor! Finally, Robin will be able to shoot for about 5 seconds, targeting one soldier's hand, for about 2 seconds on what appears to be a repetitive belt. No one could make such shots, in a short time, as the dug rifles, much less bow. <br /> <br /> After that, they flee from the soldiers and stop to help amazingly dressed and clean the "peasant" by trenching the ditch ... something all the nobles were willing to do all the time, right? How this unfortunate pretext for the second season series is over me. Production costs (at least for what I saw) must have risen to tens of dollars (or euros) ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, I think a high school drama class could have been a better transfer. It was so bad that even the terrible version of Kevin Costner from Robin Hood was better. <br /> <br /> I suggest you skip this monster and rent or buy the Robin of Sherwood in the mid-80s. Much better written, acted, dressed and produced. <br /> <br /> After shame, BBC ... shame ...
