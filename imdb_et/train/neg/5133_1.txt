I had no real expectation in this movie and I'm glad. Even if I had expected it, I'd be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Where to start? First of all, I think 15% of the film consisted of stationary pea brushes in the dark jungle field. I get it. There are peacocks. I think the title "Scarecrows" was enough. Secondly, scary and paranormal events have never gone. There are too many times when I stayed with WTF? <br /> <br /> Third, the film takes seriously. I'm making a B movie with buckets of blood, screaming women, and meaningless violence that is a simple psychopath or an ancient curse. But these films often know that they are B-films and even fascinate them like Dead Snow (a fun Scandinavian zombie flick) or Evil Dead 2. But this film seems to be neglected for its crapdom. <br /> <br /> Finally, there should be more blood and / or nudity. Yes, I said that. If you have a horror horror movie, do it by killing. And if you have one hot and one semi-hot girl, one of them has to show a minimum side-bob. <br /> <br /> Just as it is said, skip the Scarecrows and just hit your eyes. You thank me.
