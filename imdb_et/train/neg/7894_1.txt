If you are not an evangelical Christian, do as an Egyptian and avoid as a biblical plague. of what I just wasted because of the end that started on such a good evening. <br /> <br /> The plot space started strong enough - I was drawn into the movie and was interested until the moment the Bible sermons took over. Which waste is it. <br /> <br /> This film has so tempted me to be registered for the first time in IMDb but to file a complaint against it. /> <br /> Hay - what does a Christian do for me ;-)
