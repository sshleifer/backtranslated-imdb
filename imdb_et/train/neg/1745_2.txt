In the first half of the film, there was a constant pace and characters were introduced. but suddenly everything happened that Akshey Kumar has by now been 3 girls who were very white by both Akshey and John Abraham. Neha Dupia was highlighting the film, Paresh Rawal was good but not as good as her performance at Hera Pher. in general, this film was the greatest disappointment that the film is not fair to its trailer. save your money and don't watch this movie, check out Hera Pheri and Hungama! <br /> <br /> Making this summary: The inexpensive stage shows the film's performance and appearance story and no matter, the plot was exceptionally unheard of good music from Peter who bought us Dhoom! Keep it up! The movie was shot in one room, new arrivals (female cast) were okay because it was their first movie, but well-established actors like Akshey and John were disappointed with a fully-fledged director like Priyadarshan ever giving his worst movie!
