This review spoilers are offered as a public service because the only way to enjoy this costume fashion is to know that our main character, Lady Barbara Skelton, is rape and ending. And not for a moment too fast. I would have shot myself off the screen, but I was afraid I'd hit James Mason. <br /> <br /> The original 1943 novel called "Wicked Lady Skelton's Life and Death" (I think people didn't do it) about spoilers t) wrote a woman, an English navy brat, who was either cumbersome or cynical or both. His heroine is devastatingly beautiful and the author seems to think that if you have beauty, there is nothing else. But other things are important, such as the fact that Lady Barbara's immediate and only response, when someone gets her way, is killing. He murders five men in five tests. In the femme fatale series, he has a case of disocial personality disorder that should have landed on either Bedlamis or Newgat. <br /> <br /> Lockwood plays him as a narcissistic vampire, wearing so many makeup that I thought he was in the era of recovery Joan Rivers (or restoration time Joan Rivers, ha!). But Lady B. is irresistible to all three major male characters - Michael Rennie, James Mason and Griffith Jones, who all do a good job, as does Patricia Roc. Of course, all three admirers understand in a short order that is psychotic female Barbara, but the plot keeps them all in orbit until one of them finally puts down the gun - randomly, which is either irony or just dessert. Given the dramatic death of a scene where the boom raises the camera through windows and sky, I assume we have to give him death. But he's the first body we don't care about.
