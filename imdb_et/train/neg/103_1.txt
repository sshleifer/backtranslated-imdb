Without wishing to be killed, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the darkest and most cluttered films I've ever seen - one of them and Camp Blood is another. <br /> <br /> The actor is terrible, the print is filthy and all this movie is "seriously, you could do better". Perhaps it is a challenge for all of Youtube to saturate our own zombie-related devil? <br /> <br /> I bought it for Â£ 1, but keep in mind that you can't put a price on your life in 71 minutes. You would do it to avoid this turkey, even at a favorable price.
