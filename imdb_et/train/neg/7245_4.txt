I'm not interested in Pallbearer, it's not too bad, it's just slow. When the film goes on, it becomes a little more interesting, but nothing brilliant. I like David Schwimmer and I think he's good here. I'm not a massive fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but I do not mind him sometimes and he's fine. Pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie, but if you like it, you can enjoy it.
