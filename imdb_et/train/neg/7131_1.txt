I like bad movies. I like renting bad movies with my friends and ripping them for their duration. Then there are such tough movies. Redline is not just a bad film, but a sign that the American film industry should recommend at least proofreading scripts for the benefit of the viewer before funding the film. <br /> <br /> If the stereotype took this film out of it. The story is intolerable and ridiculous. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin maybe have the worst screen chemistry I've seen, and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and beat with orange packs until they exchange their invitation to the street vendors for the thing they legitimately qualify for). In addition to how Angus Macfadyen is convinced that this movie is doing this, it is farther away from me than even thinking about analogy. I am his loyal fan, but it has challenged me. <br /> <br /> In summary. Many people want revenge for different reasons (and if you care enough to find out what they are, you're a bigger person than me), so much that it becomes violence (I think). The film is like Ouroboros, a snake that swallows its tail, because it is an endless confusion cycle and a dialogue that does not fit the human ears. This movie is basically one big car commercial in the first half of the year and an unclear movie for the rest, it should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> I want to find a positive aspect to this movie, and I think it's about finally getting credit. <br /> <br /> PS Nadia Bjorlin, when you were singing these two films in this movie, you are a cage, and I hope old age will destroy you. <br /> <br /> P.S.S. If you rent this movie in search of a ridiculous experience, listen to Nadia Bjorlin's awesome songs.
