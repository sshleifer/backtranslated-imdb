The plot, character development and gags in this movie are all extremely weak. Time wasted. To sum up Saving Grace, it should feel warm and foggy as the characters have grown through their struggles. Such warm fuzzy feelings could not be developed in this way. Drug gags are clich√© and much of the movie doesn't live a life. The plot builds what should be the tension, but the characters are not developed with sufficient care. Then it will emit all the unsolved problems in about a minute after the screen time, leaving the viewer feeling they have just wasted their time.
