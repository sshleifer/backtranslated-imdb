This is definitely one of the biggest Hollywood studios ever made and published. The plot is just stupid. Dialogue is written in clich√©; That's why you can fill out a lot of sentences in the script. The actor is ridiculously bad, especially Rod Cameron. "Choreography" is silly and totally unerotic. One can only regret that the reviewer saw the 23-year-old Yvonne dance as sexual; it's just a very bad choreography. At the beginning of the film, the ballet scene is particularly ridiculous. If you are in bad movies and you enjoy laughing at some Hollywood turkeys, this is for you. I bought a colored version of VHS, making the movie even worse. Yvonne's hard-painted makeup looks like a clown all the time. And he's the best part of this movie. What a chance to start a career.
