Kitten Natividad, the celebrity of Russ Meyer, plays Chastity Knotti, a woman who has found her breast cancer so she goes to South America to get some special fruits (Crockazilla?), Which should have healing power. After some of this fruit (which seems to be stems of plastic bananas), Chastity is blessed with the mysterious magical power that makes him a super-hero, The Double D Avenger. Please note that she is also wearing a pair of panties as a mask. In writing, everything sounds pretty good. If left unfulfilled, it will leave more than enough. It seems that Chastity owns a pub and the local band connection is upset because he takes off his business, so some removers (including Haji, also the celebrity of Russ Meyer movie) go over to destroy him. Of course, Chastity fights in the shadow of Double D Avenger. See how she does a "Wonder Woman" type spin to change her clothing and lose balance as it is due to excessive centrifugal force. Bad jokes and flat double-knees fly like there was no tomorrow. Because the dough theme song plays over and over it comes out like a twisted 70 "live action" guy to show adult content, though although it's unrated it could probably go for PG-13 at its worst. And this is probably a blessing that faded stars are well covered. This makes Doris Wishman's Chesty Morgan movies relatively positive. Forest J. Ackerman's special look, but what then. Very stupid, and I never buy another movie on the cover with Joe Bob Briggs. 2 out of 10.
