I saw this movie and sometimes I was hungry, believing that this movie saw me. Munchie will melt the "farce" in the coming years. Check out Star Wars, Don't-watch Munchie again. <br /> <br /> As a responsible parent (I'm talking to those who are now older), I never (your) child (s) have ever participated in a pseudo-occult video festival. Munchie's uplifting is a satanic, co-viewer, probably an illegal chilled “duh”. He is devilish, stranger, rhetorical, and completely malicious - as Bogey's person made the meat that is invisible to adults tempting children with a lifestyle they can never afford (without income that has allowed years of self-denial and careful management). He is a catcher of light answers and false ideals. He is all that is not morally aware of the viewer. He's fucking his own Ron Pope. <br /> <br /> I pray (I mean it literally and figuratively, emphasizing myself) that this movie hasn't gone into DVD format. I hope that such a "yellow film" died in the cold nights of 1994. <br /> <br /> Munchie also loves the seal. I forgot to mention it. It comes up a lot.
