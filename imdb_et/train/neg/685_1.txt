My wife and I thought the film should be worth at least with this pain and the director. We were wrong. In fact, we gave up after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young and Tone are British, but speak American accents, was impossible for me to get past - it is hard to believe that this is England if nobody talks about British accent. For Crawford and somebody to repeat zero chemistry and the previous comment, the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly express their love for one another without cause is ridiculous. There is no reason to care for any character, so we threw the towel. I had a hard time believing that Hawks was leading it because no participant spoke about the Hawksian rat-a-tat service. So save your time and skip it.
