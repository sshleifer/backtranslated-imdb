If you haven't seen the gong show TV series, this movie doesn't like much, not that knowing this series makes it a great movie. <br /> <br /> I give it to 5 out of 10 because some things make it interesting, which helps to overcome its obvious problems. <br /> <br /> 1) It's funny at the time it was made in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 2) You get a lot of funny people you've seen at the show. 3) It is interesting to see Chuck (host) if he is not on his air television. 4) You see a lot of strange people doing all kinds of wonders as you see in the TV show. <br /> <br /> I don't list all the bad things because there are many, but here are some of the most outstanding things. <br /> <br /> 1) The Gong Show movie has many real TV shows that are tired of the length of the movie. 2) The movie's story outside the clip segments is very weak and basically consists of just one plot point. 3) Chuck is actually half-decent as an actor, but most of the other participants do a typical way in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie to watch if you don't have one and a half hours to watch. Look at 20 minutes at a time and it's not that bad. But even then it's not that good. ;)
