Not near the original. This is a pretty accurate copy that doesn't give the story something new. But management is very bad. Basinger is weak - without good control. Baldwin is just another league compared to McQueen. I just looked at it because of curiosity, being a big fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece and I got what I thought. Almost B-film with second speed and redirection. I wasn't even disappointed, I just don't know what they were trying to do. This remake does not try to play with the original material, it is not a tribute and indeed it does not have a really good age actor. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a wonderful photo. br /> <br /> It's a waste of your time. Save yourself for 2 hours or watch the original (again :)))
