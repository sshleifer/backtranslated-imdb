I don't think this is too bad for the right conditions at exhibitions. I promised the first season. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is an exhibition of lawyers who are not really lawyers. God forbid anyone who actually goes to the law office on the basis of these exhibitions, what I had heard when I looked at the interviews at the show. It just made me a little comforted. <br /> <br /> Spader and Shatner, who should be the stars of the show, are the most annoying. Although this may be a compliment in some situations, it is definitely not here. First of all, women are constantly harassed at their exhibition. But because this is what they are literally doing all the time, I understand that it is as deep as the show gets. Trying to spread some serious, dramatic, and even tear-like moments in the face of a real show, can't compensate for the progressive lack of interest I've seen to show you enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Alan Shore's amazing and free "public announcement", where he excludes his opinions, does not impress. Denny Crane is just annoying. I was embarrassed to him and to the actors wearing the colonial clothes of Crane. <br /> <br /> I give two stars because there are moments where I thought the exhibition's attempts to deal with some contemporary problem I think the exhibition writers became aware that the sexual harassment displayed by Denny and Alan became superfluous even for those who they were more called from the beginning. The thing is that I don't care if the treatment of sexual harassment at the exhibition is well done, but I just felt that the writer artificially offends me by implanting sexual bantras in the hope that my libido will keep me coming back for more. I am no longer a teenager and I think this exhibition is promising if it was not meant to evaluate the lowest common denominator for rating. <br /> <br /> Of course, I write it after I realized it wasn't much better. It's a shame because it's one of those I love to love.
