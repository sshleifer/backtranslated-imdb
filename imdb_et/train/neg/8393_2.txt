John Carradine, John Ireland, and Faith Domergue, who, as players, all saw better days on better movies, met this G-class horror film about a mysterious mansion that imitates art. <br /> <br /> For Carradine, it was among their past two decades in his career that he appeared in something theory was better to continue working no matter what you did and get those paychecks come. With this superb sonorous voice of its own, Carradine was always in great demand for horror images and the man did not discriminate the least of what he appeared. <br /> <br /> He plays the caretaker of an old Gothic mansion, who has been leased by director John Ireland for his last small budget. It's even a graveyard, but with a missing driver. Faith Domergue is Ireland's aging star and Carole Wells is a young place. <br /> <br /> Over the last twenty minutes, most of the cast is dead, not dead yet. The script is so inconsistent that I try to figure this out. I don't waste more gray weight on it.
