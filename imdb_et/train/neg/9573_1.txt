Not completely off the wall, but just stupid. "Killer Tongue" is an awkward blend of sci-fi, horror and supposed comedy. This is an arbitrary and totally inconsistent film. There is very little dialogue, mainly because the script, if it exists, is a complete "pond scum". I wouldn't even call it weird, but just a "total mess". This movie is definitely a disappointment and you are warned. There is no reason to waste this time, and if you do, the sharp smell like rotten fish .......................... .... ................................. MERK
