I saw this movie once and it was enough for me. There is very little or no plot in the film, and it seems to be nothing but a constant scene of psycho-sadistic violence and very little else. I wanted to see this movie because he played Zoe Trilling on the second "Night of Demons"; and I wanted to see that he was playing normal. Unfortunately, the Tobe Cooper script hardly starts and goes somewhere when Robert Englund dominates the film and sees the landscape and plot. Zoe, I know where you are now; hiding from this movie!
