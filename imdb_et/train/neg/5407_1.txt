If you want to watch a real "high quality" movie, keep Eden's formula. This wonderful movie has to cost all $ 50. It has a thin folded writing pad, pathetic bad sets, lighting and camera work, and a stop motion, a paper-mache monster that's totally ridiculous (they sometimes seemed to wear a rubber costume and / or a glove for a sleeve) - But all were equally terrible). <br /> <br /> Participants speak their line as they haven't seen them before and read the TV channel. Special effects remain too far. And the only sad thing is that they fell on a really nice original titled "Tyranasaurus Wrecks", which takes exactly what you get in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This happens when you grab it so hard that you break the crust beneath it. <br /> <br /> I loved it every minute.
