It was a decent film, I really enjoyed it. But the end is so steep! There is no closure and it leaves a ton of loose ends. What happens after the concert? What happens to her boyfriend? Does he connect with Grant? Will he come next semester? And what is Angela? Obviously, Holly knocked Angela's play on a couple of shirts, but nothing was shown as to how she reacted. There's so much air left and it's very happy. I don't know if he's trying to leave the space behind or something, but it's a terrible ending and I think it's making the movie really funny. I was very disappointed.
