"The Matrix" was an exciting summer banquet that was visually fantastic, but there was also a strange way of thinking that provoked its "Twilight Zone" in a way. The general rule here is - and this sequel is incompatible with its predecessor. Worse than that, it's not even compared. <br /> <br /> `Reloaded 'explodes the screen most professionally. In the beginning of a few seconds, the first impression is generally good, because Trinity is a dream. Immediately after that, the nose is filming. After a catastrophic first 45 minutes, it will gradually enter the matrix, and Agent Smith's struggle will take place. But it loses all speed when it reaches the queue of a 14-minute car and becomes even worse when there is a big belt at the end. The worst thing is Zion Rave's long-term scene. Not only does it have something to do with the plot, it is also a pathetic apology for porn and depressive dance music. <br /> <br /> The "matrix" ball-time aspect was a good addition, but "Reloaded" they move to be boring. The first was interesting plot revolutions, but here it is too linear to be far from interesting. The film is basically just a stylish deviation that prevents us from understanding how empty it really is. It works by the wrong principle that the bigger is better. It seems that the "Matrix" franchise has quickly fallen into the special effects that drenched misfire to other franchises, such as the Star Wars saga, have. <br /> <br /> A working standard is usually bad. Of course, Hugo Weaving goes to Agent Smith - the only one that is just interesting. Keanu Reeves is the ultimate Neo, but with all the special effects, there is little room to make a lot of impact. Laurence Fishburne, a candidate for the Academy Award, is a reduced monotonous mentor with poor dialogue. Carrie Ann Moss's part, as a chick, could have done much better for another actor. <br /> <br /> Poor, thrown film, "Matrix Reloaded" is disappointing. Those who did not like the first one are unlikely to be a flock to it. It's just for dead fans. Even the film's own special effect-bonanzas (minority report, matrix, etc.) in its sub-mode is still quite poor. My IMDb Rating: 4.5 / 10.
