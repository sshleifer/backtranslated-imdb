I'm never quite sure where it went. These people seem to be interested in what is happening on some mountains. They are exploring, small fleeing, leaving, coming back, leaving, threatening each other, dreaming, attacking witches with consistent wardrobes and so on. The boy seems to like the girl but leaves him unprotected several times. He gets off, he gets back, he leaves again. You get a point. It seems to me that the whole thing is about to become a victim, but I'm not sure if people turn to witches, but I'm not sure. It's just boring and endless and not worth the time. There are some atmospheric scenes, but the print is so bad that times when twenty seconds of darkness is not unusual. This is due to age or excessive use of night filters.
