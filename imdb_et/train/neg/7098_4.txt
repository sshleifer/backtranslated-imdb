An interesting idea about a movie that both shows the last dragon on earth and shows the fight he and someone has done. When he was younger, Einon grabbed his heart, so Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him to a dark master who gave him half his heart. Now Einon (David Thewlis) now grew into a selfish and evil king. Meanwhile, Bowen uses a new friend, Draco Dragon (expressed by Sir Sean Connery), to gain hope for "killing" dragons. But since Einon has half of Draco, both feel that one of them is hurt or killed. Pete Postlethwaite also plays as Glockenspuri Gilbert, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie's Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud King Arthur. This was the best visual effect for the Oscar. Worth viewing!
