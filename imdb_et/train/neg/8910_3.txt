This movie is very simple but somehow a very bad plot. The whole movie speaks about a girl who sucks through the gate to another dimension, then years later the witch is reopened during a group of friends (including the head of an actress who has difficulty with her former girlfriend, one of the other campers with her new partner ... the other girl ... it's right that they are lesbians and of course there is some nudity for some particular reason). Unfortunately, the demon now follows an adult girl. Unfortunately, it has never been explained. Where were they exactly? Where did the demon come from? How did he survive as a child in a place full of evil demons? Who the devil taught him and made him a gladiator type of clothes? Action is terrible, I think, but it's hard to say, because writing is so bad that maybe there was nothing they did with it. I give him three because the wrestler was pretty good and the effects were pretty fun, even though they were very cheap. I wouldn't recommend it, it wasn't that funny.
