The Thinner plot is definitely thin. And great. A greasy lawyer rides over a gypsy woman and a gypsy curse causes her to lose and lose weight .... OK, Gypsy churches should be fun, but weight loss has gone bad? No. Except Stephen King thinks. And Michael McDowell, another author of horror and scriptwriter of this abysmal film, does it too. An attorney is not only a criminal irresponsible but also a fat, haha! The thin is like an immature mess that a person who dreams about how he has never seen anything as nasty as fat. Hey, I can only say: Well, look at the mirror.
