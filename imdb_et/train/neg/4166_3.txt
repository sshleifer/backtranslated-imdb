A complete waste of time .... This movie is not a comedy, it's not a drama, it's not romance ... not even a teen comedy! The story ... it should be one gear, but it's so disappointing! If the film has the final result, I hope that changing movies to make the movie even better (exp. "Fight Club"), but this rejection makes the movie even worse .... If I look at teenage comedy and I don't do it very often, I hope that funny jokes and a bunch of nud ... Jokes are too bad and nudity is not ... You only have one .... very good looking ... have to admit ... girl and that is it! And she's totally dressed up in the whole movie! Acting is bad ... like a soap series ... Don't waste your time! There are pornos with a better story and acting! <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad English)
