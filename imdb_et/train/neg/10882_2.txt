This movie is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen. From the first scene I knew it would be a cracked collision. It starts with a seemingly bad girl who kills a lot of nuns in a mission. As it turns out, the people living in it were some random zombies. Well, a few years later, some college kids are pulling some revenge. A terrible act is going from the pant to the main run. Things like jock scream at him to do things in a rather non-chalice way, with a promise to react and to make the overall "eager to be a popular role". What really took this cake is the last battle. Completely HORRIBLE special effects with weapons. For example, weapons that produce noise without a flash of mouth, and vice versa. It comes with stop-animation zombies (why are they moving from stopping to mystery), cheesy music and about 40 weapons that come out nowhere. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is really. Like many others, you can rent 50 cents at your nearest low-eyebrow rental.
