The film uses the top title of the lame story. Kill Kill would have been nice. The film contains taboo scenes so the viewer moves back to his chairs. Scenes are unnecessary and uncomfortable. Film is something that a writer could have on a novice screen. Just wasting movie props and network money. I have to write 10 lines of text to criticize this movie if it is not worth 10 lines of my time, but I have to continue to let people know to avoid pointlessness. When people read that you choose a good movie for a movie night, choose something else. If you have a soul, do not harm it by getting yourself into this pollution.
