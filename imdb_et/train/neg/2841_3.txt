SAKURA KILLERS (1 + 5 stars) Maybe this movie was cool in 1987 ... if you had never seen a * head * ninja movie. Cheesy's '80s music ... cheesy dialogue ... cheesy acting ... and tea-cheesy martial arts sequences. The coolest scene in the beginning is ... with outdated Chuck Connors, who plays golf on the beach ... several black clad ninjas are trying to sneak up on him and seem to be too willing to notice his ball ... maybe he gets into his golf bags and ... well, I will not break it ... if you ever have trouble seeing this movie, thank you. The story is a lot pointless about some stolen video tape or something. Ninja is rarely trained in incandescent Caucasian heroes because "only ninja can fight ninja" or something like that. Strangely enough, these guys do not look better after their training than before ... oh, the movie doesn't move quite agile. Fighting scenes may not be great, but they are rich ... and superfluous sound effects are good for some smiles.
