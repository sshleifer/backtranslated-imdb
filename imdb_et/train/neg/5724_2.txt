I agree with the last reviewer that this movie was terrible. Yes, there was a lot of gore and nudity. But it was overshadowed by a slow moving, pointless plot and a stupid end. Where should it be filmed: Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong? The hostel was a much better movie and I would recommend seeing it. The technical annoyance with a DVD is that if you turn off Spanish subtitles, they will return to some scene and then you will have to go back to the main menu and turn them off again. Also, do not waste your time on deleted scenes because there is no sound and it looks like a tourist material.
