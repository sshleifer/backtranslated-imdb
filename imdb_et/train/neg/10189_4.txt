I saw this movie years ago and I was impressed ... but I was 12 years old again. I recently looked at it and want it back. This movie is pretty bad. If I like Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace (see My Bodyguard (1980) if you want to see a good movie that he was ... starring in meatballs (including Bill Murray)), and Burgess Meredith, this role doesn't do / did nothing for a career. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the character of Lee Majors, Franklyn Hart, is the driver of a racing car who plans to drive his racing car (which he had in stock) all over the country in California. One problem: the government has banned all private transport. I thought this concept was OK (not worse than what I've heard), but it failed.
