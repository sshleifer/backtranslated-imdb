Question to you: The family goes to a new house and goes to the demonic forces. What kind of movie am I talking about? Every horror movie you've seen? Yes, it's true, but that's not the answer I'm looking for. I'm narrowing it down, saying there are many teen scenes. Don't it help? Well there are lots of bits where characters are marked by the creature and you see characters through POV. Not beyond? Okay, is a dream that involves a lot of blood? You could still be any horror movie you say. Oh gawd it can take weeks, so I'll tell you a movie about which I'm talking about loads of Aussies, many of which have appeared to neighbors and home and to the land. Yes, this is the right film for THIRD DESCRIPTION (aka CUBBYHOUSE) and do you understand what the exercise is? It is pointing to me how the THIRD WRITING does not differ absolutely from all the horror films made
