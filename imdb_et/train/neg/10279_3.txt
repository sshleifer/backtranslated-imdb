This movie was so terrible that it was almost good ... almost. We love musicals, but not that. Even with amazing sound quality, poor cinematography and many actors who can't sing or dance, Anthony Rapp managed to give a good result (especially at the end). Marjorie, a drunken woman, was also enjoyable to watch. The plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without horrible singing and beautiful piano music. Admittly, some songs (fantabulous) are quite memorable (but not a good way). <br /> <br /> Open House is funny to watch a movie just because it's terrible! We think it can be a good stage music (with great actors).
