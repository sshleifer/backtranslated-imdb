There is not much to say about this. A piece of land that can be pretty much tied in the first ten minutes. Nothing is too wrong about this film, very little action. Sometimes it was possible to explore the feelings of the characters. I'm sure the action movie is the right genre. Sniper was one of the simplest movies that weren't viewed because it was a little complicated and simple. I was probably guilty of this, so it could be better with the other clock or with indivisible attention. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but my 4 of the top 10)
