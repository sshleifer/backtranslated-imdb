Where to start? OK, don't compare this movie to fight for the club at first - ridiculous. If it were even a fight club patch, violence, blood, gore, etc. would be much more obvious and realistic. Secondly, this film is not a football factory that is so much more real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby as embarrassing). It is enough that the story is quite decent and the fighting scenes are well choreographic - I can add a decent ending. But the film is generally bad, seriously bad. As people have mentioned, the accents shouldn't spoil the film - I disagree - whether a simple aching mistake or a lack of effort in voice guidance made the movie irritate all the time - it was obvious that one American / Geordie played a role. Don't get me wrong, a good looking guy who looks good with a skin head but not a football hooligan. I could go on forever if the football scene is ridiculous - the situation of a "fake steward". Even when GSE starts playing United up, they go to a train that only waits for them 3 - there is no point - it's a real gangster and thug cut, depicted in the movie mickey mouse culture for about 5 people. Exactly - did West Ham and Milwall not play in the last few years when they've been in the championship? Hmm, ten years OK. And I'm sure "Bother" could just roll out Milwall's pub. In principle, it is a very bad film that people want when they have little knowledge of real football and hooliganism. If you really love football and you are interested in the underworld of hooliganism, you just feel that this film would offend your intelligence. Ross George
