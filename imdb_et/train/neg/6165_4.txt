Allen goes to the country (somewhere he hates in real life) and is with his friends over the weekend - which are common successful white middle-class belly types in many of his films. <br /> <br /> I usually find something to entertain the Woody Allen comedies, but here he really falls completely flat on his face. He seems to have left him with even one liner. In fact, this is not a plot (pieces of bar and cod Shakespeare pieces) - but Allen seems to be using this location to allow semi-mystical air, which just makes things even more regrettable and half-mature. <br /> <br /> It just doesn't work at any level and is just a giant. The best thing about this movie (except for the final credits) is that bad reviews seem to wake him up and realize that just scripts and puts his companions into their entertainment.
