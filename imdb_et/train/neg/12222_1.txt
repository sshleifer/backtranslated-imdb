(Frankly, Barbra, I know you're the one who clicked all those who aren't in my review. 22 times? How many people did you have to help here? Do you have anything better to do than watch yourself in the mirror all day?) <br /> <br /> Steven Spielberg told Barbra that it was "the best movie I've seen since" Citizen Kane. "It says pretty much - and it's a very deterrent! <br /> /> What are the ingredients for a particular fire cinematic catastrophe and what haunts you will not allow you to forget the tears and pain of both laughter? In fact, almost everything? By definition? Must be in Hollywood egomania. Why would anyone want to act? "" For art?!? Well, if you are stupid enough to believe what they say to you in carefully prepared interviews? the greatest ego of all! To be surrounded by narcissistic crabs and to manage them all? this is remarkable. <br /> <br /> Film, like all his "solo" aspirations, is an ego journey straight from hell. Each scene of a strike is automatically destroyed. Stillborn. But because it wasn't enough, does he sing a whole lot of Streisandy songs? You know what enabled Mariah Careys, Celine Dions and Whitney Huston to bring this world of valuable air waves for decades. Just because he deserves him not one, just 100 South Park episodes. <br /> <br /> The premise that Streisand dresses as a man to learn to become a rabbi sounds like a zany ZAZ comedy. Apart from being a cliche, the obvious problem is that Streisand doesn't look like a woman and doesn't look like a man? in fact, I'm not even sure he is a human. How's he watching this movie? it cannot be described in words. E.T. looks like a high school jock. In 2015, he looks more than Michael Jackson. He sees HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> Songs. They made me tremble. Especially "Papa Do You Hear Me Squeel Like Demented Female Walrus In Heat?" and "Tomorrow night I will be making a queue, YENTL 2: BACK BACK". <br /> <br /> Did you know that Streisand had a nose job at the beginning of his career but changed his mind when they said his voice could change? Do you believe it? He should have done it! Killing two flies with one sweep would have been like that. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading the stories of Barbra Streisand and other Hollywood intellectuals, please contact me by email. <br /> <br /> HOW TO STOP THE BARBRA STREET STARTED?
