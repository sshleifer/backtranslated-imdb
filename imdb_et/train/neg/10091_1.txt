I can't believe this movie has ever been created. I think that in points, the director tries to make it an artistic work, but it makes it worse. Zombies look like they applied too many eye makeup. Zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes. Finally, there are five or six zombies, certainly not a nation. The best part of the movie, if it exists, is definitely a credit because the painful experience was finally finished. Again, to repeat other user comments, the voodoo priests are strange and do not make much sense in the film. There is also a scene with a snake and a Romanian girl who has no idea at all. It has never been explained.
