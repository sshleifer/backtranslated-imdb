What a shame! I checked it, hoping it would be an undiscovered pearl of James Garner and what a stranger it turned out to be! The quality of production was good, but the plot was undoubtedly flat and I can honestly say that I am just a couple of hours older and much dumber now. The film didn't really have the redeeming qualities and when such things come out, it gives Hallmark a bad name. For those who demand to know what it was, it is not something, and in this case it is not good. We are being watched by an old ornery woman who is one of the dumb beings who ever travel on earth, married to a true dear one who is probably the only person who can live with her. She pulls her in one confusion after another, she takes one embarrassing situation after another and is proud of all the time. Then the movie ends. What a relief it was! It is not worth the time it takes to watch it, so do yourself a favor and skip it, you're glad you did when you knew how bad it really was.
