"Fungicide" is probably the most incompetent, embarrassing, bad "movie" I've ever seen. Operation is criminal, the direction is practically non-existent, and the special effects are expected to be put together, releasing a monkey with learning difficulties on a vulnerable laptop. I believe that such things should not be done. I'm sure the "movie" makers say yes, "the movie" was hampered by a low (like nothing) budget - but in that case, they wouldn't have had to work hard. As they are, they have provided the world with something so frightening, so fulfilling, that only the imbugens can make it the most pleasing tone. <br /> <br /> "Movie" was not running as if I had been waiting for "Citizen Kane" or something. I had been waiting for a small budget with a small budget, which may be somewhat inventive, fun fun, and even some energy. What I got was the cinematic equivalent of the handkerchief used. <br /> <br /> Plot? Well, the antihero scientist working in the cellar of our parents is happy to see some cups stirring. Apparently, this high-level research is the end result of research for years. Her parents send her a strange hotel-type place to relax. There are some other people who are just too terrible to write. Anyway, the scientist falls on some of his mushrooms - and soon mushrooms will grow and some people will kill. (Wow, I'm getting suicidal by just writing a plot summary). Our heroes will save the day by bleaching balm with balsamic vinegar (adding a "fuse" - indeed a piece of string). The barrel has exploded explosively with a small nuclear weapon, destroying all fungi. End. (Thanks to the deity). <br /> <br /> This summary is as good as a "movie" (and actually makes it much more interesting than it really is). It should never have gone through this stage of development (under which I mean the contour of the plot written on the back of the envelope). No one should really have stepped in and give someone a strong shake and said "NO". <br /> <br /> And these "special" effects. Well, they are "special." It's CGI gone mad. And this is what a person I just think is a bicycle pump is the tip of modern technology. And if the mushroom monsters are not in the style of the 1984 computer industry package, then they are represented by actors who mix on the page covered (I don't do it). <br /> <br /> One of the most indignant things about the film is its laziness. This can be summed up in a scene where the hero spins his arms (la Clint Eastwood) and then can't put them in his pocket unhappy. I mean fire, a couple of restarts and he could have pulled it out, but just leave it as it is - very weak. "Movie" makers should put their heads to shame and forbid to go fifty meters away from any film making equipment. and post nice comments and foolishly high user ratings that give the "movie" a totally wrong picture. "Fungicide" is an absolute version of film making. Mr. Wascavage is either very, very stupid or very cynical.
