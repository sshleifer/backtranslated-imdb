Ultimately, it is too foolish and pointless. Yes, there is a gilded cage metaphor, but probably most children wouldn't miss it. Forgotten. Immediately. <br /> <br /> Animation is, as we have been expecting, super-realistic. The line could be best described as thin but strong. Although to the end it seemed to me arbitrary. <br /> <br /> The sewer underworld is a suitably nasty world for the aforementioned world, and there seems to be plenty of money and money. Oh yes, and there is a romantic interest that a woman is a smarter, smarter and closer - this in itself is rapidly becoming a tiring (anti) stereotype. However, your children will probably love it.
