STRANGER IF FICTION wrote me so much, I signed up for IMDb to write this review. STRANGER TH FICTION is a surprisingly complicated, moving and thought-provoking film until the end. If you stop several logic disappears (why didn't Will Ferrell hear Emma Thompson's voice 10 years ago when she started writing her book?) The phone rang. The phone called again. "How did he not know he was calling?.), Filmed his thoughts about mortality, destiny, and sacrifice. be as easy as ax worship as a worshiping soul. His quick trust in him is a great leap of faith. , respect for the concept of "true writing" as a reminder that great literature is either a comedy or a tragedy, but not both, is prominent. well why we accept this end, the last action, the screen goes white, the role of credit Deep and powerful end to almost perfect movie. weeks discussed. <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!! Credit is not rolled. Say this is not the case. Say Hollywood won't hit the 10-minute crap that completely undermined the film's integrity and heart. Dustin Hoffman was right when he said, "It's no longer a masterpiece, it's OK." Reviewing a movie. Except for me, it wasn't even OK. I was so offended by the betrayal of "written truth", the decision to film what I actually burst into angry tears, explaining this movie home. I don't often shout. I could care less about most movies, but I'm still angry about it. <br /> <br /> My questions to writer Zack Helm are: did the original film end when the screen went white? And did you force the coats of arms to make the film to the core of an unfaithful end? Or did you do that maudlin, which ended itself? I've read that you're great. I hope your original script finished the movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> I know Zack Helm never sees this review and I haven't been able to contact him. But, please, movie visitors, am I the only one who knows both STRANGER and FICTION? One good thing came from me when I saw this movie: I now admire LOST IN TRANSLATION.
