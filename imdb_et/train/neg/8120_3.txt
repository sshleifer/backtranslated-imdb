At least among those with at least 100 votes. Candidates directly from the screen written script? Brenda Blethyn was the best actor in the lead role? Candidate for the best picture? I do not always agree with many Oscar elections, but this film can be the worst film ever to be respected by the Academy. Writing and acting were both horrible. Blethyn's role was primarily one of the worst I've ever seen, and probably the most prized actress of all time. An amazing movie that's not worth the big screen and not worth the camera or TV that has ever played it, including HBO (where I saw it). I'm just grateful that I didn't actually pay to see the most rated movies of all time.
