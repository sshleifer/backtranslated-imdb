Ronald Colman won the best actor for the Oscar show performance as a popular stage, losing himself fully in his roles, especially Shakespeare's Othello. The critically acclaimed George Cukor film has a wonderful genealogy written by a team valued by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, the witty scammer comes out as self-conscious and the business of the backboard is too big. Miklós Rózsa also won the score for the Oscar and Shelley Winters has a few long moments (if Colman breathes with him, he asks, "What is a nut?"). Otherwise, this scenario is terribly obvious, surprisingly harsh and not very funny. * 1/2 from ****
