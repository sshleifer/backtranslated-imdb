Moron and his girlfriend attend some rituals to resurrect the dead, trying to prove that the dead cannot be brought back to life. Not surprisingly, they restore the dead soul who is going to cut the ax, and the next day some of the college parents talk about the camp. The man in the ax rises and starts to hit the idiots telling the story. The group calls the police, the policeman sees the blood splatter and thinks it's a mountain lion (!?) And soon after, there will be some deformed killer who may or may not be a ghost. <br /> <br /> Moronic has a little splash of film that was filmed with a wide range of daylight, but where many characters carry a torch and talk as if they were in the middle of the night and would like to draw attention. One man has one gun in one hand and the other has a bullet, but he can barely load it, then after he finally loads it, he has several ways to kill the killer, but he doesn't bother because it would stop the movie too soon. Then he throws the gun away! It is also detrimental to characters who do not know emotions and do not see the slightest concern after cutting their friends into pieces and bad effects (the human heart looks like a chicken meat, finally the car was clearly blown into a model car) and the terrible dialogue and some really ugly female nudity do not help. Finally, it tries to avoid this inconsistency by saying that it was an invention of the same college-age people that talked about the story of the camp at the beginning of this film. <br /> <br /> The killer then kills the real scene in the last scene. Again. <br /> <br /> It's mediocre, good for just a few unwanted laughs. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 Off ****
