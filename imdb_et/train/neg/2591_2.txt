To begin with, I'd like to say I'm a fan of the American Pie series. Although the "naked mile" and it is the two worst, it seems that this is the whole series of decline. First, the best part of the movie was that it was an American Pie film that is always welcome. <br /> <br /> However, there are a lot of bad things about this movie. First of all, the story is very obsolete with the "arc". First of all, there are characters, followed by the pledge of the beta house and finally the Greek Olympics. Each of them is exactly 25 minutes long. In addition to the general stability of the plot, the character is not developed to a small extent, which makes double plague of the poor plot. <br /> <br /> Moreover, I didn't want to deeply stereotype this movie. This means showing the push as extremely cool, only thinking-about-sex men, and explicitly showing gays worse. It also shows the female only as sexual objects and men who only want women to be treated as sexual objects. <br /> <br /> The actor was also poor. Perhaps except for Steve Talley. <br /> <br /> So ultimately, from a critical point of view, it is a movie in general. If you see it from a teenager's point of view, I think it's better, but this movie is rated 18+ in most countries, so it shouldn't really be seen by minors.
