My teacher recorded it and showed it to us in child care to show how teen pregnancy affects people. It just showed how teenage pregnancy affects a childish jock, which is not well educated about how sex works and a tiny, infamous girl who throws fruit, and could not say she was wrong with the person, even if she wore a badge shows that he was like that. I would not be surprised if the child's father had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script. Stacy's mother is a rebellion. She has forgotten that her daughter has passed the age of four and is apparently open when people are spying through her window in her dining room. Bobby's (father's) best friend's name is Dewey, and this is obviously the Sean Penn's character in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This movie is terrible, just because none of the signs are plausible. Thank you for the goodness that it is only made for TV, limiting the public's ability to watch it.
