it can be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't see how it could ever be described as a horror movie or even a thriller? it is rather a wild drama. frightening music is noteworthy, but as there were no scary situations, the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities such as a landfill or stairs. the film had so much potential. they had beautiful cinematography (sp?) and interesting characters, but it seemed as if the writers expected you already knew them. they would go through peculiar activities without explanation or even a clue what they meant. this is just one of those movies that says about one thing and it's something completely different.
