There are some bad movies. Most of them are quite fun. "Criminal Crazy 1" was one of those rails. So bad that it was enjoyable and was worth it again. "Criminal Crazy 2" must be one of the worst films ever made and come from me that says a lot because I am not the person to say something is the worst. But trust me, it was just totally awful and only works 1 hour is 1 hour too long. <br /> <br /> The film has a rather inconsistent story, but who cares about the story when all you want to see is a big fat woman who runs on killing people because she is not fed. Well, you can't see this movie except for all the first sequential sequences. The new story could have been really funny when Ethel was sent half way and all was murdered there, but nothing happens before the last 20 minutes of the movie and you are already sleeping in that place. <br /> <br /> The camera in this movie is just frightening. It literally reminds me of something I was with my friends when I was 15 years old. Sound quality is something else, because you don't understand the word most of the signs say. To show how bad it is, go to the New York subway and try to understand what the speakers are talking about, that's what this movie sounds like. Not that it is important what they are talking about anyway, because the actors are about as dry as a dead piece of wood. does not describe how bad this film is. If you don't believe me, look at it yourself. 1/10
