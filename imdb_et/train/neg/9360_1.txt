My score for this mess: 1/10 1 only for technical. Everything else is very bad. Another movie that makes no sense. It is clear that creating a good script for a movie or television is almost an impossible mission. While it is easy to understand why politicians never tell the truth, they are among the greatest liars on the planet, it is hard to understand how to make films so pathetic. <br /> <br /> We have to believe that taking people to the moor. Maybe it was a reason to believe, because 99% of the movies are crap. Because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios. <br /> <br /> If you look at the price we give to Oscars, we understand better why we continue to make the movies more ridiculous than others. <br /> <br /> And strangely enough, it was always pointless money. But it was not for education and health. <br /> <br /> If you still want to listen to it, press the super Fast Forward button (at least 20x).
