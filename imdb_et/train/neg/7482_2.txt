This movie is not so funny - the waste of such big stars that stand out so they forget. Only bright moments belong to John Cleese as a hotel manager who loves to dress up - you almost drop a helpless laugh from his chair when he dances to Donna Summer's "Bad Girls", wearing high heels, a mink and a nice hat. Rest: DO NOT NOTE!
