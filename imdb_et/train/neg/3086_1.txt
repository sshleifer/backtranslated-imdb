I thought the "Stoned Age" was the worst film ever made ... I was wrong. "Hobgoblins" surpassed it in every sense I could imagine, and some I couldn't. "Stones of the Age" hated signs. In "Hobgoblins" I hated participants ... and everyone else who was involved in creating this cruelty. I didn't add a teaser to this movie, I'm not so cruel. I could not put such torture on innocent people, like myself. In fact, the plot of the plot associated with this film is pointless and humiliating. The words I would use to describe this movie are: Insipid, Asinine and resourceful. <br /> <br /> Finally, don't look at this movie. I ask you, from one movie lover to another ... no, from one person to another, PLEASE. For your own peace of mind and intellect DO NOT SEE. Destroy all the copies you come across.
