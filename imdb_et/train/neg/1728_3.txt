**** Do not read this review if you want the "Crater Lake Monster" shocking conclusion to be a complete surprise **** <br /> <br /> The depth of the crater lake will increase slip. Destroy the local redneck group, not to mention the fast back and forth button. To summon the "Crater Lake Monster", it is obvious that the amateur is overestimated. If you are not a fan of low budget movies, you probably wouldn't look for the first time here. <br /> <br /> The film's problem is that if there is no monster, it really sucks and goes somewhere. The script is very Ed Wood-ish, because it is perfectly established as it creates the main sequences of action. "Crater Lake Monster" is nothing surprising. This explains its dinosaur, when the meteoric Count Crater Lake emerges, "overheats" with water to the point where it incubates the dinosaur egg, which has probably been on the bottom of the lake for millennia. Even if we could agree that the egg could have been lying there for so long and uncovered and viable, would "overheating" such high temperatures cause most of the lake to evaporate? Other than a symbolic mist in one or two scenes, we don't see any evidence that the water is hot except for some script lines. <br /> <br /> The script is probably cushioned with some sequences and it does everything to get the characters around the lake to be intimidated. A couple who just passes the car and if their car is cared for, they decide to rent a boat and drive to Lake Crater. Hmmmm ... do you think these strangers could be there to get our title to a monster? In a sequence that is just odd, a drunken alcoholic crush is crushed and decides to kill a cashier and bystander instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of bottle. Jumps in the car and I don't know ... they reach the lake. Food time for Cratey! Yes, it is not difficult to understand and you are so far ahead of the script that you are upset when it takes another ten minutes for these scenes to open. <br /> <br /> It's all shameful. love, and i really want like "The Crater Lake Monster". I just can't do that. It's not enough to go on, and it's more of a movie to put on during the party because you could talk about it and it wouldn't matter. <br /> <br /> The film has a thin list of things the most important of which is the dinosaur itself, which appears in three forms: a shadow doll, a large model head that is pulled out of wood through water, and a fully realized claymation entry that really looks pretty good . There are also a couple of lovable cages and they carry the most deliberate humor in the film. The end result is that we mourn the death of both the monster and one of our beloved hicks so that the good thing about this movie is dead at the end. Why was this conclusion so influenced? Was it a grieving song that was played over the final credit? Or did I just cry internally for the time I watch such movies?
