This is another typical incredible and non-sensitive Hollywood piece. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, like Snake Pliskin in the business game, convinces me he was better at baseman. Ray Liotta as a psychotic policeman is completely predictable and absurd. Madeline Stowe is her ordinary carton herself and does little to be a convincing victim. <br /> <br /> The scene of each of these peripheral slabs is completely predictable all the way to the end when Kurt affects Ray's vase or anything by tapping it down and out. Kurt and Madeline then make the end of their compulsory film, and everything except Russell and Stowe know that Liotta is back in pairs and threatens the pair. <br /> <br /> He does, of course, and Russell drills him 10 times his 9mm, which was absolutely necessary. This film can also end up with a bludgeoning scene - it is REQUIRED that Hollywood hints at unnecessary violence, and the more they can add or "strengthen", the more they are fools.
