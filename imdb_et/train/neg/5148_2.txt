This picture is terribly wrong, starting with a script that is both obvious and redundant. Courtney Cox plays a comic artist who escapes into a small desert after being raped in a big city. He has just met a local who seems to be quite relaxed (Craig Sheffer) and who seems to have tried the third Mickey Rourke imitation. D.B. Sweeny is a local policeman who is said to be defending and serving there. In the meantime, the script manipulates an audience who is actually a good man? The logic flies from the window in the first ten minutes and never comes back and there are more unanswered questions than it should be. If you think the wonderful Philip Baker Hall can save the "Blue Desert" then you are disappointed. His part is insignificant, like the whole film. - MERK
