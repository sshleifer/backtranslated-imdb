Much as we all love Al Pacino, it was painful to see her in this movie. The hacking of advertising, ending with what seems to be a unique and idealistic career, Pacino plays a part that is similar to a bed and attacks everyone with absolutely counterfeit and inconsistent southern heights. <br /> <br /> Primed spools in this way and with so many open ends and unlikely to remember the reels (and then retreat). <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger is there, not much. His scenes with Pacino are smooth and convincing. It's hard to believe they meant much to each other. There's no energy. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Leone made the screen light. He was electric and his scenes with Pacino were the most interesting in the film, but not enough to save Al's embarrassment.
