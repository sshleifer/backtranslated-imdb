Since I was eight, I've been a big wrestling fan. No matter what federation I looked at. WWE, WCW, USWA. I saw that I was watching it. May 23, 1999. It was my 19-year-old birthday. I ordered Edge and I was just waiting for a second review. But this time. I was wrong. Instead, this night was one of the best wrestlers who came out of Canada, a true man falling into the wrong trick because of his death. The situation cannot be changed much. But what happened to Owen's death made me very crazy. <br /> <br /> Rather, WWE decided to pay a fee for viewing and doing the right thing because WWE decided to protect what was first and it was money keeping it on pay per view going the way Owens's death ever happened. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you. Vince Mchmaon has made some stupid decisions in his life, but it was far from the stupid decision he ever made. <br /> <br /> And that shit saying that Owen would have wanted wage increases to continue. Leave me alone. When someone dies at the wage level, he looks at this way of thinking to stop it. It's like a policeman who lets a robber or a robber who runs and left a man to die so he can go home and call that day just like a man's life would never be important. <br /> <br /> What happens. Owen remains unanswered and thanks for the memories of all the times you gave us.
