Unfortunately, this review is the only spoiler that there is nothing to spoil about this movie. Even if B. Mattei had never done any masterpiece, she used her work with a bit of humor and craze that made her a fun director of Eurotrash. But in the last 10 years he seemed to have lost it. This film is just empty, not something that drops us after the first 10 minutes of deep sleep. There is no sex, no blood (it should be about snuff?), No participants, no dialogues, just as bad as the 90'TV movie. It is even worse than his last cannibals and zombies. into the mind forever, thanks to such unforgettable gems as: Zombie 3, Robowar, rats, l'altro inferno, viruses, cruel jaws and a few others. , give it over. Don't know this nice craftsman career after his old movies and have fun.
