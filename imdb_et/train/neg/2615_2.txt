I don't know why, but for some illness I think that since I've been to Disney, I just decided to go ahead and see 102 Dalmations. The first film, which was a remake of the Disney Cup, starring Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil, seemed a sure hit, but it was just a bomb. I think the reason these movies don't work is that 101 Dalmations, the original, was a comic, it just worked better and was more appealing to kids and adults alike. It wasn't really as fun as it is for adults running around, just trying to act like cartoons instead of real people. in the movie. And the Dalmations story isn't really that good. <br /> <br /> Cruella De Vil has been in jail for some time, but things are changing when she proves she loves animals now and is a pleasant person. But his reputation is now injured as a puppy-pillow, but he buys a man's shelter and is suddenly loved by everyone and seems to have changed. But when he sees his probationary Dalmatians, he goes crazy and starts seeing spots and losing it. She's back to puppies for revenge, and she's still determined to get it with Dalmation's hair she always wanted. but to be honest, this movie created a fun criminals just from a stupid nutcracker. It is also as cute as puppies, it works more for animation, it sounds stupid, but it's not as credible as the comic and their personalities are mixed. I really don't want 102 Dalmatians, that's fine, but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time, it's the same thing. <br /> <br /> 2/10
