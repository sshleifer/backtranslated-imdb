This book-based film is really terrible and disappointing. We look forward to it in six months. Many film reviewers hoped for it. It was also a big idea in newspapers and television. When it comes to April 29, many people noticed that the movie was really terrible. Why? First, the story was so monotonous. It's been a lot of undefined scenes, sometimes it's hard to figure out what's going on. The actors from Hulya Avsar were not aligned with their roles, especially Vildan Atasever. He works better in a comedy film, in this film, in a sort of drama, he couldn't eliminate his earlier role. And finally, the movie is too short, just 66 minutes.
