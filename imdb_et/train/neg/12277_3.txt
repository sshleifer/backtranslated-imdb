I found the "Arab Conspiracy" in a favorable binary and thought I discovered the lost treasure. People, there's a reason why you can't hear that movie a lot. The plot is muddy, the pace is slow, Cornelia Sharpe is about as alive as the usual, cold tofu and the end ends. Even Sean Connery won't save it.
