KING MAKER is undoubtedly successful in Thailand, where similar (but better) "Suriyothai legends" are set up by office registers. Lek Kitaparaporni's staged film after Sean Casey's scenario based on historical fact in 1547 Siam has some amazingly beautiful visual elements, but it is armed with one cornice, a pedestrian script, and movie story development. <br /> <br /> The picture with which the image is linked is the arrival of Fernando de Gamma (Gary Stretch), a Portuguese fortune, whose vengeance for his father's murderer leads him to shipwreck, caught and enslaved and placed in the Ayutthaya Kingdom of Siam. beautiful Maria (Cindy Burbridge) buys her with the consent of her father, Phillipe (John Rhys-Davies), who has a name and a past that comes when the story progresses. King and Fernando and his new Siamese tie Tong (Dom Hetrakul) are dropped on the ground after the king first releases his bodyguards when CGI has enhanced the choreographic foolishness of martial arts. (Yoe Hassadeevich) reveals his plot to kill the king and son to allow his lover, Lord Chakkraphat (Oliver Pupart), to take over the Siamese rule. Of course, Fernando and Tong are fleeing and have been condemned to fight with each other to save the lives of their families (Tong woman and children and Fernando now with firm love with Maria). <br /> <br /> (except John Rhys-Davies) is so weak that the film seems to be in the camp from time to time. Mostly, Thailand's cast is a struggle with poorly written dialogues that make us want to use their mother tongue with subtitles. Ian Livingstone's musical score sounds like an exhumed form of old TV soap operas. But if it is a visual glory, then you are a lot after that and it makes the film alone. It is a film that has obviously great financial support for all the special effects and masses of cast masses and shows its good intentions. It's just the basics that are missing. Grady Harp
