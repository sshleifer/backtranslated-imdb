The prerequisite for making such a film is the complete ignorance of Nietzche's work and personality, psychoanalytical techniques and the history of Vienna. Take a well-known genius that you haven't read, describe it as dementia, add her doctors to treat her, a couple of somewhat good-looking women, whose role is played by an actress with a huge mustache that every person speaks the most accent, show ridiculous dreams , add another prestigious figure that has nothing to do with the first (Freud), to mention some of the words used in genius work, exaggerate everything you get, especially music, and you're ready. Target audience, please stay away.
