My Lit. the class we just finished, Hatchet, and this movie is not such a book. (1) Brian never ate worms in the book. (2) He did not know the name of the pilot. (3) His mother deceived his father in a station wagon that was not in the woods where someone saw him. (4) The man the mother cheats is not black hair, he has a blonde. <br /> <br /> Now for the unrealistic parts of the movie: (1) Thirteen-year-olds can't beat their fists through a single punch window. <br /> <br /> And for the actress, Brian was played by a child's terrible actor. However, I believe that the scenery was impressive, although I doubt the director even reads the book. <br /> <br /> This movie is good if you haven't read the book Hatchet, Gary Paulsen, but if you have, then start the complainant's director.
