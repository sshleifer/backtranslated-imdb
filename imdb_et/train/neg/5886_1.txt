If I hadn't had the people I liked it, I would have left the movie halfway. The film is based on real incidents, but it is so upright that it did not really know reality. I have a psychological background, a lot of psychotherapists, and I really feel insane people, so it's not that such people do not exist. But the only person in the film who seemed to be a constant man was Augusen's father (Alec Baldwin) and the young Augusten (Jack Kaedin). (Although Evan Rachel Wood was an intriguing deviation - a very sexy and evil fun feeling). There were some fun moments, but the overall tone of the movie was gloomy, odd and nasty. What is outstanding cast waste! When I looked at how they were going through my turns, I felt like I was looking at a working class. At the time of the credit, it was brought home when a few people sat there, not sitting, not to mention. These moments were entertaining as the previous 2 hours.
