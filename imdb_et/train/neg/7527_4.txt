There are so many stupid moments in the "Death Tower" / "Death Game 2" that you really don't know if it's a scam. Sometimes I seemed to look at Kung Pow rather than Bruce Lee's film. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie is "all dead". If this is something, it is another "Enter the Dragon" yet again, containing many elements of this movie - especially the actual material. Bruce Lee's character Billy Lo (apparently) examines his friend's sudden death and meets a film that remained with his daughter. When the body is stolen during the funeral (!), Billy is also killed and his dignified brother must be killed by both men. <br /> <br /> Tong Long stars as a brother Bobby Lo and in fact there is no charisma to wear the film. However, his fighting ability is very good. Bruce Lee obviously appears due to (more) deleted film material simply from the legacy cash. Saying that video is generally better than a "death game", but it doesn't stop the film from being confused. <br /> <br /> OK, so the fighting is really very entertaining (dare to say peace of mind) and make the movie at least traceable. But there are so many knee elements in this movie that it really carries your patience. First of all, is there a supposed villain who lives in his palace ... or is it a spiritual institution? Seriously, nutter eats raw fruit, the deer blood, bears the chain on the shoulder and owns some peacocks and lions (?!). This attempt to make him harsh and intelligent, but to give him a pity - you are waiting for someone to send him back to his room. <br /> <br /> In fact, this middle part is terrible and when the scene includes a naked whore and a lion suit I turned off. But I finished the movie and was kind of happy because I was fighting the end of the scene (much like "GOD") was the reason for watching it all. Although the story is embarrassing, this activity is very good and includes great choreographies. <br /> <br /> But even the finals will be destroyed if something was required. We were told that the tower of death was a pagoda that was upside down and underground. It sounded like Bruce Lee's original idea, where every fight is different. Could this be the originally planned death game? No! The movie should have been called "Generator Room of Death" because it is as far away as the tower. Yes, there were indeed one or two "different" styles ... there were foil-coated primers, a leopard-skinned man and a stupid monk. This is like Enter Dragon would never have been made when the plot was in poor imitation. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking once for a quick pace, but sometimes it's stupid. If it was meant, fine. Slightly up to restore the scene of this projector to "Enter Dragon".
