This film about the secret government testimonies and the covert use of covert and insecure hidden numbers by citizens could be a really interesting film. But for me it failed. I do not specify a lot of confusion, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the user "reluctantpopstar" will comment on this good description. <br /> <br /> But it wasn't for me. I found it to be slow, which would be okay, but it seemed that it didn't go anywhere. The observer is left in the dark with too many things to really get the grip of the film in some films, it can be argued that the filmmakers wanted to create thoughts and make the reasons unclear. I don't think this would be the case. <br /> <br /> With regard to the frequent long frames of two buildings that other users have often mentioned ... I see they have a point - they give the viewer time to get another drink without touching anything. And I suspect that many viewers would welcome the opportunity to get several drinks on board to get it through.
