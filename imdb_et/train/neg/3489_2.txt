It was my first and probably last Angelopoulos film. I was enthusiastic about it because it was Mastroianni, one of my favorite actresses, and was the movie Theo, of which I've heard a lot. The opening was promising, long-standing soldiers crossing the Albanian-Greek border. OKAY! but it was all. Nothing left. The film had big holes and I don't know what to mention. An old woman will appear to the journalist to write the main piece. during a long walk. It's like a 15-minute monologue, killing and patience with the audience, nothing happens on the screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, except for the old lady who says the story. All that is supposed to be shown in action, the old lady just said to the camera. In the moment, the television outlet bar. They turn around and start winter! Probably leakage on different days was leaking. Many problems in telling the story, it was absurd to irrational, never to style, asking the viewer questions that never got answers. Poor Mastroian, taking into account a role that lacked integrity or charm. On the other hand, as many Greeks or Albanians or the Balcan people agree, the films showed a lot of historical, ethnic, or politically incorrect situations to make "humanity" a movie red in another review. Much more to say, but there is no time to lose on a poor movie that wasn't a movie at all, but movie ransom and public money.
