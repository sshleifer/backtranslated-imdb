Lovely Eva Longoria Parker plays Katet, who dies after the ice gel crushes her before "I do" with the bride Henry (Paul Rudd). After two years, Henry hasn't moved yet and his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) is very concerned. Chloe arranges for Henry to talk to an attractive psychic Ashley (Lake Bell). Ashley must contact Kate's spirit, hoping to help Henry move on with her life. When the psychologist starts to lure Henry, Kate seems to be a ghost of stupidity. There are funny situations; but if you have seen trailers, you have seen the contents of the movie. Also in production: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. I personally thought Bell stole the exhibition from Parker. And Biggs is usually the back pain. However, this film was superfluous.
