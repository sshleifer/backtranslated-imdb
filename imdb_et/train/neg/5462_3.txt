This program bugs me! There's no sense of humor and it's too serious to call it "fun"! For me, it's just too educational! The characters are very stereotypical and unpleasant. The plots are redundant and morale is repeated over and over again. Where's that fun? I also feel it has been in the BBC for too long and there are too many broadcasts. Does it really have to be on T.V every 2 or 3 months when an entirely new show ends in episodes? I think it's time for the BBC to start back with their older exhibitions: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, Raccoons, and Count Duckula, who are not constantly giving new contracts! I thought the BBC would bring back a dangerous mouse, so what's going on? 3/10
