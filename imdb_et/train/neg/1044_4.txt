"Victor Vargas Raising" is one of those lightweight family movies that you can watch and do at the same time N.Y. Times Crossword. And if you want to go to taco and Corona cuisine, you don't have to stop the DVD. Just let it roll, because you won't lose anything really important. There are no turns or tensions. It's not really an ethnic film, it's a film about a poor and difficult family of immigrants, Latino. They could be any ethnic groups. It made little difference. I saw it all zillion times before. Just connect a Jewish family, an Italian family, a black family or an Irish family. Only accents and names were different. If Vargas's family was named Bush or Clinton and were presbyteries, the film would have been complete. <br /> <br /> It's funny that the critics here didn't get straight. Some said it was Harlem in Spain. Some of the Bronx and the other are Brooklyn. As a lifelong New Yorker, I am voting in favor of the Lower East Side. And it seemed that the family never met anyone except the Latinos. They lived in an isolated / isolated small enclave. Some relationships with non-Latin people may have created some excitement, interest, or tension. Remember the West Side story? <br /> <br /> And cinematography is often criticized by now. I don't know if it was my TV or what, but all the indoor shots seemed to me very ORANGE. Apt, furniture and faces were all ORANGE. What did that mean? If apt. it looked pretty narrow to me. Someone here mentioned that the old aptids / rentals had very large rooms. Well, maybe 50 years ago. What landlords have done is to break one big roof into two or three very small and squeeze as many migrants as possible. <br /> <br /> And another annoying thing .... This is the second family movie I saw and criticized this week, showing a teenage boy "jerking out". Is this a private sex act necessary to watch? Please save me! What are their directors? <br /> <br /> So "Victor Vargas" is a nice little movie. It was a great change to see the young Latino actors break down and show their talents what they did. But the writers shot them down, giving them a solid and uncertain script. Enjoy the show, but keep your fingers button fast.
