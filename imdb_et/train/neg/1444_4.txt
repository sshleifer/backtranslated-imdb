The film is very long and unfortunately completely different from the novel. If you want to see a movie, don't read the novel first because it will shock you. However, cinematography is OK and if you are the person who loves the adventure genre that explores Africa, go to it. Effective performances are sufficient, but many important events that were in the novel are excluded. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was looking for his missing brother, not his father looking for a lady. Gagool was clever and killed in the cave, while here he was shown to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king.
