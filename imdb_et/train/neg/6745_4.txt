It's a low budget "Scream" style movie. "Maddy" is a new employee in a noticeable office where she meets and starts a relationship with her co-worker, Chris. During a hot bathing party, Chris and his friends, Maddy, are persuaded that they belong to the Murder Club, where everyone has killed someone to beat. When Maddy loses it and kills someone real, hijinks will follow. <br /> <br /> The film looks good and there are the necessary conditions for this genre and budget level (nudity, gore, maybe a few larger stars than cast), but after you roll the credit, you ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes looking at your life.
