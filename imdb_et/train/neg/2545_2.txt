That's definitely a laugh in this movie. Michael Keaton is a talent and he used to be funny (before he decided he was a serious actor). But what so much disturbs me about this movie is how virtually all the characters are unlikely. In addition to the two main drivers, everyone is a jerk. I mean, these small town losers are as close as you can. You just look and think, man, these losers should be unemployed. What's more, the American factory worker is depicted as a lazy and ungrateful slob. It made me wonder whether this film was made by Japanese nationalists. Oh, sure they'll all come together, but I just didn't get that trip.
