The DVD version consists of two episodes centered on Caesar Parricide. In addition, the language was Spanish without subtitles. So I have a hard time reviewing this movie because I didn't understand what was said. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra is a historical icon, this part is very difficult and I found that the newcomer, Leonor Varela, plays easily. He is a strongly deliberate but also very supportive, gentle soul player. Thimothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect and their romance is the main thing in the first episode. So, it's not really a documentary or a peplum, but a great love story. <br /> <br /> After parricide, a new lover (Marc-Antoine) arrives, but the taste is gone: we always remember our first love. So, I found a second episode of boredom and their tragic fate is not spoken strongly. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, production is luxurious: the kits are large, tastefully decorated; Moroccan residence is exotic and wardrobes are great. The manufacturer certainly has a lot of money, but they do not spend anything on special effects. They are so poor (blue screens, ships, Sphynx) that it's funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to hear it in French or English to make a final opinion on these two films.
