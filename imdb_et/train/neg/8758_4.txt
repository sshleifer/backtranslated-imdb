Not a film, but a synchronization of the lips with a collection of performances that were part of the British invasion that followed the dynamic entrance of the Beatles into the music world. Some of these actions didn't make a big splash on this pond side, but many of them did. Recommended are: Herman's Hermits, Billy J. Kramer and Dakota, Peter and Gordon, Honeycombs, Nashville Teens, Animals and of course the Beatles. <br /> <br /> It's so fun to watch these young deeds before they grind and polish their actions.
