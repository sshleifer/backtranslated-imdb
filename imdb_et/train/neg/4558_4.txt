Frankly, I was disappointed with the "expiration date". Super smart title and interesting assumption, but I don't think it's delivered. What was that? Does the main character want to get in touch with his Native roots again? Or more likely his need to overcome his death. But he was not created as someone who has lived his life in fear - his life seems to be doing well, but as the approach is approaching, he should now worry. I didn't buy it. In the meantime, the characters supporting the movie do not seem to have the needs to blend the overall story. They all did their thing, running in parallel with basic education. What was considered a "curse" also seemed to be a coincidence. Who the damned family? Why? When? Finally, why did he not stop his day on his birthday in his apartment? These are my criticisms, but I loved the Seattle shots, the cinematography was beautiful, the action was good at a time when it was not prominent.
