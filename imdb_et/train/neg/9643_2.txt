Below the average movie, which has music with poor music? Conventional script and direction full of errors. Salman Khan was in his usual way. Ajay's performance deteriorated over time as his appearance, especially his styles like Rock Star, were pathetic. Asin was just an exhibition. In general, I felt like wasting my movie. Salman Khan remains as immature as Aamir Khan 10 years ago. There were many songs in the movie, except "Man Ko Ati". The most important song that impressed the British music sponsor was the most impressive. "Khanabadosh" understands English music sponsor very well. The second movie I saw last week was "Wake Up Sid", which was a simple slow love story with good direction and action despite average music
