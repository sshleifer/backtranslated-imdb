This movie is a terrible waste. Although it is only an hour and a half, it seems somewhere close. I've never seen the film so slowly and without purpose. It's also a "horror" movie that takes a lot of time in daylight. My friend and I laughed a lot when we were supposed to be scared. <br /> <br /> The only thing we want to know is why so terrible film appeared in so many countries. It cannot be so much in demand. <br /> <br /> Supermodel Nicole Petty should remain modeling because she is beautiful, she lost her movie so many times, half of the time she is British and half of her time is American.
