..This is ON! Very cool premise, right off the bat. <br /> <br /> There is an excellent first scene, you need to give credit if the credit term is sufficient. <br /> <br /> He has a definite character and a sufficient scenario for the ghost story, but here are those that disturbed me: when the ghosts appeared, what I really liked; how it was done, how it seemed ... the only thing was the ghost relationship. Because the way things fell in the first scene, their dynamics would be different. <br /> <br /> Things slowed down a bit too much in the middle, and I felt the crab / spider scene was just not good. But then the end is really good! Of course, "The Grudge" basically talked about the same story with a polished lens, but not a samurai, and that was what I liked about this movie. <br /> <br /> Please, someone with tempered style will make this movie again. <Br /> <br /> "Silent Rage" fans love this movie.
