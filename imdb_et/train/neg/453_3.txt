Ok, first good: Cher's performance and cinematography. Although I'm not a Cher fan, he gives excellent performance and his part was well written. The cinema was well done and captures the romance. The rest: a thin plot, Nicholas Cage's presentation and a totally uncomfortable and weak attempt to portray an Italian-American family from New York. First of all, whenever Cage opened his mouth, I was timing. I don't know what kind of accent he used. To be honest, it is not certain that the New York or Italian accent I've ever heard. It was quite surreal. And it wasn't because I was certain his voice just in the ears. And I like Nicholas Cage's other performances. Secondly, and it is purely anecdotal, but I have a lot of Italian relations, friends and acquaintances in New York, and frankly, I'm more laughing and more joyful about recognizing the Italian ethnic family than this film. And that would be a boring evening at the house. What to let.
