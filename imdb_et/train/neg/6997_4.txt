I looked at it with a growing sense of restlessness. Why should Ian Hunter shape God help these people escape from Devils Iceland? And what did he do there first? I know I know God works in a mysterious way, but helping thieves and murderers and prostitutes find redemption, forgiveness, and heart changes in such a godly place .... In any case, it is hardly a pleasant film. No matter what Gable is missing during the competition, the portrait of this independent man is incomplete, Crawford is as pleasing as ever, as he was to me, not at all, and the overall look of the film seems to be like it was made 10 Compared to the inconvenience of films like "Stagecoach" "and" Mr. Deeds Goes to Town ", it seems prehistoric.
