Rajinikanth was born again after the magical power he can use seven times. <br /> <br /> There are a number of problems with this film that are obvious to the casual audience: the 50-year-old Rajinikanth is still at home with his parents; the girl's father thinks she is a convincing "boy" ("copper karmaa paiyan"); Rajinikanth suddenly interrupts the film with his sermons, the worst thing is how yesterday's women got their lives through housework - but we have to believe that he is not the other; although he had read well, he wasted six of his seven powers on the dragon; I can go ahead, but you get the picture. <br /> <br /> It is divine, there are gods and is Rajinikanth. It is difficult for the catalog to install Rajinikanth in one of these categories. Initially, Rajinikanth is just a Rajinikanth who makes Tamil heroes - upright against the rogues, and despite being the oldest, the most beautiful girl in the movie worships. Rajinikanth does it well and some Rajinikanth brand styles are actually enjoyable - "Baba count" is new. What makes this film intolerable is that these few initial minutes are only the foreword of the worst book. Even in the foreground, there are some comedies that are forced and obvious. <br /> <br /> Director doesn't explain hero's goal; we see that the hero is facing a number of obstacles (politicians, as usual), but we can't root the hero because we don't know what the hero's ultimate goal is. At the end, when everyone wants him to be a leader, the hero gives one more of his preaching and walks in private. The director does not solve the problem at the peak. <br /> <br /> The result of Mr Rehman is really interesting. Does he show the perfection of brilliance or does he bother to invest in this film - who can blame him. There's one scene where Rajinikanth steps into a wagon bath and then throws a knife and starts counting his baby. Music is currently very suitable and acts as a catalyst that adds tension. Songs are all mediocre, no one could disturb the songs in a few years. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is 1 lowest rank that you can set in IMDb. This movie has all the elements that justify its legitimate position in IMDb ranking.
