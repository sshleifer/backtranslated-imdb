This is not the worst film I've seen on Peter Greenaway, but it's close. This nuisance goes into even worse pillow books. The director's 3 films I've seen have found them all unhappy. Like The Cook ..., regardless of the positive cinematic flowering it displays, the reluctance of his material and overall performance has been completely eliminated.
