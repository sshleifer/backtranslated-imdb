Boy, what was this mess. But it only takes an hour and I only paid for living ... unlike all the 1933 clunker pain that is now dust. <br /> So the small village starts with the bodies that have become empty from the whole blood. Of course, the local yokels start talking about vampires and a little more loud after finding each body. The township or constable or whatever it is, played by the fantastic actor Melvyn Douglas, tries to tell them otherwise. When he mentions the fact that the dead is one big hole on each side, instead of the two holes above the two, the locals say it is a giant vampire belt. Constellation demands that vampires don't exist and that it must be a human culprit who kills. <br /> <br /> But Melvyn doesn't seem too bothered. Faye Wray plays his sweetheart in a pantaloon. Also in this mix, Dwight Frye played the town's simpleton, which is how he seemed to play the same role in every movie he did. He was out of townspeople trying bats and drinking his blood. Lionel Atwill plays an urban physician who seems to be trying to settle the offense. And the boy does it he never smells like an actor. It's just as close to the priest in this role as he could get. And Lionel Barrymore is also this thing .... many great names have such a pile of guano. Except for this terrible title that this movie is, the subtitle "Blood Sucker" is much better, this film is also dull and plodding and just silly. <br /> <br /> For me, this high point of view of the movie is watching Frye, he reaches out to a strange city, but besides him it didn't offer much. And when you know the cause of strange deaths and you see a special effect that needed all that blood. really strikes down. <br /> <br /> Bela Lugosi made a lot of terrible pictures, but at least she was fun and interesting to watch. this movie as a really bad Lugosi clunker without Lugosi and you can feel how bad this mess is bad. <br /> <br /> If you can't make a good 1930 horror movie, put it in at least Lugos.
