A number of children created a theater to get a nightmare marathon. But when it comes to the night, there is one among them who kills them one by one. Who is this ... and why? I saw it on the theater in 1991. I was waiting for it - but boy! It didn't work at all. The premise is good, they have a very attractive young man and some pluses like Dee Wallace Stone, but it doesn't work. The story ends halfway through thinking (this may be due to some major editing before the movie appeared), killings are relatively bloodless (how it got beyond the R-rating), and killing the killer at the end was boring and stupid. <br /> <br /> It's really too bad - this movie was potential. With a better script, it would have become a big horror movie. Because it's mostly forgotten and it seems embarrassing (I heard Stone wasn't talking about it). I'll give it to 3 and it's just cast.
