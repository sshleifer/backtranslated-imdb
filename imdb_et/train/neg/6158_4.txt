One time in the mid-1990s, I wrote DOCTOR WHO on fanzines and the entire fandom soul on a new American-made DOCTOR WHO TVM. As soon as it was announced that the enemy of the doctorate was going to play the master with Eric Roberts, everyone scratched his head and shouted "Who is Eric Roberts?". I should note that this was before the IMDB came into the network, if all you had to do was name this website to continue, but one useful soul wrote in the publication I wrote to explain that Eric Roberts was the best known role, where he saw F Murray Abraham, the film called by the caller and was about a boundary school. In fact, Roberts is best known for the GREENWICH VILLAGE POPE and RUNAWAY TRAIN, but it did not stop both Roberts and the RING and his mindset that the American Master, along with his southern line, was attacking. Strangely enough, fans were furious when playing Roberts, but after they saw DOCTOR WHO TVM, many fans (Myself among them) thought Robert's performance was the best thing in disappointing American production <br /> <br /> Yeah I `m digressing, but the WORD was a movie I wanted to see just because it was the first time I heard Eric Robert's name, but I had no chance of seeing it until the end of this weekend and I was quite disappointed with it. I don't know anything about the fence (all others on this page seem to be obliged to mention whether they are fences or not. I don't help) so I don't know exactly how all this is, but as mentioned, the film seems somewhat anachronistic even when You saw it in your release in 1991, hairstyles appear a few years old with their mixed teenage pain, doing a little dance routine that makes you wonder if it would have worked much better if it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer in the mid 1980s. You could argue that this would have meant a relationship between Max Suba and Alexander Villard, who has turned off most of the movies, but I was not convinced of their love / hate relationship, and Abraham and Roberts have produced much better results before and after the WORD.
