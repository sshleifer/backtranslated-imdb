Very rarely do I give the IMDb a less delightful show or film, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are just so dreadful, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't have thought if it had been an animated series - I'd be as good as I think, but as an example of a live show, it's termed "cheesy" and "campy." That's Power Rangers. Five multi-colored spandexs that carry teenage battle evil using their martial arts skills. Costumes are terrible - they look like something that reminds us which races and athletes and female gymnasts would wear. Acting is terrifying and the fighting choreography is so shockingly bad and so sneaky to watch, it makes Jean-Claude Van Damme as good as Bruce Lee, which is in itself underestimated. In fact, they look like they jump and dance; as it was a version of "Nutcracker", or they made ballet rather than a fight. Besides, there are some caricatures that have strong martial arts, but it is done in a fun but not so cheery way that makes it stupid. <br /> <br /> Children show or not, it's just on the edge of both flat and absurd. And although this version has been placed in America, you may be forgiven for the idea that if you look at some of the combat sequences they are not in the US, but rather filmed in Japan; thus, the counterfeit combat and film material was somewhat borrowed from the Japanese version only to the US version. <br /> <br /> If you like this thing, confirm the equivalent of Senta-Japan.
