I was looking forward to seeing Amanda Beet in a good second after I rented a "Nine Yard" recently - by the way, it is worth renting, but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> The "Whipped" trailer was somewhat funny and the plot about three flooded New Yorkers twenty something that all fell and manipulated by the charming lady Beet. So, in the afternoon, I persuaded two friends to come with me to this movie. This review is my repentance. In the first law, we have three guides that describe their conquests at dinner. What should have been funny or at least say it is quite pathetic. Was there a quality of redemption for the three men and their meetings that we had to get out of? <br /> <br /> [And although I don't mind movies that are cheerfully vulgar, I wondered why no one in the canteen turned around when the studs spoke loudly about sexual and schematic data. Do they do it every week in the same canteen? You think someone would complain. Wait, wait, I forgot: two other eateries in one scene. But it's just a punchline setting. Everyone else is deaf at the dining place.] <br /> <br /> The second act has all three plaques that all fall for Mia, and then brain tumors develop, who don't ask each other or what's actually going on between them. And I asked myself if the studs were acting like they were, what redemptive qualities he sees in them to stay with them for more than one day? Does he start the brain? I was hoping that Eric's character, a married friend, would get more than just a tedious punching bag in this law. His job is to clearly advise on marriage. But why do they even worry about talking to him if they don't talk to each other? And his advice? Sheeesh! <br /> <br /> The third action solves the plot, but by then I watched my watch. My friends said they were still waiting for something really funny and I had to agree. All the explaining scenes were enough and were able to explain all the questions and mysterious dialogs throughout the film, but we just checked them out of the list. ("Oh, okay, that's why Brad did that and Jonathan says it and ...") <br /> <br /> What we did came from the plot's stupidity as something entertaining. Even the exits made during the credits were not very funny. Ultimately, I missed something except the desire to warn people about this movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3
