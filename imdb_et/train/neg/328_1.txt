I'm a huge fan of Adam Sandler and one day I looked at Cast & Crew's choices on one of his DVDs and saw "Going Overboard" and decided to go out and rent. So I went with some friends and rented it. We put it on and we were shocked to see Adam Sandler, who was not yet in puberty, he looks like 12 years old when that movie came. I couldn't even look at this 30-minute view, I didn't laugh, smiled or even smiled at the movie. In fact, the only time I smiled when I saw the fear was this movie. I couldn't believe how hard he was trying to laugh in the movie ... and it didn't work once. Although we saw terribly horrible corners of the camera and heard a nasty script, I realized why I've never heard of this movie because it sucks more than anything that has ever been sucked. This movie was, in my opinion, a WORST movie EVER made, .... EVER!
