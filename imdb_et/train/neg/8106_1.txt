Seriously, why do American and Frech actors say they are Czech, to speak of perfect English with a fake Russian accent? I'm a man, so I enjoyed free nudity - but the soft porn movie would have more, and at least it would not make it artistic. <br /> <br /> All the political statements that painfully didactic - did the director hear about the fineness? The action was also woody and melodramatic, and the comic relief was never funny. The characters were very low and I couldn't identify them at all. <br /> <br /> The little I did was laughing when they cut out the archive material of Prague Prague demonstrations and they were black and white and then sepia to match the film - just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I read a lot of Kundera's short stories (not the lightness of the immortal creature) and her writing style has good things (although her themes are one big male fantasy) - and I have to say that the film didn't convey the goodness of the Kunderas style.
