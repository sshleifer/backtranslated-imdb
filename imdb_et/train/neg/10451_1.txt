I'm sick and tired of all these little weenies that talk about how to "talk" this movie. This is pure CG CRAP! Don't send Assassin, it's more sensible to smuggle hundreds of colorful, aggressive, poisonous snakes! The only reason people like this movie is because they feel they have to do it. It's not "as bad as it is good" It's so bad that I can stick to a sharp stick. I honestly thought it was COMEDY like AIRPLANE! Fraud! I was wrong. It's all over, "It sucks, get it!" Or Samuel A. Jackson shouts, "Snakes on the plane! Things. Well, I'm sorry, I can't get it. The bunch of wimps seems to have given the film industry more money to do more movies like Triple X and Die Hard If you spend money watching a movie in the company of the same people who bought the William Hung CD, you are still living in your mother's basement and the plastic chair sweat smack on the computer that plays online games and watches porn, hurry to the theater and ask one (because I doubt you have a girlfriend) ticket to snakes in the stupid backdrop to hell with movies like Full Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 Monkeys, Clerks, etc. There is no irony in watching good movies, the true fall of western civilization, calling it a cult film is an insult to a true classic of culture like Repo man or even Orgazmo.
