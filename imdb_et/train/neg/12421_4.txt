Mark Pirro "Deathrow Gameshow" 1987 is a black comedy that in many parts is extremely cheesy, but sometimes very funny. This movie would certainly have been much better, the action is terrible, and some very fun scenes are occasionally hard to track, but the concept is funny and has some fun moments. <br /> <br /> In the near future (1991) games have changed. Chuck Todean (John Mc Cafferty) is organizing a live show called Live Or Die, where convicted deaths prisoners have the opportunity to play for their lives and money. Candidates who fail will be filled with air by a variety of methods, such as guillotines, electric chairs, and other stranger fillers, followed by applause from a cheerful studio audience. The exhibition is of course more than controversial and Chuck has made many enemies ... <br /> <br /> "Deathrow Gameshow" is incredibly funny and dirty in many respects, and the actor is terrible but undoubtedly fun in many parts, especially if you are a dark humor fan. You have not forgotten anything if you have not seen it, but it is definitely a funny and good time. 4/10
