What has Ireland ever done to distribute films so they would like to represent the country so pejoratively? This film begins as a plot of cinema students in Irish cinematic clichés: unpleasant priests, spitting before handshakes, urban cattle, cycling with meadows in the background of anodic folk music. But it quickly turns out that the main theme of the film is the great Daddy-O religious contradiction of the Irish clichés. It concerns a Protestant woman who wants to decide where her Catholic father's child is educated, which seems to be quite a reasonable wish, though not for the 50th villagers of Wexford County with whom she must live. Instead of sending them to a Catholic school, he decides to go to Belfast, then to Scotland, where there are still a few clichés. Though he is there, his father (who looks like George Lucas) and the family back home is a boycott, which becomes very disgusting. I'm not going to end this, not because I think people should watch this movie, but because it's not very interesting. One of the problems associated with the film is the central character: we should be compassionate about it, but ultimately encourage him to live. Villagers are introduced as bigots whose prejudices should stand, but the trauma of your children seems to be an inappropriate way to do so. In addition, it takes the burden it deserves by analogy with the current peace process in Northern Ireland: his lawyer tells her that she must "secure the preconditions for her return". The film is based on a supposedly real story, but its themes have been dealt with much more conceptually and, to a lesser extent, pent-up clichés were used earlier.
