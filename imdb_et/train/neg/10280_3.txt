Did HeidiJean really see this movie? Great Christmas movie? Not even close. Bored, blissful, and totally inadequate imagination and heart. I watched this movie, wondering who the hell thought Carly Pope could play in this movie! The woman has no identifiable personality and it gives a perfect result. Baransky was traditionally superb and made all the things interesting. Probably his involvement was the only reason why this project was green. Maybe I am waiting too much for a lifetime movie that was played for 15 days at Christmas, but I sat through it, thinking that another director and JJ with an actor who could at least have had compassion could have been a pretty cute little movie.
