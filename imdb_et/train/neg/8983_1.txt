Ulises is a literary teacher who arrives in a coastal city. There she fell in love with Martina, the city's most beautiful girl. They start the terrible romance that ends with the tragic death of Ulis at sea. A few years later, Martina is married to the city's richest Sierra and lives in a peaceful, peaceful life. One day, Ulish's revelation makes her passion and act without consequences. The plot is completely absurd and no participant gets a decent part. In addition, three-quarters of the movie has sexual acts that are still well filmed, quite tiring, as we want to see the story more. It's just a bad Bigas Luna movie with lots of sex, no argument and stupid characters everywhere.
