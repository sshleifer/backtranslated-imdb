I grew up watching and loving TNG. Just recently I finished the whole series of ST Voyager on the DVD, which I could feel with this episode because the difference between style and approach between the two shows cannot be sharper. The idea might have been good if it was used as an opportunity to further expand Riker's character, so it would probably be treated with VOY. They could have shown the memories that would be "new" to the audience, not just the revival of old exhibition clips. The entrances and exits between the "memories" and the "present" of this episode begin as clich√©s at the beginning and very quickly become intolerable when the tired pattern goes on and on. The bar is never the worst episode.
