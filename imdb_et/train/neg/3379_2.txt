I recently bought a DVD, forgetting how much I hated the version of A Chorus Line. Any change made by the director Attenborough's story failed. <br /> <br /> Director-Cassie's relationship with such a remarkable change made the entire musical ensemble a window. <br /> <br /> Some musical numbers are growing and rushing. The hit of the exhibition gives the whole meaning a break when it is given to a Cassie character. <br /> <br /> The overall performance is very self-conscious. <br /> <br /> The only reason I get it 2 is that some big numbers are still able to enjoy, despite the movie's attempt to push all that joy and spontaneity out of it.
