The real shame of "gathering" is neither badly acting nor a despicably low plot. The real shame is that it was much worse than what it started, although it had one of the main attractions: Takashima. I would like to see Laurel Takashim in the room of Susan Ivanova even for five minutes. He has this sarcasm, that mind, the two-blade personality that is fluctuating and lovable at the same time. Unfortunately, the Babylon 5 pilot film has an incredibly boring story that includes murder. Patricia Tallman - who has never returned to the series much later - thankfully, she got much better than Lyta Alexander, who is a bit more than a little, tiring telepathy. I leave you with one final thought - why is it that Delenn looks like some kind of outer space (although she is a woman)? I thank heaven for seeing the Minbar show later.
