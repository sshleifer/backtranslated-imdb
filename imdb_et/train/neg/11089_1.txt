A pretty good movie, but not a real story. <br /> <br /> Ruby's Hurricane Carter was a notary liar, murder and was never found guilty. The state of New Jersey just did not go for the third time 20 years had passed. Carter received an offer in 1976: "Go False Test and Release". He didn't take it. This movie should never have been done, but the money was talking. Many people have spent their lives in prison and no doubt more black than white. Why choose a fake story? <br /> <br /> Jens
