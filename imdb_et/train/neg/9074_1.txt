Another area of ​​venture capital is a teen-teen comedy set on a college campus with coolness in a nervous endeavor, and how he decides to blackmail the popular river trio to become a girl. All of this has been done in the past and it has been done in a much more satisfying way. Such popular humor that has earned merit such as "American Pie" and "Dude! Where's my car" is so popular is taken out completely from this context, appearing so completely random that the viewer can only frown and not. The film is poorly written and the actors will never be able to make it even easily tolerated. I will not lose this terrible image by publishing it because it is a waste of my time and your time. At best, Slackers will never be able to laugh or induce laughter, and in the worst case, it will be annoyingly bad and sometimes totally unobtrusive. <br /> <br /> Jason Schwarzman, who impressed his debut at Rushmore, is humbling himself in this picture and wondering how his career can reach the toilet so quickly. Please do not avoid, please. Save your money.
