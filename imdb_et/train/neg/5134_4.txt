SCARECROWS seems to be surprised by the horror that corresponds to the supernatural film. A group of offenders pulls out a paramilitary like a robbery in Camp Pendleton, California. They raise a pilot and his daughter's abducted cargo plane with demands to fly to Mexico. Along the way, one greedy robber decides to save money by landing on peas with the appearance of strangers. Not only are they mills, they can kill. Operation is no better than terrible dialogue. And humor is not funny. Very low budget and fully captured in the dark. <br /> <br /> Cast: Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Kristina Sanborn, B.J. Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian.
