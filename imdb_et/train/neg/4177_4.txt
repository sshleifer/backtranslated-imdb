Another movie box. Originally called Bloodsuckers, this movie was pretty average. In some parts it is boring, but there are some good effects, but they are not big. The film takes place in 2210. Vampires have taken over the world. V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation) Squad, which also has its own spacecraft and led by Churchill, received by vampires, receives a message from a team formed by Earth and Quintana (played by very hot Natassia Malthe)), Rookie officer Damian and rebels Rosa and Roman (Roman plays Aaron Pearl wrongly accused.) The V-SAN will later meet the vampire Muco leader, played by Michael Ironside Total Recall. He has no plans to live peacefully with people because he has bowed to the rule of the world. Although this movie was not a waste of time, I doubt I will soon return to the DVD player.
