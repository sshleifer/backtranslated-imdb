I give credit to the writer / director William Gove for finding someone who finances this malicious "thriller". The good argument that unsolicited money for HBO is not wasted, not to mention buying DVDs on cover art and blurbs. Pedestrian Dennis Hopper and Richard Grieco add something important to their pursuit, although the artistic direction is not half bad. Dialogue leaves you admiring your understanding; this is the worst of narration. Tension, tension, fear, fear, empathy, catharsis, nothing. Some attractive and often naked women pray for boredom, but this is definitely the film that is best viewed as a trailer. I'm sorry that the man who thought it was green. Good late night, only for zoned viewing. You have been warned.
