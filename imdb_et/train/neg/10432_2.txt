A terrible end - and I can't believe Moore spent the year coming with it. The tastes of Mr Hubbard and Dianetitsi, which Hubbard claimed were only three weeks. It was quite disappointing to throw my disks for the first 3.5 years. Now the first 1.5 hours were packed with the action, although they were absurd, and then the series worsened for a slow, painful, sophomoral ending. Unbelievable how slow and drawn that last hour was. Did we think deeper? When I would like a lesson of a-materialism, I read Daniel Quinni Ismaeli. Absolute to think that 38K people would give up just a "fresh start". Absurd to throw the lost Kara, and rediscover Baltar and Kuus. Absolute to throw in mitochondria. Just absurd.
