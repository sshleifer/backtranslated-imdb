This wretched film shows that even some of Gollywood's best can't save a real landfill dump. <br /> <br /> I could spend a lot of time describing everything that was bad about this effort, but it takes more time and I already have 91 minutes of interim ... IT. <br /> <br /> Looking at it now, after Brando's death, it shows how tragic one of our biggest actors is. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland? Why? <br /> <br /> In order to approve this, I have to complete more lines. I have to fill in more rows to receive it. I have to fill in more rows to approve it. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this movie. I'm late to do something interesting. Not.
