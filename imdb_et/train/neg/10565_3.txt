You can give it to JMS and boys, because they were at the beginning of their series and with a small budget, but the movie is still on the right. Don't get me wrong, the B5 series is by far the best TV series, but when I saw this movie, I wouldn't have ordered the series. I don't like O'Hare as an actor, costumes are stupid and have a lot of clutter. The same can be said for most of the first season (except for Babylon Square and Survivors); Bruce immediately set fire to the series and was an amazing spectacle. If you're a B5 fan and haven't seen this movie, look at it. If you have a B5 fan, don't ... you don't want to watch the series.
