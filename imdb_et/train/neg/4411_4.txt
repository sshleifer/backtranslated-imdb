Michael Rooker is a decent actor, but he has no leadership, except in a low budget movie. He doesn't really have much charisma. Ryo Ishibash has much more screen presence and unfortunately he is not really the main character. Most of the time on the screen goes to a brick rooker. <br /> <br /> Danielle Harris (from Halloween's 4 and 5 movies) plays with her daughter and she's cute and entertaining, but she's written as not too clever and one of her stupid mistakes can kill one of her main character. Comedians Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait and Stephen Furst have interesting roles here. Just looking at what happens to these characters is a priceless price. <br /> <br /> Vincent Schiavelli plays with Consigliare with a local mafia pair and it is hard to say whether he works as a comedy or not. Tim Thomerson is also in this movie. He seems to be in every very direct video movie with extremely low budget. Thomerson is also in some low-budget comedies. Seeing so many comics and comics in this movie, he felt himself as a scam. Is this a Yakuza movie parody? It is difficult to say at some points. Certainly there is very little Yakuza action. <br /> <br /> Casting on Thugs and Goons is threatening and well cast. Some of these films have Thugs that look like they work in a local Comic Book Store or as a stockpile for Piggly-Wiggly. In general, this film is very uneven. At some points it seems like a comedy or a parody. Then it works as a good movie at other points. Then it will end up to the end. Without the contribution of Danielle Harris and Ryo Ishibash, this film would value zero in my humble opinion.
