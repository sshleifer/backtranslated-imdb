Words can't describe how bad this film is. I can't just explain it in writing. You can see it yourself to catch up on the horror of the movie. Not that I would recommend doing this. There are so many clich√©s, mistakes (and all the other negative things you can imagine) that just make you cry. First of all, technically, there are a lot of mistakes in the airplane first. I don't list them here, but I just mention painting the plane. Even in the colors of a fictitious airline, they couldn't show the plane, but instead used 747 painted original Boeing shapes. Very bad. The plot is stupid and has been done many times, but much, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that I lost it prematurely. I was also in the movies by bad guys all the time, because the good guys were so stupid. The "Executive Decision" should undoubtedly be your choice, even if the "Turbulence" movies are better. In fact, every other film in the world is better than it.
