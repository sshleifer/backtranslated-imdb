Heather Graham could not convince a convincing lesbian if his life depended on it. Who film producers think they are? ABSOLUTE WORST, the most UNREALISTIC movie I've seen as long as I remember. This movie is so bad that I felt compelled to sign in to IMDb and make sure that this "movie" falls. <br /> <br /> omg I am Heather Graham, I just kissed a drunken chick, so when she's gone, I really want to pace my room for HOURS, asking herself "WHAT IS NOT?!" .. Jesus heather, get over and grow up ... and I would like to pass it on to knowing idiot producers ... and while I'm with it, instead of this movie, it's a pathetic excuse for the outgoing story, it would have been more appropriate to direct the character of the plot that is mentally unstable. .. like the nature of your so-called "lesbian" ... after all, you know that for the first time I had gay sex when I left next morning, jumping into the sky with excitement in the middle of the street ... honestly b * tch, get a handle ... < br /> <br /> WHAT'S ANYONE! and note that this flat flick has a lot more bugs and terribly foolish aspects, but i'm so sick of even thinking about it. bottom line, if you are a smart person, you hate this movie and if you are not a smart person then you will love it ... it's that simple.
