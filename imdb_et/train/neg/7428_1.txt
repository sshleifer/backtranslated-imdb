As usual, in IMDb, the majority of votes instead of "weighted average" is rather a movie entertainment value. In this case, the majority will give him one. How they are right! To begin my review, I first admit that I'm completely helpless about why this movie is called "Alien Intruder". It includes space and even an "alien" (I think), but in the long run there is no rhyme or reason (at all), at least the actual plot base or the resolution I can do anywhere. /> <br /> There are quite a few scenes that are so cruel (both in line, in timing and how they are spoken) that it goes beyond the strange feeling you get from watching very bad movies. I have no idea about this part at the beginning where electronic Bugs Bunny seems to be something. <br /> <br /> The "plot" covers only the area known as G-Spot. this is the G sector ... and a virtual reality program infected with some alien (?) virus. I think it's a stranger, because otherwise a normal Ariel image will appear in a photographic negative shape. <br /> <br /> For most movies, we see people coming through space weapons, falling from furniture and seemingly endless, meaningless shots of "Where's Ariel?", "Don't Find Ariel" (meaningless because most other shots INCLUDE communicates with Ariel, somehow - whatever) on a computer monitor. Commander Skyler (Billy Dee), sits and looks at the fantasy of each prison's VR program, hoping to find this alien virus and become one with him ... ??? Or maybe I missed something ... <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams took a few courses on "how to act desperately" before filming it. We know this because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers over his face and looking for grief. <br /> <br /> The docking scene with one ship's nose going to the other back was half-hearted, at least for a laugh in addition to early scenes, where we see several pictures of the ship as it is just turning around, similar to the Lego experiment, which has gone back. <br /> <br /> It seems that everything is dying in this movie, so why? Even the VR women are killed, as if it meant something (especially because everyone else dies anyway) ... outrageous. <br /> <br /> Because of the money saved for food I am not talking about wanting to get my money back for what I pay for the DVD. The dollar that I saved on this vanilla wafer bag is paid for this reviewer's time. <br /> <br /> Just add that this story, at least as a novel and in more detail, can probably be quite interesting to the right author. <br /> <br /> 1/10
