... when he retired from Broadway BILL (1934) RIDING HIGH (1950). Bing Crosby's recast of DAN BROOKS does not help a scenario “dated” in 34, not to mention 50. This sad film contains all the scenes that have been lifted up from the original lift by repeating many supporting parts, unless they were dead. Although being a parent didn't matter to the director. Also, the cars and clothes on the 1934 backplanes did not seem to match the standards of the 1950s. Even singing "Bingel" cannot redeem this effort. <br /> <br /> We rated both the original and the remake of the IMDb Four **** Stars. The touch of the Frank was long gone and all that remained was CAPRA-CORN. That didn't stop Mr Capra. After slipping in the 50s, he graduated from some educational documents for his career rewriting as LADY FOR A DAY (1933) as MIRACLFULL (1961). Again, the IMDb Six ****** Star missed a bit of effort compared to the original eight ******** stars. Sometimes it is better to stop when you were still ahead, right after the UNION (1948).
