This type of Swedish film is typical. Strangely enough, the actor was so bad that these actors usually show good. The casting was badly done, it made you wait (I won't tell you anything). Lead's character was terrible ... I don't know where they find him. Anyway, away from it and go to "Den Tredje VÃ¥geni", this is Sweden's main business.
