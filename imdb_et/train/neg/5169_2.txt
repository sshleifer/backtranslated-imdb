WARNING: I recommend that anyone who has not seen the movie yet read this comment. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen all of them, Hamiltons gave me a certain amount of entertainment that he didn't do. I thought it was common with half-bad, foolish plot schemes and twists at the end of the movie, which was very slow. film imenes !!! Okay, so supposedly, these are people who eat other people. Yes ...... i noticed that people are not people, not because they are not people, or wait for them to be, oh no WAIT, they don't tell you !!!! So whether these people are cannibals, or whether they are breastfeeding or what they are !!!! I mean, they're just "things" that came here to see what people tasted, or whether they've been eaten by cannibals for a long time, or maybe this movie was HHOORRIIBBLLEE !! WHAT IS IT! So if you think Hamilton is good, I ask you why, why, why, why, why it's so awesome because it was just terrible to me! One great for BOOOOOOO Go see Gravedancers, teeth and nails or Borderland for entertainment !!!!!
