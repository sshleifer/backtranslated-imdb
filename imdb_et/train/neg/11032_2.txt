"I Love New York" is the second entry by VH-1 (MTV Networks), which shows an entertaining aspect that introduces excitement, reluctance, and woman. It must have been an easy decision to take on the wildest, ebony-speaking, worst competitors and his mother and give them an exhibition of this network. Many say "it's a show". True, it's not as bad as it's the previous show, "Flavor of Love," but it's just as bad. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of the 90's "In Living Color" exhibition, where Keenan Ivory Wayans imitated the boxer Mike Tyson at the "Love Love" show and chose the date "Robin Givens". Mike talked about how the date was fine, but how the disgusting mother stopped. This exhibition reminds me of it. <br /> <br /> Men are chosen and first names to humiliate themselves and women - (I think an intelligent person who expects an intelligent woman would not allow her - and her mother - to give you a name that is so ghetto, you torture yourself every time you appear on the TV.), but these are the actors of professional reality, why not bother. <br /> <br /> It's getting out of me to find out what's so fun. The fact that it is just as fake as its newly implanted supplements? 15 Celebrity Protocols and Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars in Network Advertising Time? (Well, you can't hate them to try to tow.) Maybe it's a miracle - who would like to be with this woman in one hour? Or don't you know if he and his mother's next show would be WWF! Anyway, if you cut it, it's the wreck of the train you've seen many times before, so now the value of the shock is zero. <br /> <br /> No twisting or turning does make it a more interesting train wreck, or different from others. Applying for the lowest common denominator, and for those who call the "end" of reality, it is just one of the nails of the nail, why they should end immediately.
