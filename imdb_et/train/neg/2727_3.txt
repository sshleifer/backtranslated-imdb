In the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION, this strange thing doesn't really need to be added because it is only in the movie for less than 30 minutes. What he does is bright on the screen. A closer plot less movie is just an excuse to show some of Warner's contract players. JANCIE RULE shows the promise and it is a shame that he did not become a big star. RUTH ROMAN has a "go-getter" role. Better if it was colored. Travis Air Force Base Points with some rear projection work well. What's best about the film is some wonderful musical differences. If you like TODAY LUCKY STARS and Hollywood CANTEEN, you like it.
