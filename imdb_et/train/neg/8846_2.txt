The Babel Tower in the mini series describes the narrator as tower builders as "the descendants of Moses." <br /> <br /> It is like saying that George Washington lived for many centuries before Alexander the Great. <br /> <br /> Or the lamp was invented before the wheel. <br /> <br /> Or that guided missile was the forerunner of the bow and arrow. <br /> <br /> Need to say yet? <br /> <br /> The writers of the greatest heroes of the Bible should at least have paid more attention to the chronology of the Bible people and events.
