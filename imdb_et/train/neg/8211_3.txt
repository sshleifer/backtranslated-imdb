I read Heinrich Harrier's book "7 years in Tibet" and was fascinated. then I immediately grabbed the DVD and started watching the movie. I remember the first time I saw it back in 98, I liked it. Well, I looked at it again when you knew this book based on. and soon I realized how WRONG said it all: <br /> <br /> When they enter Lhasa, people start to shut their tongue out of their mouths and Thewlis and Pitt have the impression that this is the way to say hello in Tibet so they welcome back in ... Harrer explains that holding a tongue is a sign of absolute humility and loyalty in Tibet and they can do it before the Dalai Lama, but certainly not the two Europeans! not only the mother but also the Dalai Lama herself in the public glasses. Harrer says that someone in Tibet did not wear glasses by that time (sorry I forgot the reason, but also in the book explained). The young Dalai Lama did, but only when he was alone and no one could see him! and what is the urge of Mao tse to look, destroying the mandala of the young "living buddha"? childish ... and specially made Harrier and Aufschnaiter Tibetan clothes are not European designer suits! why are so many events that really happened, eliminated, just to fill the time with fancy love (female tailor ...), which is completely irrelevant? like the whole story of the predator's son, the rolf. the book does not mention any words about him or even a family member of Harris. but it was good for me, because "7 years in Tibet" is not a book about the Rags. its about tibet. I am very disappointed with the "adaptation" of this famous book. and I also put the heinrich harrer on ... 3 stars, only for cinematography.
