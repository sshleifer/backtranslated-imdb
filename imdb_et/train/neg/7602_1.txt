One of the other wizards mentioned they almost walked out. If I hadn't been with my husband who wanted to stay, I would have left. This is also a shame because I think it could have been a good movie. But that's just one of the worst custom scripts I've ever seen. It starts somewhere and it doesn't go anywhere (I'd say it won't go anywhere fast, but it won't go slowly ... painfully slow). From time to time, there are hints that something interesting may happen or that one character has a potential depth, but that's all we can - hints. There is no payout or revelation in the film. Not that I need a slippery plot for entertainment ... I love good curving character as much as the next indie buff. But these characters do not contain anything. The whole length of the movie doesn't matter what happens to one of them. In fact, you almost hope that they will die because at least death can be more interesting than looking at their inexplicable behavior, which is so strange and unpredictable that you think it would be convincing in itself, but it is not. Instead of strange, noir-esquire characters in hard-boiled fashion, you recognize it right away for what it is: a number of talented, but obscure actors who suffer and raise their eyebrows when you read a strange dialogue without an appropriate context. All this is twice, painfully slow. Awful.
