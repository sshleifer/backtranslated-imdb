I have to admit that I have remembered that I have been a babe of samurai strips. I looked rather indiscriminate, be it "elitist" like seven samurai or bloody comic books, like Lone Wolf and Cub. I also liked the US / Japanese "Crossovers" like Bushido Blade. And, of course, all that includes Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada. And I've been looking at every samurai almost every two weeks. But not Kabuto. In 1993, for the first time in Kabut, I watched a video that even samurai films can be boring. At first I waited for Mayeda in Europe and the resulting confrontation, but by the time he actually arrived in Spain, I didn't care so much about the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't make movie rights to call it "bad". Technically, this is a pure entry into the genre. But just not quiet enough. Sho Koshu's skills are limited to both director and actor, and they have only a fraction of the above-mentioned Japanese actors' charisma. And speaking of Sho Kosug, the son of Kane, who appears in almost all Sho Kosuk's films as Shos's son: he has inherited little or one of his father's limited operational skills. Adding points is a lack of blood and gore, which until now was a trademark of all Samurai films. It was obviously meant for the younger US / European audience. <br /> <br /> Let's just say it's a movie designed for fans of historical action-adventure fans, but dug for samurai cinema hardened fans. "Samurai will meet?" - Genre fans, should rather go out and watch Red Sun (1971), with Charles Bronson as a cowboy, who, along with Samurai Toshiro Mifum, holds a samurai sword from bad type Alan Delon. That's pretty much how to do it right and where Kabuto went wrong. <br /> <br /> So, while the movie is only 100 minutes, it looks like a much longer movie. <br /> <br /> The reason I gave it to the honorable 4/10 point 3/10: For the first time I saw this movie, I saw it in a German synchronized version. In this version, Cosmos can actually understand. I have to admit that his "Engrish" is funny at times, but gets tired in about 30 minutes.
