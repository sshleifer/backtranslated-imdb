As a Southern Baptist, I suffer from having to give below the average rating for a public Christian film. It is certainly not so much that I would like to prevent filmmakers from a genre that is hardly underestimated. However, I must honestly say that "the joy of love" is typically a low budget, a low key, a self-conscious Christian film. The plot is predictable, acting mediocre (I'm kind) and editing cruel. It could have been a bit above average as a TV movie, but it leaves much to be desired as a feature film. Try the guys. You must have a movie that tells you about true Christians somewhere. Would I advise you to contact Mr Chesterton or Mr S. Lewis for inspiration?
