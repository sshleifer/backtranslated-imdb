William Hurt Diving Scientist ?? Do US Representatives Study Abroad? The ill contaminated man strikes the butt after 20 feet and escaped? Sniper missing and did not kill Hurt (just wounding him), but another "kill" shot is dead? Waste of time. To compare it down, other reviewers are ridiculous. At the end of the movie, they decide to wear their hands, except for the "evil" agent and Hurt decides to kill him, giving him a "virus handshake". What? BTW ... When does IMDb need 10 lines of text? I just finish here. Isn't it just the content of the reviews if you have the required x line?
