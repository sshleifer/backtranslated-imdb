I was very pleased with this move. Everything was terrible from the start. Comedy was uncomfortable, it was superfluous, the songs were strange. Even the story was unimportant. From a writer who has written successful scripts such as Guru and Dhoom, I had great expectations. The actors worked too hard and didn't help the film at all. Of course, Kareena shook the screen in a bikini, but for two seconds. I think the leaders of Hindi Stunts should investigate how the action films have been made. They tend to overdo it too much. In Chinese films, this style works because it is their signature. But the signature of the Hindi cinema is songs. A good action film should not last longer than two hours and may not be unrealistic. But in the future, I'm sure these movies will get much sharper. It should also be noted that comedy and action films are not mixed unless they are done properly. Good luck next time.
