It was just terrible. I read this book to school, I did all the tests and see it! My teacher forced me and 20 other people to see it, and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, the 9th Space Plan, and the Hudson Hawk. What made this movie so terrible was the reason why you wanted to kill yourself. First, it was done in Hallmark. Secondly, the action was terrible. Third, it was completely different from the book. In the literal sense, it was so bad that I asked for excuses. Basically I'd rather look at Basic Instinct 2 than watch it. Take my advice, don't look at this movie. Nobody would like to see it. It was terrible. HORRIBLE!
