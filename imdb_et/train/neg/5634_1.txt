Poster, who called it "Plotless and Pointless", literally took the word that I would have used in my subject line. The only thing I would add is "passionate". For a film made by a real-life couple with a lot of graphic sexual scenes, this film can do what should be a shy situation next to the ice cold. Dafoe and Colagrande will be seen forever in sexual scenes, and the viewer can also take Valio and have done so. Also, please, audience women have seen how too much tampons were used during their time, and every guy who's turned on when he sees Willem Dafoe pulling his bloody swab from his wife's vagina really needs treatment. <br /> I think the key to the movie (if there is one) is the restaurant scene where the waiter explains forever the dreamy Dafoole "deconstructed jambalaya". (All food ingredients are still separate, not boiled.) This film is a "deconstructed thriller". All the elements are there: spooky, isolated house, dead husband, horrible violin scores, strange caregiver who comes and goes, like he wants, car accidents and almost dead, characters with a secret past. Basically, every thriller in the thriller accumulates but is NOT compatible. Everybody just sits there and never sees a single plot or even an artistic mood. In the restaurant, Dafoe goes through a "deconstructed jambalaya". Future tenants of this confusion would do well to leave this deconstructed thriller on the video shop shelf.
