I saw this cinematic crime in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 (back when the tickets were actually sold for $ 1). This is the only movie I've ever been with (with a friend, while the idiocy, which is the "Laser Bra 2000" sketch, was on screen). Obviously, my and my friend's reaction to the film was normal. It's not that I found the film offensive (either 18 years old or now), but rather that it is deliberately stupid and obviously uneven, without even the unintentional humor that makes Ed Wood's movie viewable. This is the real reason NBC refused to incite it, instead of understanding Mr Mike's "vision" (unless, of course, his vision was to lead the film's supporters to bankruptcy). <br /> <br /> So far, I was surprised that this film does not seem to have published any of the "worst movies of all time" published. That's definitely mine. You have been warned.
