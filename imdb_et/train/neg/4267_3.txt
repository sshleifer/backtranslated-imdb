I saw this movie at the Rotterdam Festival, as did all the other voters. The director was present and seemed very hard to work on and very committed to a project that, in my opinion, explains and denotes the above-mentioned average reception. This is the most similar to the Aussie children's favorite "Round the Twist" feature episode, but it takes too seriously to even use this redemption feature. The film itself may be worth seeing when you try to make a cinematic world tour that visits all the UN member states, because I can't think of another Fiji movie, but in general it was a general, poorly acted (albeit amateur) and sub-alternative mentality. The moral of the story seemed to be that local islands try to screw each other, but as long as there is a fairly decent white governor, all the problems can be solved (leaving the island).
