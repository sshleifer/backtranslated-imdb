I was one of the few additions to this great bomb. I was just in the right place at A.I.R. As it was, it was known. Thank you for the good moment in the first few minutes of the movie and I don't have to sit all over. It was a big party rather than a movie, but hey, the reward was good. The detailed comment was not a strong point for that, but who knew it. The funny thing was to see the cars at a really slow speed and then in the movie picked up at a normal speed close. Many scenes were changed because they were filmed, assuming they were shaving their costs and time.But everyone had such a good time who took care!
