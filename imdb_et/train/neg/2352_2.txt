Raw, sometimes crass - this is Madhur Bhandarkar's last job - Page 3. What is a film? Whether it is about communicating to people (so-called types) who are so busy that they communicate and progress on their profiles in life, they have no time to do anything else. And you are out of it or out of it. Is not that there are everyday incidents at all. Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a major newspaper and only a supplement; maybe an entertainer to check who is who and what. Don't mix these two. And then there is power to play - it would happen in every life. So what you have said at the end - nothing - just some raw jokes that have put together less of a movie.
