I'm going to see a pattern in the movies that I give to 1. They are almost all the films my wife is watching. Maybe I should end my faith in films. Anyway, this is a typical fingerprint targeting pre-teen girls, but worse than usual. Again, the writer repeated the basic rule of any film. He made the main character unlikely. He starts his full b * tchi ​​with his friend at first, and then it turns out when he's 30 years old that he is basically a * tty person (having things, etc.). Why would F feel for this person? OK, let's say we can miss it. Jennifer Garner is about as attractive as you can get without any deformation. I don't know if it's her or the writer's fault, but her character goes beyond my anxiety. Here's a tip for future filmmakers: 13-year-olds aren't fun, they're annoying. The distant and distant film came to "Thriller" dancing the most embarrassing moment of the film. The holy crap that was painful. It showed him the practice of dancing in the beginning. This explains why he knows it, but the whole club full of people?!? Argh !!! Macarena would be more credible! Suddenly he is completely incompetent and has no idea how to do his job and no one knows it? At least Tom Hanks had a "Big" characteristic work for the child. These body changes / getting a child to adult overnight movies are really out of hand and it is by far the worst.
