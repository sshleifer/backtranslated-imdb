This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I saw it on the premiere of SXSW and was very disappointed. The director knew little about John Lennon and even spoke in premiere. It's a drama, but people laughed at the whole movie as a cheese. It's never a good sign. The only rescue work was Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as Livien's roommates. They were funny while the rest of the movie was too serious. The Beatles story was fun because it was just absurd. However, the soundtrack was great and was probably the best part of the movie. If you're not one of those crazy fans of Dominic Monaghan fans, don't worry about it.
