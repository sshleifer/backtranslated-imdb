Harold Pinter writes for Anthony Schaeffer's classic game about a man who is going to visit his lover's man. The original film was played by Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. Caine has the role of Olivier in this version and is associated with Jude Law. Here the film is directed by Kenneth Branaugh. <br /> <br /> Actress is remarkable. Both Caine and the law are gangbusters in their role. I really like the clash between chemistry and personalities. This is a wonderful and sufficient reason to see when the script is heading. <br /> <br /> Harold Pinter's dialogue is sharp and sharp, and often very funny, and I understand why he was chosen to use a camera for playback (which is being updated). The problem is that the script moves around the characters. Michale Caine walks the Law through her odd modern house with sliding doors and panels. Conversations take place repeatedly in different places. I know Pinter has done it in his games, but in that case it becomes annoying. Why do we have to go over and over for the law to sleep with Caine's wife? It would be good if the law says for a few moments that we have done it, but it will not act as if it were the first time. The script does not move Cain through all its legal manipulation. First he is blindly angry to start, so he has no chance to turn around and scare us. (Never remember a game delay that makes you think about why it worked). here we do, and although it gives an edge, it seems somehow wrong because it is so clear that we are forced to think about why Law's Milo doesn't see her being created. There are still a few cases, but to say more would be too much. <br /> <br /> Thinking retrospectively about a movie, I think it's a movie of lost opportunity and misstep. Opportunities are destroyed, there is a chance to get better fireworks between Caine and the law. It is a failure that the choice of a false-shaped setting and odd shifts on the plot takes away the tension and the credible thriller. Instead, we get some smart dialogues and great performances in a movie that won't let them be real. <br /> <br /> Despite some excellent performance and funny dialogue, it is only 4 out of 10 because the rest of the script just doesn't work
