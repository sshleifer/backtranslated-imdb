I love cheesy horror flicks. I don't care if it is sub-par or monsters are horns. I liked this movie except for the embarrassed feeling of the entire movie from start to finish. Look, I don't need a 10-page dissertation or a capital letter to explain the plot to me. But the blind floors accept "what is this movie?" a whole new (annoying) level. What is this movie? <br /> <br /> It is not extraordinarily scary or exciting, but if you have one and a half hours to kill and / or want to be disappointed and confused, rent this winner.
