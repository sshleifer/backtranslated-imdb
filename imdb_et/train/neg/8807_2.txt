I chose "Dead Creatures" because I thought it was a zombie movie like "28 days" or so ... but not at all. It's not even a horror movie. Nothing happens except for a group of women who seem to be infected with a strange virus that makes him eat human meat to survive. <br /> <br /> This plot results in a number of nasty cannibalism scenes ... <br /> <br /> A very bad movie. <br /> <br /> * My Price: 2/10 <br /> <br /> ------------------ <br /> <br /> -------------- ---
