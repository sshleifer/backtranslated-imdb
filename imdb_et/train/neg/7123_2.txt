Welcome to the bad ghost story and someone's nightmare. This horrible story is found by the newly married husband (John Hudson) and the wife (Peggy Weber), who are haunted by his previous wife's memories and screaming skulls that took place in their entire empty mansion and lily pond. Does the man really try to drive his already worried bride? Or has it been learned by the invited gardener Mickey (Alex Nicol) who has taken care of the mansion buildings from the death of the house's original lover? This low-budget horror flick has a story that keeps you in the finals. Special effects are pretty bad even for the 1958 standards. I sometimes swear when the screaming skull sounds like it should be in the Godzilla movie. It is also cast as Reverend Snow is a character actor Russ Conway. By the way ... is a lurking gardener (Nicol) film director. You can catch it as part of the AMC Monsterfest.
