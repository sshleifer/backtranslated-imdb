I liked this show! I think there was nothing wrong with that! The only thing is that Spidey doesn't hit anyone, but only that this show is no wonder! Some people think this exhibition is bad. The story was great and it was great when other heroes like X-Men, The Punisher, Daredev and Iron Man appeared! Bad Sandman never appears, but I like it! Best Spidey Show Ever! My favorite episodes are: 1. Turning Point 2. Spider Wars 3. Hobgoblin 4. Alien Costume 5. Mutant Action Plan <br /> <br /> But there are some episodes that were really bad, like: Rocket Racer and The Spot, which was embarrassing to watch. And I don't like Morbius and Hydro Man. The first Morbius sucks blood in the plasma and I don't like vampires. And it irritates me that he was almost the main villain of the 2nd season. Of course I have to mention Hydro Man! He was terrible! I see Sandman rather! His last appearance was so terrible. And I don't like Spidey as a Man Spider! <br /> <br /> But I think all this was bad!
