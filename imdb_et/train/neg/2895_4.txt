The prerequisite for this movie is a DVD. A textile worker develops a miracle fabric that does not break down. But the film can't handle it. Instead, it will emerge within 45 minutes before it makes a great discovery. Because audiences don't get much benefit when they see things, it's a strange choice: the film has succeeded in blocking a topic. Once the fabric is discovered, the film shows too quickly that both the big and blue collars of the industry want the invention to burst, leaving the film with only two thin movements; inventing chemistry and walking the oppressors. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why someone would describe it as a comedy. The tone is not funny or comic. This is rather a serious social criticism of the day: capitalism grabs both supply chains and production. This in turn prevents innovation in achieving and improving the world. Yes, it is probably true, but without some attitude towards this attitude, the film is just a serious argument. Here's a great definition of comedy. <br /> <br /> It's a British meeting with John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe?).
