I looked at this "eye" before I watched it. I really liked the "Eye", this was one of the best films of the recent Asian horror. So, I chose this "haunt of Bangkok" because it was the same director and here was the popular ring. But the human being, what disappointment ... "Bangkok haunts" are three stories of love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that are not at all intimidating, even disturbing (like "Eye") ... nothing. I can't even fill in the comments for the 10 lines ... <br /> <br /> 100% boring. <br /> <br /> * My price: 2/10
