Herculis Puaro is generally a well-known hero, whom we know well from books and films. This movie or the story doesn't work and I felt it wasn't Agatha's mistake. Cast is not good, actors are exaggerated and stupid gestures, costumes are so clean and so neat that everyone (even Arabic clothes) can see a fake and serious spectator who thinks this film twice, instead of seeing a mysterious drama in comedy. An actor who plays Hercule Puarot does a good job, but something fantastic. Scenes are, as previously said, perfect and looking fake. The story is not very enchanting, though the mystery of murder, but who cares about the death of a wicked and witch 45+ woman in the iraqi desert?! The victim is not pleasant.
