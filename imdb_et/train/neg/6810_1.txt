To be honest, I didn't really like the "executive decision" - which was obvious on the template - but compared to that joke, it seems to be a masterpiece of art. <br /> <br /> Not only do people moving around in the movie (the term "offenders would be offensive to all other actors") should participate in more active classes who have not seen the plane far from building it. It's so ridiculous that 747 has only 3 flights, but it's just the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of illogicality (eg: use sleeping gas, don't use it, use it anyway), which eventually fell below your rating. <br /> <br /> You may be more fun to rearrange the drawer drawer or cage knee opening and fill it with milk.
