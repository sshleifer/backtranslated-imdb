Some people don't like animation. Personally, I think this film was very remarkable at the time of making this film. There are many older cartoons I just love. My problems with this film are not animation, but basically how it is built. The characters are all just ... well, well. And they shouldn't be for this movie. Obviously, all LOTRs have a sliding problem (starters.) Just as they generally did, they disturbed me. My two sisters and I laughed at most of this movie. I think if many people had seen it before they saw the newer, they wouldn't have gone. I'm glad I rented it and didn't buy it. There are a few movies that give me a headache. It was one of them. But this is not the worst film I've ever seen, even though it's there. Or down, depending on your view.
