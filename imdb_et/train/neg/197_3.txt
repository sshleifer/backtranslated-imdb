Being the great western James Arnes, this movie has fallen as the worst Alamo film ever made. The story was terrible, inaccurate, and just unreliable. Sustainability was given to four winds. Anyone trying a cannon sequence? The Mexicans were foolish enough to shoot the cannons that apparently had mud and slag, which were still stuck in the tubes. Come on! Then Brian Keith is a ridiculous hat! The customer must be away or something. Or just out of your mind!
