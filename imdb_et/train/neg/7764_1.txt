What is this ? Low budget sex comedy? Anyway, it perfectly describes the people of Spain. They could come up with a better idea, I mean, they're making such movies since the 1960s ... and they like them! It's not a teen comedy or a family (you can't let your boy 12 kiss at his 12-year-old, he never wants to go to Spain). It should be rated "R" because only 35+ people seem to be laughing at the look: S I'm really disappointed, maybe I don't like gays (which is an important part of the movie). <br /> <br /> Alien humor is terrible in movies (except Kusturica), stay with the drama! If you want a new comedy, try Talladega Nights
