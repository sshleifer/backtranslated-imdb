An illegal immigrant is against a social support system, causing terrible consequences for many. Well filmed and acted, though the story is a bit forced, but the slow pace finally draws the conclusion. The feeling of disappearance in a big city seems to be effectively communicated. A big person lost in society is something we can all relate to, but I can't support you not wanting to see this movie.
