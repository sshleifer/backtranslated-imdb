For those of you who have never heard of it (or seen it in A&E), Cracker is an excellent British TV overweight, chain-smoker, foulmouthed psychologist named Fitz who helps the Manchester Police Department get into violent criminals. It is considered to be one of the best examples from England (and it says something) and was a huge success in 1993 in England and around the world. <br /> <br /> The original letters are now re-wound with the original writer for another 2-hour episode. I've loved this example since I first saw it, more than a decade ago. In the DVD box, I have the honor of being in my collection, and I can quote a lot of Fitz's interrogation scenes literally. The idea of ​​switching to Robbie Coltrane with Jimmy McGovern for another Fitzs movie filled me with absolute joy. <br /> <br /> I'll start with good. One of the many things that impressed me with the original Cracker series was how quickly Fitz was defined as a character. Five minutes from the first episode? with his lecture (throwing books into the air), his drinking and his disembarkation in the gaming machine queue? and you knew, I just knew who that was. You could feel him "clicking" on his mind with a type of click that happens only when a great actor gets a great role for a great writer. <br /> <br /> Coltrane, of course, was great throughout the show. , but I always felt that some later episodes? those that McGovern has not written? wrongly treated the character. <br /> <br /> So the good news is: Fitz is back. As soon as you see him in this show? to Make Your Daughter's Wedding Incredibly Inappropriate Comments? you feel "click" again. This is her: Petulant one moment and really sorry next, always insightful, sincere point of tact, but brilliantly funny process. If you love this character as much as I do, you will be pleased with how it depicts in the film. And it also extends to Judith and Mark: in fact, everything that fits to Fitz is fine. <br /> <br /> The problem I am experiencing with this movie spins around the crime that Fitzi is facing. In Standard Cracker's fashion, we know exactly who is the offender in the first five minutes? the relationship is that Fitz would see it out. In this case, we have a serum killer that is American blood. And unfortunately this is not due to any plausible psychological trauma? rather, the murders seem to be just to allow the writer to show his personal political convictions. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to write this because I really believe Jimmy McGovern is one of the biggest writers in the world. I also have no problems with films that are related to topical issues, or movies with political status. But in the Cracker universe, we expect to see the characters behave like people, not like cartoons. Instead, Americans in this film are portrayed in a completely stereotyped manner. They know something that complains about complaining about everything, treating local people like crap and deceiving their women? one of them can even make all the above changes in less than 5 minutes. I honestly thought I was switching channels or something else. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't stop there. We get a constant reminder of how bad the Iraq war is? reminders that have nothing to tell and that practically doesn't come out. The killer is so busy how Bush is worse than Hitler that he almost forgets to kill; but rather he is such a mouthpiece for the writer's political views so that he forgets to act as a believable person and hence we? as an audience? do not buy your sudden transformation into a serial numbered soul tortured by a happy family member. <br /> <br /> Can't say it destroyed my show? it was still a good TV, better than almost everything else in the genre (mostly thanks again to Coltrane). But its constant politicization did not allow it to be as good as the real Cracker classic like "To Be A Somebody"? an episode that was the same "problematic" but dealt with much finer and psychological depth. <br /> <br /> Two other small points: Panhandle, who is not around, is disappointing, but worse is his replacement. The whole police department? which so long filled with such great signs - is now full of vanilla. Totally interchangeable police officers, who have no personality and all personality (how to link the drain to the personality of Richard Coyle, are beyond me, but it is really missing here). its credibility for me. One such example revolves around Fitzs that some very strange criteria (French windows? Not only do it, but also in less than an hour. I don't think so. <br /> <br /> So I was a little bit It is recommended viewing, but do not forget to leave at least some of your expectations on the door, but if there is a new series, it would have been good: I am convinced that McGovern can still write great things, and maybe now, when he gets out of his policy, he can write back about people.
