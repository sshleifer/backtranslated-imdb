An interesting concept of vampirism, which has something to do with the virus (but has been made several times by now) Overall, the film is too long and drags a little. Editing could have been more stringent. I'm sorry to hear about the credit issue. Maybe the movie was rushed to the market. The lighting was too dark in places. But the worst technical problem is sound. This level was good enough to hear the dialogue, but many interiors have an echo signal that is very disturbing. Whether they were cautious when recording, or sound mixing might have been better. Also too much background noise. Someone should make sound effects for martial arts scenes. Sword striking was not the sound of an epic battle. Editing scenes had to be more stringent. <br /> <br /> The operation was also flat. I'm sorry, but when I see that the same person writes and marks in the movie, it's my experience as a red flag. <br /> <br /> But it was a good effort so I gave it to 4.
