This movie didn't give anything new or value. After that my husband and I both saw that the studio just collapsed and could have been less attractive if it were fun. This is a good example of the "only concept" movie - they have the concept of a movie and the other details are irrelevant because execs know that it makes $$ just on the original concept. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the escape and failure of Cruella from prison. He hates puppies anymore, but has been programmed to adore them - he just couldn't hurt the flea. It won't take too long after her release and she's back with her old ways. Period. <br /> <br /> The most annoying aspects of the movie were supportive characters. Eric Idle, like the bird of Waddlesworth, made me hate - and that's TOUGH, because I'm a Python fan. It was obvious that he did this because they gave him a lot of money (there could be no other reason). Cruella's little self-esteem servant Tim McInnerny was funny at the black Adder show, but here she's completely wasted and uncomfortable. And getting GÃ©rard Depardieu must cost a few bucks, but he was also completely wasted. There were also some other supportive actors, but given that these characters are badly written, I try to block them in my mind. <br /> <br /> In general, you'd better let your kids watch TV without bothering to see this generation.
