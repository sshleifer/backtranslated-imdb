A good performance will not save this terrible script, which is hidden with the clich√©s of every chick-flick book. Both of the main characters are deeply insecure and the scene where Laura Linney's character resembles sex with her dead wife in front of her teenage son - which I think it should be embarrassing - is just terrible.
