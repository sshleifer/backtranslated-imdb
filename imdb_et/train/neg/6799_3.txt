don't expect much of this movie. In many ways, this film resembles the movie Doris Day celebrated in 1956, Julie. In this movie, Doris, a flight attendant, was a flight attendant, and these days he landed his shipman, played by Louis Jordan. He did a much better job, more convincing than Kim Ojah, who took over 747 controls and was able to land without much help from the control tower. I know a little about 747 aircraft, I use myself as a passenger. As I said, there is not much to expect from this movie, it was made from a cheap budget. Manufacturers had to use the airplane with a cheap airline. Oceanic is one name that has been used by several films. The only writing on this plane was the name of the company that made the aircraft.
