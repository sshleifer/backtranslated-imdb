I don't understand why so many nations have praised this exhibition. Twin peaks are one of the most boring headlines I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Now I have seen 1 episode of the whole season and seen the 2nd episode of the season 1. Just I can't take this example anymore. <br /> <br /> 1) Where is the right induction for criminal investigation? <br /> <br /> In season 1, there was a scene that Agent Cooper throws into the bottle. Do you think he did it? He just wants to identify the murderer, making it fun, while mentioning the supernatural ability of the Tibetan dream. Wow !!! <br /> <br /> 2) There are too many unnecessary scenes in this show. <br /> <br /> For example, Season 2 started with a funny scene that the skillful old man serves as Agent Cooper with a cup of milk when Cooper put him down on the floor. (He got the shoots of his gun already in his belly.) This old man does something but says some dumb comments. That is all. <br /> <br /> This scene is really boring and even long (3 min 30 sec .... It's like hell.) <br /> <br /> I read reading comics, not seeing it anymore.
