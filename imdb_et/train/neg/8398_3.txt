Schlocky's 70s horror movies ... you have to love. Unlike today's boredom, these K-TVs are actually frightening and not using a tired formula. <br /> <br /> This is a B movie about making a B movie ... went terribly wrong. The stars of Faith Domergue (this island country) like the mountain range, Queen of the B-film, make the movie from a series of murderous murders that came to the family at home. His boyfriend / director, who looks and acts like Gordon Jump, is attentive, filmed locally and narrowly. The Ken doll co-star discovers the book of Tibetan songs that they work on in the script to add "realism". Unfortunately, "realism" is something they could have done without. <br /> <br /> John Carradine, having long since abandoned the 17th giant (The Unearthly), is now creating a modest existence as a real estate. She goes to her daily work, but she always seems to be the director. <br /> <br /> Horror builds slowly; dead cat here, John Carradine entered the grave there, finally ended with seven, yes seven assassinations. (At least there is truth in advertising.) It's just sad that ghoul didn't realize that there was a movie over him. How did the poor Faith know that these Tibetan songs would actually work? Faced with it, you just can't go over with Satan's hair and wait for it to lie down. <br /> <br /> Sterno says he's kind of seven corpses.
