Observing the lie, I recently watched this movie in TCM, hoping for a low-priced gem, because I think many 30's movies. It's not a pearl - not even a semi-precious stone. Anachronistic clothing and the 1930s Rolls Royce limo hit you immediately. Casting is also strange. But most of the time there are too many stupid and unnecessary plots. This film has many good ingredients and a basic plan that has a promise, but the components are not mixed with the right recipe. It just doesn't come together as it should. And it's a shame. Some are quite obvious, but small changes could have been a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about an American showgirl (Jean Harlow) looking for a rich British man - preferably a nobleman. She will meet Franchot Tone and her girlfriend, who is a friend of her friend at Rolls Royce. Harlow mistakenly assumes that Tone is the Lord who owns Rolle, and he puts him in sight. This early part of the film is a light comedy with no real difference. <br /> <br /> But Tone unintentionally publishes the fact that his employer is on the fifth column of World War I, the fifth columnist in Germany, and that is when the film ever comes and starts to break down. Tone and Harlow are married, but just as the honeymoon begins, he sets off Mata Hari (Benita Hume) and Harlow flees from a scene where an outsider accuses him of Tone's murder. (Tone is recovering from wounds.) \ THarlow flees to France, where he falls back in love - this time with a Cary Grant. Toon, now in the army and Harlow, unexpectedly brought together Grant in the hospital room, where he is in a crash. In the next scene, Tone Harlow accuses him of giving up because he is essentially a gold digger. Harlow never explains that the witness "accuses him of killing and his panic! This is one of those unrealistic, revealing story of the movie device. <br /> <br /> Then Tone brings back the woman (Hume) who shot her down. He's under his hand to look at his parameter, Grant, to test the new plane Tone has given him from England. Incredibly, both Hume and Tone know each other dimly, but just can't delete it! Okay, so Tone was shot and almost died; maybe his memory is little. But how many men shot Hume to forget one of his characters? (He doesn't seem to lose memory.) <br /> <br /> It is inexplicable and unnecessary. Hume should have fully recognized him, but he played it when he realized that Tone couldn't place him. This would have been a much better approach to this issue. <br /> <br /> Finale is also very pleased. In the movie, as it has been done, Tone and Harlow are summing up to keep the picture, Grant, of a good reputation, resulting in his fraudulent hero burial. Then Harlow and Tone walked. It is noble to maintain the French public's understanding of the hero of their country's war, but the story of a very dissatisfied love! <br /> <br /> What the movie comes up with is: Harlow explains that he escaped panic in the face of accusations of murder; Tone forgives her and quietly removes her love for her; he then carries him a torch to help keep Grant's reputation. Meanwhile, Harlow Grant recognizes when he is. When he has seen Tone's brave and noble man, Harlow also recovers his feelings. At the end of the film, the two agree, even if they work together to ensure Grant's death. After the funeral of Granti's hero, we see them embracing and kissing during the disappearance. It would have made a nice little movie. For the fans of Cary Grant, it would have been better if Tone played the French frame that was killed and give Harlow a reunited first wife. <br /> <br /> It is incomprehensible that Franchot Tone is cast in Ireland, living in England, while Cary Grant is French. This film would have been much better if they had the opposite roles. It would have been a movie that should have been ...
