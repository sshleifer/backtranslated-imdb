I bought this movie because it was Shah rukh khans Debut.And also I liked to see how he does.I have to say that he is great in his role.Divya Bharathi is great in this movie.Rishi does wonderful work.Susham Seth supports well. Alok nath was good for his role. Amrish and Mohnish did their parts well too. Much also was good for his little role. Body shine mediocre film. The direction is average. The performance is bad. The story is boring. It tells us about Ravi's famous pop singer. He has many female fans. One of them is K people. Treatment and K men fall in love and get married. Treatment can be killed by his relatives. K man is a widow .. Healing relatives.They go to Bombay. It comes over to Raja.It falls in love with her and marries.Treatment returns.The story is predictable.The region is predictable.First half drills.It also attracts a lot. recorded by actors and music. Another half of entertainment. Music is pleasant with some nice songs. he's in the first half but seems unimaginable. The pictures of the song are boring, with the exception of "Sochenge Tumhe Pyar" and one raincoat. Costumes are outdated.Everything to watch only for actors and music Rating-4/10
