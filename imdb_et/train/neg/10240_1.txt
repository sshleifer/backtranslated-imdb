I love all movies, especially horror. This means that survival does not survive any hype surrounding it. <br /> <br /> I can't give any points on originality. There is nothing wrong with studying the same topics or what others have done. It has just become a policeman for indie films to bring us through a ride, a mad killer, and lately to throw a crazy family. On these routes, it has to be compared with the characteristics of Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turni (although it is complicated) and others. Survival falls against comparable films. The plot was in no way original. Some movies may have a weak (and overall) schedule with excellent actors, special fx or other factors. Survivial does not have it on the bank. If you wish, please note the following: Action in the movie never went out. I don't beat or blame the participants or the director. The dialogue was, at best, mediocre and the participants never showed (did not say they had) the talent to pull it out. I mention 2 standouts. The person in charge of this film is definitely a look, but I think he must consider more training before he is ready to wear the film. The actor who depicted Greg had a potential, but we could never see it (see the movie to see why you don't believe it). <br /> <br /> Terrible movie looks like. Ah, yeah, that little magic of tid-bit filmmaking, which aims to bring us to the Grindhouse Film Days. In today's cinema, it has become a trick. It works or not. In this case, it just doesn't work. There are too many other mistakes, so it comes out of the movie, not to it. That said, I think they did a good job of adding this fruit. It is a good and high quality grain. I think they should try another "Grindhouse" test for a different script, better direction and possibly actors. They will probably pull out. <br /> <br /> As far as the technical aspects are concerned, I think they are not really gelled for me either. Sound could have taken better care (it seems to have been fed directly into the camera, but there is nothing wrong with it) and it was too soft for me to put on DV. <br /> <br /> That's all I have to say about it .....
