It was really the worst movie I've ever seen. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? And she looks terribly awful through the movie, hair is so bad! They speak like monotonous voices and nooo chemistry. The DVD cover doesn't even go far beyond what the movie really is. Really, really boring. I had to move through it because it was so painful to look. I really want to know how I could think someone on earth is that good? hhaha they literally like to talk and say "yes" and have no passion. I couldn't say at all that they were in love. I'm sorry, but it was the sadest excuse for the movie I think I've ever seen.
