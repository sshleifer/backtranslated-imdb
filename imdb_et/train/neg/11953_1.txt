Do you know the movies that are cinemas? You're there in the best seat, at the center of your special sweet place, which you exchanged three times before you just got the right seat - and after what you feel like 13 hours, you're still trapped, uncomfortable and itchy, thinking "If F *** is this movie ever going to end ??? " (You feel - think A.I and the village). <br /> <br /> Visitor Q offers a strange version of this feeling. I was sitting there for the first 30 minutes and wondering when it started! It's infinite! So "Arty" is painful. This is the first Miike Takashi movie I watched. Apparently he's making films by dozens and if they're all like that, I suspect it's the last one. <br /> <br /> I am not against Pretentious w @ nk. David Lynch is among the top ten leaders amongst me, but the visitor Q is a cut, a cheap, and a revenge. <br /> <br /> As you have already worked, I hated it.
