Another great movie about Costa-Gavras. It is a Latin American and US participation in Latin American politics. The facts may or may not be accurate, but it is true that the US participated in the dismissal and support of Latin American dictatorships. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film's typical left-wing / communist propaganda of the Cold War era follows. Costa Gavras is known for its communist compassion and its films are always biased. For example, he presents US activities brutal and inhuman, while representing Tupamara's extreme activities as something positive. <br /> <br /> As it turned out, it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of Latin America that the US was involved. Europe is full of poor Eastern European prostitutes. I have never heard of bad Uruguay or Chilean girls who massively prostitute themselves, as is the case in most Eastern European countries. The US fought with a messy war and god, blessing us all with the monster of Soviet Communism. Unfortunately, the US had to do what it did in Latin America (and elsewhere), but sometimes you have to play dirty. It's not an idealistic world, as Costa-Gavras and Matamoros believe. If Matamoros had come to power in Uruguay, we would have had another Ukraine in Latin America. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film follows the ideology of corrupt and bankrupt times and tries to convey it ideologically and morally.
