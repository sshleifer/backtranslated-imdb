"Algie, the miner" is one of the bad and uncomfortable silent comedy. Closing timing is completely off. Such humor is with certain sequences that make you wonder whether they should be funny or not. However, the actual quality of the film is not relevant. This is a must-see for film enthusiasts mainly because it is one of the early examples of gay cinema. Algie's main character is a feminine man who acts like a stereotypical "armor" of many early films. The film has a homophobic attitude. "Algie, the miner" is pretty terrible, but interesting from a historical point of view. (3/10)
