This is indeed the change of god of Jane Austen's novel. Compared to the American version of Guinneth Paltrow, the script was written to resemble as many books as possible. But acting was terrible. In addition to Kate Beckinsale, who thinks this was the real similarity of Emma, ​​all the other participants tried too hard. Mark Strong was not the "gentleman" he was supposed to be. He was often rude and insulting, had no feeling, and throughout the film he didn't see his entire Emma's love growing. It had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale, who seemed to have sought his leading role and his partner "resque". Besides, not all the cast chemistry. Harry Smith, played by Samantha Morton, seemed to have no real detention for Mr. Elton, played by Dominic Rowan. Therefore, he did not seem as cordial as he was depicted in the book. Movie settings are also too bad. Costumes are even more. I would have imagined Emma Woodhouse dressing in a fashionable and elegant way she did here. The end is also too long. It's good that it resembles the end of the book, but it's a movie killer. And again, I don't see Mr Knightley's sense of happiness. All in all, I believed that this adaptation was loyal to the book, but with poor actors. It seemed that the film would have been made without a budget. I would like to see a "lighter" version of Paltrow and Northam, even if it is clear that it has been "blocked" when looking at these actors (except for good Olivia Williams and better Kate Beckinsale). the whole script.
