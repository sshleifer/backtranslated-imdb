I testify that I only looked at a handful of episodes, but everyone seemed completely different. It seems that after the first season, the producers decided to completely withdraw the exhibition, to mark the signs, to introduce new ones and to write the whole exhibition dynamic. <br /> <br /> As you have already guessed, this exhibition is beautiful. , an unpredictable teenager, Holly (Amanda Bynes), who is moving with her magnificent sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) in New York. Decent enough premise: odd couple + fish from water + high jinx. <br /> <br /> Although I miss the weekly sitcom, this exhibition unfortunately jokes repeatedly, and it is sad because they have a decent talent Everything they demanded to change the show (Val lived with a regular bf of one season, then he suddenly went, so he opened the baker? What?) When things change it is a sudden feeling that even * show * knows it's bad. I mean, brand new sets, characters and new ones show regular! <br /> <br /> Side note (it's just nitpicking), I know it's TV show and not real, but Val and Holly live in a large attic (there are stairs) with a terrace ... MANHATTAN! Are you serious??
