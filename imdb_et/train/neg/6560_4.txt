"Shadrach" wasn't my favorite movie. I found that it was too sentimental and the action was under par. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good, but some other actors were not at all credible. I also didn't believe Paul's parents would go away and leave him with the Dabney family, especially if they had a housekeeper at home. Their social classes were too far to believe. It seems that Dabney's lifestyle was too exaggerated. At the beginning of the movie, there was a scene that showed Andie MacDowell to leave the car after having sex with someone. Who was it? His son? What scene did we have to show us? Why was the scene even involved? It had nothing to do with the rest of the film and it never really refers to it again. It seemed free and didn't fit the story at all. The film had too many contradictions for me. The story of Shadrach was nice, but I wasn't sure that Dabneys would have been as kind and generous as they were imagined.
