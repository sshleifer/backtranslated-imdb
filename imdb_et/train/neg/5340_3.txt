*** SPOILER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I love Tim Roth, I really do and he does his best with an incredible role. I see how this is a movie that can be good in the script, but it's complicated, unlikely, and ultimately silly. I saw a fake death ending a few miles away. Rene Z. is struggling with a well-written part and so is Patricia Arquette. A detective whose name I don't remember (what is not Chris Penn) is a great sweaty actor. See if you're not smart enough to distinguish a movie that is so smart that you can't follow it, and so confusing that you don't understand it. See if you like the work of a cheesy camera that makes you sick. See this when you love to watch Tim Roth working with a heavy script. See if it's free for late night. Otherwise, rent ordinary suspects.
