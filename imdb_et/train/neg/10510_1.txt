oh god where to start ...... bad behavior .... characters you just don't care ... are they american or british ... they think they are in america because where else is this huge in the middle of the forest ... <br /> <br /> one big mistake ... they drive all night through these forests ... if they don't go around and they would have been in Scotland in the morning .. when a tiny little kid strikes a poor traveling woman. ... <br /> <br /> and they are mobiles that do not work .. so what they do ... of course, are more easily taken out ... so three are looking for a house that can be there somewhere in the middle and two will care for the unconscious woman ... so what do they do, not make their comfort soften their head, cover it up or move it from the flowering path when they just left the hard road when they go and fire 100 years away. and all the time they have a caravan. put it in ... <br /> <br /> and beyond horny angels who should keep the human desire so much that they are out of heaven to live among us ... so what do they do? to start sexual relationships with all the men they come across? ......... they don't bite them into big pieces and hang their heads ... I think they don't have a point ... they are not gorgeous sexually affected former angels they are hemp products vampires ... and like tom savin saying how breath beautiful they are .... well these gals have good bodies but nothing special in the facial department. the leading role was much more beautiful than the so-called. irresistible sirens ... <br /> <br /> garbage waste Â£ 2.30 from my local library ...
