I think I agree that many of the comments here must be fake. Even if the film is not necessarily bad, definitely below average. "Dark Remains" is basically a Ghost Movie, which requires your own ghosts and bad emotions. The film begins with two readings, which are loosely web-based and which are not linked later. The couple loses their child, which is found in bed. They move to the country house to escape their past and guess what ... the house is haunted. From there, Dark Remains starts with some frightening moments very slowly (the first ghost shows are nice and the torch sequence worked very well). OK, then ... The woman sees the ghost of her daughter, other ghosts of people who died in accidents or suicides appear, the person tries to solve the mystery of the past of the house, the woman becomes depressed, strange neighbors appear. There was a lot of it there, but the assumption that it is their own emotions is great, so you're waiting for a twist. Not twisted, you just confuse the story of a haunted house, a strange neighbor, a totally useless horrible prison, and a dead daughter thrown with a photo idea that reminds me of a lot of "shutter". The end is ridiculous, because when you start and finish this slow movie and piano music, it's pretty flat to add some ghosts that look like a zombie flick. <br /> <br /> To make it short, Dark Remains could have been a nice scary story if the script didn't try to go anywhere and get there. feel and contradict the main environment of the film. And next ... please never use abandoned prisons again. It is so worn out and in that case it makes no sense. "Hey, this horrible prison uphill lets you shoot there." I think there are many blends in this mixture in the dark residue.
