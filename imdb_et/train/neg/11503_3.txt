Quentin Crisp once said that if things are too beautiful, it's romantic. If things are intolerably gloomy, they are realistic. And if something is ironic, they're on the ground. Unfortunately, Leon de Aranoa falls into the second category. This director has obviously been trying too hard to make a Spanish "Ken Loach" movie without being able to capture the comedy and warmth between characters, which increases Loach's movies just "depressing". Los Lunes al Sol is just what is only frustrating. Things are unreally gloomy. Criminals who have the worst moments reach the same point and if the glum story is not enough, Aranoa will wash the story visually with a gray and gloomy color palette. The films were ridiculously overpriced by Goyas. The film, which shows empathy with the weaker citizens of society, in this case the unemployed port workers, does not automatically make a good film, although I would be the first to the fate of these people. This film succeeds me in changing my fate. In the 21st century Spain, unemployed people like beggars do not work, and public transport boats have decent toilets, and it is hard to meet a bar with so little redheads and little luck. Obviously, Leon de Aranoa has no idea about the working class in Spain and does not support it. Unfair is the only conclusion I can make. The scene in which men watch a football match for free is directly copied from a film that deals much more "realistically" with the "poverty" trap, namely "purely Belter", a topic that is far more interesting, humorous, and yet sad.
