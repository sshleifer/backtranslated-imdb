I'm sorry to report that I've seen this movie many times. When it was bombed in a box, it was repeated at night in HBO for about a month. And I watched it over and over, because television in general is so bad - or at that time. I no longer look so it may be wonderful now - as Samuel L Jackson says about the pigs: "It may taste like a sweet potato bulb, but I never know, because I don't eat dirty cattle." Let's see. Dudley plays in Arthur's desert, always a few steps behind Moses. It came out right after Bryan's life so you can guess where the inspiration came from. Few funny jokes move too long until you just close your eyes and teeth. There is one scene where Arthur and Dom Deluise meet in the desert, both dragged and dessicated, dying of thirst. Then they meet like old acquaintances, who did not know each other very well, promise lunch. It could have been funny. <br /> <br /> But the scene I remember most clearly is a meeting with Pharaoh, where Pharaoh is a black street boy made entirely in King Tut regalia. He must have read the lines straight, because at some point before his release, they overcame their scene with Hollywood's equivalent black street, which was expressed by Jimmy Walker wannabe (Kid Dyno-wannabe). Or could have been Jimmy Walker - who knows? Who cares. They managed to make a basically boring scene a very racist, very unlikely, very long stool, one of the legendary things that just didn't shift, no matter how many times you try, so you leave it to someone else to deal with. Well, this is my review. If you rent this movie (DO NOT BUY, HOW TO DO!) Prepare yourself with a Tequila bottle and six Corona packs. <br /> <br /> Now that they have rebuilt Poseiden's adventure, one is likely to be on the list where you can rebuild. Maybe they are hiring a comedy writer this time.
