Maybe I'll give it a propaganda film 6 or 7 because it shows when and how the propaganda film will be successful. If there are people who look at this piece and think that "the Jews must have done something to be treated as they were treated with WW2", then the film is very cleverly made to hide "why and" how and how correct there are and wrong observations on how people live. What more is the purpose of the propaganda movie? The part that includes the American film from the Rothschild family has been reused, for example. The question of why a Jew keeps his wealth away from an officer has never been asked. No one mentions the tax system in this particular social layer. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the film's excitement (or level of disgust) increases slowly in the film, and the end of film solving is a goal and goal of propaganda. Audience leaves joy and gratitude for the times that come up ... well done. <br /> <br /> The film has the simplicity of dealing with the most emotional perception of the audience. The film is such a history today, so there is no need to really bring it to life. Nonetheless, in the case of the simplicity of ethnic degradation, a careful observer may find it important for today's cultural anger, violence, discrimination and integration problems. Generally a fine trash can.
