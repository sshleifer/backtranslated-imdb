I just saw this movie and I have to say that it was a big waste of time. The girl who played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) can't work at all. She read her lines very naturally and had a very natural facial expression through the film. Petran was played by Rosanna Munter. He played his part very perfectly. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS! The story was simple - we've seen it many times before. She breaks down, she finds another, she gets jealous, she breaks with another girl and finally they get back. There was no surprise at all, knowing that Eva would break down and that Adam would "stay" on Petra. The only thing nobody saw was that Petra told Adam he was at Eva's party. He became all serious, which is Petra's side, which the viewers had not seen in the film before, and said he had won Eva's heart, which was really cute. <br /> <br /> Next to Rosanna Munter, it's not an actor who gives a memorable result. <br /> <br /> This is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors, so I don't recommend it!
