I tried to watch this movie twice and even fast on irritating parts, but still couldn't do it. <br /> <br /> I don't understand how this movie * really * got good comments. I think those people who make such good comments are trying to mortgage the movie for marketing purposes. Their reviews seem very unrealistic and seem to be an internal work that makes things worse. Movies should get really positive comments on their steam and not driven! <br /> <br /> The exhibition resembled a cheerful porn movie, not a funny way. I don't mind badly running low budget movies when they know how to work with it. <br /> <br /> I found that the nature of lead is irritating. His facial expressions and humor were unbearable for the children. I thought it was deliberate to make women's conspiracy more sensitive and justified, but they were even worse. The script was also very inconvenient (his bosses over business call) and inconvenient sarcastic remarks. <br /> <br /> I didn't find anything to redeem this movie except for some attractive women. <br /> <br /> Never felt that rating was misleading. I liked this premise, but scared everything else. Of course you will see it if you want, but I just didn't want anyone else to waste their hopes on their time. Maybe it's just me ... Probably not.
