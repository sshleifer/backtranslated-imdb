The television channel explosion must be forever grateful to Randolph Scott's western production line, as there must always be one that seems to be one hundred Randolph Scott movies that play at least one off-budget station. <br /> <br /> "Man Behind Gun" is a typical melodrama in the early 1950s that was preceded by World War II production values ​​based on a historically topical mystery piece hidden in action steps to hide the complete absence of the script and thus lack of interim control. In the following years, the role of these films was taken over by television programs such as "Gunsmoke", "Bonanza", etc. - and they did the job better. Randolph Scott, especially in this church, is a good man who fights against the bad guys he finally wins. It no longer cares about what it emotionally passes through, as what a horse knows, if you don't think it solves the initial misunderstanding with a female leader. Music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of "characters" than it works. But it is good if it floats on your boat; and I wouldn't like to enjoy you "Diagnosis, murder". <br /> <br /> Work, pedestrian and aging fast. 3 stars to be competitively assembled; 0 for artistic endeavor.
