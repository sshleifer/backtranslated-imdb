Okay, what the hell is TRASH now watching? "Witches 'Mountain' must be one of the most inconsistent and craziest clams in Spain, but at the same time it is strangely convincing. There's absolutely no point here, and I doubt there was a script to work with, but I couldn't turn it off anyway." you start scratching your head, a little angry little girl who killed her mother opens up. So you think this movie is about children in the hands of evil forces? Heck no, because after that, the girl and her evil are no longer mentioned. cut the guy with the most obviously cut mustache that you will ever see, who will disintegrate with his girlfriend quite uncomfortably. If he asks him to spend his vacation, he will immediately call his employer asking him for a task! Great motion. Finally, the film begins now when it is traveling isolated Although not before she gets a new girl (Patty Shepard) and photos on her topless! do any strange events occur during this period? you guessed it? has never been explained. The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, hardening hardening music everywhere and someone even steals the jeep! Really, the witches of raising cars? Obviously, the silent witch in turn has mountains and they are dealing with voodoo victims. It's as close as I describe the plot, but there's a good chance that I'm away? The atmosphere is more important here! "The Hill of Witch" is from time to time very horrible, with its spooky music and interesting film art. Supporting characters look all unnatural and scary Patty Shepard plays a good heroine. It is a type of European horror film that could have been legendary if only someone had bothered to write a structured scenario.
