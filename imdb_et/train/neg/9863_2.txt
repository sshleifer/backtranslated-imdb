Christopher Guest does not have to worry, his ultimate retention in the Mockumentary sub-genre is not a problem, not particularly that very unpleasant RPG player. Jokes are flat over. There is not enough substance to last a typical (especially rotten) length of SNL, much less than 87 bold minutes I watched to watch this drivel. Great William Katt (Greatest American Hero, House) deserves much more. One thing and one thing alone is that I saw it worthwhile in my mind and post it here so hopefully I just hope I will save someone with such a bad experience. <br /> <br /> My Rating: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Additions: 2 Audio Comments; 7 interviews with various cast members; 4 deleted scenes; & Theatrical Loader <br /> <br /> DVD-ROM Add-ons: 2 Wallpapers <br /> <br /> Easter Egg: Eyes on the picture in the main menu of the short scene.
