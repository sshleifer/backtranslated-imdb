A typical Goth chick (Rainbow Harvest, which looks like a cross between Wineta Ryder and a boy of Beetlejuice) goes even with the people he feels he has been wrongly bowed by the mirror he finds in his new house, with his and his mother (horror) ) The main thing, Karen Black, the only remote control good thing about this travesty) buy. The actor is pretty ridiculously bad (especially when Rainbow interacts with the above-mentioned mirror image) and has no fear or intercourse. This movie inexplicably created three sequences, each of which was a little more terrible than the latter. Like the theme, but with much better cinema events, people would just want to look for a "Friday 13th series" where a geeky girl finds an old cursed compact mirror. It reduces more chills in 40 minutes than the entire franchise has offered to four films. <br /> <br /> My Class: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Charlie Spradling Provides Mandatory R&D
