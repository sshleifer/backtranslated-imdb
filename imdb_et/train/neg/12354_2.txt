Of course, I didn't look at the GI Jane selection. I was more or less forced to watch this movie around my former girlfriends house. <br /> <br /> GI Jane loses her credibility right away, trying to convince the viewer that this is a potentially real scenario, which of course is not. The result is that the story is automatically bounded by constraints, limiting the number of humor (none of which) or entertaining scenes, and soon it becomes too serious. Thus, the film becomes very boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> GI Jane fails when other films succeed, mainly because movies like James Bond, Dirty Harry and others are bigger than life, but never preach any other way. They are escapism and therefore entertaining. "GI Jane" is trying to be real and unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing movie from Ridley Scott, who has a very incredible story, remarkable action and the only reason I give it to him. 1/10 instead of some technical work.
