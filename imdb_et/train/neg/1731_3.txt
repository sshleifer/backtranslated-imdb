Twilight Zone has achieved some mythology - like Star Trek. This is because there are many dedicated lovers that no matter what each episode was a winner. They are the ones who evaluate each individual for 10 and are unable to objectively assess the reading. That's why I looked at all the original Star Trek episodes (good and bad) a while ago, because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive. Now is the time to do the same for Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> Although I have a lot of episodes 10, it gets 3 just because it was bad. Writing was actually embarrassingly bad. Throughout the episode, there are two great people who are on the opposite side of the war. After a while, it is obvious that they are the only two people who have left the Earth - as you learn in a truly stupid and completely convincing conclusion. Usually the episode changes at the end - it killed it!
