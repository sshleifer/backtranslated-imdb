My friend, my husband and I advised you to invite another couple to this movie. I really apologized for them - all four of us hated it and spent all the time watching our watches, waiting for the end of the movie. Half of the vignettes are weird, very little entertainment. There were few scenes in Paris - for example, I was looking forward to seeing pictures of the Latin Quarter, but I couldn't see anything. Most of the scene was inside the bar. No one in the theater laughed or reacted in any way. If you like a strange, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual movie, don't miss it. If you are on earth like me, you will be sorry if you saw it.
