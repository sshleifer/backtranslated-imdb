First of all: I love good Splattermovies and I'm not afraid to get in touch with art, but this zero estimate is not one of it! The picture quality is so wretched, the sound I heard the most annoying, and, as for FX, the super-low quality has seen some of them not in the halban or in the real movie (which this junk isn't here). There is no concept, bubble pad, primitive action, and rare dialogue - I think about the whole movie I thought about 10 sentences, about 20 times each time ... the same number of movie sequences (can mean What audience was this mess !!!) Story it seems that the young boy had to look at his father's rape and kill his mother, got psychological damage and the adult wandered through the self-injury of the show. So far it is so good ... But for these pseudo-art-idiot leaders, this plot is just a line that puts cheap produced shock scenes sequentially, with no message or no sense (freshly taken intestines are thrown naked, tied to a woman's hole in the ground. .. why? and why is it the only time you see a woman and a thief in a bloody "movie"? Annoying? Yes! Sick? Yes! Needed? No! Artistically? NO !!!!! Anyone who deceives this cheap gore-show art should visit his psychiatrist as soon as possible or watch Pink Floyd's "The Wall" to see how a similar theme can work artificially ... I hope it was your first and last (! !!!!!!!) movie, Andrew Cobb ... !!!! And all you have to do is remember: Not everything that seems cheap and obviously makes no sense is automatically "Art" ...
