I just finished watching Going Overboard. I have to say that we should send all copies of this movie to Iraq and make them look. I even tried to look at the blind women and turned it off in 20 minutes. Adam Sandler couldn't find a better project than this? As far as writing is concerned, if that is what you want to call it, those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever! I believe somewhere I read that the budget for this movie was $ 10,000 and they were still there. Was Wallmart a good deal in this regard? Each store has a large trash can on the floor. The only good thing about this movie is that you can use the DVD as a camera or sell it to a friend, but then they may not be your friend anymore!
