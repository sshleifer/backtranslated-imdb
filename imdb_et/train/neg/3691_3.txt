I'm not a big fan of Rajnikant first, but Baba was a big disappointment. The activities and songs between the storm were just mediocre. The story is very preaching. Instead of working in an office like NTR or MGR, Rhin seemed almost like the next big guru in Tamil Nadu. My wife tells me that after this movie was announced, she ripped more movies! <br /> <br /> At first, we had happily bought Babu (grandmother of Sivajiganeshan) who tried to buy it. .... it was a great movie that was made to buy this purchase unless it makes Baba even worse, <br /> <br /> Bryan
