Having just seen it in TMC, I think it's fresh. It is obvious that although the stogs are marked with letters, they are not actually shown. First, they are divided into two groups - Moe, as "Shorty" and Larry and Curly as a couple of heaps, so there's not much full teamwork. The love story that heats the plot is uninteresting, the two women are the only ones who have the ability to act, there is another musical group of stogs that have failed, unless you think their efforts to be funny. The music is tiring, they ride to the car and then depend on horses, western dorky wear is stupid, and the film has a lot of movies that don't have stooge. By the way, this is obviously after Curley's first stroke and his reduced energy level is clear. Vernon Dent appears early on. I loved everything that these guys ever did, including all the non-Curley stuff, but this little dog is pretty bad.
