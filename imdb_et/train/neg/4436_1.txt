I gave this movie a rating of 1 (Awful). The only reason he should get to one big instead of -0 is Ben Kingsley, who always shines when the terrible material is thrown. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is so characteristically here that, as a viewer, it simply cannot be overcome by even being a piece of it. <br /> <br /> Stupid, stupid story and terrible production. DO NOT waste your $ $ video rent.
