In the late 80's, the unexplained rash of supernatural horror films was seen by ghostly imprisonment films. Renny Harlin's ultra-bright and moody "Prison" got all the haunted hoosegow ball rolling; it was immediately followed by a noticeably worse "The Chair", John Saxon's enjoyable trashy "Death House", a satisfying psychological image of "Destroyer" and this amazingly limp'nhletic exercise hopelessly comic. <br /> <br /> Your usual annoying collection of horribly insecure college student chowderheads leads to insufficiently spineless tortured twerp Alex (tremendously unappealing Nicholas Celozzi) to go to Alcatraz Island to explore the odd circumstances associated with the sudden gruesome death of up-and-coming rock star Sammy Mitchell (plays Toni Basil's "Hey Micky" fame). Alex's brother becomes the infamous demonic spirit of the infamous Cavalry comedian of the infamous Cannibalistic US Civil War and continues to kill, forcing Alex to overcome his passivity and stand against this ghoulish spectrum. <br /> <br /> Although Nicholas Von Sternberg was photographed in a tiny manner, with some decent gore sets and a fair amount of spooky atmosphere (the movie was hit in the frustrating, rusty, lost places of the island of Alcatra), the "slaughterhouse rock" doesn't cut this solid, effective as an intimidating feature. This is largely due to uniformly unattractive and unlikely collegial characters, tiringly smirky bunches, whose comics are more like a racket than a fun. The plane that works with the pains of interest is even more important because once Playboy's playmate and undeniable blonde cutie pie hottie hopes Marie Carlton is particularly irritating to Linnea Quigley's impersonation as a symbolic excessive nymphibimbu. Dimitri Logothetis shows a smooth visual style, but the tone is uneven between serious gravity and silly, terribly sophomoral stupidity and most harmful, Ted Landon's sloppy, inconsistent, too complex, and ultimately confusing script badly fails to get the necessary internal logic to make a far-fetched story even remotely credible. In other words, this stinker will be badly felt within 90 minutes as a punishment for cinematic films.
