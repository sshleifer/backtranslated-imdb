Wow, not only this film is a "new lesson for truly bad taste", but also a lesson for "making a real bad movie". Don't do it wrong, I appreciated the concept of "Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence", but at the same time you have to understand if the movie is terrible. If you don't miss the story, the Zombie '90 plot will have a government plane carrying toxic chemicals that happen to fall into the desert, causing chemicals to leak, making local people fearsome zombies. The next thing you know is zombies all over the city where people eat people, while a cozy-looking doctor and government agent are trying to find out the disease that makes these people eat each other - so called "Extreme Pestilence". Since then, everything we see is zombies that have a local day every day - nothing more than extreme and sick outbreaks and cracks, with endless coarse and gore buckets. Since it is a German film, the film had to be duplicated in English and if you do not laugh at the zombie diets, the voice commands are quite fun and fun. As the user of UnratedX mentioned * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER *, the film has a scene that goes beyond the acceptable and unacceptable boundary, that is, a scene where a woman wearing a toddler is wheeled around her wheelchair with some guy and a horde of zombies coming out and attacking them . One zombie grabs the child and hangs it up, eats his organs when you hear baby crying. Wow, this is a new lesson in REALLLLLLLLLY bad taste. Dirty, I'm telling you, cruel.
