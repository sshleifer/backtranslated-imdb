... did they bother with this movie? Someone? I didn't think so. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an age class movie, go for rent in the summer '42. It's not the '42 summer. , there are a lot of curse and skin around, just to make it look "artsy". <br /> <br /> Sarsgaard made his usual uninteresting, cardboard character that was thought out in moments that had to be intense. Strength is in people with bi-polar disorders. <br /> <br /> Miller is the most famous in terms of appearance and what he had to say about the city of Pittsburgh after this movie. Pittsburgh should hold him against. He gave the wrong Pittsburgh mother tongue wrong. <br /> <br /> Foster gave Sarsgaard a style of cardboard for his money. Wow! Was it his first role after graduation? <br /> <br /> So we have this weird triangle. Foster has a Miller drunk, but is his boss / girlfriend. He can't take Miller to bed. So he hangs out with Sarsgaard & Miller and looks at them. <br /> <br /> Then, after one of Sarsgaard's pseudo-intense moments, Foster & Miller gets it, the scene that we "treat" to every sloppy, weakening detail. Finally, just to round it up, you get Foster & Sarsgaard, with Foster in the role of Miller. Now I know how 2 guys get it (as if it ever was something I knew). remaining 2. It goes to the abdominal wall. Wait, wait! It was the pepperoni pizza I just had. <br /> <br /> I'd like to come back when this movie came out of my life.
