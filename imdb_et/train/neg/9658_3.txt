My God, which is an incredible movie! Reminiscent of so much similar to the scene in Mel Gibson's movie "We were soldiers" when "The company is not lost, they are just cut off" And another scene in Pearl Harbor when British officer says to Ben Affleck "If all Americans are like you, then God will help the country fighting with America! <br /> <br /> Put all three movies together and have enough BULLSHIT to fertilize the entire Sahara Desert. <br /> <br /> The story of the cut battalion may be real enough, but the movie could have done without the accompanying American preaching propaganda pandemic. "But the lost battalion is actually in its class?" <br /> <br /> "Do Americans think they are inspired by bravery?" this abdominal bloating has occurred (this movie) <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes were well done (3 stars), but if the script is manure then packed even in brightly colored ribbons, it's still manure. Writer James Carabatsos also wrote these other screaming hamburgers, Hamburger Hill, No Mercy, Heartbreak Ridge, anyone, please shoot him before he writes such garbage. <br /> <br /> Director Russell Mulcahy is also an Australian, God, shame !!!
