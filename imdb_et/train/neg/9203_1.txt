Many people want to refer to this TV movie when they claim that Hanks-philes' wide legions are there that Tom did indeed make filthy movies (I think the "Bachelor Party" was great, but that's another story). The movie focuses on the "Dungeons and Dragons-style" game that drives our young Gump into a hallucinatory craze. The story is charming in the early 1980s, focusing on how it is our imminent threat to our youth caused by these evil role-playing games. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I prefer to look at "Mazes and Monsters" as a turn for "What happened to Chris Makepeace?" story. we all remember him as "Rudy the Rabbi" in "meatballs" and when the unfortunate Clifford at "My bodyguard" where he gave us all the professional excitement, beat Matt out of Dillon. Few could claim (especially those who read "Dynamite!" Regularly) that he had great things. And then came Rona Jaffe. Between bad behavior and poor writing, the razor is thin, so I'll leave it to you to decide whose fault Makepeace is. I know the last big edition I saw him was "Vamp" and it was in 1986. He played a small role as Sean Penn's brother in "Falcon and Snowmobile", but by that time the Brat Pack torch had others getting straighter hair and brighter ones. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie in good conscience. See if you see only the younger, more idealistic Chris Makepeace before Rona Jaffe stands up to her soul.
