The reason I was going to give this film a chance to take 2 hours of my life (in fact it was only 35 minutes) was my desire to try and understand Indian cinema. All I've ever seen is some older S.Ray movies. <br /> <br /> Browsing through IMDb I found this one and after seeing the rating of 8.7, I concluded that it should be the one that unlocks unknown doors and brings artistic enjoyment. Oh, how wrong I was! The only logical explanation that this rating is 8.7 is that most of the 970 people who voted are India and their only venture outside of Bolliwood's production was Adam Sandler's films. <br /> <br /> With this rating, this movie ranks 9th in the IMDbis 250 Best Movies for Citizen Cane, Goodfellas of Psycho! I'm not really in the mood to watch and criticize, because there is simply nothing I have to remind you of this painful experience. My only hope is that there are a lot of prices that I like to find this movie - a common fool with lots of kitsch and cheesy music.
