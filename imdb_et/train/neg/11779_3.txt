I don't like this movie much. If you have read Puzo books or have been watching the first two films very carefully (especially the first one), you agree with me. <br /> <br /> Compared to the Corleone saga by Puzo's novel, this film's script is sometimes even ridiculous. Signs and relationships between them are distorted. The story goes somewhere, although it seems that the film is going in some direction. <br /> <br /> It is understandable that in the 90s Corleone saga should wait for different times and that we are not going to find things the way they were before. But on the other hand, I do not know why they had to copy some of the dialogues from other films in contexts when they did not fit. Why this? These seem to have been badly done sequences that are just trying to copy the original film properties. <br /> <br /> What is never understandable is that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino joined to do this. A man who led a piece like Apocalypse Now and a godfather must forgive almost everything he does in the cinema until he dies. So Al Pacino says he's an actor. But Mario Puzo shouldn't have written it. How? He harmed his entire previous job. What a shame, my friend. Puzo's novel "The Last Don" is a 90-year-old story about a mob and it's great. We can never talk the same about the godfather's plot.
