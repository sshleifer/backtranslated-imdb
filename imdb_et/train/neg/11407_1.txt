This movie is a great example of a magnificent book that the film has destroyed. Jacob Have I Loved is probably the worst film I've ever seen. No story, plots disappear and editing is terrible. First of all, this music is straight from the synthesizer and sounds incredibly terrible. Bridget Fonda's activities are decent, but everyone else is an amateur. I would recommend this movie to anyone who learns to produce to study how not to film, because it is full of bad scenes, bad transitions, and action that should have been fired again! Read the book and don't waste your time with this movie.
