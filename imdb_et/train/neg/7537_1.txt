And I thought the beach was bad, unlike the fact that this film has one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Don't blame her for a terrible script, if anyone can understand what the hell was about the idea of ​​the movie, give yourself a bribe on the back. Its a Cross Village and a crappier script. Its beginning begins with a certain eye and when it gets closer to the plot, it makes no sense and can't get me started until the end !! What was that? The only thing that makes this movie is Nicolas Cage's usual great humor and his ability to be funny in strange situations. If you are going to be an attacker and this is the only movie to watch, save yourself five bucks and just go back home and put some things on fire and when some ask why, just tell the stupid thing that comes to your mind, and there you go!
