This movie was all elements to be smart, sparkling comedy, but for some reason it took the dumbass route. Perhaps he did not really know who was his audience, but it is hardly a man's film given in cast and plot, but it is too slippery and buggy to turn to women completely. <br /> <br /> Once you've seen Legally Blonde and its sequel, it's like an amazingly terrible sequel. Big actors like Luke Wilson should wait for better material. Jessica Simpson could have managed so much more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller are leaving the supporting roles that are more foolish than fun. <br /> <br /> Many things in this movie were paintings, different uber-clich√© assemblies, last-minute misunderstandings, even the chaos of the children's party. It just refers to a lazy script writing. <br /> <br /> This movie should be enjoyable if you do not take it seriously, but it is as prominent as it may be better if you are likely to be disappointed and increasingly disappointed when scenes are passing.
