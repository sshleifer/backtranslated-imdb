I chose this DVD Dollar Store. The DVD was $ 2 for a $ 1 tripod, but since it was Michael Madsen, I thought that since I've never seen this movie, I still bought it. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I didn't do it like a movie. The film played more than a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else. I found that using the director's feedback didn't add a story to me. I would have preferred to view the story in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I will not throw it away as one of the other commentators, but it may be quite some time before this movie is reviewed again. <br /> <br /> Who knows, because it was the debut of Michael Madsen's movie, maybe he might have some archival value in the future.
