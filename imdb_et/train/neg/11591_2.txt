This movie is so incredibly bad that I almost felt it sick. Until then, the other parts had at least one good thing about it. The first part was tense and spooky. Part 2 was victory and fun. Part 3 was an interesting and big impact. Part 4 had great music, good special effects and new fun with Freddy Krueger. Part 5 is more boring than anything I've seen before. Alice, a much more beautiful blonde, part 4, is back with her boyfriend Dan. In some, this presumed Elm Street installment will become a daily soap. Newer characters seem to be tough and even this sweet Alice has a chip on her shoulder. Freddy seems to be out of it. She looks tired and doesn't look so harsh. His one liner seems to be inappropriate and different, where, as in Part 4, they can be pretty funny. Leslie Bohem's story never goes down and Stephen Hopkins's direction is so bad that my grandmother looks good! The whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unreal. It's also confusing and pretty stupid. Avoid part 5 at all costs!
