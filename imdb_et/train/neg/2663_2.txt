In an interview, David Duchovny said he couldn't even watch the first hour of this movie - nor did you. A scene where he asks the owner of the house where the murder happened when he can look around - change the name he gives, and he could have raised his performance for almost every episode of the X-Files. He's for the autopilot for the whole movie. Brad Pitt goes horribly over.
