I've never seen this movie, but I can tell you about one of those productions. While comedy / older radio DJ was in 1988, I got a call from the manufacturer. They asked me if I would write and record a bit of what they would get into the music radio as sounds from the TV (the television screen would never be shown). I said for sure, he wrote a parody of the 50's sci-fi monster, rounded up some sound effects and called another DJ, Pam Landry, to play the female part. When he happened to air at that time, he put a long song, joined me in the production room, and we cut the walk on one hand. Giggling, then he went back to his show when I confused twilight effects. We would never have done this if we knew that "Woodchipper's massacre" would be such a turkey - but then we didn't pay for our efforts! - Gary Theroux
