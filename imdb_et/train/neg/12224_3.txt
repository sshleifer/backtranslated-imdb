Barbara Streisand leads and celebrates this Jewish story. <br /> <br /> To get the chance to get an education, Babs enthusiastically hides himself as a boy who is not the most difficult thing because he already looks like a boy anyway. In his new school, he meets many male classmates who have no problems at all believing he is a man. <br /> <br /> Don't overlook the moments of inexperienced humor when the male Babes thinks he is a man, but picks him up on the "ground", sits "on his" and gently looks at his "eyes" ... * dull *. <br /> <br /> Medium film; splashy story something particularly interesting.
