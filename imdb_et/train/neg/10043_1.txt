I would have written this story, but there was nothing there. I would have liked to quote a couple of hard-hit dialogues from the movie, but "hinglish" is only funny in 5 minutes, after its overpopulation. I would have liked to sweat over the "keep u-guessing relationship" but it was as predictable as ... um mm, Yash Raj movie (?). I would have wanted to talk about the edge of the seat, but I don't like cartoons much. <br /> <br /> * sigh * <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is ideal for: 1. People trying to commit suicide - I promise it will put you over the edge 2. Sado Masochists - this movie much more effective than the barbed wire that Silas's guy wore in Da-Vinci's code. 3. People who explore alternative ways of spreading terrorism - I swear that leaving the hall seemed to be in the mood for someone to kill 4. Film Piraters: More power for them. If the movies deserve the audience to not be able to watch the money - that's it. 5.Barnacles, Most Types of Plankton and Green Algae - Because almost all other living creatures require somewhat larger IQ factors than what film offers. After that: the film director is of course his own species. (And I hope God is the only one of his own. Suffice it) <br /> <br /> Things that would have become this better film: 1. Story 2. Choreographer 3. A Scriptwriter 4. Stunt Coordinator 5. Story ( Did I already say that?) 6. Director - preferably one who is not in a mental challenge (although even the one who was challenged could have done better work) 7. Anil Kapoor = Bubble plague - Avoid at all costs 8. Mandatory Warning - "Watching Yash Raj Movies Damages Your Mental Health"? <br /> <br /> Things you like about the movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor - for obvious reasons 2 English titles - "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" are changing "My heart is empty", "Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya" changes "Im flirting Im a lover, Im a vagabond ". /> <br /> In short, Tashan is like the opposite of the heading cube - the cube should increase the player's IQ, Tashan promises to lower the IQ and that ... in just 2.5 hours! Woot! <br /> <br /> * sigh * .. But it's just me. I may be wrong.
