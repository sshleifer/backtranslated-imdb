... except for Jon Heder. This man tanked the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The plot sounded entertaining. The 29-year-old boy (Heder) still lives with the widow's mother (Keaton), who happens to be with new love (Daniels). Slacker son is jealous and wants to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage relationships. She also meets a girl (Faris). Heder's performance is annoying, which would be good, because he is playing a tedious guy, the problem is that the actor loses the loss of this act, making this man in the finals pleasant. Finally, you still want to personally hit your face and you're done. In the future, every man's film will go for me!
