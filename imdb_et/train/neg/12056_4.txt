This film is a good example of how media manipulation can help you sell a movie that is not just very unlikely to be TV. Puerto Rico has a widespread daily newspaper that has written about the wonders of this film, almost all others mute. Randomly, the second largest circulation newspaper belongs to the same owners. Weekly CLARIDAD is the only newspaper in the island that has analyzed the form and content of the film and noted all its shortcomings, clich√©s and poor writing. <br /> <br /> Just because the film makes some audience laugh with simple and obvious jokes and because it is possible to recognize actors and landscapes, it doesn't make it an acceptable film.
