The first noticeable problem with this uncomfortable title movie is pouring it. Ann Nelson plays grandmother here. Three years later, he completed the "Airplane!" as a woman hanging out while listening to Robert Hays pine Julie Hagerty. I didn't get this picture out of my head. <br /> <br /> Matt Boston is fifteen years old with problems. He has a headache. Her mother was nervous. His grandfather had a big heart attack. A chain smoking psychiatrist decides to find out what the devil is going to do with that family. First, he hypnotizes his grandmother Nelson. Nelson talks about the story of returning the first part of the film. The RV will soon have a mind that goes on and off the road. Then the big boulders start to hurry about it. The fear of older couples is scared, but they remain in the vehicle to move to the plot. <br /> <br /> Boston's mother begins to talk to some Indians mummies she is around the house. He feels good for the author and makes rich remarks about the bodies. The psychiatrist reads detailed notes and uses his imagination to fill the voids. We see the mother halfway, but her mental breakdown appears on the screen, like the heart attack of Gramps. <br /> <br /> Finally, patient resistance, little Matt. Matt goes under the hypnosis gun and talks about his story. She thinks the mother wakes up (it was done in 1977). Apparently, Mom makes the Indian mummy astralehi through the air. One of the hits of Matt like a bee hits the windscreen and Matt starts acting all crazy. <br /> <br /> Psychiatrist takes Grandma and Matti into the desert. Matt is now inexplicable in the wheelchair and the trio is facing invisible (and inexplicable) forces. <br /> <br /> Flocker has no sense of scene design. One pro here includes an RV that is in the desert along with salt. At a distance, a couple of boulders moving along the RV are observed. It's a pretty scary little scene that has finally been overrun. As boulders move toward the vehicle, special effects become apparent. <br /> <br /> Scenes where RV is off the road and then back in will take forever. Scenes where the grandfather is trapped in the RV roof, because it takes care of the dirt, takes forever. Mother's conversations with mummy take forever. Matt is out of the body, takes forever. This film will last forever. <br /> <br /> I was tempted to hit the fast back and forth button at least ten times. As the scenes were drawn, it was obvious that Flocker was padding. Cut the fat here and it would have been an hour. The final "explanation" that the grandmothers' spirits tried to kill those who were near Matt were not holding water. Did they live in RV? The filmmaker never produces the fact that spirits are not good in their murderous ways, they did not kill anyone! <br /> <br /> Because I was thinking of Nelson's "Airplane!" . Something to fall asleep at that time. Boston is terrible as a child who plays a fifteen-year-old cute ten-year-old with a smart alecky for all those adults who fall in love with him. <br /> <br /> Finally, Flocker has written and led the confusion. The title is just the beginning of this exercise, so that the audience is frivolous. It's not scary and like ghosts, you can still walk ... away from the tape shop. <br /> <br /> It is invaluable and contains some physical violence and mild embarrassment.
