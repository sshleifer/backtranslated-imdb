George Brent is a reporter who sends an interview to the heir. He is said to be the heir of the facial cream store. He interviews him in his yacht. They fall into each other in swimwear. <br /> <br /> It turns out (quite early) that he is not a heir. She is part of a cold cream advertising campaign. <br /> <br /> The film follows the ups and downs of their romance. <br /> <br /> Supporting casting does not support it. Davis and Brent wear the picture. Although it is quite predictable, it is also quite fun. It's not his best. But especially given the vagueness of this creation, it is not his worst.
