Okay, if you have a few hours of waste, or if you just hate your life, I'd say I watch this movie. If something is good for some laughter. Not only do you have obese, topless natives, but also special effects so bad that they are probably illegal in most countries. Probably the "PG" rating is quite humorous when you see Native Porn Extravaganza. I'm not going to give this film to my slowed brother. You couldn't even show it to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. The plot is sketchy and cliche and stupid and stupid. Action is terrible and the end is so painful that I look at the fact that I started to pour salt into my eye to take out the TV screen.
