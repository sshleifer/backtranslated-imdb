This ambitious film suffers the most from the genius of the writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson. A lot of better material (Altman's "Nashville", "Lumet's" network), this elephant elephant takes a little too long, a couple of misleading bypasses along the way (embarrassing musical difference, biblical plague) do not help. bad: William H. Macy, whose character and style would be easy to completely eliminate, Julianne Moore, that he is not convincing, and how many times do we have to see John C. Reilly's Sad Sack shticki ("Chicago" and "The Hours")? Tom Cruise compares well with his misogynous, disappointed mouth, Roller was quite fun. When talking about unpleasant mouths, the script had so many "F" bombs, they lost their influence over time. Don't even talk about the terrible sound of Aimee Mann's amazing and "Expedition" one, maudlin number started, distracted me at the beginning of the movie. I should have listened to the wall with a handwriting and saved myself for another three hours I was pushed to the edge of hell, one of the redemption functions that I have not mentioned in other reviews is the best performance in the bunch, the unknown role of Melora Walters Claudia, the damage of the damaged coke to self-destruction. His credibility was far beyond everyone else's. This film took itself too seriously and just didn't know when to finish.
