I rented this movie for a laugh. I would never have seen a SNL skit, but like Tommy Boy and Waynes World, it couldn't be so bad either? Answer: It was. This movie wasn't hard to relax at work after a hard day. I just waited for the graph and the funny part, but there was nothing. The highlight was tiffany amber thieson and that's exactly it.
