the film was sucked, it wasn't funny, it wasn't exciting. they tried to do so bad that it would be good but failed. and thought this movie is nice when this movie is the only reason why this movie is a success ... <br /> <br /> The fact that now 50% of 10 out of 10 this movie seems for me, it is pretty beautiful whether the public film is going crazy or that voice is unrealistic, which can be numerous and must be dealt with. anyway, this is less than average for a movie that advertises by mouth-to-mouth. Its success can only be described as admiration for marketing.
