There were only two things that interest me about this movie: I was expecting Owen Wilson's death and Catherine Zeta Jones. <br /> <br /> It was basically one woman. Catherine Zeta Jones was right there to offer eye candy. Liam Neeson was completely wasted in this film. Like Jones, he had no role at all. The film was all Lily Taylor (Ransom, ready to wear). He was the only one who had a real part of David Self's funny script. OK, it was his first and he redeemed himself on Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> I don't know what director Jan de Bonti's problem was. he did a great job with speed and twister. he really fell to work. Maybe he was still in the Disaster Speed ​​2: Cruise Control. He should thank his happy stars to The Wild Wild West, otherwise it would be the worst picture of 1999. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
