... the child's actors were annoying. It also seems that the makers of this film are trying to complete 90 minutes. At the same time, decent death scenes. If this isn't for death scenes, this movie would be very Disneyish. <br /> <br /> The main child's protagonist seemed almost as frightened as he should have been. When I was in the woods in the middle of a ghost-type personality in a tooth fairy, you can bet your ass that I don't drive and ride a bike. <br /> <br /> In general, I have seen even worse (that is, waiting for it), but this is not something I look at again, or I recommend someone who suffers if you are not an avid horror collector.
