Primary species come from the B-film legend Roger Corman, and as such, anyone who follows it must understand that it is a low-budget B movie and it knows it. kill the whole army doing this, they believe they have uranium, but not ..... It contains two Dinos who have a taste for human muscle ... Then the Crack team, who may also be called Delta Force <br /> <br /> OK, this is not Jurassic Park and yeah Dino's never clearly seen, because it's probably a guy in a costume that's not too different from Barney's dinosaur - but a little less scary, but it was about 1% for men in Jurassic The park's budget, and as such, does what it gets. <br /> <br /> Is it worth being in the 100's bottom? .... HELL NO! I think almost half of the voters who give it 1 - WAY WAY are too harsh, it's much closer to 4 ... it's actually much better than a whole host of other non-100 movies, and it's Sci Production value similar to Fi channel production. (again, movies that get too long from IMDb critics) <br /> <br /> The actors are welcome in the B movie, although no participant takes it seriously and the script <br /> <br /> Everything is enjoyable B-Movie - Not a Snob for Film <br /> <br /> ** *****
