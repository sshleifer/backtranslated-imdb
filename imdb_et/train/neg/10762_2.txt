It was the driving force behind my local video store. Don't make the same mistake I made. This film is tedious, convincing and generally boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and edited; I wrinkled in all the shared scenes. Dennis Hopper makes some rare appearances and is his usual independent self; his role was obviously not a stretch for him. And while the film is allegedly set in Puerto Rico, it looks much more than a Hollywood movie lot; All the main characters are Caucasian and many tend to speak English with pseudo-Irish accents. Strange. Anyway, if you see it on the shelf of a local video store, then walk.
