I've never watched so little time in the movie. The only rescue was the fast forward of the DVD device. It was like watching a barely produced CBC movie. Obviously there was no money for lighting, filming, kit, location, scriptwriter, editor, actor ... Oh, no story! I have to write ten lines of comments ... Bad, terrible, terrible, sad, embarrassing, embarrassing, delicate, nausea, paralysis, hostility, nasty, thin, icky, yucky, pukey, smelly, smelly, whistle, filthy, smelly, whistle , dirty, all -thumbs-down, and i dont know if i can continue with all ten lines of performance, how bad this crap-o-matic production was!
