This movie is FULL! I don't even know where to start, I'm speechless. I can't even describe how terrible it is. Blood is first fluorescent and actor is TRANSLATION! The only good part was the biker chick that saves the day. This movie was nervous, I don't see how it could even get 1 voice so bad. This seems to have been done by high school students.
