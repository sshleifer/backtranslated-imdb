Very bad attempt for a young spinal tap. At least the music on the spinal tap was good. <br /> <br /> It's really a sad case of Hollywood nepotism in the worst case. A bunch of Hollywood crowds, bad musicians and manufacturers are creating some "poopie" shows to get their kids to focus. Oh please !!! Potty humor was even bad. I hate this stuff if there are really incredibly talented children (musicians, actors and artists) who beat me there to succeed and this mess comes. <br /> <br /> Help u all !!!! Why wasn't Gene Simmons in it? Ameriac entertainment is below the toilet.
