After Highlander 2 (which I still deny), I thought it was impossible to make a sequel that could shout at me because it was so bad. I was wrong. I loved the original Wargames, but this movie is inaccurate with the details of the computer and the details of the original movie. The original Wargames had at least some cages that worked. Who wrote this movie didn't know anything about the computer, but how to use word processing. I doubt he even looked at the original movie. Operation is not even convincing. Please save yourself, never watch this movie. I don't care if the channel is on the TV and you can't turn off the TV. THIS MOVIE WILL BE YOURSELF.
