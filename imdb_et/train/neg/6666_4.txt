I really wanted to like this movie, but the story is ridiculous. I don't want to spoil this movie. - Don't worry right from the start if you know something bad happens - but here's an example of how sloppy this film is put together. Cowboy and "Twig" sail ridge above. Cowboy has a mustache handle. Cowboy and "Twig" get shot and run halfway down. Cowboy has been cleared through the rest of the movie. Sometimes a cowboy has been shaving on the back of a horse in the dark between a gun change and a mountain bike ride. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the action of the four main characters is certain.
