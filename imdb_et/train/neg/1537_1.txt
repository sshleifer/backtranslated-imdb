Really bad video game "movie" made by not one but two but three amateur video makers. <br /> <br /> If you are going to make a bad horror movie, throw at least some blood, gore and nudity. The props from latex removed hands from the Halloween store are some blood. There are lesbians and whores, but no nudity or sex. Lesbians spend a lot of time in bed, but only talk. <br /> <br /> It seems that editing effects will not disappear, disappear, wipe, etc. > <br /> The terrible music of bad heavy metal bands, the websites of which make up most of the final credit. Representatives of werewolves are rubber masks attached to the face of "actors" only. They don't bother even their brown makeup on their neck, hand or wrist. <br /> <br /> I guarantee that a 10-year-old camcorder can put together a better movie. rent or watch this movie, except an example of not making a low budget video.
