Well, this movie is amazingly awful. I was sorry for the participants in this project because I'm sure they didn't write their own lines. Sometimes they were lightly delivered with sarcasm, which made me believe that they were not taking this film seriously, nor anyone who was looking at this unpleasant shot. Looking at this "Being Unknown", I couldn't help but thought there wasn't much budget or competent writer in the team. But if you look at it laughing, you are happy, the film is disgraceful to mock you because I don't see how anyone could watch it and be proud to pump it directly to a DVD who wants to be a frightening fight against the film.
