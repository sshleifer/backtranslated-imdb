After part 4 success, the second order was a natural movement. But they should have stopped it before it started. Alice, who has survived Part 4, finds herself pregnant and it seems that Freddy uses her unborn child to her victims, of course Alice's friends. A strange nightmare that is very difficult for religious images and bad behavior. Special effects are good, but the film itself is not.
