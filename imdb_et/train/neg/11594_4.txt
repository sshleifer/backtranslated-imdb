Like Freddy Revenge, this sequel takes a pretty strange idea and doesn't make a big story out of the story. Basically, Alice's number 4 is pregnant and her child is haunted by Freddy, who gives her a showcase of haunting her friends. It has the smallest deaths from the entire series and wise cracks are quite poor, so spooky fans and comedy fans are not happy. <br /> <br /> I haven't said much about it. This is moderately interesting when you see Alice and Dan characters from four, but not watching the movie. Uninspriring and unenjoyable, maybe the only competitor towards saving it is the worst in the series.
