I wanted to watch this movie because of Eliza Dushku, but she has only a smaller part, and her character is not very pleasant. But the main character played by Melissa Sagemiller is an extremely beautiful and perfect joy to watch the whole movie. It is really nothing but his appearance and talent. He does a very good job. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite meaningless on this face. After a car accident, some friends are probably dead, but still live their previous lives, while all kinds of mysterious things happen. Some bad guys are after them, but we'll never know who they are (maybe they were in another car, but we don't hear what they are after). The ultimate scenes seem particularly film-like, but I don't get anything uniform about it. Open a scene where the bad guys (who wear some strange masks) cut the blonde's girl's wrist and collected some of her blood not being explained or followed. If the bad guys shouldn't be the surgeons who try to pull Cassie (Sagemiller) out of the dead, but no, it doesn't seem to work. Bad guys are just bad guys; they just interfere with a story that would otherwise have been interesting. In the supernatural story of death and love and sacrifice for whom the devil needs bad guys? <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
