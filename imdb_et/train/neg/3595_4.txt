I wasn't so "happy" as some others commented on this movie: I've never seen anything else ... say ... Sarno thinks. I agree with many: some actors who spend a lot of time on topless and (go-go) dancing are not really that attractive. I liked Fraulein Crank (?) ... she was so homey, she was cute! The action was also quite disguised, although the transmission of routes in another language could have led to much of the problem. Trying to follow the plot was a big chore: was there one? I wholeheartedly agree with another comment: there is not much blood in the vampire movie. Yes, if you want to suck high blood, check out the Hammer classics like "Dracula's Dread" and (My Personal Favorite) "Dracula Brides". <br /> <br /> The most (inadvertently) humorous is where a lady doctor gets her clothes off the bat, which you never see! ... bats, I mean. <br /> <br /> Okay, as the time runs when you take the cable here in the North of the Great White, but don't rent it for heaven!
