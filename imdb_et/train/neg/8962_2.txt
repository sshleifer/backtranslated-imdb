I think it sucks on the ice because it left the cube and gave us a lot of information about who and why. The original CUBE never left the cube and left everything to its imagination. But this fucking festival gives you everything. and I didn't like it ... Although the actor is sure, I think this reason was down, because it was done by people other than ORIGINAL filmmakers if they had prepared Vincenzo Natal, or even a sequel, I think it would have been better and would have been more of a source. so i suggest you stay far, far from it, and HYPERCUBE, another movie that i don't even want to discuss ... (i gave it just for show 2)
