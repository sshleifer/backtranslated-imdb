Gday Mates! I just watched the Croc Hunter movie. it was fine, but the show seems more real. It just seemed like a longer animal planet episode with more fun lines and more characters. Some things: Steve described Fangs as snakes as hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! for the realities you know it is painful. and cant they jump high? he is all tail and stuff. There were two MAJOR splits in this movie. if Terry thinks he's going to "We need to grow them like a child". Woah! I thought he was going to feed that child. that would be PG-13. While at Terry, someone made a film about the film and many exhibitions about Terry's knowledge of ritual mating. he knows his sex. The film takes place in Queensland, Australia. I want koala, dingo and joey! <br /> <br /> Steve's dog Sui is really a goal in this movie. albeit small, which proves not to be meaningless for the dynamite-warning hottie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if someone else follows it, try and agree with me, saying that the country's bumpkin fat lady with a dog nose was the right fold. She eats her sheep! I would also be crazy!
