It must be one of the worst stuff I've seen and I've seen some. It's slow, boring, amateur - not even uniform with your own simplified reading. Participants will not act. I can't blame them - they have been given a script of complete banality they can do, that is, through the pain that lies behind those eyes, which has nothing to do with SummersIsle's evil events. <br /> <br /> There is no moment in this movie that truly talks - not honest lines or any moment when it is moved. Nicholas Cage's character is so badly drawn that no one knows him through all his misery. I have no doubt I saw a man suffering there, but Nicholas Cage was fully aware of the fact that he was the worst in his entire career.
