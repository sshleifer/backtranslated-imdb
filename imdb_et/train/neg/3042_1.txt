I promise to write 1000 words about this movie, but one word may be enough: weird. This really terrible movie didn't laugh at me as much as gawk. We looked at each other for their best "What ..." expressions. This movie can't be described enough. Killer tomatoes were funny, but it's just sick. What kind of mind does such pictures produce and then puts them on the film for others to see it? What kind of mind does innocent children contain in this strange, strange film and pack it when it is suitable for children? Parents, whatever you do if your child still believes in Santa, don't let him see this movie. Preteens can see it - probably "What ...?" their face. If you decide to create this movie with others, you may want to draw your eggshell. <br /> <br /> It's probably the worst film ever made.
