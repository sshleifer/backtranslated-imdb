America needs the best man to win the "game", so who will hire them? A gymnast (Oh brother!), Played by Kurt Thomas, who has the skills to win in a game involving ninjas, crazies and Richard Norton, whom Kurt Thomas says to keep his hardware in the pants. (His exact words) I missed it in theaters and that's a good reason, because I would probably be defiled because I smiled regularly. The first thing that went through my mind was how these ninjas are flat when the gymnast can hit her ass. Kurt Thomas is like 5 feet 4 and barely hits one of the Best Man for Work. As for Kurt Thomas's acting talent, if you can't say anything nice ... Seriously, though, it's a wonder how much cocaine was used to make the idea so stupid. The only decision to throw Tara Reid as a scientist here. 18 years, although it was the title of the most stupid movie I've ever seen. Not to say that I didn't find it invisible, I laughed so hard to almost die. Twice. Only in the 80s did such a bad idea film. Although the only hero ever in the hero is a record, he can't even pull a sword out of the ground. It's ever a mental film and one of the most fun. <br /> <br /> * 4- (bad)
