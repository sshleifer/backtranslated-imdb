Unfortunately, Marry Harron decided to make Bettie's life a fictional view of the men with his problems. As is typical in all of his work, every major male character is depicted as a weak, bundle, or twist. To add to his fiction, Bettie Page, in his own words, plans ideas and questions that are not true. Bettie did not leave this because she thought it was morally wrong or was a religious problem (although she was born again later in life, under the influence of her third wife minister). He left because he was in his late 30s, his acting career had gone somewhere and he felt he was losing his appearance. In Bettie's own words, hints of incitement and rape have not been validated and denied, and whether the director's efforts to claim that every woman who did what Bettie did must fall victim to men. Harron does not pay attention to Bettie's design of his clothes on almost all of his networks (which "sick" fetishes didn't give him). Harron also does not make Bunny Yeager, who made many famous Bettie Photovoltaics, bettie with many "naughty" shoots and wasn't a morally fair professional photographer in the film. <br /> <br /> The only sustainable arm is Gretchen Mol, which looks like Bettie. Otherwise, other movies and documentaries will be more accurate and honest to your life and to the people who live in it.
