Back when I rented free videos, I picked it up. OOPS The things I wanted to mention outside the summary I have already presented were. 1: Someone who was much involved in making this film was a strange and sick food for food, it was difficult and necessary. 2: Against the background of the film, there is a band of sound that seems to be there all the time, and how I saw the trash after a day that I saw that they had something unconscious on the track. Whether it or it was just traumatically bad or both. Many times during the film you can say that the writer and director did not get much experience or talent. And don't even ask the actor.
