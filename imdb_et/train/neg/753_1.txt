Wow ... <br /> <br /> I picked it up at local Wal-Mart after reading online that it was early released. I've been following this network for quite some time and I just had to buy a movie. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> I think the thing that really hit me was editing or missing it. Time and again, characters (usually narrator and whoever it is) are shown ... and walking ... and walking. I'm not an editor, but I know you can skip point A to show that they're coming to point B. There's no need to show almost all of the journey! Wow ... <br /> <br /> I really felt somewhat regrettable for the participants in this area. They don't seem to have been given any direction on what to do during the scenes, except to scare or look happy, depending on what action you want to add later. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Why decided to make almost all effects with CG is next to me. Even ILM sometimes uses miniatures. One of the most annoying uses of the green screen in this film is the constant high-speed (final credit) representation of the same group of people representing citizens of different cities, including London. Sometimes these folk come and go without taking into account the angle of the frame or the distance from the camera. At least one man in six seems to be at least one foot in London, walking behind the narrator's brother (starring Anthony Piana without his disturbing mustache). Not after seeing GETTYSBURG, I saw such fake facial hair. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Why Timothy Hines talked about how he did this is out of me. It's turkey, simple and simple. On the plus side (at least for me) it has given some really ridiculous fun pictures.
