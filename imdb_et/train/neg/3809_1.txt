This exhibition is just annoying !!! I'm sorry that the actors have to try to be funny (especially Bob Saget), the laughing head is trying to cover up the sad jokes, and the "Awwww" trail comes up with the most unnecessary times. Children who are too dramatic are no exception, especially the Olsen twins. This show is also a city of cliché. If you wanted to search for the word "cliché", you would read "Full House". Every story is a "lesson" to learn at the end. A lucky speech makes everything better and even able to make the most difficult child suddenly realize the welfare of the GASP is too bad for it to be impossible in real life. I don't know how anybody could look at this example without the bad mouting of the signs or the laughing behavior. I find myself crying on the television saying, "It's not FUNNY / SAD / CUTE" If life were really like that, the world would break down.
