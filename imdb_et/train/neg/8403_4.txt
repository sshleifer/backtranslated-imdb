I gave it to four purely in their historical context. It was thought to have disappeared for many years until it showed blue at Showtime in the early nineties. <br /> <br /> Fashion is a straight man and Larry and Curly are acting duo. Spade Cooley has a couple of numbers. I think it had something to do with ranch work. I'm not quite sure, because the plot was so small that there was nothing in my memory. I remember this is a western musical comedy. Even Stooge seems to be in motion. In general, there is nothing to recommend here. <br /> <br /> If you are not a Stooge fan, don't worry. If you're a Stooge fan, paste the shorts.
