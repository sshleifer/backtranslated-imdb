Many times - not only by myself - it has been said that watching Eric Rohmer's film is like drying a color; it seems that Monsieur Rohmer deplores it (he does not deny it, but how he could just lure it) so much that his new film, which may also be his last, Inch Allah is so far back in time when it is like dry drying . The wonderful people who gave you Nouvelle Vague, Cahiers du Cinema has already called it one of the best films of 2007, so it should give you some ideas. The reality is not high on Rohmer's agenda, so in the 5th century in France we have one extreme church that wouldn't be in the Loire Valley, while the only other dwelling we see is a rude woodburner. The story includes nymphs and shepherds, and since he has often given Rohmer to unknowns who just happened, so the overall effect is that the annual classroom play at a special school for pupils with special needs accidentally hit the film. One is almost tempted to say, "Come back to Godard, everything is forgiven," but even this poor production can't express those words.
