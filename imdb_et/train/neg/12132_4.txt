The trio of low-life criminals led by Matt Dillon puts burglary in late night. They're fleeing, but they are quickly crossing the road with a police officer who just happens to be a terrorist. Of course, the police terrorist burglary was wrong, the real terrorist goes away and the burglars are forced to lurk in a small bar diving, taking hostages without knowing why the police wanted to catch them. And I guess who else has chosen the bar as a night sanctuary? <br /> <br /> Unbelievable? Absolutely. And it goes down the hill. Spacey got good acting ability; Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Blue, Viggo Mortensen and M. Emmett Walsh, but they're all wasted. Mostly because after all the characters in the bar are stuck, they all claim the rest of the movie. Endlessly and purposefully. Before you finish the movie, you have finished what happens to them.
