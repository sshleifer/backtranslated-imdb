I was skeptical when I first saw Calvin Kline-esque ads, but I thought I'd give him a chance. So I've been watching it and all I can say is tired. This movie was so bad. It's rare to hate this movie a lot. Watching this flick reminded me of these funny scenes in Altman's The Player when writers raise their bizarre ideas to producers. I would like to know which MTV manufacturer decided that the hour and a half years of music video was adapted by Bronte (but this time Heathcliff's name is Heath and he is a rock star and Hindley's name is Hendrix). /> <br /> Even this may not be so bad if they didn't get every other aspect of the movie so terribly wrong. The direction must be "you are lonely, me pout." I laughed out loud during all the "serious" scenes and I missed the rest. The camera's work was confusing and reminded me repeatedly that I was watching a bad movie that was trying to be sharp. My theory is that the sound worshiped and went to the beach with a couple of booms - everything I heard about the scene was waves. And in other scenes, I want it to be all I could hear. And talking about the sound they made with the Mercy Sisters of More "More" is absolutely unforgivable, then again it is unforgivable what they did with Bronte. <br /> <br /> The Helgelian side had one entertaining scene - specifically the moment Johnny Whitworth ceased to face Katherine Heigli - and if you can tell me what this scene was all about for the rest of the story, more power for you.
