Six geographical signs that are going to send home and empty, drunk and sneak into the Asian council. Two male dancers surrounded by hoods pretend to have a fight. Behind them, on the altar, a woven basket opens, and a picture appears that begins to imitate the snake, eventually biting one dancer. An imitation snake is dressed in some scarf body tights. (This is certainly a snake mocking a female snake). Of course, the GI will take a flash photo, the members of the cult will send to the angry hysteria, steal the basket containing the "snake" and drink it into Asian night. <br /> <br /> One of the boys, the most offensive and snarky, dies of a cobra bite on his neck, although no one can explain how the snake entered his hospital. <br /> <br /> Back in New York, it seems that everyone is fairly old news when empty men live in their civilian lives while still maintaining ties. Their jobs range from a bowling leader (David Janssen) to a college student (Richard Long). James Dobson, Jack Kelly and Marshall Thompson are also part of the neighborhood. Richard Long is a nice blonde girl. Kelly is a somewhat careless woman. But they all get well enough and they all look happy. <br /> <br /> Then a dark, funny, mysterious woman will appear (Faith Domergue) and Marshall Thompson loves her and guesses what will happen. The first Janssen is scared in the back seat and dies in a car accident. Then Kelly Domergue's visit. Something scares her so badly that she falls through the window and dies on the sidewalk in the fall. Long and Dobson are beginning to suspect what the viewer already knows - that Domergue has had something to do with deaths. They also think that maybe he's changing into a beaver that is so. Dobson is facing his doubts and he proves his point. <br /> <br /> By this time, Long and Thompson are thoroughly frazzled, especially Thompson, who is in love with Domergue and has discovered that he has attracted him, even though he has to explain to him what "love" is. Does not matter. Cobra's ultimate reckless attack on a long girl's friend - not one of the six original criminals - and Thompson has to throw the snake out of the window. On the sidewalk below, the body becomes Domergue. Final. <br /> <br /> I think I leave most of the questions that the plot raises. I just mention one of the most advanced ones. Who paid Domergue fare from Asia to New York? Who pays their utilities in the hotel? Who paid for his grand wardrobe? How does he speak American English so well? What the hell is going on? Writers and filmmakers have clearly seen Val Lewton's modest horror films, and although this work has not worked hard, they have lost some tricks from Lewton. For example, in Lewton's "Peoples", a woman has become a black leopard, but with one small exception, the threat is always kept in the shadows and it is even more strange. Most of the transformations made here also use shadows, but unlike Lewton, shadows are clumsy and unambiguous. <br /> <br /> Lewton also occasionally used what he called "buses". Lewton's first bus was literally. The potential victim rushes alone through the dark tunnels of the Central Park, but only the footprints. Something or someone is watching him. She freezes under the street lamp. Something goes on with his bush branches. She looks up. There is a strong, wheezing momentum that makes your hair end. It's a bus that uses its air brakes to stop it. Manufacturers used at least two "buses" in this movie and they are nothing. For example, the boy moves unevenly at the intersection and there is an unexpected truck that almost hits him. No picture set. It's stuck with a shoe horn. <br /> <br /> I don't care especially about movies that keep a snake stereotype like slim, ugly, toxic and phalic. Actually no snakes are slippery, most of them are harmless and many are extraordinarily beautiful. What's more, they are more feminine than masculine in their brilliant movements and serpentine approach to goals. Want a reptilian symbol of masculinity? Try a six-lined racer. It's really a quick lizard. When she sees something to eat, she pulls it up and pulls it down. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you want to see some subtle, low-budget movies, don't worry about it. Find "The Cat People" or one of Lewton's other smaller masterpieces, which is an obvious copy.
