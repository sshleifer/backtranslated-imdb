How many times do we have to see Scream-ripoff masking bad horror movies with a murderer? The Bleed plot is original, but the film itself is a complete failure. First, the dialogue is poorly developed, it is boring and wastes too much time on trivial details, it is bad, and so on. I want my money back, this rental smells worse than the skunk.
