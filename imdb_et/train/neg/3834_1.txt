Watching this movie, which had many years ago Gregory's daughter. It was open. In the form of a plot, there was a gently terrifying teacher and a friend who pulled very short skirts from girls aged 14-15. Previous comments seem to think this is not important, but I found it quite disgusting. If you have children at school, the last thing you want is to think that every young teacher is lusting for their students. We were surprised that the censor would let it through. Moreover, the film was just a waste of time. The script was bad and John Gordon Sinclair tried to rebuild his school picture, slightly nervous and out of the wall. Why would anyone want to be coveted in this performance is incredible. This movie didn't work for everyone. Terrible. Please don't waste your time looking at it. Life is too short
