It's a tired, but strangely childish, clich√© movie. In the basement there is a Nazi witch who performs sf-related tests? Oh please! <br /> <br /> With the aim of fear and fear, the overall impression of the movie is a very immature concept of fear. There's no expectation before, I'm left behind: outdated Xander Buffy and a hero who has a monkey-like face who doesn't seem to know how to act. Adrienne Barbeau told me that I only had a much more pleasant "Cannibal Women Avocado Jungle of Death" before. <br /> <br /> Camera and editing add an overall impression of the lamp.
