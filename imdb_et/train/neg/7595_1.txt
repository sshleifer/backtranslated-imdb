"Ask for dust" seemed to be intriguing in the trailer and especially appealed to all the actors. Unfortunately, the film was not weighty enough to be read, and it was not funny to be a comedy. It practically seemed to satirize itself and a fun effect. Seventy minutes after waiting for this thing to get better, I went out of my wife and I, and we appreciated that we would not waste that kind of mess. It was simply not interesting, moving, funny or artistic. It would seem to have been written, produced and staged by a high school boy; worse, it was a shameful waste of otherwise exceptionally talented participants, not to mention our time and money.
