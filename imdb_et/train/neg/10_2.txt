This film had many promises and the plot was relatively interesting, but the actors, the director and the editors were serious about the film. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for writers, it could have been good. Action is wood, very few characters are plausible. <br /> <br /> Who ever edited it, just learned new editing methods and wanted to spray them all over the film. In almost every scene there are many quick flash changes that are obviously intended to be symbolic but ultimately annoying. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie and wait for a decent balance of resolution, but unfortunately I didn't feel like I was wasting my time and wasting my money on filmmakers.
