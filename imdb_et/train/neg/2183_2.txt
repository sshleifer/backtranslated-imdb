This movie was really bad whether you take it as a sci-fi movie, horror or even comedy. The whole thing is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly (and is) inexpensive, actors don't know what works and the script clearly shows it's done with shooting. It is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not at all scary - it was even beautiful - and they thought they needed something impressive; they also failed here (at the end of the 50s it is terrible). <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows why manager Joseph Green's career as well as the writer has never materialized; he was both very bad. The same applies to actors who run and support. <br /> <br /> "The best achievement of a brain that won't die" is its short working hours.
