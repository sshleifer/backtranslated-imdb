I watched this movie a few months ago with my friends, I still laugh, thinking of some stupidity. The first scenes were fun alone. I don't break anything for those who want to see it, I don't want to laugh. Needless to say, throughout the time I watched this movie, I was trying to figure out exactly what the movie was about. After all, we all missed the initial fun and shock of this random movie. There is no plot and no trace of proper behavior. The characters are about as well developed as in the kindergarten "Learn to Read". They even made lesbian sex interesting to the scene.
