For me, it's just a soap opera. I think any image of bad people can be considered a "social comment". But ultimately, I am not interested in characterizing this film. No character is very pleasant or interesting. I didn't know any chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story here, it will disappear in paralysis. And despite the fact that Dorothy Maguire's complete and immediate (and therefore incomprehensible) rebellion-induced twist ends, the story is not enough to keep my interests. No matter how much Freud's symbolism and psychology is thrown away, this story is buggy, melodramatic, and trite. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is a noble wood. This is Lauren Bacall's least engaging role and one of her poorest performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack give more inspired performances, but her character is bad and she is pathetic. Robert Keith, a loving father of two wrongly grown children, is the most sympathetic character. The most interesting thing, however, is that Robert Wilke has a small role as a bar owner. He is best remembered in many western countries for being disgusting, but here he is an honest, pleasant companion. <br /> <br /> I have an interesting, interesting story and some pleasant character about my social comment, thank you.
