IMDB's rating was 8.1, so I waited much more for it. It starts with a funny and loving energy that seems spontaneous. But before the film is halfway, it starts to drift and everything becomes slippery to predict. Office characters were wonderful in the first third of the film, but we know them a little too well; they become cartoons, not real people. That's the same story I've seen hundreds of times, and I was just talking about a little different situation. The thing is that I could manage another predictable love story if only dialogue wasn't so outdated! also for Dead Letter Office. Hopefully this movie will soon arrive at Dead Movie Office.
