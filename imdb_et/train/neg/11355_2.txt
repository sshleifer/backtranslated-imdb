"Nat" (expressed by Trevor Gagnon) with his brain friend "IQ" (expressed by Philip Bolden) and always hungry "Scooter" (David Gore) are children with great dreams. They want to be the first spaceflight. And the one that encourages your dreams is the first spacecraft to let you hear, Apollo 11, waiting for its historic trip on the start platform, where the three are hanging. </p> Movie animation. I found it done very well. The terrain had its depth because things that were far away saw the focus of scenes. I didn't see the movie in 3-D, as it was in HBO. But I saw there were no scenes that exploited the 3-D effects except for fighting near the stars. I also didn't like the design of the characters. For me they didn't see anything like a flight, especially in painting. The flights were unusual blue-gray, which was disturbing to me. <br /> <br /> Cast performers were not bad, but it wasn't good either. There were several times more focused on your computer than the story. Writing was certainly written for a younger audience, where comic moments make younger children laugh. I didn't see anything for adults like jokes that they get a punch for adults to understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> History of this movie was not followed. In fact, I think it was completely ignored because the main focus was flying. I also hated when a well-known astronaut appeared on the screen and explained that the stories about the movies were flying, and there were no flies at Apollo 11. I liked how he thanked men and women who sacrificed when they were adults, not for you. It wasn't done for the whole family. It's definitely just for kids. But, it remains a rainy day.
