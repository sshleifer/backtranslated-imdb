Having just been watching this movie, I feel wasted for almost 2 hours of my life, but I think there is something good: <br /> <br /> If I rate it as another movie, it can only get 1 or 2 tops, but if i appreciate it with low budget ind. movie, it can get 3 or 4. It is a movie should be "complete" and without too long sections of boredom or waste of time. This movie is not. But I think many independent films show how to show film skills and, given this, there are some highlights on this film. If I would like to comment on what the directors should do for their next project, I thought the distorted sound effects were of some quality. They also manage to build some characters, but this leads me to what they should exclude in their next project, as character design takes too long because it is mostly irrelevant to the plot of the film. Also, the next project should not continue for a long time to move around, which makes sense? I think this movie is trying to be a little bit of everything (building characters, intercourse and plot), and it comes to nothing (not much) <br /> <br /> This movie is trying too much and too hard and I think it should have be a short film. I can easily find an hour's walk or meaningless dialogue to cut a movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many irrelevant things in this movie. The story should have been smoother. I know there should be a secret in this movie, but somewhat surprising who the killer is is not a secret. The story behind the "mystery" gets almost no attention during the film, leaving the final "point" for quick dissatisfaction. So I would like to say that this movie was a nice try, but I can't. I hope the directors will learn from their mistakes and will produce a better product next time. <br /> <br /> If you have no interest in producing low-cost movies, you don't have to look at it - you don't even see why everyone thinks it's bad. This film didn't get "10", far from the objective point of view.
