okay, this movie f * ck in 'rules. it is undoubtedly one of the most technically failed cinemas ever made. totally terrible, but you see GOTTA. rent it with your friends and come out for a drink or just have fun, it's fun. and the movies at the back show it, you can do something with paper plates and finger paints. awesome. Okay, rent it for just one scene: two characters will stay in place for about 3 minutes. the director (in the commentary) says, "yes, tracking was so smooth that it looks like ...". yes, the right man, they are completely walking in place. it's so funny.
