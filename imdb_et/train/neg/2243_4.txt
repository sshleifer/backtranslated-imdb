This is not even valuable, except for warning to potential viewers. This is a somewhat general ghost story about the actors who haunt the studio during WWII. There is no fear, no tension or surprise. One shocking moment that seems too shocking. The visual style is very flat and boring, though at any time it is really nice to edit. The story never comes together, and the movies are really just a complete bust. 4/10.
