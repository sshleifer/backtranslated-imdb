Considering that many horror films are based on the assumption that one or more middle characters make some kind of fool in the process, the girls of this film will collect the gold, silver and bronze at the Darwin Awards. The pope with a mental disability would have made better choices than it would have been, and would have screamed it a lot. <br /> <br /> If you like movies with a sharp image, intentional amateur camera work (my 92 years old) - an old grandmother using a better-performing video camera), extremely bad sound and a noticeable plot / narrative, this is your perfect movie. Also note that you should enjoy the following: women scream for no reason, women whine for no reason. In fact, there is not much reason and logic in this film. For example, "We have to find Stephanie" "Yes, I can't believe I talked to her like last night" "she called you last night?" "Yes, he wanted to talk about some of the dates he asked," "WHAT? How did he say to me"? Like us, a friend rides a shotgun with a serial number and a lot of cute weapons, but I have a problem with not telling me he's going to date. Okay, so the budget is low. That doesn't mean you have to look like it would cost half the budget. "Score" is interesting because all but one tracks are written and executed by the film's own writers / directors. In fact, it seems that the entire budget has been blown up by the Swedish Dumpfall dead metal band The Duskfall. <br /> <br /> The most worrying thing about the whole movie is the end that we have left to continue.
