I couldn't believe I spent $ 14.00 on it. The only redeemable quality is outrageous gore. Duplication was worse than I have ever experienced. It looks like it was shot with a VHS camcorder. I think every pfennig was spent on special effects because there was a lot of blood and body parts everywhere. Its one of the worst films I've ever seen, but I have to admit the rich gore that wasn't as disgusting as it might have been, because the whole movie is so stupid and incredible
