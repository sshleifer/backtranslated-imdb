The best thing about camp movies is to know what to expect. It's like looking at a professional wrestling game or a daily soap opera or Jerry Springer: you can immediately follow the skim, identify the cardboard characters, and look calm when all the clich√©s are filled. But sometimes the director does something unexpected. It can be something extraordinarily stupid or something strange or something insightful. Director Makinen is here with the best camp leaders and is his best film. <br /> <br /> Yon's predator seems to have come together. There's nothing good about that, but it can still be a united whole. Never let a movie slow down - the action flows and strikes. <br /> <br /> The odd thing is that you don't know the time: some characters seem to take some time, while other characters have just spent one hour at the bar. This is partly due to the summer in Finland, where the sun never lets, so you don't get the day at all. <br /> <br /> Finally, there's a plot somewhere. Maybe you need to see the movie three times before you understand it.
