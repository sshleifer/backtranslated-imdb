but not too many of them. Probably the worst "biggest release" movie in my life has been seen. Surely this year is the worst. Commenting on a plot, cast or actor makes no sense. The problem is beyond that. It looks absolutely stupid about all the annoying things on the screen (not funny). I don't know why I gave it 1/10 instead of 2/10. Probably because of Steven Martin. He really tried. Bottom line - 95 minutes to wash the toilet with some brain cells. Avoid at all costs.
