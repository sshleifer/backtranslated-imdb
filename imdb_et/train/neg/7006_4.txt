Mark Hamill should have been able to frighten CORVETTE SUMMER! This time he uses a new type of "power" to restore his dream machine, the Red Water, to possession. It seems that the second sour teenage age slides in the first half and turns in the wrong direction. Writing and referencing jobs are terribly done, some scenes that you hardly can. You expect this to happen anyway, and you are at the end of the 70s. Only a former newcomer, such as Annie Potts, would steal the play easily and record this bad movie repo slip! Her impractical but delightful personality is good for you and is the best way to see her in a swimsuit. For Hooray Annie! Sorry, Mark! I think the power wasn't with you this time.
