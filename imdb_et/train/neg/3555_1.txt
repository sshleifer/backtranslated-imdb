Years ago we went to a friend and I went to see a horror film we thought it would be good because he was with John Cassavetes. John Cassavettes was an individual actor, actor and director (married to actress Gena Rowlands) who was nominated three times for the Oscar, who wrote and directed a variety of good budget films using his income as an actor to keep himself afloat. Until we saw Incubus, we did not realize that John Cassavetes' income came from the movie he was offered. If we knew what the film was, before we saw it, we could avoid it at all. But we didn't go out. At that time, my friend and I joked that it was once a movie. Frankly, this is not true. I've seen a lot of badly made movies on Friday night at Cinemax (did I just say it loud?), Which is much worse than Incubus. Almost every film starring Brian Bosworth is by nature a worse film than Incubus. Certainly Santa Claus marries the worse film than Incubus. However, I have been using Incubus constantly as a threshold below which I do not want to fall. When I talk to a friend about a movie I've seen, I always notice that it was better (or worse) than Incubus. <br /> <br /> http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
