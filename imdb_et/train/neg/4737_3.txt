I loved the first "Azumi" movie. I've seen Mrs. Ueto in various TV shows and I've seen my fair share of Samurai and Ninja clips. I have to say that this film was much weaker than I had expected. <br /> <br /> Due to the cast of the film and the setting up of "Azumi", they should have been able to work much better with this film, but it was slow, in some parts, and sprinkled with very bad, convincing and wood. <br /> <br /> When they looked at the references to the first movie, they did it so it was pretty loose and weak. "Azum" is the best group for the title character, the highest killers. "Azumi 2" seems to have somehow declined and less impressive. <br /> <br /> It doesn't mean that it was a complete loss. There were some scenes of decent fighting and some of the top characters. Unfortunately, the film's general fact is that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. The last two really felt the "manga" in their scenario, while the former was not "well".
