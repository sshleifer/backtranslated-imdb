CAMILLE 2000 <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 2.35: 1 (Panavision) <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> While in Rome, Nino Castelnuovo is in love with the beautiful young liberal (Daniele Gaubert), but their unlikely romance is against Castelnuovo's rich father (Massimo Serato) and Fate is dealing with a tragic blow ... <br /> <br /> Sexy love story of the passionate sixties customized by writer Michael DeForrest from the literary source (Alexandre Dumas 'La Dame aux Camelias') and which Radley Metzger, along with Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno, is free to redirect the redefinition of 'Adult' cinema parameters in the 1960s and 70s. Using the latest career format, Metzger's 'la dolce vita' research is rich with a visual surplus (note, for example, the emphasis on reflective surfaces), although the film's sexual costume seems worryingly up to date with modern standards. The production values ​​are beautiful and the performances are appealing and humane (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are especially memorable) despite the weak post-sync duplication. Although Enrico Sabbatini's well-established designs lie in an unspecified future, they find the film firmly during their period, and Piero Piccioni's 'wah-wah' score has become a cult object among those devoted to exploitation. CAMILLE 2000 is ultimately a taste, but the fans of the elegant soft porn erotica do not have to be disappointed. The next Metzger was LICKERISH QUARTET (1970), which many consider to be their best films.
