Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. This is the first, most important, and most disturbing thing about this attempt to imagine Scooby-Doo and the company. <br /> <br /> Shaggy's voice is stinky and doesn't sound like he has ever heard of the earlier incarnation of Scooby's exhibitions. They have also changed the clothes and the classic mode of walking from the original. <br /> <br /> I am not sure what they are still at an angle, but certainly not the formula used in the previous Scooby show. <br /> <br /> And the animation style is very strange and distorted. I like this, but it's not a real Scooby-Doo type animation. But the strange animation used for other WB exhibitions grew to me; it can also be. <br /> <br /> It's worth once - if you can handle the right Shaggy voice. This right is sufficient to show one display correctly. Besides, I'm not trying to be an inflexible, nitpicking fan. As they say, develop or die. We are seeing this two more episodes watching - I have now made a lot of firm opinion.
