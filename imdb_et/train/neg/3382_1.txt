This is one of the worst movie adjustments ever made for music. A Chorus Line's stage version is great. This film hits the mark almost completely. Even pouring is confusing. Take Audrey Landers Val. "Dance 10 Looks 3" is a Select Song. Choose a story is that it is a great dancer, but a 3 year old appearance department. Yes, he finds a solution, but eventually he is a big dancer. What do great filmmakers do? They hire an actor who can't dance and is famous for his excellent viewing. The way the boat disappears. <br /> <br /> Then there is choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett turned over to his grave. Why didn't they use their choreography? It really can't be repaired.
