What a great actor in such a terrible story ... <br /> <br /> The film and its production are still quite good, even if it is in London, but with the exterior of Bristol. Does not matter ?? Look at one of the cathedrals you saw, sort of. <br /> <br /> But the story ... is about someone who was born with power to die and destroy everyone and everyone, whether he should want to. Only by passing through the real life events of telecine, narrative builds a picture of a man who has been misused and misjudged as a boy, a teenager, and finally a man. so much, in fact, that he expresses revenge in will, literally. Over time, he concludes that the whole world is moving wrong and thus destroying the batch? just thinking about it! <br /> <br /> However, the problem with narrative is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data about strange spiritual forces and combine it all with an almost religious valve to create a hodge-podge theory of everything. Blending fact and fantasy in this way rarely works? and I am afraid Richard Burton had to try in some cases convincingly. But his best scene is when he gave his wife and lover a verbal paste when they left their home: a sharp, clever and deadly dialogue sent only by Burton. <br /> <br /> Good support cast helps to make things much better, starting with Lino Ventura, the last one I saw at Garde A Vu (1981) as Brunel; Harry Andrews as Commissioner-designate; the fact that Lee Remick was much less than Dr. Zonfeld; Derek Jacobi as a publisher of Towney and some other well-known characters. <br /> <br /> I liked how the story was played as a rebound return to fill the story and thus solve the direct mystery of the murder attempt by Morlar (Richard Burton), a writer at the killer. Until then, it was a visual detective work by Brunel and his English sidekick. However, it was very predictable because it quickly became clear to me to find out what a murderer is. <br /> <br /> Then they went and spoiled it in the last fifteen minutes. If you want a clue what it is, think of Samson and Delila (1949), the famous Cecil B. de Mille, and how Samson finally got the bad guys. And the last scene is just stupid. Why? Because there are at least one hundred ways the resurrection of Morlar could have stopped, absolutely. <br /> <br /> Shame because it could have been a much better story and movie. I think Burton needs money. <br /> <br /> If you're a Burton fan, spend some time seeing what I mentioned above. Otherwise, don't worry.
