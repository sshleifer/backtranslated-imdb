I tried to remove something that could be considered a spoiler. I also assume that you have seen the first movie or at least the familiar general so that if it is not, it may not make sense. <br /> <br /> Plot: This movie strikes the audience over and over again with tired philosophical ramblings to get over the subject. We are being bombarded over and over with purpose, destiny and choice, and we are forced to endure these long, tortuous sessions of the Plans that contain them. <br /> <br /> Neo, waking up from the last movie of a dream, is now beginning to understand his existence. There are many revelations in this film that I am vague so they don't look like spoilers. <br /> <br /> * If you still have worrying vague references to a movie, don't read the paragraph below. * <br /> <br /> The strength and weakness of faith are manifested. The strengths and weaknesses of love and its temporary character also appear. It also shows the interdependence of people and technology and our trust in technology. The importance of choice and experience emerges. Explaining the additional things that have emerged would go into too much detail, so I will refrain (as the comment writing instructions ask). Btw, which "showed" I mean pounded through our ears and eyes like nails. <br /> <br /> Story: So how does Neo and gang get the next movie from the end? In a nutshell, they keep faith and use and abuse too stylized action and bullet time as it goes out of style (and after this show I hope that both filmmakers and makers learn to appreciate a little bit more and a bit more originality). More about it later. In order not to spoil anything, I will not say more than the promo material has already done: Neo is still trying to find out the matrix, and he is looking for answers, trying to save people, and Zion, all while bad is after him. and his cohorts. The film goes up pretty much where the last one left. <br /> <br /> Action: While martial arts action and gunplay pepper are somewhat equal to their predecessor, this film focuses much more on martial arts than gunplay, adding swords, getting it, etc. Special effects are so often used as well as the audience's face that it becomes really tiring. I've been discussing this film with both friends and colleagues, and almost all of them found some sequences of action - especially the "Smith struggle" that we all heard was too long and tedious in the film. This is a big red flag for backgrounds, because the end of the action phase should leave you with a little bit more or fully satisfied with awesomeness. <br /> <br /> These fighting scenes do not. These are over-styled, over-top-sequences that are wood and uninspired. In the first film, there was a real despair for some activities, a sense that the struggle was for survival, not just with good vision (which I honestly don't believe they are leading Reloaded) as black and leather. Check out the Drunken Master or Iron Monkey movie to remind you of good combat sequences - you won't regret it. In addition, "Matrix capabilities" are not reloaded in humans, and what they actually do is not consistent. The contradictions in the first film were here, but they were not too obvious - unlike Reloaded. <br /> <br /> Special effects are poured in and on. Every little thing someone does, whether it's just a jump, a fucking, a spin, and in many cases just a portrayal, is a slow, bullet-timed or some exaggeration of destruction. It is obvious that W Bros had the money to throw this film and the boy was thrown away without a real restriction. The Sharp editors would have really helped, but the first film was a hit that obviously gave us a free government that leads us. . . <br /> <br /> Character and Dialogue: I've said more or less that dialogue was tired and full of philosophical tiles. Actresses cannot really bring a lot of depth to their character if the script and direction lead the face of the character's progress to the public or ignore it completely. At no time does the audience have any nuances and substance so that they can reflect on their character. <br /> <br /> Keanu's show power is the best. Keanu is a good confused, and that's all he does in this movie. He tries to show a passion between Neo and Trinity, but it gradually falls. <br /> <br /> Lawrence is trying to make Morpheus everything from Moses to Henry V and be as cool as a cat. With the script he offers, he does a noble experiment, but it also falls. <br /> <br /> The step is also not very credible. His appearance is always the same as Keanu, and chemistry does not exist, although in their very physical scenes they do well. <br /> <br /> Hugo once again brought his strange nature to the Agent program, but he also suffers from the script. I think he is the most interesting character of the cluster, but instead of developing, they just excuse the huge, challenged battle stage. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is disappointing if you have good expectations and an independent film as an independent film (which is not how it should be done), it is still terrible. I don't see the Matrix so deep, but I see it as a pleasant sci-fi with interesting ideas, good activities, some funny lines and enough restrained symbols and elusions to entertain. Reloaded fails on all of these lists and I hope that W Bros will give us a better experience of the third installment. No more hope for this movie after this movie.
