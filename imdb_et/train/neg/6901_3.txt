The most positive thing I can say about this dumb local "comedy" is that it is unpleasant. In fact, it is so astonishingly blissful to wonder how many tens of repetitions the Commission has carried out in order to make a complete removal of personality. It's not witty, it's not fun, it's not wise and it's not charming. It is just four losers who have to change their way - and their attitude towards women - just a ridiculous, ridiculous progression to allow them to participate in their best friend's wedding. <br /> <br /> By acting as an equal local amateur book society, so tired of the plot line that he makes Allo Allo of forty-third season fresh and joking about humorous when looking at decomposing vegetables, Sione's Wedding still wore ten (yes 10) Candidates for NZ movie awards recently. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, someone saw the idea and it didn't win.
