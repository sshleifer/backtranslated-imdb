Robin Williams gave The Night Listener an excellent result, as did other cast members. However, the film seems to be in a hurry and leaves too many open ends, which are considered "must-see". I think the problem happens because there is not a strong enough relationship between the caller and Gabriel Noon (I had to write it exactly because IMDb wants the correct spelling to be "no one") automatically. The movie takes just over 1:30 and within the first 15 minutes, or so, it looks like Noon starts looking for the boy's caller, Pete Logande. <br /> <br /> This happens after he talks about a mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times. Chats are usually no deeper in the way you are ... I'm in the hospital ... why did you move ... etc. In the book, the child becomes almost a contraction of Noon, and vice versa, and the reader understands why he is going to find this boy when he finds the boy disappears and thinks he may be a scam. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Noon is obsessed with finding Logande, but the audience is wondering why? Because there is really no strong enough connection between Noon and the caller, why? Who cares if the caller does not exist? <br /> <br /> I know there are differences between a book and a movie, but these calls and the relationship were critical to creating the screen, as it provides the basis for the rest of the movie. Because this is not the case, it falls between the films. <br /> <br /> It's surprising because Maupin's second job, Tales of the City. When it was done in the mini series, it worked beautifully.
