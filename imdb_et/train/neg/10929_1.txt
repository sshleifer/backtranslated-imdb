This movie was still an amazing Mormon movie. That put Provo RM & Sons out like well done movies! It had to be funny about what I was told. The best part was the best actor in the movie-Travis Eberhard-if he wasn't in a movie that probably wouldn't have been done! He ruled! <br /> <br /> 10. It wasn't funny 9. It was beating 8. It was Thurl Big T Bailey who has made the character. it was 4. This was the first movie Clint Howard wasn't 3. funny.
