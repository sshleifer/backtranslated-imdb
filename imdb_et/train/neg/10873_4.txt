Many people thought this was a good movie, but I disagree with them. At the beginning of the movie, a spacecraft was crushed on the ground, and some aliens fled the spacecraft, then he killed some people on the ground, but without reason. It's also in the dark forest, I can't see anything on the screen, I can hardly hear the sound. <br /> <br /> After a few days, the predator came to the ground, but no one had sent him before that signal, he shouldn't know what happened on earth, so there is a contradiction. Eventually, the predator found the alien director and killed it without reason. He did not live on the earth, nor is any of his things what happened here. Finally, the movie is only 90 minutes long, the summary is too short, and it can't clearly tell the reviewers the story. <br /> <br /> Finally, I don't think it's a good movie.
