Wayward Cloud is a disappointing movie to watch. Excitingly mysterious treats every stroke like a work of art. You get the impression that each set of shootings is designed and made with some fine care that is bounded by the obsession; Imagining how far the cinema has progressed because the first films were curved in the 19th century and imitated their construction, the camera almost never moves here? besides camp and colorful musical numbers. The ambient noise is kept to a minimum and barely word. This curious but effective device forces the audience to focus on its visual stimuli only so that even if the story progresses at a snail-like pace, we feel surrounded. Unfortunately, at least this language immersion will last for hours. I started to feel the challenge of the film would be overlooked when it became harder for the minutes to drag, so as to just look, it was a test of will. <br /> <br /> The content of this movie was not as sexual as it would be even more unclear for Western audiences. As it is, a woman is nudity and sexual abuse of an unconscious (or perhaps dead) woman who is so reluctant, although there may be a backlog of pornography involving both men and women (users). and usable) is so redundant how it decides to make its point effective ineffective. Of course, the worst and enthusiastic actors in the explosion in pornographic content are looking for this movie for all the wrong reasons and watching it with the sticky button on the remote control. <br /> <br /> For all your problems, the movie is definitely permanent, and the more you think about it, the more meaningful the aspects are. Ironically, for a movie that happens so little, the viewer is likely to pay a second or even a third time proportionally. But for me it was once enough ??
