This picture reminds me of Keneten's picture from 1957, called the Admirable Crighton, while in the boat he was a servant and on the island he became a captain and was returned to the servant back. If there is a picture showing that Madonna can't act, this is one. <br /> <br /> I am not sure if it was a subtle copy of "The Admirable Crighton", but it is sure to like it and if it is, then Hollywood's idea must run out and it's sad to offer a platform participants to improve their career profile, and precisely to fail in the corners and details. <br /> <br /> The plot is loose and the actor is mediocre before it was placed. How many here have Madoona preserved for all of their actors, I think that in movies like "My League" was pretty good and enjoyable and "Who is this girl" showed that Madonna's style is not obvious at first or later. The other Madonna films are not so enjoyable and I would have liked to see Madonna's animation series "Who is this girl". I like the music of these two films, but "swept away" at the bottom of the pile here and it will remain so. <br /> <br /> Everyone has the right to a bomb?
