Even the first 10 minutes of this movie were terrible. It is hard to believe that anyone other than John Cusack would have made that money. With anti-war / anti-war movies already destroyed at the post office, it is almost impossible for any type of studio to want to associate it with the script. <br /> <br /> At first it may have seemed like some politically motivated derivative of Grosse Point Blank with Akroyd and Cusack (i). But with only about 90 seconds of the movie, it turns out it's a talentless test of DR STRANGELOVE. <br /> <br /> I liked so many Cusacks movies I thought I was risking with this DVD DVD. I have to say that I don't know if Cusack is reasonable enough to even look at another chance that plays him again unless someone else can wear it. Cusack seems to be so irreparably damaged by his hatred against George Bush and the war in Iraq he wants to commit suicide. Tom Cruise had never gone so far. Not even close.
