I went to my relatives a while ago and we jumped with the theater, so we thought we were going and let it go. What's wrong! This movie is terrible in every department. I would never have heard of the film and, literally, not everything. No wonder it's the same rank as it gets. It's comedy, so it says the only thing is the funny director's ability or the lack of such a movie. So close to Christmas that it should be titled, how to nourish turkey for about an hour and a half - or how long it was, as I was walking. At the end of the film, you feel like you have been poisoned with a fed turkey and you regretted that you wasted your time on such drifting. Who knows why such things are done. Some people had gone out of the theater before the film was over and I blame myself for not having gone far before. It bothers me that you are paying good money to see something decent and everything you come out of is a bad TV movie, which should be at 2 o'clock in the morning, really bad, the daily TV shouldn't show it. What more can be said ... there would probably be not enough bad words to achieve justice.
