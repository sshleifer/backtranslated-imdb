In the original film there was nothing of value, it was even a lamer. The fact that I even found a rental was absolutely amazing. Anyone involved in this movie must have something high! What was the story? What was with the girl? Did the viewer take the story in the first four minutes of the movie. Sorry, I tried to view it several times. I even took someone back to get feedback. Kid said it was stupid and he was four years old. I think maybe some credit could go to the film director because some of the pictures made the film more than a B movie. It can push it. I loved the theme song. Good thing, it was just a dollar, it was worth it. I think you could enjoy the movie if you were high when cast and the team should be. Is the pot legal in France?
