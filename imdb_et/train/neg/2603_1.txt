I was interested in this topic and only Drew Barrymore's dance fans at David Letterman's desk find something interesting. OK, she shows some breasts (or maybe a body double). The plot is cut to bits and it is terrible. No cooker has any material to fit because the direction of the film does not go anywhere. Don't waste your time. Instead, check out Donnie Dark if you want a creepy Drew Barrymore movie, and if you want to see another, leave it again and see Dark again. <br /> <br /> Doppelganger's legend is also completely criminal. See something about Charles Williams' Descent Into Hell novel. It's just a pretext to make B-film right on the video and suck some of the lives of Blockbuster people. <br /> <br /> What makes these people think that acting here is commendable? Leave me alone.
