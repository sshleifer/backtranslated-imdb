The question for all your girls out there: if the person you have never met, called you for the purpose and continued it in the most uncertain moments, he would have been interested or disappointed. ? Yeah, that's what I thought I couldn't get to Marti Gerrard's idea of ​​Connor Hill's unwanted attention. <br /> <br /> ***** MILD SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> It's really a stupid story. Connor Hill's wife has been murdered and the plot reversed to ask if Connor is calling Mart to have an alibi? But here's the big logic gap, Connor didn't get a busy man? something that the accusation seems to have ignored. And was there forensic in the murder scene? Why then, at the time of the murder, did the whole trial with Marti call Connor? Hull. Hull. Hull. And it's as predictable as it is pointless. <br /> <br /> The reminiscent of this film is that someone who did the Winter Olympics is really a nasty skier for Marti Gerrard.
