This movie, Alamo: Thirteen days of glory, is the perfect garbage. The actor is terrible, it is too patriotic and its historical accuracy is not always the best (historians would have a field day). It has some good moments, but it is not enough to keep the interests in because it is too long. Rating * off **********.
