"Dan in Real Life" is a little excited. First of all, the whole setting is incredibly lively. Did you really believe that at this very long first meeting in the restaurant, Marie wouldn't have told her where she was going? And since Dan did all the talk during the call, why did he attract him so much? In this regard, I have never understood why Marie attracted Dan to the film. He is very narcissistic and does little to convince us that he is a really good boy (for example, he is in a bookstore Marie, laughs at his brother from his former girlfriends and tries to make Marie jealous of a "blind date"). There's more charm than a ridiculous scene at the bowling alley where Dan and Marie are caught with the whole family. Yes, it can really happen. Dan is slow, gentle and manipulative in real life. Even chick flicks like Jane Austen's Book Club get higher marks than this predictable "tearjerker".
