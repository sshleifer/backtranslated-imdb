I wanted to read other comments before leaving the comment and the majority decided definitely: This movie is amazing! From action to non-realistic animation, countless mistakes. I was actually hoping that the valves would have widened the imagination (you can't extend the valves without the engine). You can't lower the ground if you don't have electricity. This small small fan that was running was not enough to lower the gear shift. One thing I thought was quite peculiar when they landed, the rear wheels touched and then the nose was cut off, thus stopping both rear tires on the plane. How did the captain apply the left and right brake to tires that did not touch the ground? Did they forget about spoilers? A word to the director: Before trying the * airplane, you can find out all * about the aircraft. Sorry for the technical beads, but I'll give this movie 1/10.
