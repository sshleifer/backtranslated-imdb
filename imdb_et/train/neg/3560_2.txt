For me, this is a story that starts with some funny jokes about Franks fanatic when he goes on stairs and when he's sitting on business meetings ... The problem is that if you watch this movie in one hour, you'll see the same fantasies / funny situations again and again and again. This is predictable. It's more done than a TV story where you can go and come back without touching anything. <br /> <br /> I like Felix Herngren like Frank, but that's not enough even if it's a comedy, more variations and a message to this audience .... <br /> <br />
