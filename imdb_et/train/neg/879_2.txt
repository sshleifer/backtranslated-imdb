Choosing a Bone to Choose: David Jannsen was 38 who played Robert Driva's father, who was then 31 (yes, I know he should just be out of college, but the hints in the script are him a license and he's probably 24 years old -25 scripts --- which still puts Jannsen in the junior class). I assume that AMA wrote a medical miracle in its 1938 medical year. This movie is not very outdated at all, and now the main appeal is to see Sin City, the 1969 round and all the smoky hair, the strange hair (Drivas has an atomic chamber that makes it similar to groomed Cousin It) and trendy fashion that they went with it. If anyone remembers, there was no LV exactly in London ... the city wore mobs and gamblers these days. Driva becomes so sexually unclear; his father thinks he may be gay (sad ironically, Driva himself died of AIDS in the 47's) and the soap conflict arises from the issue of the generation gap (ahem, as if it could be a 7-year gap). Sonny's boy wants to be his own man and his dad wants to get him into the casino (Caesar's palace!) And troubles him with girls (including horny-for-money Edy Williams). Interestingly, the son does not seem to remember that he is thought of as gay --- unusual by that time, and the lovely Brenda Vaccarro is close to moving from her platonic. What nudity is there is terribly flat - just what was needed to draw the RAA rating to the audience in the first days of the MPAA rating system (which was G-M-R [16] - and X). Editing is HORRIBLE and the committee is stupid-silly overdubs (neo-avante-garde comedy in the late 1960s, which after a few years graciously disappeared from the map). Don Rickles is on board as a blackjack dealer ... he seems to be preparing him twice a decade later in a much better CASINO. Nothing to give away, but they would have dealt with Mr Rickles's electric tools and then a hole in the desert. Best of all, curiosity far from Joshua Logan's usual workforce. Dos / Dias. Now follow CASINO again ...
