When I saw it in the shop, I thought it seemed really good and original. As Wolfs Creek meets the massacre of the Texas chainsaw, and I think it only costs three times (about $ 6). Frankly, I don't think it would be worth it. <br /> <br /> It seems that directors - "butcher's brothers" could not decide whether they wanted to do an artistic horror or a terrible horror. It ended with clich√©s fighting in a sadistic hour and fifteen minutes, with all the characters being one-dimensional, and you couldn't do anything less than what happened to them, to make sure that the viewers take care of the characters they add to the endless monologue. the beginning of the film, which was completely honest, was not necessary. <br /> <br /> The only good part was really in the middle / end - I won't destroy it for you. But that was the only "good" part. <br /> <br /> Generally pointless. It seemed like a two-hour movie, but it was actually only 75 minutes. If you want an artistic film, don't bother. If you want a movie - don't worry - the movie will move as slowly as nothing happens.
