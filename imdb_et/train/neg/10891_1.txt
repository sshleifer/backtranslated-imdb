I saw this movie trailer and it seemed great so I went out and bought it. What a mistake in acting is a stigma, special effects (if you could name them), look like something that wouldn't be inappropriate in school play. Some of the characters in this movie are so stupid that you are shining at the minute, which is unfortunately often. As for the story, forget it. This is a warning, not to waste this movie at all, it must be one of the worst things I've ever seen. If for some reason you like this movie to watch Troll 2, you probably enjoy it too.
