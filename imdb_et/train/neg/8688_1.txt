If the only sex you've ever had is a farm animal, then the tagline of this movie is probably misleading. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most boring films I've had the pleasure of trying to watch lately. I found that the DVD was in my friend's house and I made a sad mistake if it didn't burn. <br /> <br /> I can't say any details without breaking the movie because there are only about 5 details about it. Just try to imagine that someone who makes a movie about things in c-span is only a fictional film 10 times less interesting than the most boring discussion with c-span. <br /> <br /> I think there is a conspiracy in this country. movie, but I couldn't say exactly what it was after I went out and threw Richard Gere.
