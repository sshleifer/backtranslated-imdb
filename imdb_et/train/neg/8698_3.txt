Okay, I remember watching the first and the boy wonder. After that, I just watched a laugh and said to myself: "Oh boy, another B-film with a small budget. I never see this part 2." Then, about half a year later, the second part came. It sucked even more. But I just laughed again and said, "I don't see this part in any way." Then, about a half year later, Part 3 came out. I was stupid enough to rent it and boy, I just broke it after that. God, I've never understood how many movies you can suck these days. Just save yourself $ 7.50 and don't rent the whole series. Trust me, it's worth every penny.
