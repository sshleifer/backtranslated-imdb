Best-selling writer George Plimpton (Alan Alda) assumes responsibility for Sports Illustrated. He must go to Incognito Detroit Lions Training Camp and try his position as a third string. He has been quickly found by team members with Alex Karras and Mike Lucci. The whole team finds it fun to create stumbling blocks to the writer's determination to play in the real game series. <br /> <br /> This movie is Alda's debut and has also helped Karras work. In addition to the 1968 Detroit Lions, Sugar Ray Robinson, Roy Schieder and Lauren Hutton have also been cast. <br /> <br /> Alex March directs this story on Plimton's book.
