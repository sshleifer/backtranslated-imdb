It was the same garbage we had to look at Bob Saget's host half an hour before that. Dave Coulier only thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same as American funny jokes, except for hosts with combined IQ. Tawny Kitaen really needs this money and Coulier had to go to the trash for his jokes. It was enough torture to see him to follow him with Popeye, and other washed comics start from Full House. This one guy who played all the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be at the end of the A grade. Coulier needs money to please Alannis Morisette when they were.
