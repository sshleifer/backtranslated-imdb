I don't know how the participants acted in this movie. Annette Bening was really herself, half and half, did she cheat or was it natural? Considering that even if he had walked on the ceiling, it wouldn't have changed the pattern of the film. Brian Cox really did well. I almost thought he was always behaving like a complicated, dishonest, dirty environment where no one cared about hygiene. In the case of Gwyneth Paltrow, the question is what he does in this film. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty scary and nasty. Who would pay to see such a mess?
