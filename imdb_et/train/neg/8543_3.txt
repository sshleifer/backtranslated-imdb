I admit that I had to move fast with this poorly transferred DVD after about 30 minutes - NOTHING happened, and everyone has already described the "plot". But has anyone opened a reputation? - The beetle is shifted through the wig and it is on the front grass! I think the dirty child did it, never explained it. Really trippy opening. <br /> <br /> I want this to be a better written or thoughtful film, because what we have left, how nice and a movie that makes no sense, is not a "smart" movie It's just a badly fillable movie . <br /> <br /> I'd like to see a cleaned up version, and if there's no film, I'd like to see if it would help. Otherwise, this is an odd little movie that is best for sending it fast!
