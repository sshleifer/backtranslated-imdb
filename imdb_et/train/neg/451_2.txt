I don't care how many candidates this junk is the best and that, this movie bounced. I didn't know if to turn off the device or to file a case with O.J.'s lawyer who has broken his mental health. I've rarely been bored; to call this manure entertainment is the face of every planet's filmmaker. The whole story was stupid, the actor was undisciplined, the "drama" was emotional. I'm grateful that I didn't have to pay for this outstanding experience.
