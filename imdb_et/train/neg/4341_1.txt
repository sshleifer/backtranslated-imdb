It was so flat that I turned the DVD off ... maybe halfway through. It was so weak, I couldn't even pay enough attention to tell how far I did. Although I really wanted to believe that the young Carlito's portrayal would be somewhat different, I just couldn't buy it. I don't really blame the participants because I think it was a script that may have fallen. I found myself laughing a few times, but I don't think these lines are funny. <br /> <br /> It's just a grace to buy 2 DVD sets and I would have paid for the original price. This is one of the cases when they should have let the classic independently.
