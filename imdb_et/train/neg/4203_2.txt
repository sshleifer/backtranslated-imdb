What starts as a rather wise farce about a somewhat shady security company, is almost instantly an uninteresting and completely mysterious mystery of murder. David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci are trying to guard this wreck of the train, but some things are simply not humanly possible. <br /> <br /> What causes, for example, Gale's sudden sweet drunk Tommy's parents' house? Why would Heinrich, though indeed a dream come true, destroy the business he devotes his life to, robbing and murdering his clients? Why does seemingly reasonable Tommy believe Heinrich could be a murderer (based almost entirely on sleep) and even if it were plausible, why shouldn't he go to the police? And why didn't Gale activate the alarm when he arrived home, especially after Howie turned off? Of course, all these events are necessary for the plot (and I use the term very, very loosely) to open up. And it can be forgiving if it results in even the smallest comedy. But everything from Howie's date-rape description to Gale's chronic identity for Gale and Howie's final joke is still tasteless and pathetic than anything else. <br /> <br /> I ticked a box that indicates that my comments contained "spoilers", but there is nothing else that I or anyone else could do to spoil the thing that smells like heaven.
