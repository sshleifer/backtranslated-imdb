It's interesting to see what the director was trying to do with this movie. But the problem is that it is not very good. There was nothing really original in the film, and although the plot was well presented, the main characters were a bit low and you didn't bother about them. <br /> <br /> Rather happy (and sometimes totally downright) leaves a bit to be desired, but I think you can't expect a lot from people who just make a low budget movie. It's unfair to watch a movie and compare it to other big budget movies. But unfortunately, this has to be done. It is not very good in itself. And compared to others, it's still not very good. But this is not without good points! I liked the plot. It was built quite nicely and at the end at the end together. Sometimes he also managed to create a horrible feeling in a really dark scene. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film can't impress. The characters are pretty much non-existent and we don't care about them. Each of them may die, but the final "survivor" can be precisely identified at an early stage.
