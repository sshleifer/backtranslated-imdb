The central theme of this film seems to be confusion, because relations, setting up, acting and social context lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel seems to have been left out of his elements and has no ordinary impeccable clarity, direction and intensity. Worse still, his character's name is "Che", and we are only told (directly, by the narrator) of the film that he is not "it" Che, just a man named Che. Family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film, and when they are defined, the family is divided - the younger generation into America. So cliché. Other reviews discuss how the film depicts the impact of the revolution on the boy's family; but the director's political stance is at best dark, and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed is. So they lost their assets (which are derived from gambling profits) - what then? The refusal of a Cuban revolution in making a film from a political point of view is a strange and timid choice. Not to mention the movie was in English! Why do all these Cubans speak English? No wonder they were not allowed to film in Cuba. And if family life is the most important thing to look at here, it would be nice if we could find out who is who - we are “introduced to them first” - this is a cheap way to make relationships throughout the film clear! Action was mostly low, wooden and incredible, timing was everywhere. The "special" visual effects were confusing and disturbing. References to American films - and black characters to the Greeks, are strictly free, intellectually potty and consistently away. I just watched the whole movie just because I was expecting clarity or something. It never happened.
