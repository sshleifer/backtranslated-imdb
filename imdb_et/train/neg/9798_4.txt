15 years ago Power Rangers was one of the exhibitions of peoples, especially young people. When I was a 3-year-old child living in the Philippines, I would look at this exhibition every Friday at ABS-CBN (Channel 2). When the film appeared in 1995, I was in shock and fear when I watched it with my father and 2 uncles. My grandparents also sent me a "Balikbayan" box full of Power Ranger stuff (including easy to build Megazord figure and Ranger stuffed toys). I even played video games and loved only one of them ("MMPR: Fighting Edition"), which was really sad. Anyway, it was a show that laid my interest in a series of robots (especially an anime mech series like "Gundam") Now that I'm 18 years old, I would like to think that this show is very cheesy for me now. To prove this, I took out a memory card, buying a 2-pack DVD collection with "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" and watching both of them. I was like "Ugh. How terrible. For all of your generation's people, it's not the display you want to look over and over. I'm not saying I leave it for the rest of my life, but from time to time it's not a bad thing, right?" Instead of "Power Rangers" I would recommend something like "Mobile Fighter G Gundam" (highly recommended), "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (aka Ninja robots), or even ORIGINAL Sentai exhibitions, which were the "Power Rangers".
