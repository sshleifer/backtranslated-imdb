I couldn't wait to see this movie. About half of the movie I couldn't wait until it ended. All (white) actors gave their lines, as Woody Allen just said, "Say it ..." Then they said they were on the screen as they tried to imitate Woody Allen. It was so annoying. We all know how Will Ferrell actually speaks and does not stumble with his words like Mr. Allen. The comedy part of this movie was just as boring as the tragedy and certainly never funny or even fun. I have to admit that I've never been a big fan of Woody Allen, and this movie hasn't really changed me. I think his writing was as bad as his direction. This movie falls into one of the worst 10 films I've ever seen.
