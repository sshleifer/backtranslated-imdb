wow! I watched this one trailer and though "skin, it's not for me". I looked at my husband's and our friend's face during the trailer and knew it was a "boy movie". I mean, hallo! a bunch of chick smokers dancing - another striptease? <br /> <br /> Then I started watching it, it didn't seem so bad. so I watched. I looked at it until the end. which awesome movie. if anything, it's a chick. these girls have an attitude. it's really a good movie and a little love story. really leaves you with a nice feeling. <br /> <br /> basically a story about a little town girl that makes this city big after the big city c ** p. there have been a couple of them, it is almost a new legend of the city. but it also makes you think about your life and what you have achieved. well, anyway. I think this is because all the work in the bar scenario is very familiar, not just for me, but for the many people I know. Do not trust trailers for this - its purpose is to bring men in.
