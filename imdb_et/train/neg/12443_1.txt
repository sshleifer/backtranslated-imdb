- Let me start by saying that I understand that the Starfire's invasion was meant to be a parody of 50's sci-fi movies. I understand that none of them is serious. I have a problem that none of them work. The parody should be funny and it just isn't. Never during the runtime I did so much that I smiled. In general, I am easily entertained, but I was unable to find star entertainment anywhere in Star Creatures' invasion. The two "stars" change the look of their screen with one imaginative - a water hose that they can't control so they get wet. These two come like a Bowery Boys wannabes. Why would somebody want to remember the actions and personalities of the Bowery boys? After less than a remarkable start, the films continue their comic tracking sequences, dancing Indians, vegetable men, decoder rings and other mixed discomfort. It's just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> - I bought this on a dual-function DVD with Bee Girls Invasion. This film is the Academy's award-winning stuff compared to the Star Star invasion.
