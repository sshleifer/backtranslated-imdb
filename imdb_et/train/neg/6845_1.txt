"I went to the movies to see" Beat Street "/ it wasn't bad, it was kind /" Krush Groove "was a flick that I don't mind / but when it came to" Rappin ", I pulled the lines." Word to your mother. <br /> <br /> Do you want me to finish? <br /> <br /> This is just a small example of the Stym-Fly style of rymin that is featured in such film and location permit waste. This movie is really nervous (it is just talking about f * cking in the 80's). Mario Van Peebles is one of the hell of an actor. As an actor, Mario Van Peebles is a bodybuilder. <br /> <br /> Every movie called "Rappin" was better than the highest standard in this era. Why were the 6-year-olds in the aisles even the day when the standards were so knee-to-high-to-Webster? Because this rap is weak. So weak that even B.E.T. or Comedy Central touches it with a 10-foot gold-rope chain. <br /> <br /> Blondie 'Rapture' is def poetry by dr. So don't be boobie, avoid this movie! <br /> <br />
