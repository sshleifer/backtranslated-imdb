argh! this movie hurts my head. maybe it is just my growing hatred against the genre of action, but even if the child, when I swallow like navy seals, I still thought this movie was pleasant. now I find it totally bad. <br /> <br /> Take one pretty good fast paced story. hold the title and throw away the rest. Instead, use some of the future gladiators' story that is so full of plot holes, all the things that may collapse (why is the arena in the middle of the rebel base, how cameras? Why is it clearly stated what actually happened at the Bacherfile in the unobtrusive space?) <br / > <br /> The whole film screams in the eighties, from truley terrible scores to silver shiny costumes. Don't look at this movie. I know some people liked it, but some people get down and don't understand it.
