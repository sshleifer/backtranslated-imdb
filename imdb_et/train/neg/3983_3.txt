Irene Dunne finished her excellent career with both this film. She should have lit up being a stylish actor she was, not in this unmemorable, almost unknown movie. <br /> <br /> This light comedy is okay, but something special. It is much better in the first half, because in the second half it becomes pretty stupid. Maybe Irene saw a handwriting and gave up. Even his high-level voice got a bit annoying here. The rumor is that he was not happy with this movie. Why see why. <br /> <br /> The story reminded me of the 1950s television comedy. Speaking of this, I thought David Nelson Ozzie & Harriet was in the TV show, but it turned out to be a very young Richard Crenn. He looked and sounded like Nelson. <br /> <br /> In general, both the best and the great actor.
