I like Brad Pitt enormously. He is an actor with the brain and spirit, not to mention the face, the pectoral, and anything else. Since I saw him in "Thelmas and Louise", have I thought about who reminds me of it? "Troy" did it for me. He's the new Brigitte Bard. The differences are obvious, of course. However, the man, the American, etc. Brigitte Bardot recalls. She is so beautiful that she is the most effective against her. "California" "12 Monkey" "Fighting Club" "Snatch" His independent humor makes him human, almost accessible. Fortunately, Troy will soon be forgotten. Only photos with Pitt, who are half naked in live sprint positions, adorn the walls of bright fan legions. Strangely enough, "Das Boot" is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th century. What does Wolfgang Petersen control? I think it would be very difficult to say that it is possible to work with the new Brigitte Bardot.
