Joel Schumaker manages the script he wrote and owns a group of Georgetown degrees that face adult life situations. The story is a mess of confusion, but some scenes are really good. There are many wasted talents and time here. Cast is more impressive than film. Recommended are Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham. The most remarkable is McCarthy and Moore. Lowe is quite unpleasant. The age is not so easy.
