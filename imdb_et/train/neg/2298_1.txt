Here are some examples of Pat Robertsons who suspiciously demanded a fairly good result of their predictions. <br /> <br /> In their widespread comments about the 700 Broadcasting Network's 700 club's January 2 release, which he predicted would be "very serious terrorist attacks" and " mass killing "in the United States in the second half of 2007, Pat Robertson hosted a" fairly good result "in earlier predictions. However, the review of Robertson's 2006 forecasts undermines this statement. He predicted, for example, that: "President Bush will strengthen." WRONG <br /> <br /> * "Autumn elections are unclear, but the result of the war and the success of the economy leave Republicans responsible." WRONG <br /> <br /> * "The Iraq war is about to be successfully completed. We will begin the withdrawal of troops before the end of this year." WIRONG WRONG <br /> <br /> In addition, Robertson has reported suspicious predictions under the Associated Press article on January 3rd: <br /> <br /> In January 2004, the broadcaster predicted that President Bush easily won the re-election. Bush won 51% of the votes that dropped by beating Massachusetts John Kerry so far. WRONG <br /> <br /> In 2005, Robertson predicted that Bush would win after his second term. He said that the proposals for social security reform were approved. <br /> <br /> He says he's talking to God ... If so, God has a sense of humor, looking at Pat fooling himself over and over again.
