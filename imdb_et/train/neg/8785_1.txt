I often comment on the market of truly frightening films, and unfortunately, White noise only gave me the belief that the film industry can do such work. I was surprised when I grew more and more tired when the plot was worn and my statically induced headache increased. I found the white noise unreliable when we didn't try to stop our beliefs. Even after witnessing Michael Keaton's harassing attempt, his death had not been fully influenced. Something that was something that would unite me with the story of the characters, was awaited until the credit, but such relief never came. Of course, there were occasional moments of cardiac-stopwatch, but only because of the loud noise they tend to see with the viewer. <br /> <br /> Although the actor was flat, Michael Keaton could play his role to date. Perhaps the only redeeming quality that White Noise has to offer is the stunning archietecture at both Keaton residences. All in all, white noise leaves one disgusting idea that those who die are trapped in a world guarded by three malicious shelters who are trying to live to watch their dead in their graves.
