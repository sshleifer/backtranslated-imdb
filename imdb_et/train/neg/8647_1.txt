The amateur is extreme. Camera operation is particularly burned - documentary operators do not have to turn over ALL TIMES. <br /> <br /> The script is really naughty and performance is even worse. In addition, the story is loose and inclined - some logical openings. At one point, the leader wants to go to jail to rub Al-Quada's suspects on his shoulders and get an interview with Osama. I found the story so incredible because of so many mistakes. The "filmmaker" / leading role is really a rash, an idiot's frat boy. The only point of interest is that the filmmakers made the film on the spot. It's really a shame that they wasted their chance to do something interesting. <br /> <br /> Who funded this mess?
