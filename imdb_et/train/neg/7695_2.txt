I had such great hopes that I saw a classic story like the Arab Night. Instead, I was disappointed with a movie that couldn't keep my attention from the beginning, although I tried to watch it twice! <br /> <br /> It was a bonus Caradine had in this movie, but it didn't mean much if the actors couldn't feel it. For something like Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras there is much better action, comic moments and general enjoyment. Something wow about regarding martial arts and plot line you wont get it. If you want the kids to set off on Sunday afternoon, maybe that's for you with 3 ninjas.
