One note comedy that is likely to set the teeth of today's feminists on the edge. Department store secretary Betsy Drake loves the idea of ​​infants and marriage, putting her hopes on women's magazines until she spies super-bait in a nice bachelor's degree. The rest of the movie plods from one plus to another when the relentless Drake continues his career. I think the word "perky" is almost the sum of the role of Drake. She has a charming smile, but after 20 minutes of memorizing my dentures I started to overdose. Grant's role is essentially secondary and minus its usual elegance. There is, however, one scene that almost saves you from this targeted exercise. Drake asks the unhappy Grant after her lecture to honorable ladies. Here is his perpetual way, which has a strong freshness, which is really remarkable, and that the production did not rub our nose in such a pleasant 90-minute smile, the film can be more than 1948.
