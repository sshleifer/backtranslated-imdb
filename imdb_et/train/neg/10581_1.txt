There were no original ideas in this story. Themes were drawn from different sources; some of them are the ninth gate, the madness in the mouth (the second Carpenter movie) and the Ring. It even went so far as to contain the same glowing ring from the Ring and used it as the name name. Cody Carpenter's soundtrack was all stopped from Suspiria. Hopefully, no one can resist this comment when the word HOMAGE is surrounded. Yes, I saw the theater playing Argento Deep Red. A tribute would be a fun dog. It was a barrel. Gore and "disturbing images" in the pot do not make a good horror film. Carpenter knew it before. He should fade or acquire a time machine.
