It is hard to say whether Noonan and Marshall are trying Abbott & Costello, Martin & Lewis, Curley & Larry or any other comedy team, but whoever they tried to emulate could not fail. With this incredibly stupid picture, there is hardly one weak laugh. Noonan (who helped write the alleged "script") and Marshall has no chemistry; Marshall seems to be trying to cool Dean Martin's type of fucking-care, but he doesn't even come from far away. God knows what Noonan thought he was doing, but being funny, it wasn't. He seems to think that slipping and staring at his hands and feet and everything is the height of the screen comedy; maybe it is for him, but not for the audience. I remember it in theaters when it came out. It was at the bottom of a double bill with the three-year-old Jeff Chandler ("Heavenly Columns", which was pretty good) and three short ("Sappy Bullfighters"), and about 20 minutes into that thing all the kids in the audience were thrown to the screen; it was so amazingly uncomfortable that he didn't even think the worst of the three Stooges pants. I ended it up (not the way I wanted, but my people didn't have to go to the end of the movie), and by the time that mess ended, I was the only theater. I saw it about 15 years ago in a cable one night and stuck to see if it was as bad as I remembered. It was worse. The only thing he had was Julie Newmar, who was both smoking and never before; other than her, this thing is absolutely nothing to recommend. Two of them also play Japanese soldiers and the way they make Jerry Lewis famous Japanese characters with thick lenses, bangs, gibberish mental defects. Marshall hosted "Hollywood squares" and Noonan tried to make his films, but most of them were just as bad. Not quite because I don't think anything could be as bad as this. A truly pathetic film residue. Don't waste your time.
