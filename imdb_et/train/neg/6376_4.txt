Jennifer Cassi ("Dead and Breakfast" by Gina Philips) returns to the house where she grew up, where she recently lived with her dead sister, without having yet lived with her grandmother (Fay Dunaway). Jennifer decides to sell it because she needs a lot of money for Granny. He will also start with mysterious climbs with recurrent nightmares. No one really was involved in this movie. Jennifer seemed cold, distant, unpleasant and narcissistic, while grandmother seemed embarrassing, sad and narcissistic. The film is good and well done, but someone with the impression he found was difficult to take care of what happened to them. <br /> <br /> My degree: C-
