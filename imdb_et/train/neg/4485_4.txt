Science Fiction seems to have this periodic setback to make an odd phenomenon that appears in long series novels. This is where the first novel (Dune, Ender game) blows away your action-packed revolutionary story. The conclusions, however, take this universe and lead you through the gardens of any new small social or political comment that the author wishes to make. The Matrix is ​​finally the film's equivalent. The matrix stands alone, as an interesting film, with an odd twist in the middle. By seeing this money in the cow just sitting there and wishing to explore other aspects of society, writers and directors guide you through what must be SciF's most painful monologues and ineffective sequences. Although the visuals remain so stunning in the first films, the new characters of the characters remain a terrible one. Look out for candy, not deep thinking.
