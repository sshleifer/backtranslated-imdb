I should have known that I have problems with the leading character of Casper Van Diem. Words can't describe or justify when this movie was terrible. But please allow me to describe it: terrible action, terrible dialogue, bad situations, and all that you feel about being forced into the Trinity Broadcasting Network beliefs and propeganda. It's a weak attempt to show Hollywood that the movie can be entertaining and have a deep and religious message to it. They failed. This was probably the worst movie I've seen for a long time.
