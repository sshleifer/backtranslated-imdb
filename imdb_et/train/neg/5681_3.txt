Having seen and loved the post (yes, I actually loved the post), I decided to try another Uwe Boll movie and I picked Seedi because I happened to be in the local DVD shop and it should be one of his best Though the first 10-15 minutes of the movie were very promising and seemed at the beginning of not too mainstream psychological thriller, it soon went down and eventually fell into one of the most common movie films I've seen so far, including a lot of plot holes, unrealistic emotional responses and parameters. It seems that Boll tried his best to find a good plot, but after a while he gave up. Maybe he should stay in comedy?! Some of the good things about this movie is that it manages to create a general creepy atmosphere that the special effects are better than I expected, and the soundtrack goes well with the general atmosphere, but the unbalanced pace of this movie, combined with its perfect overall nature, makes it quite annoying for the last half hour to see, which destroyed my experience. It is very pretty well made shocking scenes, but it seems to be just for shock value. Let us not forget the camera work that was occasionally bad. <br /> <br /> I hope that Uwe Boll will learn one day that makes a good movie because, among many creepy films, he seems to be a decent film every now and then. The seed just isn't one of them.
