Pryor's and Gleason's comic option doesn't save this dog from thin pieces, a weak scenario, bad behavior, and ridiculous consistency to make it mess. It has very few memorable moments, but it dries well. As a child, I remember it as a Luke-warm vehicle for two actress-comedians, but there was always something strange about the flow and the feeling that was conveyed in each scene and how it would relate to the plot at all. Watching it again after years, it screams a-a-mania. I'm not worried about this racial contradiction, because I wouldn't want the film to see this problem lightly. The most obvious mistake for me is that the scenes are put out as a confused, unrelated series of 2-minute comedy bits (no good), created by the editor after the night, the local soldering. Characters change feelings and motivations on a fine line, without rhyme, without reason, between scenes and scenes, making it feel like no one has a clue what to get out of the scenario. Not that it was the beginning. I feel bad for the two parties whose legacy is damaged by this disaster. Maybe my sense of humor has become too refined ...
