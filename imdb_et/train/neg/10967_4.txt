Believe me, I like horror movies. I like science fiction. I like independent movies. And I like low budget B movies. Sometimes I even like bad acting, scripts, wooden lines, unlikely situations, and so on. But I didn't like Christmas on Mars. <br /> <br /> It just doesn't work on so many levels. For all the above reasons and more. This includes meaningless and blatant use of female genital images. And lots of tips for male genitals, very much on Freud. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that this is purely injustice. In contrast to some attempts to do something very different. I mean any movie that takes years to film, just can't keep up with the demands and focus of a modern audience. <br /> <br /> I had hoped the whole movie was a dream or hallucination of the main game. Unfortunately, it had to happen because we saw things on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say is that the picture at the end was amazing. If it had been used at the beginning, it would have allowed the film to come off when it ended in 2001 instead of ending it ... <br /> <br /> It wasn't a bad thing to do it. I just don't understand what was so important about this movie that it even had to be done. Was it a plot? Certainly it can't be. Was it characters? I doubt it; I mean, I could live without Ed 15. Was it a dialogue? It's clear no. Music? Maybe, but more likely to be the unceasing ego of the ledgers who need beating. <br /> <br /> In many better efforts, the cutting room is dead on the floor.
