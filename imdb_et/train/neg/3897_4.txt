The noted comedy is I.R.S. agent Tony Randall, who is investigating an eccentric family in Maryland who has never paid his taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the daughter of a tomboy farmer who squeezes rather uninteresting taxpayers. During this period, Debbie certainly made a part of the lower theater department - and it's no better or worse than the rest. The picture starts lightly, but flags half way, becoming frenzied and uncomfortable. Randall is not a bad game for Reynolds, but the vehicle itself wins the chemistry. Based on H.E. novel "Mai Darling Buds". Bates, a mixture of bad sound that causes the sound of all the actors as if they were stuck in the echo chamber. ** from ****
