I absolutely adore the book written by Robin Klein, so I was very excited to hear that the book created under the book was doing. because it didn't hit what I loved about this book - an absolutely ridiculously funny Erica and an interesting way she looks at the world. This is not what I imagined in the book. So, I went along the ride. It wasn't that bad, I guess. Miss Belmont was completely different from what I had imagined! I didn't think he would be one to smoke and drink - Jean Kittson, who plays him, is fun! job, but unfortunately I am a fan of a book (one of my favorite books of all time) that I couldn't help but feel disappointed = P
