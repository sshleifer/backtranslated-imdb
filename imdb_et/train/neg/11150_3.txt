I watched this movie alone in the dark and it was a full moon outside! I didn't do it for the purpose, it just happened that way. So all of these elements on this movie were to scare me of hell! Well, it wasn't, in fact, I wanted to close the DVD player in just 8 minutes, but I thought it would be an option, but unfortunately I did it. The actor was terrible, the only person with decent behavior was Samaire Armstrong. The plot is not original, if you're a spooky fan, it's the same thing you've seen many times before. Some scenes were not at all meaningful and you just feel that the director wanted to make the movie longer! Monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie. (Scary) scenes saw that they belonged to the 80s horror film, if there was not enough technology, but some good movies were then made! I was surprised when I saw the names of big production companies at the beginning of the movie, I thought they couldn't put that money on and make it decent? I was no longer able to keep up with movie reviews, this is my estimate of three out of 10.
