It took 9 years to complete this film. I think that during these 9 years, someone would have said that this movie is terrible. I've seen porn movies better. The story is tired and played. An abused child becomes a serum killer. How to change something new. How Does a Abused Child Become a Florist? At least it would have been a new twist. Why do you think anyone who has a camera and movie idea (especially unoriginal film ideas) thinks they can be directors? I admire that they captured the film for 9 years to end it. It shows endurance and spirit. Hopefully with such a drive, next time they can focus on a better script. If you want to see an unsuccessful experiment about making an indie movie about a Michigan writer / director, look at the hate for a minute. If you want a good movie about Evil Dead from a Michigan writer / director.
