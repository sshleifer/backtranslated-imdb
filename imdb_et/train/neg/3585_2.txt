As a big fan of gorilla films in general, I expected it to be great - and for gorilla effects, but they were pretty good - this is the only thing I can write about this flop. The film says it is based on a real story, but it doesn't really come close to what actually happened to "Buddy" - who in real life was famous for Gargantua sold to Ringling Bros by our "heroic". Gertrude Lintz, who is known by many animal enthusiasts as a woman who barely had his own animal welfare. As much as Buddy was shown to be aggressive, this complete fiction and gorilla never used such behavior in real life. the friend could not really get out of his wooden box during the storm (not the soft cage depicted in the movie) to look for shade and comfort in the house that scared Gertrude Lintz for his sale. No, Buddy did not descend into a family of gorilla surrounded by lush trees in a zoological paradise - he was left behind a wooden box on the back of the garage for a while and was then sold in a circus - where he actually lived for a better life where the peanuts were thrown away until he died (historically oldest living) gorilla, by the way), before the Miami show. Also note in the film how Buddy is aging, but chimpanzees never age. (By the way, the reflections were not raised simultaneously with other animals, including Buddy, as depicted in the movie)
