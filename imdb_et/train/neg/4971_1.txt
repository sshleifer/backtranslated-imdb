I work in the Blockbuster shop and every week we have movies that come with just a few copies, these are the movies the Sci-Fi channel shows. A movie that nobody wants, and just that idiot hire when they bring it back, I ask them "was that good?", They say "no, we turned it off in 15 minutes!" Movies with terrible computer production, super-set monsters and the like are very unpleasant. <br /> <br /> This is the same type of movie Grendel has, and the absolute waste of time, if you want a reasonably (and only reasonably) good Beowulf-based film, try Beowulf & Grendel, starring Gerard Butler, who is also starring eagerly expected from 300, like King Leonid Sparta. <br /> <br /> Plus, this year we have one more Beowul film with an asterisk that extends from Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson, Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. <br /> <br /> But don't let it build your hopes as we all did with the Eragon or we're all Another great disappointment. <br /> <br /> And with regard to rentals, here is my rule of thumb: if there are only one or two copies, do not rent it because its load is nonsense. % time, usually not valid if title is stranger or documentary.)
