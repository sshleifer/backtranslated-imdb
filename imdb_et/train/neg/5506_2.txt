We went to this movie because my husband had enjoyed the original version of "My Favorite Mars". We had our 6 year old daughter. She wanted to leave halfway through a movie that was good with both parents! Some of the things we saw were only occasionally humorous, mostly either too foolish or harsh. I hope this film can be between 9-12 children, if it is. This is definitely not suitable for younger children. From what I've heard, the original series was far better, and if you're going to "live the past," you're probably disappointed.
