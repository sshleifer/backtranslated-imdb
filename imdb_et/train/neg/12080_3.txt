I'm a fan of Shakespeare and MST3K so I waited for this episode. I comment on the movie first, then the MST3K episode. The recipe for this movie: Take talented actors, rich and beautiful Shakespeare materials and a $ 1.25 budget. Mix well, then drain all life and movement, up to dull and lifeless. Serve in cold large, simple stone boiler. The movie, I give 3 out of ten, because the actors deserve at least a little credit. Okay, now the MST3K episode. I admit that when I first saw it, I fell asleep. I understand that it was also a reaction of many other bran. But when I looked at it for the second time, I realized that there were a number of smart references and good things that I missed for the first time. The trick with this episode is: listen carefully! Every row is a couple of views. Give it a second chance and see what I mean. MST3K Episode: 7 1/2 out of 10.
