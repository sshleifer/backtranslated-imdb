It's available in "Drive In Double Feature" from Dark Sky Films and since I just finished "Barracuda", I also watched it. It's a movie that turns out to be incredibly ambitious and at the same time unfair. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the young lady traveling on the streets of two foreign cities, but where exactly are they? They stop looking at the necklaces of some Chinese vendors and try out Chinese-style clothes in the shops, but then see some of the Aztec dancers? And all the time, these girls are followed by two men who eventually fall out of any hidden things they didn't have to do through the cities, and they end up catching them. <br /> <br /> It seems that one of the girls is in the coin on the coin and these guys want to loot and where did he get it? So, on return we go back to find out. And how did they know he had this coin? Hard to say, really. <br /> <br /> Now, when these two women were ten years old, they were in the boat with their sister and sister boyfriends, and after stopping in their tanks, they pulled this young boy back to his home only for his grandfather would have come out and invite the "young" to uneven grandmother's roads. But not everyone has a way, Todd has returned to the boat to control the young girls, and when they are away, the boat blows up and when they get back to the house, their friends are mysteriously gone. Well, it seems that these "kindly folk" raise your vegetables, but they expect the meat to fall for the spell, and serve it with herbal teas. The island, but now, they return, their prisoners, and they are there to find treasure, despite the fact that no one has ever shown girls where it was before. There also seems to be someone else on the island, and insurgents are going to mysteriously die, one by one, and because there are only three, it won't take long. And there is even a happy ending that leaves the viewer as confused as they were with the rest of the movie each time. without being able to act, they are fun. The Hillbilly-type family also lacks the ability to act, even though Grandpa is Hank Worden, who appeared in many films and TV shows. Activities are confusing, local areas are still confusing and the island looks like Southern California. <br /> <br /> What the hell is that? I'm not sure, but definitely worth seeing once so you can think (or say)? 4 out of 10, very odd.
