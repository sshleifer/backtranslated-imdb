Basically, it is a long-term, unusual, action / comedy. First of all, I would like to say that I enjoyed Wayans' brother Scary Movie (1) and the successor had moments. Unfortunately, white chicks do not make HALF laugh. <br /> <br /> Humor is absolutely raw in it. If you like blasting, farting, stupid phrases, you should probably look at it. If it's not raw, it's idiotic. The first 10 minutes of the movie gave me everything, an unforgettable one, just an idiot. <br /> <br /> But I looked at it all because I was with a friend (otherwise I wouldn't bother). The story is undeniably thin, it was also in a scary film, but at least laughs were fast and persistent. I think this is probably one of the main problems with this film, laughs aren't coming fast enough. Some jokes are pulled out too long when they are funny on the contrary. If you prefer your comedy with some brain cell, you can simply prevent it. If you want to laugh foolish comedy more, check out the terrifying movie, plane, hotshots 1 + 2. <br /> <br /> 1/10 Totally miserable, thin story, a movie that seems to be based on one idea (what if we would we dress in white chicks for the film?) but just didn't have enough material.
