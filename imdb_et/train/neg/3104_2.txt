I've made a lot of comments about IMDb and this movie is unique in that I never saw the whole movie. It was so terribly stupid and uncomfortable that I just couldn't sit through it - though I tried. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this and every Mel Brooks movie I call "Mel Splitter". In other words, the better his film, the less you see him in the movie. Think about it - manufacturers and young Frankenstein were great movies and he was barely at all. BUT, such films as Life Stinks and Space Balls are full of Melissa and are pretty cunning movies (yes, NOT WISHED to Space Balls - but this is not the place to talk about). <br /> <br / Second, after cancer, rectal itching and mental retardation, I can't think of a less funny subject than homelessness. It's just a comedy interrupter. Think about it, people. The movie FUNNIEST (?) On the scene is Mel made with Leslie Ann Warren in the trash !! And in what way is it funny?
