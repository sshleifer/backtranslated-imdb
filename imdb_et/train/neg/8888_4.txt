I rated Basic Instincts 2 high, but this movie got less than 4 ratings. This movie only got me 4, but it has 7.3 more than 600 people. I see no reason why they like this movie like that. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring because it hardly leaves these rooms in a broken big house. There are only 5 people in this movie. It's almost two hours long, which is totally unnecessary. Many dialogues are slow and pointless. The film's tone is also dark blue, which is a delightful look. A movie can simply be shortened to a few sentences. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of Hou Hsiao's "Three Times" that one is so boring, dialogues are also boring. It also has a high rating! I had to stop watching it after the first story. <br /> <br /> This movie is not passion or excitement.
