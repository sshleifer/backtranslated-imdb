I've never seen a worse movie. <br /> <br /> You can take a video game and make it a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Error 1: Absolutely no link to any characters. In this movie, you don't associate with any characters, because ... you don't get the chance. <br /> <br /> The only sign that makes sense or even interesting is Deck Hand: Salish as played by Clint Howard. Except for this unique character, the result of the film is meaningless, since all the characters were lifeless from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Bug 2: The worst bomb attack. I love gunfights. I love the heroes opening to the badguys and the clean house. Heck I even like to watch the badguy clean house sometimes. But this weapon fight was strange, I think the best way to describe it is "Apathetic". I have seen people come to feel more emotional and emotional when they release VIDEOGAM. In this film it seemed and seemed "actors" just walked through the emotion without moving everything. <br /> <br /> Why? Where's the trash? Where are the attacks? These should be children who have been kidnapped by evil, but even real soldiers who act professionally and mercilessly show their humanity. Monsters, I recommend Sam Rami's Evil Dead series. DON'T see an accident that is the house of the dead. I hope they will burn the captain of this movie and all the copies.
