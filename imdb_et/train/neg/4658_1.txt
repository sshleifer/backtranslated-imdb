BRIEF SUMMARY is David Lean's classic strange and meaningless transformation of 1945, based on Noel Coward's "Still Life" game. The doctor removes laughing eye particles at the railway station, he is unhappy, he is happily married to a social worker of Italian origin. They meet randomly for the second time, make direct entertainment and organize meetings every Wednesday. The couple falls in love, but after some afternoon wear they realize that they do not have the real chance of happiness and agree. Coward's original single game played two ordinary people who fall in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two superstars and Hollywood Epic veterans, are not "ordinary people". Especially Loren is overwhelmed - Sophia Loren is full, just like a million dollars, working as a part-time volunteer social worker at Citizen Advice Bureau, just doesn't fit. Burton, looking at the eyes, with colored hair, too much make-up and platform shoes, is not your usual general practitioner. That means you can't really blame them for having a thing after seeing the spouses. Burton is married to a literary critic who spends toxic comments in the evenings and treats her husband with total contempt. Loren's wife, Jack Hedley, potters around the house and is forever boring: the most exciting thing he has ever done is almost six years. Their final scene in synergy creates nausea ("You've been a long, long way away", etc.). This great British team player, John LeMesurier, has a Burton friend for three minutes, and seems to be a little inebriated, talking hardly about the loud voice of his rows. This is a sad and forgotten performance with the cinematic frightening and terrible rehash of the cinema. Avoid at all costs.
