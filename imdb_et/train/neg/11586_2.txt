Nightmare Elm Street: The Child of Dreams <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. You can't get out of it. I love this series and I think Freddy is probably the best character ever in fear films. But even if I'm a fan I can't help but this movie is mediocre. <br /> <br /> Not even an attempt to create an interesting story and strong characters. They had just given up now. They don't even try. They are of course production products, hoping for a few simpler dollars. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't take your attention. It is so simple that it is almost absent. <br /> <br /> Alice, part 4, is now pregnant. Freddy comes back through the child's dreams. In the beginning we learn that to stop her, Alice has to find her mother. And that's it. <br /> <br /> The story is progressing slowly, because there is so little meaning on the plot that changes in a few minutes for bad dialogues and terrible deeds. In fact, this is the only frightening thing to do, because deaths are not even a bit cool. <br /> <br /> The characters are so uninteresting that we didn't care about them. <br /> <br /> Girls are as unpleasant as possible. The whole reminder reminded me of a bad amateur theater group. I've seen better actors at school. It is embarrassing indeed. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wilcox succeeds in bringing some more classes here. She is beautiful, sexy and has some talents. But the material just doesn't let it shine. It is unfortunate. <br /> <br /> The work of Stephen Hopkins is not close to Renny Harlin's great direction in the Dream Master. He tries to look for some imaginative pictures, but the tension Harlin and Craven have done so well in earlier films is not where they can be found. <br /> <br /> Dream Child is just another unimaginable sequel. It's a movie that gives a bad name to a horror story. <br /> <br /> Finally, frightening Freddy once. It's too sad to see her right away. A clown that isn't funny. Bad joke. Goodbye to Freddy.
