I was completely disappointed with this movie. I had read some other comments here and I had much higher expectations. I was expecting drama by developing a more intense character. But it never happens in the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor but not as good as some of our reviewers believe us. I thought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the film. I would appreciate his performance in 6 out of 10. <br /> <br /> By: 10 out of 10 Direction is from 5 to 10. The script is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I deleted my DVR movie after 70 minutes. movie. Lots of better movies out there than this ...
