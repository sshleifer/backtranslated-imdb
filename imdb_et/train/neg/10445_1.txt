It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, and the scandalous and biggest issue in the script is how this pretty low-eyebrow script went through the selection process. <br /> <br /> I like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to make more male-oriented kill everything you see in a movie, so I can't say I'm picky. I've been trying to find something to compare, but I just don't think of anything that suits it, maybe the star soldiers. 2. In my opinion, the witch is crying the gods of the film and thinking of throwing my DVD player out, but compared to that, its effect is great. Must provide a functional excellent and script. You know, the movie is funny bad, but people aren't the one who kills your soul in a minute.
