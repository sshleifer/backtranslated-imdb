2005 gave us a very decent "gore porn" flick Hostel and in 2006 gave us a Live Feed; The hostel is not so decent. Live Feed follows the same formula as Eli Roth's earlier film, except this time when fools are in Asia, not Central Europe. At the heart of the plot are these stupid children and one of them has irritated one of the locals to get into trouble. The locals decide to lock them all in the theater and kill them. Despite having heard less favorable things about this movie before seeing it, I was hoping it could be at least half as good as director Ryan Nicholson made a very decent 45-minute rape and revenge movie "Torched", but this movie falls just because most of it is ridiculous or boring. The film is obviously trying to go back to the good days of the Grindhouse Cinema (which the Hostel did well), but it really doesn't come out. Surprisingly, given Nicholson's earlier work on special effects - not even gore is impressive ... although it's much better than an actor! There's not much else I can say about this movie ... it's bad and not good. Avoid it!
