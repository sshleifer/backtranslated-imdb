Poor operation, no script, no plot, persuasive killer, no intercourse, no original settings, no use of one and the same bed / bed / rear-view mirror tactics, making it repetitive and boring, and not predictable, and the fact that NOBODY never "kills" is killed (at least not on the screen), which in turn pulls out any arbitration it can call out of it, and makes everyone feel more likely to spend money on their entrance ticket .... this horror movie with any horror LMAO . The MOST you see looks like someone who has taken a bottle of ketchup and sprayed it over a plastic sheet. <br /> <br /> You have to be a teen who sat there in the theater yelling and frightened yourself to enjoy it, or you were high / drunk at the same time. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I have life and do not bother writing comments, which is often not the case if I really do not hate anything and enjoy it enormously. <br /> <br /> But this movie is NOTICE and I feel I have a variety of duty to warn you not to give your money to Hollywood and encourage this movie again! <br /> <br /> One thing is "bad" renting a movie from Weinsteins, the other is if you have to sit in the theater. <br /> <br /> Even if you want a little remake of nostalgia, forget about it! It is neither remake nor transformation. It's not scary or tempting and not enough to be "funny", as others have claimed in IMDb ... it's just hidden and booing. <br /> <br /> Here's what you take away from this movie: remembering the grace on Brittany Snow's head, which looks more like a plot, the fact that Jonathan Schaech must have a sexual affair with JS on The Forsaken Cardoon has got another role as a murderer (because he is as scary as my trees and too cute to kill almost anyone) and someone who returns to the hotel suite is never coming back. What kind of person does not worry about the Miss when they decide to announce the prom king and queen candidates, and the hardly competitive girl just doesn't show up? This is my warning. DO NOT waste money as I did. "Original" sucks too, but is more guilty for Jamie Lee Curtis fans, although it's not as close as this cute piece (sorry for vulgar or rude, but when you see it, you understand why I'm saying what I'm saying.
