Positively terrible George Sanders vehicle, where he goes to the theft of the police tsar. <br /> <br /> Although Sanders was an actor of great character, he was certainly not the leading man and this film proves it. <br /> <br /> It's totally stupid. Gene Lockhart gave a comic relief until the anger of anger indicated that he would shoot with his weapon tragedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, George Sanders and co-star Carol Land committed suicide in real life. After such a regrettable production of the film, it is not shocking. <br /> <br /> Normal tempting Signe Hasso is nothing here.
