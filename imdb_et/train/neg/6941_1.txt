This film is not only boring, but also really badly done. Graphics are so bad they're not even at a second speed - they are terrible. The characters don't show facial expressions, the voice is empty and without breath, and the plot lacks a full .... well ... something and everything. My 5-year-old likes - but I think it's a bit boring. I agree with her.
