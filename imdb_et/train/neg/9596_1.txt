There is simply no use to glorify any part of this movie. <br /> <br /> It was directly in the trash. At first, you might think that you are visually stunning for a cinema ... and then soon after, you will be hit by a big FAIL bag. Fighting is hardly a martial art, the actor is par on the parameter and there is no need to describe the music. Only the story is an excuse for this movie. The decisions that the characters make and how they deal with the situations are weak and do nothing but distract me. I think the only reason why this movie came was using Yumiko Shaku to do a little bit of fan service.
