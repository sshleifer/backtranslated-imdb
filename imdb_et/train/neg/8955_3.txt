As far as the film is concerned, it is an OK fiction film. It has many cool things and some quality scenes. That means it's not that good, and some things are pretty far off ... <br /> <br /> With this call, one more cube movie is perfect and perfect! This is a very big and inventive definition of the milking of the original film ... The whole feeling that it can be interpreted somewhat as the core of the first, but the introduction of people / androids as part of the "team" behind the cube. is somewhat stretched ... <br /> <br /> I gave it 3 *** because of the original back. It should have been sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all ... <br /> <br /> Traceable to those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube but are not recommended series for fans ...
