Listen to some interesting things our fighter hero believes in healer Pat, his son Gordon (the Ministry of Television seems like a family business.) And Terry Meeuwsen (won Miss America in 1973, wearing a swimsuit and showing his legs. Oh my goodness!) poor viewers are sick and need help. <br /> <br /> 1. Someone who has an "abscessed right tooth" has just improved. Someone who has "twisted intestines" has healed.3.So Terry said there was a "strange state" person, (You mean God doesn't know?) Burning the feet that has just healed. Then Gordon said there was a man (it narrows it!), Where is the better swelling of the sinuses, with much pain behind the right eye, but he has now improved. stroke is now able to walk. 6. Terry said he saw someone with a heavy bone in his neck but did not know the exact disease (God does not know?) - that the person is now healed. 7. Someone paralyzed on the right side, especially (not exactly?!) The right side of the face is now improved.8. A man (which narrows the world population again) with a plate in his skull is constantly in trouble and doctors just don't know what to do. Terry said he saw the rebuilding of the bones around the plate (a funny bone ?!) and the pain of the man has disappeared, he has now recovered. <br /> <br /> He knows how our war hero, Pat, helps our sick and poor people. 1. There is a woman in Kansas City (Missouri or Kansas, but it narrows down). Who in you, what the lord dries, thank you now to Jesus. 2. There is a man with a financial need - I think a hundred thousand dollars. (I think their god must go to school or something!) This need is fulfilled now and within three days the money will be delivered. Holy Spirit through wonderful power. Thank you to Jesus. 3.Cincinnati is a woman with lymph node cancer. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it has been diagnosed (Ask your revenge god Pat!), but you don't feel good and the lord dissolves this cancer right now! (What?!) 4. Lady in the back is a lady at the back of a wheelchair-curve (I think Canada). The Lord stretches out what we have now, and you can stand and walk! (If you have this condition ignore Pat!) This and it is yours. Thank you to Jesus! Amen, Amen! <br /> <br /> When Pat Robertson had prostate cancer, did he go to Peter Popoff? Oral Roberts ?, Benny Hinn ?, Terry or Gordon? No! On February 17, 2003, Pat went to surgery to become a surgeon! (You mean he doesn't trust his faith in healing friends, Terry or his own son Gordon?!) <br /> <br /> When LT Pat Robertson was a military during the Korean War, he was a liqueur officer who was responsible for providing officers with liquid. He was known to drink himself and often prostitutes and he feared he was contacting gonorrhea. (Did you ask for a healer of faith!) <br /> <br /> The reason Pat got out of the fight was because his father, Absalom Willis Robertson (D Va from 1946-66), was chairman of the Senate Military Appropriations Committee. <br /> <br /> Terrorist Attacks, September 11, 2001 We've imagined ourselves to be vulnerable and consumed by material, health, wealth, worthy of $ 150 and $ 200 million! (mansion on Virginia beach, helicopter launch pad !) and sexuality (She had sex with her future husband before the marriage they had a son!). This (terrorism) is because God raises our defense for us (a statement published on September 13, 2001). Pat Robertson reminds me of the Burgermeister coming from Santa Claus and his evil hostile god reminds me of Venger Dungeons and Dragons. <br /> <br /> The corrupted brat Gordon does what Father Pat tells him and Terry is a paid yes woman who doesn't have his own thoughts! <br /> <br /> It really grabs you! The September 5, 2005 edition, The 700 Club, included a report from Christian Broadcasting Network's correspondent Gary Lane outside the New Orleans Conference Center, which has mostly accommodated the victims of the impoverished black disaster throughout the weekend. evacuating "Lane said" they add this voodoo to the cup saying, "Is the curse with you?" One New Orleans plastic souvenir cup appeared on the screen. "The title of Guerrilla Warfare and Thugs 'R' Us." Lane noted, marking a busy pile or rap CD on the ground. (His great dads, Absalom, have taught Pat to racism well!) <br /> <br /> If any of you good people who ever think to donate to these sex-glorified people on behalf of God, no! You sponsor a softball or basketball team, give food to the shelf, be a big brother or sister to your child, but please do not give these people because they have been around for more than 40 years and have not solved anything. <br /> <br /> If you still don't believe in Pat Robertson, who listened to the web during a business interruption and watched the search, and if you hear what he really likes, then I know you won't give one cent to those worshipers! And otherwise Terry was divorced and Pat spoke several times of his divorce. <br /> <br /> I like to say that people in Dover Pennsylvania, Orlando Florida, and the beautiful people who have hit Hurricane Katrina and I hope this is a pleasant day. Have the operation blessing been useful to New Orleans (I doubt!) Please let your readers know! I do! By the way, if your sick, go to a real doctor and let everyone laugh at these liars, and one day, Burgermeister Pat, Gordon and Terry can go somewhere else and take their angry god Venger!
