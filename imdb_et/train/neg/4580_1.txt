I'm still trying to decide if it's really the worst film I've ever seen. The very troublesome problem with this movie is that real scientists are interviewed, but their film material has been modified to look like they would support ideas from many BSers who fill the film. The interviews have a BS signal ratio of about ten thousand to one - finally, the interviewees seem to say, "We want you _think_ !!", but they're too lazy to do simple research on the things they say that you are open and want to expand your consciousness, be open enough to read some actual books on quantum theory: "Einstein's Universe", Nigel Calder (thin volume, not challenge), "Cosmic Code", Heinz Pagels. If you cannot read a book, please do not complain to the reviewers that they are "open". <br /> <br /> To take back this movie, it's just incredible bad. <br /> <br /> Do you know what a really good movie is, which questions the nature of reality? "Thirteenth Floor", directed by Roland Emmerich, with Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'onofrio. Smart, sexy, thoughtful.
