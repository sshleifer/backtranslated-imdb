It's not just that it's a bad movie; in this movie, there are not only four "best" Mexican filmmakers; and it's not just that the script is terrible. It's just that ... this movie sucks ... great time. These people waste money on terrible scripts. It should criticize Mexican society, but we are tired of such films. Should bad language be funny? I can't get it. Mexican cinema is big without problems if this type of movie continues (and is written and produced). <br /> <br /> Don't think that such films are well received in Mexico: we hate them and don't reflect us.
