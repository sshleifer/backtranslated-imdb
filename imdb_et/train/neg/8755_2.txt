This movie was the least creepy. I was hoping much better after seeing High School Musical. The whole movie was a "simple life" complete hanging, only this was not a reality show. <br /> <br /> Operation was not good at all. Amanda Michalka had her moments when she wasn't so terrible. On the other hand, Alyson Michalka was bad all the time. Chris Gallinger, who played Amanda's love, played a French guy but had a terrible accent. One of the good things about this movie was the totally divine Michael Trevino, who played Alyson's love interest. Just to remember something when this movie was first delivered to High School Musical, it probably wouldn't be so bad. But that was not a comparison. <br /> <br /> Generally I give him 2.
