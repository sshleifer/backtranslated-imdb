Man oh man! Which piece is filming! But this is the joy of my childhood, although I hate to admit it. They showed this movie in their main cable system all the time. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the border of Cupertino), our cable system was the thing called the G-channel. And they basically showed the same movie over and over again. Wanda Nevada was one of those films. I fell against the craving and love of the young Brooke Shields and loved the adventures of his 40's in Grand Canyon. The script has almost no sense, the direction is bad, some emphasize that Henry Fonda makes a look, a lot of dialogue that is so bad that it is good and a nice Carole King song was played over credit. Maybe you have to squat to really enjoy it. And hey, everyone knows there's no gold in Grand Canyon!
