There's a time when kids have grown up without ever seeing it, and only Bugs Bunny can (technically) on the lips of another person. There's a time when it's not a Duck or Rabbit season. It is a time when Tazmania's devil is dubbed politically wrong. <br /> <br /> But so do not help me now. <br /> <br /> Nobody really wants the EXTREME version of our beloved Loony characters. Who is this marketing who comes up with "Corn Nuts: Corn went wrong" and "Extreme Doritos" and probably this scary turtle should know that precisely because they have a degree in business or advertising or does not mean they know the jack I think they are doing services to the children, leaving them the one and the most iconic exhibition of the time. It shows me disgusting and it's not just dated art or terrible dialogue. They abuse good voices like Phil Lamarr, Michael Clarke Duncan, Candi Milo and so many others. It lacks style, humor, character development and, most importantly, heart. <br /> <br /> The exhibition, as it has been repackaged by characters (Slam Tasmanian, Rev Runner, Ace Bunny), is just its former, timeless, and hidden shadow. beautiful myself.
