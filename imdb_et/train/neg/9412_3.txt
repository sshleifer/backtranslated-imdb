This film was part of the 2007 Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival. I had no hope for a movie if someone chose it for me. <br /> <br /> I like movies that need time to develop, movies that allow characters to open and play. The quiet situation is good. But this movie was pretty slow. <br /> <br /> Credit must go to two main players. There was tension between them because two completely different people, who really do not fit, come together very uncomfortably. There were delicate moments and sadness when we learned more about them. <br /> <br /> I also liked the device and the way it was shot. It was claustrophobic and monochrome, and it increased the intimacy of the film and strengthened the symbolic character. <br /> <br /> I just don't understand the end. What was it all about?
