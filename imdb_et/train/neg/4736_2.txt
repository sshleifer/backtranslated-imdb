The movie deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl, (I'm sorry I'm biased, I think the beautiful girl is the only highlighting of the movie) and 0.5 that it's shorter than Azumi 1. I looked at Azumi's 1 and 2 in 1 seats. I was amazed to be able to sit through it. <br /> <br /> Allows you to talk about the movie's plus points. The girl. Ueto Aya is cute. All this is to save the whole movie. The fact is that if the protagonist is a man, I'm sure most people (including me) wouldn't have touched the film at all. <br /> <br /> Now you can talk about the negative points. First, it is a real twitch with lots of repetitive scenes. Nachi and Azumi scenes come back. It looks like it's a drama way to shoot. Typical Japanese dramas love setbacks and this movie. Secondly, the film is too unrealistic in the historical environment. I don't mind unrealistic movies. But this film is like a poor way to show creativity by throwing it into ninjas that act like bears and spider webs, and so on. ... reminds me of Shinobi, although Shinobi is a fantasy movie. What's more, to imagine "i-don't-know", what effect does a director have on people who die with blood spray (literally), everywhere ... people who don't know their head are cut off. .. etc. etc. Too many of them violate the exhibition. The effect of anime in this movie seems to be strong. It greatly worsens the exhibition. Third, whether Asum should be an assassin. He seems to be more of a single man army for me, just as he is a woman. I don't think you can see assassins in military camps. The only time I felt he was an "assassin" was when he killed Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Asum. Finally, the film was thin on both films. It is a linear graph with no development and no surprises.
