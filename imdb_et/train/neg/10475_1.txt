I am a young pastor's wife and we saw this movie. Then we spent one hour explaining it to them. They didn't get it and I didn't enjoy it. It is based on a concept that has passed through all three major religions of the world (Bible Code, Thumbnail Code, and Code in the Qur'an) and is as questionable as ridiculous. This is not a progress for Christians in art, it is a step forward for those who believe that we control our brains at the door.
