I would like to think of myself with relatively open thinking and I have a lot (!) That I don't like the movie, but it is undoubtedly one of the most crappile movies I've ever seen! <Br>> <br /> I don't know what is wrong with people who gave him such a good rating (imdb is usually quite reliable for ratings) ... the only thing I imagine is that people have to vote one or more of the following conditions: <br /> <br /> 1. If they think they are stuck / stuck. 2. They've got hard money to vote 3. Under the gunpoint <br /> <br /> I can't believe I wasted a good 1h 45 min. pathetic apology for the movie.
