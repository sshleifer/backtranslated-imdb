My sincere advice to everyone: don't look at the movie. even this glimpse is bad for health. serious. no jokes. this is 3.30 in the morning. and I came back from this crappi of this universe. WORKING FOUR !!! I'm proud to stay alive after that! If it is called survival. <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed. annoyed. disappointed. it was a waste of time! money went drain! no plot. I hope I will wake up tomorrow and without the memories of that night! RUBBISH MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Happy Republic Day for Everyone :)
