After the success of Paris, Je T'Aime, the group decided to meet the directors and make a similar anthology film in New York. Unlike the original movie, the stories of this film sometimes seem too fast and reach - by the time you think you get the story, it is over in too many cases. And often start and stop and then start again - with stories woven. As a result, there is no title to show that the story is complete and the structure is less formal. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, although "Paris, Je T'Aime" hit or missed (mostly hit), most "New York, I Love You" was miss. The stories were more sexual, but also much less sweet - and often quite terrible. It was an amazingly boring and uninteresting movie with just a few extraordinary stories - and perhaps the often dwindling music seemed more. Now understand, it was good quality music, but its dark tone really made me feel like cutting my wrists! Among the better ones was the story of a young man who took girls in a wheelchair, a couple talking about fraud outside the restaurant (although it was also on the first film) and an older couple. It's all so sad because I had loved the first movie so much - and I really love WANTED this movie. I respected what they tried, but I just didn't like it very much. By the way, and it's NOT really a complaint, but I was surprised how many people were smoking in the movie. For a recent film that was unusual in our anti-smoking culture. <br /> <br /> Also, when you get a DVD, there are two segments that are not included in the movie. One consists of Kevin Bacon (wearing cool fedora) who eats hotdog .... and absolutely nothing more than ten minutes. Another feature is a teen who spends a movie that records the world, including a very unhappy couple.
