I'm sorry, but I am breaking the plot line as well as the end for you, in the hope of avoiding a holiday break like what I see now. Father died and mother asks Santa in a letter to bring him back to Christmas ... and Santa. Father is peachy, happy healthy and fully aware of the fact that he was dead. All ends are syrupy sweet. <br /> <br /> But when a parent who recently looked at his five-year-old lost dog friend, it was a horror shot. Now my son is convinced that everything he needs to do to bring his friend back is to ask Santa! Do not underestimate the power of the young heart - no persuasion convinces him that it was just a film and that his dog was not coming to Christmas. It has been a break of heart to look at his joy only knowing that he will have to face his loss again on Christmas Eve. <br /> <br /> Shame you on behalf of all believers who have recently loved the lost. For a child, it is hard to cope with the damage once, but there are some wishes that we should not even imagine.
