In the future of 2001, Freddy will be the last surviving teenager on Elm Street.

Not even the great legendary Alice Cooper could skip this film. And if they ever had a daughter in hell? The entire film is constantly slowing down in a more conceivable way, with shape and shape. Rachel Talalay, you smell high in the sky, babe. <br /> <br /> My Class: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Additions: Cast and Crew Bios; Jump to the 3D series and jump into a nightmare (appendixes to the movie can be found on The Nightmare Collection DVD from Seventh Disc) <br /> <br /> Content of DVD-ROM: Trivia game; Scenario; and web link
