Well, what was fun ... except for the fun part. /> <br /> Let's get started. Teaser, it was very well done and emotional. Being a great animal mistress that I am, it was fun to see so many beautiful animals in this episode. Little point, so these animals were kidnapped by aliens and impregnated? whaaa ??? the dialogue was also quite terrible. There were about one or two quoted lines. <br /> <br /> And the worst thing about all these animals dying was very unpleasant for me. Finally ... what's the point? they all died a lot. We didn't learn anything, we were not entertaining, and I couldn't even find Sophia's death sad ... just very frustrating. <br /> <br /> Star. shame because the 2nd season was so good.
