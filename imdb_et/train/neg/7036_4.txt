I will not destroy anything when I tell you that you will see a woman having sex with a goat in this movie. If that's your thing, your movie has arrived. <br /> <br /> The woman and her husband are going to look at his stranger sister's family mansion in the woods. Her sister is horrible to say horrible and she seems to be interested in family love. On the side, foolish, unattractive characters appear and begin to establish all kinds of pagan rituals. <br /> <br /> Drawing is pretty weak and characters are pretty stupid. She sticks even after her husband turns into jerky and hangs on the Gentiles, even continues to have sex with her. There are many bared meat and a couple of kinky dressings on the exploitative side of things, but something that hasn't been better anywhere else. Oh, and the above-mentioned goat-sex scene. <br /> <br /> Most of the viewers will not finish it. Benefit fans will drive it out, but they will stay more. <br /> <br /> 4/10
