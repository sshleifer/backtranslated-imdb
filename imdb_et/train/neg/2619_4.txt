This is a good film for lovers of dogs. It runs slowly slowly slowly but ends when De Vil's bow. The main picture is the same as the first movie. The bright side of the adult film is a spoken bird who thinks it is a dog. The bird speaks like a person (Eric Idle Monty of Python) and barks like a dog. This is a comedy that the film needs more. See it in matinees, so you don't have to pay the whole price or wait for it to appear in Disney.
