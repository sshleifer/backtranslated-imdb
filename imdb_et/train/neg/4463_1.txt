This is one of those films that will make you want to look back at it, and then for a while, such as the time you accidentally picked up, the time to get to a video store, and so on. <br /> <br /> First of all, look: it's grainy, it's a small budget. Now, if by itself does not make a bad film. But the way it was filmed makes the activity unnatural, so it's annoying. <br /> <br /> Then, the story. 3 gals is going gal gal weekend boy. Of course, as EVERYONE does when he went on a camping trip, they stop on the road with earrings. When they reach the area where they stay, they get over from Mr. Ranger, who scares them to throw a cigarette illuminated during a fire and then drives them from where they go (the distant cabin). Of course, 2 "cute boys" are flying close to them and Bambi (yes, Bambi) and Aubry will hit right away, but probably Bambi will hit with two legs. Mady is quite disappointed with this development because she was waiting for the weekend where she forgot her ex, getting ** - facing and stoned. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I almost forgot, there is an average old hermit living in this way, maybe someone who doesn't want to mix, and the area and salon they are in is kind of "reputation" ". <br /> <br /> So, of course, sooner or later (unfortunately much later), some of our weekend wooden visitors will begin to die and find different strikes (though some of them are really less) and of course the rest of the campers are upset. Of course, there is no mobile phone reception (who would lose the opportunity to watch his mobile phone in the receiving movie anymore?). Mr. Ranger Sir keeps the odd times up and his behavior seems a bit strange, but he's said he's getting help. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic twist that you just don't want to miss when you're still awake. Pray that you wake up on an empty screen. <br /> <br /> It is terrible, the production values ​​are terrible, and the whole company is just flat and I find it amazing that it was even released. Avoid every 10 out of 10.
