James Gandolfini is a good actor, so what he ever did in this uncomfortable piece of garbage. Affleck is just an easy one who just can't cut it, the rest is truly unforgettable. I saw it in an empty theater in the US, I knew why this place was empty after about 10 minutes. I went out before the end, it was so bad, so imagine my surprise when I saw back in England that the movie had a yoyo "Paul Ross" glowing report on one Sunday Sunday. I've always been trusted by Ross to save money on cinema tickets when he says the movie is good, I get directly from this website to check it out. This movie should have gone straight to a 1.99 pound DVD at a supermarket near you.
