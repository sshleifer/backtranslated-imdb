Although it is properly warned, I sat down to watch this movie. Partly because I usually give a break to every movie and because I thought one movie wasn't that bad. I'm standing up. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick, or Ben Stein could get this turkey from drowning like tons of bricks. Only once during this humor, when I was frightened, I smiled. Namely, Simon says during the scene. Other jokes are either badly done or just plain simple. And some of the ones you actually see will stay for miles. This movie just didn't get what is a good parody like a plane! (I + II), Naked Gun (I + II + III) or Scary Movie. They all had A. funny jokes, B. good dialogue and most important of all C. unforgettable quotes. Men In White has received none of the above from D. Naming this movie would be bad little. HOW TO REMOVE THIS MOVIDE! CONSIDERING THAT!
