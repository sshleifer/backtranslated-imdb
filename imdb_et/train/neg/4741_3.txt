Wendy Wu: The Homecoming Warrior has a very good, strong plot, but it has ruined the details of the whole cheese. I'm a younger teenager and didn't enjoy the movie very much. I thought the effect was terrible, but they may seem like entertainment for younger children. The matrix moves destroyed the action, you know it was completely fake. Then was Yen Lo, an evil spirit, who temporarily holds random people and in his home country, where Wendy tried to win. It all ends up as a typical feeling of a good movie when Wendy and her Buddhist monk cousin Shen end up with Yen Lo (and destroy her forever). So Wendy's lesson is learning ... blah, blah, blah. I'm ready for the next DCOM.
