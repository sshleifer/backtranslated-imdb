Bollywood fans keep the Amitabh Bachan beetle very much, but I think it is very overpriced. Manmohan Desai previously collaborated in films such as Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee, and Coolie, and I've seen all I liked so I had great expectations before I looked at Mard and was bitter disappointed. My main grip on Mardi is that it seems that Amar Akbar's Anthony, part 2, maybe Mr Desai ran out after he used this formula for years and years. 1. First of all, some cast members will be repeated from AAA, such as a police inspector who brings Amari, a Muslim who brings Akbar, Nirupa Roy and some more. 2. In AAA, Nirupa Roy loses his vision, losing his voice in Mard. 3. In AAA, Mard also has a famous song (Shird wale got a baby), we have Amitabh singing the Earth Sherawal. Having seen AAA more than 1000 times, I noticed it immediately. My other grips are that some situations seem ridiculous, the real Manmohan Desai made his brain to the door but with Mard. I thought he went too far. My last handle is that, compared to the songs from previous Manmohan Desai films, I found the songs quite disappointing. I know it has many fans who swear it, but I didn't like it a little. In fact, I have the mistake of writing this review because I am such a big fan and have loved my movies because I was a child.
