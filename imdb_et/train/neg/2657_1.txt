I was looking forward to seeing this movie very much. Assuming it is described more precisely as the "Christmas Box", based on Richard Paul Evan's book. I sent many e-mails to friends and family asking them to watch this show, hoping that they would better understand the small amount of my new life. After seeing the movie, I was so disappointed. Being a mother who in November 2003 lost her only child and really knew the pain, I was hoping that this film sheds light on parents who "think" they understand the grief that a parent goes through who has lost a child. This film was a very light-hearted film, and Diane Keaton's stupidity was a blow to the child's buried parents. It was very unrealistic from start to finish. I had some calls after the movie, each one calling the same way: "It was out of the mark and showed that in a short time you are back on track and listening to radio songs and life is back" a bunch of bulls! It is clear that the director and Keaton have never lost children because neither would ever have made this film out of the mark. I think it's Hollywood.
