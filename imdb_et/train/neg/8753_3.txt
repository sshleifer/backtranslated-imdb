This movie only reminds me of Mary-Kate and Ashley. Just rich sisters, which I think, although Alysons more actresses, in this movie Amanda michalka was sometimes okay, but Alysons acted beaten. I think that after high school music they had to get out better and it certainly wasn't. The story was not so big and I think they should have two other people playing Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big fan of Alyson Michalka and this film didn't make me better. i think they should definitely be sick and watch this movie only if you have nothing better to do (which was unfortunately not)
