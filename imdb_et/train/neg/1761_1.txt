First, I understand that the "1" rating should be reserved for the worst worst. This film comes from me because, as one reviewer points out, it is not self-conscious, so overwhelmed so that it can have a comic or a cult value. It just leaves its mark on every number. ** Includes possible spoilers ** Dialogue is completely unpleasant. Consistency is so deliberate that it is painful. Daniel stops talking about his lost love, and his last word begins with flamenco dancers. What is his name (see? I don't even remember the name of my character, let alone the name of a forgotten actress) when her husband (Baldwin) tells her that her friend is a bad boy. Car and motorcycle moves did all the right things. Vegetable carts were flying. Cars fall into each other. Motorcycles that go down the stairs. People who have almost hit but noticeably have no one. Oh, that's right ... except for one man who has been robbed several times, it's obviously a stumbling block along the curb, and the approaching car probably didn't notice him there. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> For me, it's more and more remarkable that such movies can be made. There's so much pressure in the film industry to make money, so you think someone in Hollywood would think about making good movies. Now it's a new idea. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: you can't see this movie. Don't rent a DVD. Don't look at the cable. You have many other things you could do that will make you more sensitive.
