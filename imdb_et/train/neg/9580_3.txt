Former brat pack actress and all round beautiful boy Rob Lowe stars in the movie set in high security American prison. I had a gut feeling that his character would become popular for all the wrong reasons, like Tobias in the first OZ series, but PROXIMITY isn't such a movie, it's more like a "Man on run" movie like FUGITIVE. It also makes James Coburn a commitment to crime and justice, which puts the victims' group of victims in justice, but all intelligent discussions about how society should treat criminals is completely ignored because the film degenerates into tired old clich√©s about shooting and cars.
