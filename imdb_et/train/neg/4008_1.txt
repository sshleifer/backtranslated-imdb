As a fan of Sookie Stackhouse's books, I think that this series represents their full representation. Vampire Bill is not very good looking and looks much older than described in the book. I found that they have already made wonderfully colorful characters that seem very natural and vulgar. One of the things I loved about books is that, despite having gone through Sookie, it's always a lady, but she doesn't even look at the TV series. Not only is the bias in the TV series not nearly as widespread in books. I didn't expect an exact copy of the books, but I was expecting at least to use them in the series.
