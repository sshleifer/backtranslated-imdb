This is a pretty bad movie. But not as bad as it mentions. Production values ​​are not too bad and there is a strange effective scene. And it has an 80-year-old cheezoid veneer, which means it's always fun. See also Jimmy Nail's short look - his experiment with the American accent is so amazingly rubbish it fantastic. Sybil Danning's breasts are also fantastic - they make a short look in the film, but the scene is repeated endlessly, which can only be described as a 12x remix of Sybil Danning's breasts. As a fear film, it is not scary, the effects are stupid and Christopher Lee appears in his performance as a dream, I think he bought a new house and needed money to deposit. Wife - were so insignificant that I have almost forgotten about all of them and I watched this movie tonight, and werewolves are considerably less impressive than in the original film, actually odd, they sometimes look rather badly burned monkeys. The atmosphere in Europe is pretty good and the music offered by the new wave brand Babel, while quite dreadful, gives at least the cheese added to the film. <br /> <br /> Generally? Good laugh. were you seriou expect it to be? And at least you've always got Sybil's knockers.
