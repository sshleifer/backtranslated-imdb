It could have been a wonderful story based on the cat's ancient competitions, but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> This work could have been just that; admirable and full of mythological references that keep my charm. Guides (Charles Brady, played by Brian Krause and his mother Mary, played by Alice Krige) were low, lacking in personality and hardly pleasing or drawing. Even MÃ¤dchen Amick (who played Tanya Robertson) didn't fit the character in this description. <br /> <br /> But as I have said several times before you adjust the TV's Stephen King novel, you just have to consider the fact that his books are not written on television and his scenario talent unfortunately has no fire and depth that she exhibits as a writer. <br /> <br /> This is another attempt to try to write Stephen King's magic, be it his novels or his original scenario. Just cut and paste your work on a small screen. His novels are completely bastardized in the process and everything you finally create is a nice movie; nothing else but definitely nothing else. His scenarios have hit and miss. Unfortunately, this was an interpreter of the scenario. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Sorry, the movie will not work. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 1.0 / 10 ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
