I think this is one of Kenneth Branaghi's Shakespearia's weakest works. After such great efforts as much Ado something, etc. I thought it was bad. The cast was weaker (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhone ???), but my biggest grip was that they interfered with Bardi's work and cut out some of the games that were put into musical / dance series. <br /> <br /> You just don't make Shakespeare and then get confused. Sorry, but it's just wrong. I love some Cole Porter like the next person, but jeez, don't mix with Shakespeare. Skip it and see "Prospero Books" if you want to see the brilliant customization of the Shakespeare tempest.
