Comedy Central has a habit of making big programs from time to time for the Chappelle Exhibition, The Daily Show, Colbert Report, and then for some people who are loved or hated by Stella, Dr. Katz. Then there are some exhibitions that have their own defenders but are just terrible - Mencia and now, Sarah Silverman. <br /> <br /> This exhibition is based on the fact that Silverman is self-centered, which may be funny (Colbert Report), but may be terrible (Mencia's mind). It should not shock anyone, which I think is the last. This exhibition is a parody of sitcom and society, the program is so absurd that it loses its absurdity and is simply not funny. Many times, a comedy is a smiling woman because it is not something that is common. We don't need it for 25 minutes. When the offender is armed by the armed forces, it simply loses its appeal - we saw it back with Jay and Silent Bob Strike, except the women were hotter and the whole scene was more absurd, making it better. But the best comparison of this show is Stella, except Stella was finer, which made the absurd comedy funny. It was better action and I think a little more is a fantastic realistic view. <br /> <br /> Maybe some reviews are so negative (I am very skeptical about critical recognition, but do not dispute the fans' response) this ad has a lot of ads, very unpleasant ads through many programs that exceed the advertising of other programs. Many people wonder why Sarah Silverman has a career and others are bitter when better exhibitions have been canceled. This exhibition would never have had to go beyond the failed pilot phase. There were many more promises back to the Norm, but this exhibition will do more. And when critics are right, many things are universally sealed and their status rises enormously. Last time I also checked Britney Spears for a good overview. However, take this comparison if you want, because no one suspects that I am psychotic in IMDb that it will not be shown.
