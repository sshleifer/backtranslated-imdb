As big as Texas prairie and equally boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills and Dennis Hopper can't swim this overbloated boat. Taylor really sees bad - the wrong wardrobe, the wrong hair, and the wrong makeup - a unique achievement in his remarkable career. Hopper gives a unique incredible result and Dean in the climatic scene shows remarkable talent that we usually don't remember - comic actor. Rock Hudson is his usual Barbie Doll Ken prototype and makes one miracle that Redford could have done with a man's lead. There is no visible plot that would give tension up to the last 20 minutes, but just a little interrelated milestone paste. With the exception of Hopper, there is no character formation, just a set of cardboard cutouts that appear regularly without apparent reason like random targets in the shooting gallery. Against its credit, the film deals with racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo, and has SIZE, so it's a great choice to get rid of unwanted guests. Those with a DVD version can save some of their tedium by starting from the second disk. You won't lose anything interesting.
