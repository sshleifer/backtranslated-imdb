This movie was rented by a friend. His choice is usually good. I first read the cover and waited for a good movie. Although it was a <br /> <br /> horror movie. What I wouldn't prefer. But there was no fear when watching the movie. It was boring, <br /> <br /> not a very fun movie. Denise Richards's appearance was once again a joy to the eye. But that's it. We (our four) <br /> <br /> are a little disappointed. But watch this movie and rate it yourself.
