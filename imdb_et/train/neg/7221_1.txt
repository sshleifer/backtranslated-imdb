.... CAUSE! A movie that makes you laugh at the filmmaker and say "WHY?" The amazing camera work ... reads the times the camera tries to stay on one person and can't. The dialogue is ridiculous. Operation is comic. They seem to have taken a ghost town in the West to see if they could save as little money as possible. I'd put $ 10 to use home video cameras to do that. Was that or most of the camera men drunk. Truly, trailers are more entertaining than film. If you ever want to host the "worst movie", bring it. You want more entertainment ... stare on the wall.
