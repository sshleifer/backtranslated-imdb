Just don't worry. I thought I could see a movie with a great newspaper and action. In the middle of the film there is a small social drama and all the tensions disappear because it slows down the speed. Finally, it gets better, but not big. I think the director took this movie too seriously. In such a movie, even if u don't care about the plot, you want at least some nice action. I almost missed the middle / main part of it. Rating 3/10. <br /> <br /> Derboiler.
