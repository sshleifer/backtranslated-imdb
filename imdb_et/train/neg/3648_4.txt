A childless couple (Brooke Adams, Jeff Hayenga) goes to the doctor (James Karen) to try. It works, but Adams is slowly knowing that there is something seriously wrong with the child ... <br /> <br /> A pretty interesting idea has been thoroughly conducted with a nervous script - the basic idea is OK, but it becomes an amazingly predictable ending. I saw every "twist" coming. The direction is poor - he seems to have a clue how to shoot the main scene. Production values ​​are - be nice. Very shabby. And the gore scenes are too unpleasant (I almost turned off when a pregnant woman started to grab her stomach) with extraordinary special effects. The film ends completely when it becomes quite clear that they had no idea how to finish this movie. <br /> <br /> Some good practices make it somewhat tolerant. Adams, Hayenga, and Karen are all good in their role and keep me looking, but that was it. This film hardly came out in 1991 and is still unknown - it's easy to see why. I'll give her 4.
