When George C. Scott played the role of "Patton", he saw him driving his tanks with his tanks, shooting German diving bombers with a revolver and forcing both bosses and subordinates. Gregory Peck's "MacArthur" biggest amount of the same debut-winning war is when he touches the cards on his finger and raises his famous eyebrows. <br /> <br /> Pecki's comparison with Scott may be unfair. But the fact that "MacArthur" was made by the same manufacturer and the same composer strikes parallels, as well as the fact that both films are opened with the generals of the West Point cadets. It is clear to me that filmmakers wanted to emulate this Oscar winning film a few years ago. But while Peck sees some more than Scott ever did, he comes out as mostly a bland story that feels less like drama than Wikipedia walkthrough MacArthur's later career. <br /> <br /> "To date, those who think he is a dangerous demagogue and others who say he is one of the greatest people ever lived are telling us the title of the opening." This is a typical food of post-Vietnamese sophology for those who led the American army, a lot of time, but what we are here is not a view. MacArthur, as presented here, does not hate or inspire how he did in life. <br /> <br /> Director Joseph Sargent, who traveled to the famous turkish "Jaws The Revenge", makes color-numbers work with amazing battlegrounds and some obvious settings (as China attacks US troops in Korea), while Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins scripts are released by MacArthur, who is as benevolent as a little bit too much of his public image, but never less than decent. <br /> <br /> Here you can see him stepping back to the ship to return to Phillipine. There you see him in the speech of his "Old Soldiers Death". For a long time he has been sitting in the Toyko cinema, waiting for the North Koreans to cross the 38th parallel, so that we can capture the story, while the newspaper's footage describes Japan's rise from ashes according to its enlightened rule. Peck's co-actors, Marj Dusay, as his dedicated husband ("you are my best soldiers") and Nicolas Coaster as a loyal aide, tear your eyes to the companionship of your companion, but do not hold your interests. > <br /> Even if he claims to be with others, Peck never raises his voice and, for the most part, he wins his arguments with a loud talk. If Admiral Nimitz recommends postponing Philippine return, personal pride and MacArthur's tactical concern, MacArthur will come back with a comment: "Right now, when I listened to my plan, I thought I saw our flag down." No doubt, real Nimitz would have said something, but the film's character simply captures its head and foolishly accepts the presence of President Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> The only person in the movie who does not seriously agree with Harry S Truman, with whom Ed Flanders is doing a good job, despite having a nose that makes him remind him of Toucan Sam. Truman's MacArthur burning should be a dramatic high point, but here it is in a quiet dinner conversation where Peck plays MacArthur as something other than a brilliant martyr. <br /> <br /> Peck stands at the top pantheon of the screen stars; it offers a great presence, but it has no complexity even in many of its most famous roles. But it is unfair for him to dock so much here because he gets little help in defining MacArthur other than the speaker. Except for the two scenes in which he ranks against the surrender of the Philippines ("He struck the old glory and ran up the bed linen!") And the other where he has a mini-division, waiting for the US invasion of Inchon, against the Communists who are undermining the White House Peck really a peck, not a complicated character who inspired the famous sobriquet "American Emperor." True MacArthur could have been worthy of such a comparison. What you get here is less worthy of Shakespeare than Clown shakes.
