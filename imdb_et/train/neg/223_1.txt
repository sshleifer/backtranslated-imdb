Not a "female film", but a movie for the gang. One of the worst films ever made by the male leader. Director Andy McKay just doesn't know a woman. Bad taste, American Pie humor style, raw story, no sense, unreasonable story, reborn characters. Vulgar fantasies appeared on the screen. Smashing and definitely not funny. I don't know how the three good actors took part in it.
