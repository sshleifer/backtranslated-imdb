After reading many reviews, I don't know what kind of movie some people watched, but it wasn't exactly what I saw. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Functioning, mostly Moore, is just terrible. A woman cannot act. Nice tits, but she just can't act. At some point he didn't get real. Instead, there was a violation of a Hollywood actor who was going to believe in boys. <br /> <br /> And that's the movie that finally is - Hollywood. Training sequences are up. Politics - from above. Political correctness - up. Fighting scenes - you guessed it over the top. Your task is to enter and get out without discovering. What are you doing then? Why shoot as many circles and make as much noise as possible. Oh G.I. Jane, you can be my wing man at any time. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite is good, but as soon as Hollywood gets it, we'll reach the top with a gun. <br /> <br /> What more to expect from US commercial movies? Not much to think.
