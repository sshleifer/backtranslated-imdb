This movie is so bad you can't imagine. Action is terrible, even worse than third-class soap operas. It is a pity that this film was the most successful in Switzerland in the last 20 years. Communication between soldiers did not make any sense at all. The story could have taken the bravo photo story, the dialogues were wood as well as Treebeard, and the plot holes were larger than the black hole in our galaxy. But nowadays there is no need to satisfy the audience much. The actors were beautiful, for example, former Miss Switzerland and the main character was even hung (woah !!) and there was certainly a lot of drug abuse. It's a real cool man! Especially for teenagers aged 12 and 13. But the media created a wacky atmosphere where you didn't allow the film to be rejected because they manipulated the group dynamics by implicitly saying that you are a nerd if you don't go with the 'sheep' of others and say it is exactly what it was, when i was in the army / that's exactly what i'm doing when i have to go to the army ... for any exciting activity related to drugs and coolness. And don't think I like the army. I was there and I hated it, but this film is worse than cleaning a sticky toilet with a toothbrush (which I was forced to do because I insulted a lieutenant). Sometimes you just want entertainment for a few hours and forget about the problems, and I think it's not bad. But such films affect a lot of teenagers, showing them a cool lifestyle that is actually just a fool and turns them into an ignorant and egocentric idiot without brains. But now that my opinion is not very popular, I am now quiet and I suggest you avoid this terrible flick at all costs and to save your thoughts! <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> (Damage to my bad English)
