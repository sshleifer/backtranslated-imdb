I agree with the previous comment, the beginning of the movie is pretty good and you are talking about what's coming ....... What is something. All open story lines remain open; Two characters that seemed to be much more important at first were completely excluded from the picture except 1 or 2 very short scenes. I'm traveling if Ilya hadn't left it better to just leave them out. For one of the remaining characters, nothing has been done to him. He just visits some godly place and suddenly the film no longer talks about him, but some of the geriatric witches who spend their days to drink from the bread, eat homemade vodka and probably each other. Some may say that the film shows how society breaks down, like the IFFR judges, but for me it's just a bad taste, bad camera work, a sad script, and a terrible bad direction. That's why I can't be as a predecessor as graded: 1!
