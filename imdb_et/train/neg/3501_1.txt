I understand quite well, they just aren't good. The exhibition is terrible. I understand this and this is another terrible thing. The only cool indicator in EVER was one hobo in this episode, but then I see another episode that contains this episode and the show is terrible. It's not funny, not funny! I don't want people to say, "Only intelligent people can do it" because if they're so smart, why do they understand people they don't even know and say they aren't smart or intellectual enough to understand it? It's like saying "Heaven is red" but never looking outside. But anyway, this is the absolutely worst show I've ever seen in my life, jokes are terrible, I mean you can understand them, they're just horrible, his controversy is very flat, his jokes jokes and other jokes on body fluids are really fools and usually consist of very bad actions. I'm not sure what these "smart" people will see in this show, but judging others, if they don't know anything about us, is not an intelligent comment.
