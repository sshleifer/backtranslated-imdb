I just don't see how the Concorde-New Horizons movie by Jim Wynorsk and the talent of the actors of Steve and Steve could be bad. It just grabs your mind, isn't it? <br /> <br /> Let's make a mistake. "Munchie Strikes Back" is really a bad movie. Munchie is a doll that has been around for centuries. For reasons that have not been fully explained until the end of the film, he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and his son. The mother's problem (at least her main problem) is that she has a two-week mortgage payment for a mortgage of $ 20,000 for a non-such setup. Ouch. He can't get out of the money because he's just fired. OK ... JUST is the key word for this sentence. What ...? Does he plan to pay for one salary? Perhaps it would have been a good idea that I have spent a lot of savings in recent years ... I think? <br /> <br /> Munchie has magical powers similar to genes ... but there is no limit to the number of wishes! Munchie gets the boy a gift card overnight, but the boy asks that it be sent back to the shopping center Munchie had "borrowed". The pesky furball also uses your other world skills to help the boy win the baseball game by cheating. Baseball strikes so hard that it orbits the Earth several times. Unfortunately, these stupid parents who watch the game don't look strange at all. Hmm. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I would like to turn it up because it has already got enough of its vitality. The style in which Leslie-Anne Down, while playing with her mother, really moves her, pulls her to the dog who tears her. Your heart will melt her charm when she notices that her dollars are sliding under her foreskin, and she asks how this snow will get during the summer. "Munchie strikes back" credits allowed another movie to follow, I believe "Munchie hangs ten". To date, the viewing public of the film has been robbed of what would have been a force for cinema. Heh. 1/10
