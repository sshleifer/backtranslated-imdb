I died to see it when I saw a ridiculous poster of MEATBALLS and shared that it should be the best satire ever. What a great satire idea - the genre is great. Unfortunately, the finished product (as I think all the players are likely to understand) is a directory that uses the opportunities, non-real productions and (fortunately, some) very fun, inspired bits. The very striking Janeane Garafolo seems very bad here, probably because she is uncomfortable in difficulty to make her flat role funny. David Hyde Pierce is just sad to look, trying to be funny and Castro nerd. Molly Shannon is so funny that SEE that she is laughing, but somehow her segment is not hysterical with a snowball. Paul Rudd had a great merit and was sexy as hell; other boys are also very funny. I think the problem is that the director just doesn't move things at the right pace. He starts very dead and puts a monotone. But if he really makes things terrible (drug sequence is another more fun moment I've had all year round in movies, the first one is in the flat movie: Andrea Martin ALL THAT complains about IN & OUT) It's just funny. I wanted this movie to work so badly, but it just wasn't. The 1981 clothing and style is 99.9% PERFECT, and very little used songs are perfect. It ends up as a medium-poor MAD-TV episode that contains frustratingly superfluous sketches.
