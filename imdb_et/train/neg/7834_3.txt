I usually do not write comments, but I do not understand why it is rated so high and wanted to warn horror friends because I can only assume that all these high ratings were by average TV viewers. <br /> <br /> I only looked at the first two episodes, but these two were clichés, no longer funny. the same old stories you have probably seen / read a few times - live toys, bad things from other dimensions ... and it's not just that these stories are not innovative, but also the pretty bad versions of these clichés. i would prefer eg. "Chucky" and "quiet mountain" over these two episodes at any time. and don't even ask about visual effects ... those who are in the first episode are fine, but those who are in the second are terrible. looks like some film student projects went wrong. blood ... or gore ... erm ... something worth noting. <br /> <br /> It may be interesting for a ten-year-old child who probably hasn't seen / read this many horrible stories (though I'd rather recommend "incredible" - now I call it proper mystery television). but an adult horror blower is worthless. I gave only 3 points because in fact there is beautiful cinematography (especially in the second episode) and some nice actors.
