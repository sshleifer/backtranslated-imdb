Words can't describe how this story is totally stupid (and so bad for this movie)! Basinger, Del Toro ... what did you mean? So there is a shopping center and its parking space is full. Basing's character is going to buy a cup of tea and some packaging paper. <br /> <br /> When he comes out, the whole place is so empty that no one is listening to the two hits that were shot near you? Even if he lives there, when he drives away from the idols, does he go to the furthest and ungodly place instead of the nearest police station or at least overcrowded? COME ON !!! I'm not even going to the infamous red toolbox because other people have done it before. Not to mention how he kills moral pieces one by one. <br /> <br /> It's so stupid, with little logic, I can only warn you, it's a waste of time, honestly!
