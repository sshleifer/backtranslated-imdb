WHAT ARE NOT NON-RECOMMENDED SPOILERS Why do people, if they are inaccurate or ill or fear the club, cut through a crowded dance floor in the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Who in the right mind hides the bed when someone breaks into their room? <br /> <br /> How often do you knock on a stranger door and if they do not react immediately, you open the door, walk around, cry out and then start doing things? <br /> <br /> If someone was being tracked by someone you just discovered, was the murderer what would you do? Quietly hide and hide the wooden platform or metal tools? Of course, quietly, robbed of an old fence or other corrupted structure? <br /> <br /> I could talk about almost all the thrillers that have come out in recent years, but since it's the "Return" page, I'm probably talking about "Return". I saw it for free because I work in the cinema and made a point to screen all "scary" movies. I thought it was acceptable ... aside from well-worn clichés. Sarah Michelle Gellar is really sad and looks like "Huh?" through the film. The plot details are slowly released when the movie progresses, and it's almost enough to make it interesting unless there were enough explanations as it moved on and so I was almost gone until the last 2/3. <Br /> <br /> If you are a hard-working fan, you should see at least once. If there is nothing better in the theater and you want to watch the movie, I think it's worth the matinée ticket. If you thought the trailer looks like an interesting movie and you can't wait ... wait.
