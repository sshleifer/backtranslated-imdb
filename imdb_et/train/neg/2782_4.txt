Just saw the movie last weekend, I'm upset and frustrated. In principle, the film says that immigrants, especially from the former Soviet Union, come to this country, bring everyone they receive, from the old country, and penetrate and take over what the Americans have been working on. What a very wrong way to see immigration and a much worse way to tell people about it. This is the main thing. Another thing, general writing, leadership and filming, is at the village amateurs level. The actors did quite well, but it was not to save them. Some jokes were funny, but most of them were bad and cheesy. Can't wait to get out of the theater, I want my money back.
