this is the result. A piece of trash that doesn't even deserve to be categorized is just a bunch of things on a film roll that doesn't make sense. Back to the actors who seem to be running just a few friends who thought they would get a little money and try to make a movie that would be a great horror movie. Well, it is still a big horror because it's a movie. Hobgoblins has many terrible acts, but worse is the main man called Richard, who is just too much of a weakness, even the root of sorta. Well, if you drop a bunch of friends and try to scare the movie, less than the shoestring budget, it happens. At least MST3K version was fun. But it is still a terrible film that deserves all this momentum. 9 for the MST version.
