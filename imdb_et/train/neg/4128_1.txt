This movie is one of the most terrible things I've ever seen. Dialogue is not just terrible, it never ends. You think it's over, but it's not. How long is it, 140, 160 minutes? I don't even know. I know I never look at it again. It's like someone who took a romantic comedy, took a comedy, then decided to hit the romance, leaving us with a bunch of things that could go on the screen. But don't take my word for it, find out how terrible this movie is.
