I'm a big fan of old western countries and don't think Hollywood can capture his old glory. But even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger cannot help with the 1957 film, which carries almost all the good qualities of the reformed gunfighter western countries. fallen but virtuous woman, big city people who have to turn to rescue the armed forces, etc. I can hardly notice the surname of the writer and the young "actor" who plays Granger's son. Is there any nepotism there? I've seen the high school playing better. Chill Wills plays Chill Wills comics. Have I got another 1000 words?
