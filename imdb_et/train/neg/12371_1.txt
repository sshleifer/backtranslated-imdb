This film could have been great (to cause it to be somewhat interesting), but it never rises above the cartoon. The action is seriously flawed and there were moments where I was so harsh that I thought I could get down next to the theater. Never and I ever think of Look at this godawfull piece .... The Danish cinema has got a lot of good in recent years, but if that piece crosses the border, I'm afraid no one ever wants to rent. Danish film. This movie is why I decided to register here. I really felt that I needed to drive people away from this piece. My sympathies go to people who have already gone to the cinema to watch it
