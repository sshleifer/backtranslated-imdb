Cannon pulled out a true visual beauty of a medieval epic that seems to be exciting (except for a dragon project). Now, how did the long-standing studio known as Chuck Norris first get a complete lack of knowledge? Example: An amateur actor and a terrible plot is a sign that reviving the medieval legend does not improve any bad performance. They went on and made another cheap exploiter with hundreds of strange bimbos to make it even better. In the case of two "barbarian brothers", they will certainly know how to make miraculous noise when they get so strong and courageous warriors to save their homeland. This is the biggest potential waste I've seen in the "expensive" low budget movie, and worse still, the ax hits the cute print without grace. All this followed an advertising campaign that sold T-shirts under BARBARIANIDE! Movie alone makes a great souvenir!
