It is so sad that the Romanian audience is still inhabited by vulgar and uneducated people who enjoy cheap and demonstrative exhibitions such as superficial and cruel, such as "Garcea" or "Vacanta mare" child games ... The difference is that Mugur Mihäescu , Doru Octavian Dumitru and other such sub-artisans never think they will show their art as "art". Pintilie, who made a very good film 40 years ago ("Duminicä la ora sase"), followed by another, nice ("Reconstituirea"), attempts to declare the length of his film "works of art" - but unfortunately he directs too cinematic expressions on a too limited level. As such, "Niki Ardelean" again offers a sample "HOW NO" - this is its only value.
