For a film with so much promise, it was disappointing, thin lines, and a terrifying and incredible opportunity to act. The plot had more holes than Swiss cheese and it is the worst clich√© I have seen in the film for some time. The final scene would have ripped my heart out if the whole film wasn't so painful at first. I was dumb! From the first scene - one was wondering if the sister tried to get her twin to get help, or just scare her into a death that would have been better for the audience and saved us two hours after the worst. has seen so far. It was a horror in the real sense of the word.
