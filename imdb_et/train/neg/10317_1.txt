Until this new season I have been a big "little mosque" fan. The new season, however, was completely ATTENTION. <br /> <br /> The new Christian prince has destroyed the whole purpose of the exhibition. It has always had to live together to overcome prejudices. The new prisoners are destroying that they expect and show Christians a very bad light. <br /> <br /> I am not a Christian or a Muslim, but I loved to look at this example and see the marriage between Amar and the admirer. Not anymore. <br /> <br /> Just undo it and do it. It is no longer worth it. <br /> <br /> This may still be saved, but many changes must be made. <br /> <br /> Retrieve the old format.
