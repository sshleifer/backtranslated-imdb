This movie was terrible. I watched it three times, not even the whole thing. It's just impossible to look, the story sucks, it's frustrating and totally disgusting. I'm not writing a spoiler, so if you want to know why it's so nasty, look at it yourself. The only good thing about this movie was John Savage, his dialogue at the beginning and some funny parts in the movie. A little baby in this movie is annoying and the whole situation is funny. I saw this movie in American stores, so I thought it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, I was wrong !!!! Acting is all horrible and nudity itself is flat and disgusting. Another thing is that Starr Andreef, the other main character, has not been in such bad films in the past, he was really good. Same with John Savage. This movie sucks!
