This very low budget comedy capricious film will only succeed with a low budget. The dialogue is stupidly foolish, chasing is evenly boring and most of the screen money seems to have been stored in a series of collisions and explosions in the parking space of the movie in the last five minutes (a briefly blurred port-a-potty at the beginning of this scene is definitely sure that the film's main villain has been attacked and spitted. The whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those who occasionally came out of Rodger Corman's studio when he gave the director a few bucks and a camera for the first time - but without the discipline of introducing Corman.
