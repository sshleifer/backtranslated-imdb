I read another review that expressed the view that platinum was an endless seafarer that killed people, was killed, drugs and spam. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with this, because the film actually had more, but it is five, I see what this person is trying to say: it had no real plot - this is the point I agree with. <br /> <br /> This is an obvious stone at his best. He really wanted to show not only how war ends with death, but also how it is extremely traumatic for those who survive. Unfortunately, it seems that the film "glorifies" this aspect and the big final is as if too champagne, grandiose, Oscar hunting "create a lasting picture" for me. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with the filmmakers of Stone and other creators of it is that they do not understand the simple concept of depicting fearful bloody waste, which is not supported by war or does not allow it to be an unfair or immoral war. We have seen that the same thing is happening now with Iraq. If you are not missing this point, let me tell you: if you saw a truly bloody World War II and how destructive it was in the lives of surviving soldiers, would that be an unfair war? If this fact alone does not convince you that it was an unfair war, then why depict Vietnamese horrors would convince you that driving in this situation is wrong. Personally, I do not support the American decision to go to war in Vietnam, but I certainly disagree with "this war is wrong because people died and suffered" theory. I don't think motivation is always wrong by default, just because the war itself is terrible. <br /> <br /> It doesn't mean that the end or the last big "twisting" was a little stupid. But this is not the departure of Stones first oddball. Wall Street was a great movie until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a terrible "wrong turn". JFK is probably one of the few movies Stone actually did, very well. <br /> <br /> But this is not very important on this issue, as there were very few images up to the point of the movie to twist. And that's why I gave him such a low mark. It was practically less of a story and finally boring - if you didn't fall for the boy you produced.
