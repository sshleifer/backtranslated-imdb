I saw it for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson thought they were girlfriends. But Busey is in the opening scene, it won't show up to 40 minutes of the movie again. Although every scene is he fantastic. Especially when he hides himself as a dark horse. <br /> <br /> What is incredible about this movie is the plot. In the film, Fred Williamson tries to find out who is stalking and killing the phone brokers. At one point, I think it's Busey. But it turns out that I'm only partially correct. Busey is not a killer, but he calls and harasses women by phone. Why? I do not know. In no way is he related to the killer, he just does it for a blow.
