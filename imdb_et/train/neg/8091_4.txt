(This is an overview of later Disney's published English, with Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart, and co.) <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie to be good. Really really. I am a big fan of the princess Mononoke and I was excited, and after I saw all the glowing reviews of this earlier Miyazaki movie, I was eager to see it. But I was shocked to be shocked by the quality of this movie. These later films have well-designed plots, three-dimensional characters and the best movie music ever since ... well ... ever. This movie is not just close. <br /> <br /> Maybe also positive aspects. Like all Miyazaki films, it is still a very imaginative, bizarre fantasy / sci-fi setting in a post-apocalyptic world where insects are dominant species. Nausica can also give other films much better animations from time to time. (though not as beautiful and fluid as the Miyazaki later films) And the English voice works quite well. <br /> <br /> But this movie ... just ... is not ... good ... The characters are all from the cardboard - from the sweet little Nausica of saccharin to the mercilessly evil Thumbnail, to all who are in between. If you have seen each of them for 30 seconds, you have all seen. And the fact that there are only bubbles on the plot doesn't help. <br /> <br /> Then there is music ... Now, Hisaich's hands are on my favorite film composer, but Nausica doesn't make him fair. Half of the music is 80's keyboards in overdrive, and it usually enters and leaves so sharply that the visuals are rather annoying rather than helping. I very much suspect that Hisaich was told that he would make a lot of music before he even saw the picture. <br /> <br /> But wait! This movie has a great message, right? Let's all be environmentally friendly! Too bad that this movie hits you with a head like a butterfly. There's a scene where Nausica hugs the tree. Not really. I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> It makes me a little sad to talk about how this movie is flat. But for some reason, all other IMDb reviews seem to worship it. And if the characters have to speak for a longer sentence to say what's going on, it's flat. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who worships anime, enjoys 80s of music and a tree of plants every Arbor day, you probably like this movie. Otherwise, save your money on your later movies because they are for a long time.
