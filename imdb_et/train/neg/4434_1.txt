I rented this movie, thinking it looked like a wonderfully pleasing historical piece. What I got was pure rubbish. This movie was confusing in most places, almost everywhere terrible and terrible in all places. Mira Sorvino, a queen who played a young male scientist, was at best frustrating. Ben Kingsley should have removed his knighthood to even consider this film as one of his projects. Fiona Shaw should definitely try to play Petunia Dursley; at least Harry Potter's movies are more entertaining than the thing they play in the movie. <br /> <br /> Cinematography looks like some college kids took 101 classes in cinematography and failed. Almost every movie scene is cut for some effect; The end result is of course what I've ever seen. Jay Rodan was almost as good as Agis; too bad it was such a bad script to work. Rachael Stirling is doing her best when an almost gullible woman is waiting. Finally, I really want Blockbuster Video to pay back. I'm so glad I didn't spend $ 10 watching this fiasco in the theater. If they have performed this Marivaux performance since the 18th century, then I think about how many people have been the best at this age. Had I been there, they would not have heard of snoring. Thank you for the good comfort of modern DVD players; you can forget or terrible scenes. Guess, that means I just looked at the beginning and the end!
