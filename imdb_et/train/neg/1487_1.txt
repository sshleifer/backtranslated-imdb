Thanks to this movie, I can now answer the question: "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" <br /> <br /> I can't even think a bit close and I saw some really bad movies. <br /> <br /> There's nothing going on in this movie. Identify one element of any horror film and this movie will not succeed. Honestly, I've seen better on YouTube. Here are some typical dialogues: <br /> <br /> "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve, is that you?" "Steve, I'm not joking" "Steve, it's not funny!" "Steve, are you there?" "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve?" <br /> <br /> "ARggh !!!! Ahhhhhh !!!! Nooooooo!"
