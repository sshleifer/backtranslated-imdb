JUST CAUSE introduces Sean Connery to Harvard Law by Prof, Kate Capshaw (does he still work?) As his wife (a slight age difference) and Lawrence Fishburne as a racist lunch (!) And Ed Harris is a top-down killer of fundamentalist southern sera. <br /> <br /> Strange pouring, but the movie plays a serious mind with the audience **. (Don't read if you intend to watch this movie seriously or ever watch this movie seriously because of spoilers) First of all, I felt confronted with my liberal stereotypes: police officers are all sadistic and framed by a black man who has no evidence. The coroner, the witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused work with him (he is accused of rape and murder of young girls) because he is black. <br /> <br /> Connery is a Harvard law professor who gives stigma to black people against injustice and the barbaric death penalty. The convicted person turns to his grandmother to protect him and reopen the trial. <br /> <br /> Connery has fossilized (grabbed ...) by small town officials and a good club of IL-boys, but finds that Blair, an alleged killer, now a death, was all made. The main evidence was his confession, which was beaten by him. <br /> <br /> The black policeman (!) guided beating, who even played Russian roulette to get his confession. Connery discovers that another person in death was actually murdering and after a few pairs of things that were seriously touching, Hannibal Lecter, like Ed Harris, finds where Harris hid the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> He will get the trial again and Blair will be released. <br /> <br /> I think ... movie over .... <br /> <br /> Then suddenly! It turns out that Blair is a psychotic psycho and that he used "white guilt" to include Connery. He agreed with Ed Harris a story in return for Blair, who made some murders for Harris. <br /> <br /> Now Blair is open again, thanks to Connery's frustrated computer-based principles! Last 30 min. is a weird action movie hit on legal drama, Connery and Fishburne in the fight against serum killer in an alligator skinning house that is evergreen (yes, you read this right). <br /> <br /> It was a strange movie So the whole system is corrupt and ineffective, police officers are just bully and Abu Graib type tormentors, but criminals are really psychotic and deserve to fry. <br /> <br /> Really pushing every level! The system is completely rotten and the white types of PCs that challenge it are also seriously disappointed. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down. Connery probably had to make a mortgage loan or something.
