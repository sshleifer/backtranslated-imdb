If during the first 10 minutes of this movie you do not realize that the main actor who writes a life-consulting column is going to turn tables and oh-so-cleverly and learn valuable lessons then you probably have something wrong. Setting up is so predictable that the movie will be destroyed, even if the rest of the movie was good (what it isn't) <br /> <br /> There's hardly anyone between drivers and Steve Carelli's stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing, not funny. It is hard to believe that a Binoche character would be interested in her. Ultimately, it's all so wonderful and everyone is happily living. Isn't that great America!
