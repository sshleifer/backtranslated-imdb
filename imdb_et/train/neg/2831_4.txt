I saw it recently with my husband and discovered it was better than Caine, though not a cop. Britain's greatest actor ever seems to be too interesting about this role, which is a pity, because he could have been more convinced of this in his game. Rex Harrison seems even less disturbed, perhaps surprising, because his character is very poorly written. William Holden is better, but his screen time is short and again his character is not well written. <br /> <br /> Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have seen, but she has been given little work to do, the film could be more focused on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but basically plays a comic that doesn't stick to the serious tone of the film. Music is bad and Omar Sharif is making one of his many pointless movers (his career is the basis for decades). <br /> <br /> Richard Fleischer must be blamed for not managing it more effectively. a shamefully unpredictable film director and one of his weakest films.
