I just saw this movie and haven't read the book. The good thing about the film is that in some places you are thinking for a while for a spiritual subject, evolution, sincronicity, and your part in the world. <br /> <br /> However, movie diving is easily broken by the viewer and there is very little information between the characters. It is very clear that the book loses a lot in this version of the movie. Events that assumed synchronization are almost recognizable. In order for the viewer to see that the scene shows coincidence, many reasons must be given and even more imaginable that it is related to a greater purpose. Enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not create a better sense of what he had to anticipate. Do you remember the illumination of Keanu Reeves (White Buddha)? Well, that's not something. <br /> <br /> Most scenes are badly played. There are many scenes that really do not develop the story, nor do they help create the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Better actors in this movie, Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow, can't save it. The first 2 seem to have received more scenes than their characters should try to record a movie and because they were paid more, but it doesn't work. Most scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all. <br /> <br /> Jürgen does good in his scenes and sells as a bad guy (as always), but the script doesn't help him all. The scene where he first tries to join John (Matthew Settle) is just a bad script. Filling a scene when he died in an explosion is absurdly bad. You can't even comment on the entire movie. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is a long belt, read the book! I haven't read it, but it's probably a billion times better than it has to be. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I have to write my first comment in IMDb.
