This movie is not worth the film. The dialogue is flat, full of clich√©, and delivered by amateur actors who sound like reading scripts for the first time. Dirty, trembling, movie style is cheap in the style of visual visual effects. Characters don't even work like a normal person. For example, a character who is looking for her twin sister at home, drives through the door, falls around the house, scares and sniffs, and she doesn't even ask her sister's name to see if she's home. What? You think he was just buried in his sister instead of looking for him. Too many setbacks in your childhood. Too many unnecessary setbacks are the typical character of the amateur manager. It's really funny, looking at the many women who drive their car down the street, from the carriageway, from that angle, here, there, side-by-side, now in front view. Enough already. You think you are watching Solaris for TV advertising! Terrible movie. 0 out of 100. I'm really sorry for anyone who spent the money on making this movie or watching it.
