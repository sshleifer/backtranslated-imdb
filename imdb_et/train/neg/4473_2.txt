Dane struggles hard and is extreme for all her screaming and madness, pouring herself into the water and rolling on the floor. Too much. Calm down, get yourself together and make us laugh. I didn't understand his comparison between comics and rock stars. Just because there is on stage or something? He said every comedian wants to be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield was really in this life. He had a few good jokes like Burger King's joke where people travel. I also liked the Reese pieces joke. If Dane just doesn't act so mentally, he might be funny and I could have given that higher rating, even eight.
