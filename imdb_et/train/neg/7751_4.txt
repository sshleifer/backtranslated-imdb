First, the movie CGI was terrible. I watched it during a bad movie marathon on the SciF channel. At the end, when the park owner is killed, this is probably one of the worst examples of CGI I even saw. Even Living Dead's night had a better animation. <br /> <br /> However, the film had almost no plot. Why were they especially on this island? Well, it wasn't mentioned in the movie. And why should people keep coming to the cat? There's no point. <br /> <br /> One thing that emerged in this movie was moderately good. What could be called a "B made for a TV movie" was a very good actor. Particularly distinguished by Parry Shen. <br /> <br /> If there's nothing to do on Saturday, check out this movie. This can be good for some memorable quotes.
