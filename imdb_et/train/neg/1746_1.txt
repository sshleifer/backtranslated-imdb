Probably the worst Bollywood movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> There is no plot line. Very small character development. <br /> <br /> Perfect foolish and pointless humor. The whole film was chaotic and less direct. The story was not finished properly. The airport was filmed in the mall. <br /> <br /> Same story over and over again until you want to say "please go ahead!" Even song and dance were meaningless and poorly choreographic. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is that everywhere there were hot bodys ... but most Bollywood movies are on such days. <br /> <br /> I am not from an Indian background <br /> <br /> 2/10
