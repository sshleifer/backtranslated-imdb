I looked at it today, partially attracted the adult star and partly because I have enjoyed so many other movies in this movie. However, this is one that must be avoided. There are dozens of badly cut scenes where continuity just doesn't flow, like billiards at first. Fighting scenes of natives is about as good as you remember those old black and white Tarzan movies, you know where you see the spear flies through the air and the camera cuts the dead native, which is immobile on the floor when it sticks to its thigh. Is this an instantaneous death? There are also quite a few unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with the plot, as a little girl is saved at the time of flower collection. Really badly animated clay toys are too painful to look at. When you see this movie, there are highlighted crabs that are about 5 km away. Somehow I can capture David Mccullum and give him a tip. It would be as if there was no time to leave the road, such as when the city obelisk falls, and at home, there are two steps left to the left of the world, but he is not screaming and it falls on him. I'll give it just because of 2 Ekland. And why does Mccullum's voice develop a smell as the movie progresses?
