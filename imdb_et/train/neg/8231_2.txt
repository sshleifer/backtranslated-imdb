USE A SPOILER ... HOW TO ATTENTION! <br /> <br /> Five eyes can be summed up in one word .... Amateurish. This movie tries to best differ from most of the films "Blair Witch" filming .... it doesn't work .... it just gets to look and feel like someone was a cheap camcorder, van decided to make a movie. The story is not explained, the main character is not given a real motivation (and looks like a lesbian who is wearing a powerful suit compared to five girls) and there is no talk of violence ... just screaming and splitting sounds. The whole movie takes place inside the van, which means that a decent landscape is out of the question. Five girls do their best, but they face quite terrible actresses ... although it is difficult to decide with the material whether they are in reality ... they spend the whole movie screaming, sliding and stepping up .... so much that it is difficult to say half what was said and the cameras are so bad that it is really hard to say who said it. This video paints itself as a film of violent torture, but there are actually only five girls who are terrifying terror ... that literally takes the whole movie ..... then we end up after what seems to be 5 hours of constant shouting and all the way girl is still alive ... one minus finger. The only thumbs up (get this ... finger .... LOL) are for the poor actors who struggled hard and probably lost their voices (and their pride) after that terrible movie. Don't rate it with a poster .... you are very much let.
