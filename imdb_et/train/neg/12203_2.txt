I think it's time for John Rambo to move on with his life and try to put Vietnam behind him. This series is getting older and Rambo is no longer a solider, but a cold-blooded killer. Whenever he appears on the screen, someone dies. Vietnam was not a fun place to be and, frankly, I'm tired of Hollywood that it seems to be. This is not the worst thing about Vietnamese films, this honor goes to John Waynes Green Berets. In any case, John Rambo, who carries about a 50-meter machine gun, which appears to be half the Vietnamese military and a good Russian, offend. What's worse is the Rambos cheese at the end of the speech ... Please! Oh yeah I heard they do one more ...
