It was just a terrible movie. I had to hurt it. Almost every action was unmotivated in the context of the film, the actor was very bad (P.Diddy was the best actor who really says something about the film) and the plot was generally predictable. Some links to Carlito were okay, for example, his dream of one day to Carribien, but they were generally weak. In my opinion, love was wrong, but it is arguable. Anyway, I didn't expect much before watching the movie, and I think I could say that even those expectations were not met. I feel bad for Jay Hernandez because he is actually a decent actor (Friday night). She's happy because I'm sure this movie won't look too much. I usually give the films a decent rating when they blame my interest at all, so I'm going to go and give it two stars. The next time you are lucky. And yes, I enjoyed Carlito's tea.
