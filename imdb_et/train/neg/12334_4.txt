The premise is ridiculous, the characters are incredible, the dialogue is tritical and endless absurd. Believe me, I am a fan of Kevin Kline, but looking at him as Pepe Le Pew's accent for 2 hours as an expected Frenchman is not nearly as fun as it sounds. <br /> <br /> For its part, Meg Ryan is overwhelming and divine as (take your choice): kewpie doll, baby, puppy, kitten, whatever you think is the cutest creature on earth. Nor does he bear the slightest resemblance to a real human being. <br /> <br /> This movie hits me as an opportunity that soldiers Lawrence Kasdan and Kline arrested in Paris and southern France, while being well paid for it. So I can't really blame them.
