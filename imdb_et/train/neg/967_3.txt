In 1988, Paperhouse was welcomed as a "man of horror". Wow, you can say you're signing me. It's a mess. It includes a one-time young actress ranging from 1 to 2. G. Headley with a bad British (duplicated) accent and a story that is not chills, excitement or leaks. <br /> <br /> This is not even an interesting psycho-babble. One laughs only for his cheap effects and long to show Leprechaun. <br /> <br /> The story includes a girl with a fever who escapes in her dreams. Where you are not a good horror, an art house or even a decent post-school special. I found myself after two hours, saying ... where I went for two hours. <br /> <br /> The direction is endless and I wanted it to be even pretentious ... something interesting ... it looks like manufacturers Even in the dream world, things are boring. <br /> <br /> Short.
