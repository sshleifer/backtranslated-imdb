Due to budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (again, Priscilla Alden) is released by a mental institution (although he killed six people) and delivered to Hope Bartholomew. As soon as he is, he immediately recedes to his criminal annoyance and kills everyone who gets between him and his food. <br /> <br /> Holy MOLY! Does this movie suck! You know you are in trouble when open credit is started and they are just the first movie credit, probably filmed on a TV screen. Nick Millard (pseudonym Nick Phillips) decided to go back over the Crazy Fat Ethel world for over ten years and with the budget that probably covered the rental of an empty tape and camcorder over the weekend. Let's just say that Millard's unique style does not reflect the video well. Seriously, I have made a home video with a higher production value. And Millard is trying to pull SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT 2, by completing half of his working time with the first film (which looks like it was removed from a worn copy of VHS). Alden is good again as Ethel, but the film is so wrong that you will get to know him in this garbage. I mean at least the first movie. There is no music, no weaker effects (if at all possible), shaky camera work, terrible sound and editing that looks like it was made with two VCRs. Avoid it at all costs!
