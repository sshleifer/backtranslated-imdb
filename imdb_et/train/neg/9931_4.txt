The "black angel" is small in size, whereas June Vincent is a woman who tries to test her husband's electric chair after being guilty of old. Dan Duryea (wife of the murdered wife) decides to help Vincent find a real culprit. Peter Lorre has a dubious undoubted role. This movie noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer, never getting anything special. It is quite pleasant, but then at some point the mindset and the solution to the mystery will provoke one of these great "give me a break". This end alone can completely sink the film, but what precedes the conclusion is not very good either. Vincent is a heroic heroine and Duryea was never very good at playing good boys. I love the movie noirs, but it was a real disappointment.
