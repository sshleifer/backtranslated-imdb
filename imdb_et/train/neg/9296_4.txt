Normally I am a pretty generous critic, but for this movie I have to say that it was very bad. I'm amazed at how positive most of the comments are. <br /> <br /> There were some great shots, but it's too bad that they wasted the movie on that corner. It could have worked when "Daggers" was a purely action, not a romance, but unfortunately this film was built around an empty triangle of love. There are no chemistry between either pair, regardless of what Mei and his men exist, more love than love, and usually the dialogue is just silly. It can only be a translation problem, but the frequent use of the word "flirt" reminded me of the eighth grade, not the twist, with eternity, worthy of death for love; I also felt that we could overcome the wind with a metaphor. Listeners are given very few signs that really care, and therefore very little emotional investment in the film as a whole. I wanted to move the remote control quickly, I was ready to hit my seat, but most of the time I just dropped a lot. <br /> <br /> ******* Spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> Now, cake. Or rather insulting the injuries. The end was really one of the most terrible, ludicrous I've ever seen. The boys fight and scream and shout and hack each other. Oh, and then the snow starts. Randomly. Oh, and then Mei (a dagger placed in the heart) jumps out of the weed suddenly. Then he throws a plug that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach the destination, even slowing down comfortably the midscreen to hit a small drop of blood. Well, cool down. <br /> <br /> Well, Mei finally dies, I guess because she threw her breasted and deadly bloodless. Jin sings, stabs, holds her body, the screen goes blank. I and the people around me laugh. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning, but finally a failure.
