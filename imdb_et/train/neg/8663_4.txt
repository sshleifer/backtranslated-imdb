Just when you thought that returning to the water was safe ... <br /> <br /> Another computer-generated mutant plague on the human luncheon that is released by one of those who lead the mad science. Gereco Biotech fools with growth hormone studies by accidentally releasing a child's chocodile that develops at an accelerating rate. <br /> <br /> The B-movie cast adds to the fun of this mill's monster movie. ‚ÄùCostas Mandylor recalls Mick Dundee, Aussie accent, hat, grandfather knife, works like Joan Pacula, Gereco's head. Charles Napier is a local sheriff whose city is in danger, and Jane Longenecker is her hot daughter working in the animal shelter, soap opera star Matthew Borlenghi is a lover of Longenecker, a local artist who welds sculptures (.. his brother is a victim of crocuses). it was powerful when our heroes created a trap created for a crook, hoping that it would poison with carbon monoxide, through a reserve that searches for food, special effects of low-quality varieties, as far as Roger Corman's productions related to renegade dino monsters are concerned, I'm with Carnosaur. The monster here is basically a crocodile that stands on its hind legs, often upright because it carries potential victims. d Crocodile Dundee with your croc hunter and this imitation can amuse you if the monster fails. Borlengh and Longenecker actually have quite good chemistry on the screen. As expected, Pacula gets her funny fashion (.. gulp).
