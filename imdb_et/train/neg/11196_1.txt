My friends and I went out after 15 minutes and we were not the first. Later we tried to get our money back. Movie theater management would not allow it, but they agreed that we would see another movie. The only time that worked for us was seeing Dickie Roberts: a former star. As you say, it was not a memorable night. Probably one of my worst movie nights. Close must be when I saw a double headed "Domestic Disorders" and "Heist". In summary, for the sake of humanity, please do not look at the order.
