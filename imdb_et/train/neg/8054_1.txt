Oh dear, what a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Production was so cheap and disgusting ... Remember the strokes of "natural" where lightning hits the tree (leaving a glowing stump) that Roy Hobbs makes the cord? Well, the producers of this film used the same scene as a prefix to the scene, where the wooden box grabbed the house. <br /> <br /> Didn't I know if they were using The Natural material or hoping someone would watch it? <br /> <br /> At the end where they tried to get into the truck. Such an excessive activity in the cabin. <br /> <br /> Really bad movie, really bad movie.
