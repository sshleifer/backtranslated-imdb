"Whipped" is 82 minutes long. This review is 82 words long. The three unlikely New York Lotharios, the ruthless "scammers", will end with the same woman as Amanda Peet, with disastrous results. This is true for story and movie. Too sophomoric, to be miscommunicative, funny and ridiculous, the shocked Jock Tom Lykis's philosophy mixes with Penthouse's fantasy. Although technically overwhelming, it is dated, grated, poorly written, medium and obvious. People don't act like that. People don't talk about it. Really.
