It's common to see why Scary Movie makers found these "teen slasher" films so light. They are so incredibly formal. And when Valentine was released a year or so ago, I am sure they would be deceiving the film - that is, when they found genuine original material to distinguish it from Screams, I know what you did in the last summers. and Urban Legends. <br /> <br /> Valentine does not offer anything new to this genre except for the better end, which naturally leaves plenty of room for the inevitable stage. As always, a hidden psychotic killer heap a beautiful young woman who kills the main game friends one by one, usually over the top style. Many R & D on the screen, no character development, bad behavior, and too complicated bloodshed. <br /> <br /> What I can't talk about such films is that they go out who did it? "The thing is that they are not because the motif appears only after the killer has revealed it, and tells the main character who has been killed by all friends. Usually something that was never clear at the time of the movie (eg Mother of the main character) Uncle's fishing partner kicking his friend's father's dog.) Anyone who is still alive under the movie is a "suspect", but they are more "red Baltic herring" than suspects. appearing unmasked psycho-killer. <br /> <br /> Valentine followed this formula almost to the letter. *************** SPOILER !!!!!! (mini spoiler anyway) ** ************* The Valentine's motive did not appear, but more was left to you considering that the film did not reach the typical "teen slash. The question is only partially solved and the lead killer may or may not be not satisfied when bloodshed and almost all were killed i if the demons were really gone? <br /> <br /> It did not do Valentine still a good movie, but just save it as bad as usual, which still do not read much. For anyone who thinks about making another movie by their lines, please don't. Originality is so important that the originality of this genre is difficult.
