Parasomnia has interesting spaces, but the story is badly done without tension or even logical approach. The cast is convincing, even Patrick Kilpatrick, who played a big role in films like Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser. The rest is unknown (and not very good) except for Jeffrey Combs. (Herbert West's trilogy on the great Re-Animator). But he can play such a role in his dream (which is a bit of what he does here). The main problem is that the activities of the characters do not make any sense at all. The story is quite boring and predictable with cheap computer effects mixed with some gory scenes, especially at the end. It is really below average.
