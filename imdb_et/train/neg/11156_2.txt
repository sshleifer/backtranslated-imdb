Dark Wolf Let's get it right: This is a controversial piece of rotten tea with a cow *. It's just a terrible movie. This is a film of urban art where one of the worst is to imagine and a story that is weak than any ganglynag of an 80-year-old high school drama. Worse still, poor Kane Hodder cheated to play a giant werewolf. Kane f * cking Hodder. Someone is trying to make sure that Jason Voorhees's play is the height of his film career ... <br /> <br /> In any case, the former Playmate Jaime Bergman is also a movie and eventually gets a werewolf. It's a kind of crazy policeman with the worst werewolves in this world. But there are moments where there is almost rampant nudity. But that's all. Want to know more? Okay, the werewolf is generally a silly-looking black screen that is around the screen. And if we are privileged enough to see the transformation sequence, then we will be given something that resembles a full-motion video of the Playstation's early video game. First Playstation. CG animation is really so primitive. Only for horrible hardcore fanatics who want to see the small nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomiting. 2/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
