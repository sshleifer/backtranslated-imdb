Supernatural, revenge policeman is behind the third installment, this time acting as a guardian of the wrongly accused female police. A standard image of a stem and slash, but well worked and guided, making it strangely interesting and observable, although the violence is not weak (especially the director cut, originally given the "NC-17" rating). <Br /> <br /> * 1/2 out ****
