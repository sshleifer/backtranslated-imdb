The plot and characters are ridiculous and do not qualify as "plot" and "character" of AS. The biggest problem is that everything is dark, out of focus and blurry. The fact that Fulci filled the fog of the film does not help. On the other hand, this thing is completely odd and full of sexual and violent. The contradictions are quite fun, one of the main characters says he has no friends, but he locks a new guy in a few minutes of screen time and has a full pawn next to women. Although he shows his antisocial tendencies, randomly placing an arrow on the poor b ***** who just keeps his business! Blood or gore flowing images pay more attention than characters, but what you want from Fulc. Maybe it destroyed your career, but it wasn't really much stupid than the Zombie. It is worth renting if you like Italian staples or have a desperate sword and witchcraft or something strange. How do you sleep through someone who is absorbed by two feet from your head and screams for help?
