The story is very reliable and powerful. The technical aspect of the film is pretty good. The main problem is castings that made this film almost a second local and regular clich√© with no major impact and even greater lack of impression. In addition to Father Rafael's small role (impressed by Asi Dayan), not all other actors were unfortunately the best. The role of parent blind girls, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh but without a leading role. therefore his behavior was mild and low. There were moments and episodes that seemed to be a test rather than a real film. But after all, it is a good starting point and will make great progress in the future.
