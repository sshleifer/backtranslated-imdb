Flat, plain thriller about a woman who deceives all those she loves to increase her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays tricky Tracey, married to Andy Andy (Bill Pullman). As an old school friend, Andy named Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) appears as a resident surgeon, there is not much trouble behind him. an effective, tantalizing thriller and a serious lack of motivation, background and development of character leave the entire exhibition in effect. No cast is interested in its low characters, especially Bill Pullman, whose inexplicably curious Andy is impossible to believe. and can't do it from any entertainment. By the time the "secret" of the plot has appeared, you just don't care. <br /> <br /> At least in cinematography, Massachusetts is good. George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher, and Josef Sommer also celebrate. <br /> <br /> Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
