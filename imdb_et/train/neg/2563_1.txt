That movie was the second day on t.v and I didn't enjoy it at all. The first jungle George was a good comedy, but the sequel .... totally terrible. The new actor and actor playing a leading role was not at all good, they had to have the original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and the original actor (forgot my name) so that this movie gets from ten out of ten, not a movie that can sit and watch and enjoy, this is the movie that you go to the second channel or return to the store when hired or bought. It was good to see Ape's monkey back, but it wasn't as fun as the first, they should have a new George when Georges's son grew up, and he still had Bredon and (what his face) in a movie that would be "I was a little better, when it was.
