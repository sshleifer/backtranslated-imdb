During the first season, I thought the Teacher was a very interesting and exciting show. The combination of the reality TV and the 16-week job interview was innovative, and the producers of the show were able to hold the example appropriately and not too much. <br /> <br /> The new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and has nothing to do with business at all. In earlier seasons, they paid more attention to business-related tasks - mostly focusing on a meeting room, where it is assumed that competitors will do everything to keep them at exhibitions (that is, lying, talking to the trash, back, etc.). The Chamber may be an entertaining look, but it is an entertainment in a shallow place - sometimes you do not know if you are watching an old episode of Jerry Springer. The exhibition has tasks that are most boring and mostly present to companies that are stupid enough to pay for NBC advertising. And what about half of the competitors in the season's 6 tents? It's just stupid and has nothing to do with real-life business. <br /> <br /> I have no respect for this season's contestants, everything seems to me to be idiots. In earlier seasons, at least some of the contestants were a little more complete, now it seems that the competitors would kill their mother to keep them at the shows. It also seems that the tremendous ego of Donald Trump gets bigger and bigger every season that goes by and honestly, I don't understand why someone with common sense would want to work for him. His rationality in the board usually doesn't make sense at all, and sometimes it seems he just wants people in the trash for what's worth. <br /> <br /> R.I.P Apprentice. Please NBC, for God's sake, get the air out as soon as possible. It's just embarrassing to look. The trainee was once a great TV show, but now it's just a big fat joke.
