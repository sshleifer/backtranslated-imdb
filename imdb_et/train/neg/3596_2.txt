To be as honest as possible, the fucking game (or blood or vampire ecstasy fruit or black sister passion or ????) is a complete hole. Behind the film is a good premise? the resurrection of a long dead vampire through the offspring's body, supporting and assisting the black women group? but the execution is terrible. There are big and long moments on the screen when it doesn't literally happen. The characters just stand around doing something. There is no secret, no intercourse and no point on the plot. Operation is simply exhausting. Most of the actors also include women with a medium view, dancing naked, looking at the camera. They do it repeatedly. And what small plot seems to be designed to get more of these less than attractive women naked so they can join the dance. Although it is not as bad or pointless as dancing or dying in the Orgy of the Dead, it's close.
