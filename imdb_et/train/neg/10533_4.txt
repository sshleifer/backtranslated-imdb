This version slightly changed my taste and I think I have problems with this game. But first of all, this movie, a typical TV show version of the game, means it doesn't have the elegance of the original movie version with William Holden. What could they not afford to hire more than twelve people? Why move the movie until 1966? So you could give a little sister a series of Vietnam war protests? Why not in 1963 and give him a series of civil rights movements? <br /> <br /> With regard to casting, some will have some drawbacks. Jay O. Sanders made the right comments on his character, especially with his scenes with Josh Brolin. Brolin, on the other hand, leaves many notes. He is believable as a former BMOC jock, but he does not have William Holden's raw sensuality. I always thought Brolin would look a bit like a gorilla, so that all the women in the city would go around him (grace). Gretchen Moll was cute, but he was looking for a ditch. He did not plan the innocence or ignorance that this character needs. Perhaps this is because he and Brolin were about 5 years older than the characters. But then Holden was ten years old again. Bonnie Bedelia was quite forgotten because her mother and Mary Steenburgen were unable to recognize whether she was playing Blanche duBois or Katharine "The Shrew of The Shrew". <br /> <br /> Mr. Inge's I've always felt that young women who choose passion for practicality always needed an epilogue. "The Twilight Zone" I believe I offer a likely epilogue with the episode "Moment" where young Diana Hyland was murdered by Elder Diana Hyland because the younger Diana Hyland decided to go with a similar man.
