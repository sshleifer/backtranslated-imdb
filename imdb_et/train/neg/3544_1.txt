Vulpine Massacre should have been the actual title of the films. And the tagline should have read "Guaranteed to Make Your Kids CRY!" It is a nature drama that speaks of a distant forest from the fox family. Starting from the meeting and mating of two young foxes and the birth of a large family and attempts to grow them. The only thing you talk about is the narrative by the tree that stands above that which gives an insight into the love and life of animals ... Lovely scenery and great filming of animals. Sounds good? Well from there, things go straight to hell and then start drilling towards the core ... <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers below - or they may be a warning! *** <br /> <br /> Almost first we learn that one of the foxes is blinded. But it seems to be good enough and she is accompanied by a beautifully cheerful musical score ... And then she dies ... Next we have one of the sibling adventures. And then he dies ... One sister gets the time of her screen ... and then she dies ... And so it goes like a horrible movie as one fox, when the other is killed from nature, trapped, just up and disappears, and even with a number of snowmobiles! At the end of the movie, almost all foxes have been killed. Though graciously does not appear on the death screen. (At least not in the version we saw.) Unlike saying "Tarka Otter", the deaths of this movie are almost all meaningless and limit the sadistic way of building up hopes and then pushing them out. One or two losses would have been acceptable. After all, it's a natural film. But not nearly the whole family. Look at this with some perceptions that things are not * not at all good and that you or your children may stay very bad, depending on how sensitive you are or they are. You can enjoy it. Or may not ...
