I went up with my hopes, in 20 minutes, a movie that I couldn't get. Even though I thought it would be another terrible bad remake, I kept my hopes high, maybe ... just maybe someone will get it on time. Unfortunately, Prom Night is about the same level as the recent April Solstice remake, bad script, bad direction, cheesy overdone behavior and generally bad horror. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, it's boring, repetitive, and deserves about a dozen eye rolls. We've seen it before, and we've seen it a million times better. If you see Prom Night in the theater (I'd say I'm looking for a DVD or PPV), get ready to laugh at the audience because they're laughing. The laughs are not at the points of the movie that should be funny, they are the answer to a key "exciting" time on a film that is so badly made to feel like watching a new scary movie. Seriously, was it supposed to be remake or fraud? The filmmakers left the mark so bad that a large part of the audience I went through was halfway through the film. What again, I wish I had done. Not so, I have to torture myself and hold on, hoping it will improve. Needless to say, it wasn't. "Horror" scenes are fun, not so much because of the operation, but also because of the direction, the script, the "special effects" and the operation of the camera. The film can be seen as if they had spent their fortune, but still came with a micro-budget movie. I was half waiting for some of the props to see the dollar store tags and thought I'd like to see porn stars somewhere. <br /> <br /> This movie is frightening, if it is the future of big budget fear, then the genre of fears is doomed.
