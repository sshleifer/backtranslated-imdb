this movie was terrible. I thought all the decent actors would be better. don't waste your time. The Eva longoria park was terrible. she would be stuck in a desperate housewife. Paul Rudd is becoming a B-actor. The confusion he made in the film could never be your wife, what I say. and the lake clock he was cute but definitely needs some more active lessons. look like Reese Witherspoon in the sky ... it was better. or any other ghost movie. you are grateful that you have not wasted your valuable time. PS, which I love you, is also good outside the grave romance! time to start watching movies from over ten decades and listening to people who have already seen it.
