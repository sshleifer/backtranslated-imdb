This film does not offer a new genre that has traditionally shown an intercultural love story, backed by the mid-20th century politics / post-war India, where the British and their modern ways are bad and primitive, but honest and true Indians are good. Certainly, such British cluttered images are quite a passport now. <br /> <br /> Apart from the drama that feeds the second part of the movie, the narrative is predictable, acting as pedestrian and two-dimensional, and leading obvious and unimaginable. <br /> <br /> The story really needed to be clarified and would definitely get another half an hour on the screen to give the characters and narrative a deeper look and give the viewer something to feel. <br /> <br /> All in all, uninspiring. Oh and Linus Roache just can't do the tragedy - cross-eyes with emotional pain just don't work for me!
