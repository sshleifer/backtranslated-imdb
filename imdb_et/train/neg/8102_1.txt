Oh, I heard so much about this movie. I went to it with my best friend (she is a woman, I'm a man). Now please allow me to disagree with mainstrea. After the first few dozen "take off clothes", we both felt a very strange combination of stupidity and boredom. We laughed (at that, not with it), we went (and would be better in bed), we were convinced that we spent the money in vain. And we had. The plot was inconsistent and the characters were a group of people who couldn't care. Waste of money, celluloid residue. This film does not deserve even ten votes, but it is the lowest. I'm not sure why this film has a reputation for being great; I don't recommend it to anyone who even has taste or intelligence.
