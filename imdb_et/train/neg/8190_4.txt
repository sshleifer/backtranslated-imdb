My take: tired formula for the Christmas media. The laughter is tired and the talents behind it seem too. <br /> <br /> I love holidays as much as the next man (even though I often have a bad holiday blues), but it looks like it's just a dump for a day off for comedies that would be bad films every anniversary, but that doesn't do they are less painful during the season. Just like we already had enough SANTA GLASS films (three and * gulp * still reading) who wants to see a movie about their brother? FRED CLAUS is a premise of one joke that continues for 116 minutes with Disney's SANTA CLAUSE franchise (except for occasional raw humor and Santa's Little Little helper helper). Of course, Jolly Ol 'Saint Nick has a brother, but where does it go from there? <br /> <br /> It's really a shame. FRED CLAUS is blessed with the pain that could have made it more enjoyable for Christmastime's comedy, which is likely to melt with snow, but it would have been so much better. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but we believe he is really a long-aged Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti) who is inviting his good brother to visit. Mrs Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant and even worse, the efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey) has come to watch closely for Santa Claus and his closure. Ha! And I guess who's playing Santa's mother! Kathy Bates of course. Elizabeth Banks is Santa's Helper Charlene, John Michael Higgins is one of the gnomes and Rachel Wiesz plays Fred's girlfriend! SI does not know if I praise the lie or praise it. Here are some familiar faces that add a high quality image, but they do not have enough work to do. <br /> <br /> As far as humor is concerned, the best thing FRED CLAUS could do is be the exact opposite of Santa Claus and joke DJ Elf. I have to admit that I had some giggles associated with Fred, who was involved in advising a celebrity group (where he joined Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), but starts and ends there. Worse still, the film even has sentimentality that should "make us feel good" and teach us the story of what "Christmas really means". Obviously, what Christmas means for Hollywood is to get as much money as possible from our remaining Christmas boys. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** of 5.
