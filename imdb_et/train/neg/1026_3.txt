Wow. I don't think I'd ever seen a movie with so many big actors who had such an important role, so it's confusing. Justin Timberlake is probably one of the worst actor who plays a big role in a movie with stellar power and money behind Edison. <br /> <br /> His action was PAINFUL to follow. The story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional actors, hell, even LL Cool J was good because he had many small parts to cut his teeth. How the director and film company thought that Timberlake was ready for this role is not understandable. <br /> <br /> His character destroys all the experience, because every time he is on the screen, you really get into a corrupt cops to shut his fucking ass, and he should be a hero ... I won't waste it at this theater nor on video. Maybe if you have HBO and have nothing else to do on Saturday night at 2 pm, and you're drunk and stoned, it may be OK. <br /> <br /> Watching Timberlake in this role was like a human "Kermit the Frog is in a Hollywood band, just doesn't work.
