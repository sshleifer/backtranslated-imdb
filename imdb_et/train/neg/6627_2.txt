What happens to RGV? He seems to repeat himself in every movie. Has he run out of creative ideas? If he has, it's time to take the backrest. I went to see the film with great expectation - of course, never imagine it near the original. I knew it wouldn't, advertise it all. But even then I thought it would be great for treating RGV, but it's not the same man who led Sathya and Company? Or is it? I have doubts after looking at Aagi. I'm not talking about a plot or story, because most of it is taken from the original, if you really die to go and see it, you can play with your friends in a fun game: identify the scenes of the original and give your ratings! So Veeru Heero (how is that?), I think Heeru doesn't seem so big. Ajay Devgan is a rather big disaster, like Heero, comedy is tense and insecure talking that was really effective in the company is fake. Chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) doesn't exist at all. In fact, the more charming Nisha is trying to be more irritating. It ends up at the top. Raj is not really bad compared to others, he is a future observable man. I was really disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, he looks like Gabbar Singh's caricature. There's a scene where he drinks something from a bowl that is covered with a neck instead of an inspiring fear that he looks like a spoon in his bowl. The only show that really looked out was Mohan Lal as inspector of Narasimha. I'm afraid I don't have to write more about suffering.
