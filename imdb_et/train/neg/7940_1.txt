Guy de Maupassant was a writer who wrote a novel about a man, a poor person, without moral qualities. He only wanted success in a society where all people, political men, businessmen, journalists, women are corrupt. The only king is MONEY. Maupassand's hero Charles Forestier is higher and higher at the level of society thanks to his seducer. She is in love with all the women who could help her climb the styles of her society. At the end of the novel, he married the daughters of the largest daily paper owner in the largest church in Paris: "La Madeleine". "Le Tout Paris" is there. He has happiness and more, he becomes a member of Parliament and later a minister. "Useless" women are out of his perspective, but he is always up to date with useful women. Image "BEL AMI PRIVATE RIGHTS" is a story of morality. This is the story of everything, but not of Maupassand. Why did they put the title "BEL AMI"?
