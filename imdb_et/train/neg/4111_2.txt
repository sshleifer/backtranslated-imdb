Think of the Chinese budget line headed by a film student who fails with John Woo and gets 'Power Play'. The idea was good, but its execution, action and dialogue completely killed it, not to mention the ridiculous amounts of violence and catastrophe that were used to compensate for the development of a substantial flaw and more interesting parts of the film. This is a story of a reporter who is investigating the disappearance of a member of a group of three party activists who mysteriously disappeared after they broke into the office of a power plant that causes an earthquake. A relatively cavalier reporter who goes against what should have been the more ruthless killings of the company is driven around the city (with someone he talks to) to "cleanse" any convincing evidence that remains in the factory's mistakes. br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no real extraordinary feeling, because the characters communicate much more insecure, with idiotic dialogue and a lot of dreadful action. Not to mention that a spectator who can be tempted only for a film that is a complaint of his genre of action is forced to endure the body and ridiculous amounts of violent shootings and earthquakes. The whole focus was put on the wrong place to apologize for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that would have brought the story. It could have been much better if the filmmakers focused more on the thriller and paid more attention to the development of the corruption aspects of this story. Embarrassment, naive reporter and those who are trying to make the informant deliberately. It's formal, but at least it would have been fun.
