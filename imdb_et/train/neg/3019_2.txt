how do you get your hard-living, glamorously violent bounty hunter story seriously * that * accent? It's absurd. In addition, the director's visual style is nausea and tricky, the plot is low, boring, confusing gangster film rehash and the actor is not convincing. The film introduces the new symbols of the film and speaks of a fragmented setback - mostly in sequence - seemingly just to keep you nice and confused. The film will never show what things are not really happy and then later say, "It didn't happen," look at the (obvious) killing of the "first woman". So what did we see in the first, wrong, order of events? <br /> <br /> A terrible choice in casting, a complicated, dirty plot and a headdressing style. 1/5.
