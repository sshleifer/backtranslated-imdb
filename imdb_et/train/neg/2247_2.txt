Kris Kristofferson, who, in the mid-1970s, came to the top of his drug use, could barely push La Streisand's humongo alongside the screen with feminism. <br /> <br /> No character is really nice; I was delighted when Kristofferson's Ferrari went over this hill and fell. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie about rock-roll-start, try _ Buddy Holly Story_ (made about a year and a half) after that.
