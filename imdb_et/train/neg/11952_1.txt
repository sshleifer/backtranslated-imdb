His first film after the death of his long-time friend, John Belushi, shows Aykroyd a lot of fatigue, trying to pull down the character that Belush had. <br /> <br /> Instead, Dr. Detroit gives us a book by Professor Aykroyd, who masks a weird, violent pimp that only prevents a competitor known to be a mother. It is bad enough, but it also has classes for teaching, for a school dinner, for four evening women and a Pimpi dinner (or something). No wonder Aykroyd seems to be overwhelmed most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone? <br /> <br /> Aykroyd met with her future wife Donna Dixon. This chaotic confusion was at least some good. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. You want a good Aykroyd, look at "Blues Brothers." You want bad, look at "Doctor Detroit".
