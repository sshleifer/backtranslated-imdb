This is by far the worst film I've ever seen. From the plot, although the shots, "special effects" work and did I mention the plot? Any thing sucking ass! <br /> <br /> This is a good example of what "overfilling" means and I try to explain: <br /> <br /> I understand what the creator was trying to do about this movie; it was supposed to be one of those movies you really don't know what the hell is all about to end. You sit mesmerized, do not know who is dead and who is alive and who killed, who and why and just when you think you have the right timeline, you know you're wrong and the movie ends - leaving you in the next 5 minutes open mouth! Something like "Unbreakable" or "Job" if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Olga Levens, this spam writer, yes, Olga? Writer, Director, Director, Scriptwriter, Caster, Production Designer, Artist, Costume Designer, and also Double Character, are some scenes ... it's basically one female movie and when it comes to Olga Levens "Levens Productions", you can't go wrong :-) <br /> <br /> Well it can be a shocker, but "this time" Olga did this big time, jumping from scene to scene, from dream to reality ... but wait! it was all a dream ... or was it ??? The picture disappears and I realized that none of this ever happened, the girl was alone on the ship ... actually there was no ship ... no wait! The ship is back and the boys! They're alive! Thank God! No, they invite him to join a cruise ... but then the ship will get rid of it, so maybe they're dead? or maybe they were never alive to start ??? <br /> <br /> If you understand what I've just said, this movie might be like it - otherwise it will be a dull job and the only reason I got through all this mess was to find out how to stop them from hell. <br /> <br /> Don't look at the time you have 90 minutes of waste in this case ...
