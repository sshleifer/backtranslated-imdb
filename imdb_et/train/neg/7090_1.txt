I slept on my couch at 7:35 yesterday evening, watching Larry Sanders (I usually DirecTivo, but not last night). I woke up at 3:00 am (invesment banker on the west coast) and was fascinated to see it in HBO2. I was shocked at how bad this "film" was. Seriously. shocked. So shocked that I have to write a comment on iMDB. It's really very bad. writing is boring, but chairing and editing is just down from the film student's beginner. Remember that this is done with VIDEO, not with DIGITAL VIDEO. It looks like a soap opera. Skateboard videos have more movies than this fear. Images and blocking are foolish. yes, i chose the word "fool". not unusual, not bold, not bold, not boring, just stupid. I know that people who look at this review say "give me an example". I can not. It was 3:00. but trust me, I know you look at it anyway, then horrible comments are drawn. <br /> <br />
