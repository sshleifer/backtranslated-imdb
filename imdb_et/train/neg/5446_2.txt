For loyal fans of Duran Duran who want to watch a good music video, skip it. The producers decided to make it creative and make the sci-fi story of the 80's videos, including the evil Barbarella's wireline from which the band got its name. <br /> <br /> What makes this idea unsuccessful is that in the midst of the great 80's Duran Duran song, confusing and annoying scenes are showing up on a fictional antagonist trying to stop the band from one of their concerts. Good music is not only interrupted repeatedly, but we have to suffer with some of the cheap spin-off stories organized by the evil Dr. Mario. It's almost too big. 2/10
