I saw this movie yesterday. I have to admit that it wasn't my cup of tea. Although it should be a kind of horror movie. But when I watched it, I thought ... 'That movie doesn't make sense at all.' Where were the two men when they left the girls? Where on earth the shark came out? <br /> <br /> All these elements of this movie didn't add anything. I felt that these filmmakers would waste so much time and money on a film that was so forced to be so cute. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of good movies during my time, but it's one of the worst horror screens I've ever seen. At the end of the movie I told me I wouldn't look at it anymore. With so much movie show I have decided to give it a thumb! Let me have it! 0 out of 10!
