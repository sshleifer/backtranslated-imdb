I would never have seen a Tarzan movie, so when I saw it on TV, I thought I'd give it off. Unfortunately, I have to say that I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years old and somewhat overweight. Not how I thought Tarzan would look. And if I didn't do it, when I made the cup myself, Tarzan never gave up his traditional screaming. There was also no Tarzan who turned through the trees - jumping from vine to vine. Well, so much for expectations. Anyway, Jane was there - Monkey Cheeta was there. There was someone on the guitar. There were villains and good guys and romance ... everything was very safe and predictable. Nothing is bad, you understand, but nothing good. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best movie to introduce Tarzan: 4/10
