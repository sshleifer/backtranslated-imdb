I have not seen the original, but I just wanted to hide the quick message to anyone who happens to wander around: Wicker Man is the worst film I've seen this year. Maybe even after two years. I wish I could get my money back from the theater or get back to warn me not to see it. <br /> <br /> I give her two positive notes: the Cage character's sarcasm at least laughs at me and the island's scenery was beautiful. Sorry, that's it. Here come bold. The film plot moves forward only, because other characters don't give Cage any straight answers - and he stops it !!! The way it lasts more than an hour from my time (much less days in the movie) is over me. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. You leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill the library. How could anyone read this script and think, "Yes, people should pay $ 11 to see this shady vision of what the film should look like" outside of me. <br /> <br /> Don't look at this valve. Or even rent it on DVD.
