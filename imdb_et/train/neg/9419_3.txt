I would never have heard of it, so I learned that it was a man with a deadly lens I heard but didn't see. Connery's presence helped me buy it and that's not good. He wants to be a kind of cross between Dr. Strangelove and Mashi, but it's just not that funny if you can't find the name General Wombat (?) Funny. It's over a 70-year-old thriller up to the last ten minutes when it lives. The White House has many and many flat scenes between the President and his assistants who are not working. It is almost the same if the original cut was too long, and in the first half the whole nuclear bomb was changed to ransom and suicide attacks, which I think is meant to laugh, but again it's not funny. The location is great, but the studio stuff looks like a cheap TV. I couldn't believe that the man responsible for Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did that. Just laugh: Connery throws her wig before applying the helmet and out of the plane. It will never say ever Never look like a genius.
