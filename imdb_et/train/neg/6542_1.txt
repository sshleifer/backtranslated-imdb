The person who wrote the glowing overview of this misleading project must be related to the writer / director / star - or is actually the same person as it violates rational thinking that this film would be attractive to anyone who is not tied to a very tightly knit inner ring. How does it look? You want to make a movie - tell the story; entertain; pull me out with vivid characters. Of course, you can do it artificially, without worshiping a mass appeal. But it does not deal with elements of artistic expression in a vacuum where the audience is in constant struggle to grasp the narrative thread. If I have to move with a dreamy psychological thread, make the concrete fabric easier to buy.
