A pointless film about a good-looking but pointless couple who decide to live their dreams and take people on diving trips. The couple almost makes the wrong choice for the customer and mixes with some people who want to open the fallen objects on the ocean floor during the credit sequence. A very good direct video could have been so much better than it was so interested in a good look. The performances are usable and the plot is not really bad or it would have been the manager and the producers who did not direct the plot to make sure we saw a lot of people in the swimsuit (or what I think, "not evaluating" "Moniker with some bare breasts.) never create a tension or rise above the level of a retractable TV movie. If you see it to see it, you will not see your eyes out because the eye candy is nice, but we really need to stop the producers from making films that are excuse to get paid holidays.
