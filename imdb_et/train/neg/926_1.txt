This film talks about Tyrann, a gladiator who has been called back from the dead to invite Tyrann, who is back from the dead. Tyrannus, which we learn in about an hour, is also called Demonicus. It adds a much needed depth to the scenario and questions our assumptions about identity, psychology and ours. <br /> <br /> The tyrant's spirit achieves his little list of tasks (kills some people and says repeated phrases in Latin), having a college guy. He uses it with a magic-minded helmet that a college boy deliberately puts on his head, and then, at several points in the film, takes off and puts it back. <br /> <br /> Maria makes oral sex for a poor man on Sean Willian Scott and Tyrann is wearing a Rollerball glove. The tyranny has its own green backlight for no reason, and apparently, for centuries, it has just sat in the old concrete tunnel next to the CG fire. The whole mishap. <br /> <br /> This movie is empty and hurts you. Look at this.
