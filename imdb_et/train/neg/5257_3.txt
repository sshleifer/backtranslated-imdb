For the horror movie, the movie is very interesting. I was really intrigued by the story and secret of the movie. But the end was a complete fraud. The film went through a fast pace and built up to climate change. But I guess what's not. The film is a little over and in about half and half an hour the audience will just find out what happened. Why all missed questions were missed. None of the main points of the plot had been explained at all. This movie is like watching the mystery of murder and then never knowing who did it. Very disappointed. This movie looks like the producers just ran out of money and never finished the movie. Real BOMB!
