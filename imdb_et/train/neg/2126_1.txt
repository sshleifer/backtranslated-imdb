Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but it's ridiculous to cast him as a beautiful romantic leader. The fact that he is dancing so well, cries so effectively and throws himself partially so completely in any way just made him feel even more horrible. At more moments (with the girl at the train station, Rosie) I couldn't take her eyes off because she was so repulsive. You expect him to fall for a nice boy and start accusing him. Vanessa Williams was a real star, the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie. By the way, when you see the production of the production, the 1963 film and the 1995 film, you see three versions with more changes (different songs, the same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations) than any other music I I've ever seen.
