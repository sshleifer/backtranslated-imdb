When I read the back of the DVD, I thought it sounded really interesting ... so ... I had my mother throw it in the blockbuster box "4 for $ 20". When we got home and jumped into the movie ... twenty minutes into it, we found ourselves turning to each other, "it sucks. Let's put something else." I admit that some of the friends in the cafe made us smile a little. But come on, at least get some decent actors! The movie every time the actor is bad and the film does not go painfully slowly and seems interesting, I can kick it out and get some laughs over how they over (or down) their lines. But I can only take that much. The screaming scenes saw that the actors were on the hysterical sides of laughter, their lines had no delivery ... the amateur is not even close to the people in this movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone who came here saying that this movie was good was some really good medicine while watching the movie. This is the most pointless thing I've ever seen. DO NOT BUY OR BUY MOVIE !!!!!
