Fine actors have been waiting for "Deceiver" much more than it was delivered. The plot is extremely busy and manipulative. Many setbacks only add confusion. The unbelief flies out of the window and ends up being intolerable and even ridiculous. I would strongly recommend that anyone who likes their film plots is based on what is at least possible to prevent a "fraudster" because you are very disappointed. Maybe I'm just not clean enough to get it, but my suspicion is that many others were confused about the story and especially the end. The blurring of the line between reality and lies does not work simply because the whole film doesn't make sense. - MERK
