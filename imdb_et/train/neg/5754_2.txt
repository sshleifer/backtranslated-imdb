I watched a mask in the 80's and it is now showing in Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember it had cooled down a day ago and there were also a couple of toys, but looking at it, it now becomes tears. I never knew how annoying and boring this cartoon exhibition really was. It's just terrible! This is not where almost the same league like Transformers, He-man or Thundercats and almost everyone almost forgot when it ended. I only look at it at Fox Kids because Ulysses 31 comes right after that (this is when the mask doesn't leave me before). One of the smallest 80's cartoons that I hope to completely forget when it stops Fox Kids inciting!
