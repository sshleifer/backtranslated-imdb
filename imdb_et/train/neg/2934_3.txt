Simon Pegg stands for Sidney Young, a stereotypically clumsy idiot of Britain, who works as a famous journalist in this US comedy. After a very happy holiday, he will start in a highly rated Sharp magazine run by Jeff Bridges in New York. It's More Devil Wears Prada than Shaun of the Dead. Kirsten Dun, who works well with Pegg to laugh, is unlikely to love the luck, but they don't specify the screen with their passion. <br /> <br /> Sidney is going through some emotions trying to decide if she should forget her press principles to get the material in the magazine. Of course, he has seduced the famous and famous celebrities of the world, especially the young constellation Sophie Maes (Transformers' Megan Fox). The fans of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Spaced, wonder if Pegg himself has experienced the same feelings in real life and to some extent on Run Fat Boy Run, one of Britain's finest comic strips that the United States is destroying. /> <br /> All this is a forgotten comedy. Please come back to Simon, we can forgive and forget.
