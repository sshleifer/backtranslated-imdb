Superhero movies are pretty much sucking, and this is no exception. The only quality of redemption is that the film MAY be worse. I'd put this movie on "Batman & Robin" and "Steel" so yes, it's so bad ... <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a black superhero, check out "Blankman" for its not a "serious" superhero movie, but at least its fun.
