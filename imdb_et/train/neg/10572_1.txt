*** SHORT SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> A 15-year-old boy kisses a very cute 15-year-old girl and finally has sex for the first time. After the law, he puts him in bed where he didn't touch him. The next day he concludes that he does not like sex much and does not want to try it again for at least a couple of years. <br /> <br /> This is probably a fine openness on teleplay for a boy who discovers his homosexuality or perhaps a medical drama about a post-natal teenager with severe hormone deficiency. <br /> <br /> However, as the plot progresses, this story is about a 15-year-old father who is supported and encouraged at one point to preach his mother to his associates who are not as understandable as they could be, "Every step in that direction , my son has been amazing .. .. I've never been proud of him ... "<br /> <br /> The older father's older sister who is otherwise cold with his brother is proud to show his brother:" You've been it's kind, "because he gives him an encouraging warm hug. <br /> <br /> A 15-year-old father wants to be a father. He wants to be older. <br /> <br /> Why not? We see a "new" baby a few minutes after birth - it seems to be a healthy, happy 4-month-old child. Just as children were born on television in the 1960s and 1970s. <br /> <br /> When a young father is older, he has found happiness. He demands that he start changing the dirty diaper. We see that a 15-year-old father is sincerely happy to keep his child, while a teenage busy = body mother is on his shoulder. Blacken fade.
