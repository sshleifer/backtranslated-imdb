Even worse than the worst David Lynch "confusion", "Brain Dead" makes no sense. Disgracefully wasted talent (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton) collided as they are "Tom and Jerry" in the figure. Character development is negligible. It just starts to climb the "strange scale" until the chaos comes together. Do not suck it because of the above-mentioned fine participants. They are not given anything to do, and you don't know what's going on for 85 minutes. I recommend avoiding "Brain Dead" at all costs, unless you have scattered your brain. - MERK
