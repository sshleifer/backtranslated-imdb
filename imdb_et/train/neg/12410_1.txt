This movie was really terrible. Action was the worst! It was worse than a student film. Super cheesy, and I think the worst actor was an old lady. At first I thought myself, this is an old film. Then I remembered it was no excuse! I've seen the older movies seeing better and so. <br /> <br /> The music was terrible. It was really bad. Editing was bad (most of the dialogue was not synchronized.) <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is not even worth it. It was just ridiculous. My dead grandmother's pink rose can make it a better film.
