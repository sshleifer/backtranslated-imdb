First of all, she didn't want to watch this movie because the trailer gave the impression of a common and too much anticipated movie ... but since I was delighted to discover the surprising "Mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinité" that was Laurent Tirardi's ("prête-moi ta main" scriptwriter ) beautifully managed and written, I thought and decided to try it, I thought "Prête-moi he main" would be as good as "mensonges ..." And that is not absolutely - the script is not bad but it is not so well targeted as "Mensonges ...", actors are not as generous (especially Charlotte as boring as usual) as Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac, and frankly, I still can't understand how such a mess can be so successful, even Anyway, the story would have been a pretext for creating so many interesting plots, but it's not as good as the "Mensonges ..." of Tirardi, although it's also written, simple, surprising and lazy.
