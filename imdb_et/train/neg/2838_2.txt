Skip the mission: Galactica and watch the original Living Legend episodes instead. The Network participated in Living Legend Parts 1 and 2 and created them in one plot with a terrible fire space episode. Although Galactica suffered from network control and lack of time to prepare for the right production, Living Legend is the best TV series of 1978. Fire alone is one of the worst episodes. As a historical remark, look at Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then the revival Trek series, and you'll see the difference in quality between network-based sci-fi and syndicate-sci-fi.
