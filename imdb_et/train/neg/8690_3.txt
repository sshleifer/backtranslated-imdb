Everyone involved (and the audience) should look for "Candidate" to see how good this film would have been. What happened to the South American story? What was Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw thinking that their roles would be cardboard cutouts. So far I have liked every action and / or film by Gene Hackman. He was either unselfish (which I hardly believe) or terribly failed. I have also loved and defended Richard Gere (and has been pampered for it). But here he had no "power". He was never scary and only occasionally convincing. All in all, I was very disappointed. I waited much more for this director and I was aching. If you can't find "Candidate", check out "Wag the dog" again or even "Bulworth".
