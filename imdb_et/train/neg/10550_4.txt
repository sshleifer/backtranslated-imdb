Waiting for Stella Street's ten minute long T.Visjon, I was expecting this movie with excitement and anticipation. Unfortunately, I was feeling very disappointed. <br /> <br /> It was terrible that almost all gags and one liner were lifted directly from TV episodes, and it was much less enthusiastic and comical than the actors would have once told them and could not be said again. I bought a copy of the DVD and felt I was beating that I had left my hard-earned money to watch the same joke again. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The film plot begins with Stella Street (normal English Surrey Street), which is gradually populated by "some of the most famous people on stage and screen of the last forty years", including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All the celebrities on the street end up with the local traitor for their entire fortune and are forced to live like trams and common class people. There are great moments, but as a whole, writers can make an interesting idea and make it quite boring. * END OF SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> In T.V episodes, all characters are John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including women), but in Ronni Ancona. I think it was a mistake. His impersonations were not funny and it seemed that his characters were the only story to give him something to do. <br /> <br /> If you were not a fan of Stella Street Episodes, you may find this movie fun. But if you were a fan, I think you can walk a little cheat. 4/10
