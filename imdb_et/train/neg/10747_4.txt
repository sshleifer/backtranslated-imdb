Camp Blood III is a large-scale development in Camp Blood II as it sounds mostly in the right place and primitive plot. This time they are a little further away from the car park, the other two films were filmed with good movement because you can no longer hear the cars that drive farther than they should be in the wilderness. <br /> <br /> This time it is a reality to intimidate the TV show and the fake clown rivals. This is hardly a new idea, I have seen at least three other horror films that have exactly the same assumption where a real killer rises, but at least it has a plot instead of just stealing a knife. Unlike the other two series, it is good for at least some laugh. I liked how there is a shock effect when someone can catch up early and how the boom mike keeps people like a phantom. <br /> <br /> I don't know why anyone would want to make a third camp blood movie, I would have thought it would be better to start from scratch, but they have at least tried it. Half the bare deformed woman had a little bit of me, they seemed to try to keep consistency when hired by a freak who would get her $ 5 as they did in another movie. They have not yet developed a machet not to be used for cutting, but well, is it a Camp Blood movie that you expect? If you like crap movies, you'll enjoy it.
