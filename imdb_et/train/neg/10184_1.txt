For several months I've heard this little movie and now I've seen it. I find it cute, cute, how so many leading leaders make movies where they combine other people's creative ideas to make one's movie a joke. Reminiscent of troops, Swingblade, all the millions of Blair Witch parodies. If everything they want is a leg in the Hollywood door, they will do the right thing and they should keep it, because combining plot boundaries is how Hollywood makes movies. How many times have you heard the phrase: "This is the animal house will meet the future"; "This is Wall Street corresponds to the Dead Poet's Society"; or "Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars"? I remember when independent films meant original and bold not safe and unpredictable.
