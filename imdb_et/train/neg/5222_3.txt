This is really a very bad movie. Why? First, the story is bad. It's an artificial story that combines all kinds of things that make no sense. It just seems like a wrong experiment. Secondly, the participants cannot play realistically. They can't even speak as an actor. Why did I buy this movie? And what should I do now?
