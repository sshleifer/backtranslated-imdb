Even Bob Hope, accompanied by a wealth of character actors, cannot save this poorly written attempt in the comedy of war, because his patented timing is little to work with. The plot includes the Hollywood film star Don Bolton (Hope) and his attempt to avoid military service at the beginning of World War II, followed by his recruitment by mistake in trying to meet the Colonel's daughter (Dorothy Lamour). Bolton's agent, played by Lynne Overman and his assistant, depicted by Eddie Bracken, involves him and three have participated in various training sessions in the Malibu, California Mountains. Paramount, which is well designed for this endeavor, serving some of its top specialists, but usually the direction of a trusted David Butler was uncertain and must be associated with the absence of a comedy element in the scenario. The change towards the end of the movie to create the possibility of Bolton's heroism is still born with a bad stunt and evidence of camera action. Strangely enough, Lynne Overman is given the best features and this veterinarian is very good. Dorothy Lamour also looks beautiful and acting nicely, as well as being delighted to see and hear Clarence Kolb as her father, whose voice is unique on the screen or on the radio, but there is little they can record for this movie, cursed as it is in error scripting.
