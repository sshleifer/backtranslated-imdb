Whatever someone tells you, the movie simply has the word "mastery", such as "what will bring you this green movie?" Religion has nothing to do with it, but common sense. This means that if your head is clear and you are sensible to make a decision. <br /> <br /> On many levels I tried to rationalize, where this movie is for entertainment ... or even for the average consumer. Star? Story? A unique idea? A friend of a movie that kids would love a dinosaur and a black woman? My goodness! I'm sure that if it was an "idea", it sounded good. But somewhere during development, somebody should have noted where the idea could not be translated into entertainment that someone would want to see or pay for ... if they weren't very deeply under the influence of alcohol or drugs and saw something the rest of us didn't see. <br /> <br /> However, it is a complete confusion. Mess, confusion - sin and confusion. <br /> <br /> Who cares about the plot (what plot?), etc. Whoopie got a salary, but I would have covered it. I hope he fired his representative / leader / publicist over this career move. Obviously he didn't make any more bad movies. And more bad movies. Sad.
