There are no words to explain how bad NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. It simply describes the description. Something about a computer that can turn personal items into silver balls that enter the mouth of the victims that kill them or make them zombies. The whole thing is so puzzled that it's stunning. In her room there is also a girl with a PC and the computer speaks by hand with the doll !!!!!!!! I'm not doing this stuff. The computer also checks things like cars, although there is no connection to the computer. <br /> <br /> "Film" is the entire trash. Surreal bad trash. Spectacularly, one-of-a-kind bad trash. Here and there are many sexual scenes that are not very hot or erotic. There's even one scene where a woman seems to love or wants to kiss French with tarantula, which rolled me on the floor. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the worst films ever made. There's an equally terrible, direct-home video of BOARDINGHOUSE or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a killer toothbrush!). At least it is fun to watch it and try to understand what is going on.
