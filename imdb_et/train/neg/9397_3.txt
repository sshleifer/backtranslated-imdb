I saw most of the RMFTM episodes as a teenager at the "Cliffhanger Theater" that ran a couple of years ago at the local station, and then again, when the Mystery Science Theater in the early 90s, riffed. Time has not been kind. <br /> <br /> I can definitely do special effects that were quite impressive for the 50's of a small budget (IMO Commando Cody's scenes were better than George Reeves / Superman's TV show). And I also get support for struggle, "acting" and fighting choreography. except for the man who plays the moon men ruler. He's incredibly uneven. He looks and acts like a fellow who comes to his pipeline, not to a despotic ruler of a strange race. Even the dirty dialogue works all right - everyone ran their lines like banging strings, without wasted time or breaks like "thinking" or "feeling". Since everyone does this, the viewer finds it to be around for a while, and even to my modern feelings, it doesn't bother much. <br /> <br /> What irritates me is writing and drawing. I'm not talking about the sunny weather on a moon or baked soda rocket or flying suit with "up / down" and "fast / slow". I'm not even bothered by the harshness of resolutions for the harsh end of each chapter. I'm talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are unpleasant as garden posts and have no cumulative memory. And the fact that while dialogue is like a high-speed train, the same movements of the plot go through again and again. <br /> <br /> Dig it: Commando Cody and his wife are the head of a secret high-tech research lab whose mission is to protect the Earth (or at least the US) from the insidious alien invasion. But there are no guards or security controls in his office. They don't even have door locks. So the bad guys walk in RIGHT IN and beat the crap on Cody and his staff ... not once (perhaps understandable), but several times. They even rob their female assistant on the second sample. And they never get smarter. To further prove your points, let me point out how Cody is jumping on her volatile suit and flying into trouble and never seeing anyone succeed. He does it again and again. Cody drives her ship to the moon (a woman's assistant has to eat) for about 30 seconds and immediately turns around and comes back. Cody strikes one of Atomic Ray's weapons ... and loses it again to the bad men because he couldn't bother him. And so on. <br /> <br /> And you think that if Cody's efforts were so important to rescue the US from the Moon Men, he could ask some soldiers with carbines, a helicopter and a tank or two to keep him back, instead of working all the time with the local police. It was supposed to be a military operation, but they act like a "Gangbusters" second episode. It's all pretty hard on the stomach. I appreciate that the creators had a vastly limited budget and time constraints ... and I appreciate that Cody is actually a relatively hombre (although he loses half of his fistfights). But I just can't get "DOOR! LOCK THE DOOOOR !!" scream! if the gangsters just enter their lab or try to blow the ship and there are no security measures at the landing site ... not even a fence (!). <br /> <br /> Still, it's OK. From the three Republican series I watched, "Phantom Creeps" had a better plot and "The Underwater Kingdom" had more atmosphere (hah!) And a better hero than "Radar Men", but this is OK. <br /> <br /> BTW ... why "Radar" men? They didn't use radar, they used atomic beam. Shouldn't the title be "Ray of the Atoms Gun Men from the Moon?"
