Stilted, stagy, strange and opaque, as a visually striking ... wannabe erotic fantasy. Really boring, too much man nudity (including father-son incest) and just sort of shameless nonsense. However, I admit that certain parts of the dialogue that they themselves have taken are lulling, haunting quality.
