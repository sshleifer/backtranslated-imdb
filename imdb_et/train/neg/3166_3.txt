I admit that I have a rather uncomfortable feeling about the ghost movie, and while I sometimes enjoy horror, but when it comes to comedies, they have to be funny. "Over his dead body" seems to take his life too seriously after life and does not think, in my opinion, almost every aspect I mean. The story is, of course, absolutely incredible and I couldn't convince me of the comic or the sentimental register. The choice of the main actors was terrible. Although Paul Rudd is at least beautiful and looks like a nice boy, his character's taste seems to require serious healing, because Eva Longoria seems too old to her (sorry) and Lake Bell seems too unpleasant (again sorry). The romantic romantic story without romance is due to the failure of the beginning. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were actually better, but they had only supporting roles. The rest are uninteresting and intrusive, flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful TV comedies. Nothing deserves to be remembered.
