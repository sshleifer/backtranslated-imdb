Dr. Hackenstein begins in the second half of the last century, "1909 The threshold of modern medicine" is accurate. Dr. Eliot Hackenstein (David Muir) is at an early stage of rejuvenating live tissue experiments, Dr. Hackenstein is able to bring a skinned rat to life, confirming that he has been able to bring the dead to life ... Now "Three Years Later" and Dean Slesinger (Micheal Ensign) for Dinner Doc around the house. As Dean Slesinger and Dr Hackenstein eat to talk about Hackenstack's attempts that Dean Slesinger has always been holding, Dr. Hackenstein shows Dean Slesinger in his lab in his attic, where he keeps his wife Sheila (Sylvia Lee Baker), who died an unfortunate "accident" and can talk to him telepathically (Christy Botkin apparently offers Sheila's voice). Dr Hackenstein also shows Dean Slesinger, who runs around the cage and explains that he has brought Sheila to life with his advanced process. The dean has some attachment and probably dies. Meanwhile, sisters Wendy (Bambi Darro as Dyanne DiRossario) and Leslie Trilling (Catherine Davis Cox) and their brother Alex (John Alexis) and their cousin Melanie Victor (Stacey Travis) are traveling near Hackenstein's house, looking for asylum and help and arrivals At Hackenstein's reach. Dr Hackenstein invites four passengers to stay overnight. Later, Dr. Hackenstein is visited by two grave robbers: Xavier (Logan Ramsey) and Ruby Rhodes (Ann Ramsey) who deliver the male body when Hackenstein needs female parts of Sheila. Dr Hackenstein is a genius he decides not to waste the opportunity to get three young beautiful copies and borrow the 'n' bits he needs to fill Sheila ... <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Richard Clark surprised by Dr. Hackenstein, I say immediately that imagination is not great, but what it really was. It moves at a reasonable pace even when it tends to drift slightly in the middle of things. The script tries to mix a sense of humor as a scene when Dr. Hackenstein tries to restrict Melanie and tries to draw attention to his deaf housekeeper Yolanda Simpson (Catherine Cahn) and Hackenstein keeps Melanie Yolanda behind, who is seemingly attentive to what happens, somewhat gore, but I would say that Dr. Hackenstein is a comedy rather than a horror concept and a feeling for the whole world. There are also some sticky reds and sexual enthusiasms that are always a good laugh, dr. Hackenstein Wendy "would like to see my instruments". I also thought of this scene when Mrs Trilling (Phyllis Diller) announces her missing daughter, Detective Olin (William Schreiner), a fairly amusing sequence that speaks around, telling her why she's not looking for her, although she has only been told why the cell is not in jail and that if he did not find the cousin to worry about it. None of this is lame laughing, but I have to admit that I have sometimes smiled and found the whole movie quietly amusing. There are not many screen shots, a couple of cuts, Sheila's decapitated head, some medical sewing and those skinned animals that are definitely fake off the road. I also liked Dr. Hackenstein characters, which was surprising in itself. Action is not brilliant, but gives everyone the credit to invest in it, a lot of exaggerated facial movements and some serious over-burning means that it's never boring, the three birds at Dr. Hackenstein fit if you know what I mean. Technically, the movie is also fine, again it can't win any Oscare, but I have to give the filmmakers at least some credit for trying to pull off the turn of the turn of the century. It doesn't always work, clothes are contradictory, girls look like Victorian England, while boys look like they are from the West. The house looks like all the filmmakers remove all modern objects from the room and stay there for a few candles! It's a bit cheaper, but it's not a weird movie at all. Maybe it could have been without comedy music. All in all, I enjoyed much more from Dr. Hackenstein than I thought it was not a recommendation. Surely this is never the best comedy horror movie ever made, and it is certainly not the worst. Traceable enough for a piece of harmless fun.
