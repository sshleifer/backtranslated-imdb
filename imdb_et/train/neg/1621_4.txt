"Fox and Child" is a new film by French director Luc Jacquet, which brought us the Oscar winning documentary "March of the Penguins". It focuses on a young girl (Bertille Noël-Bruneau's wonderful game) and her blooming friendship with the fox. <br /> <br /> Here are some really mesmerizing moments; the mountains that suck, lynx, who robs the fox through snow in the forest; one scene, especially when the fox is tortured by the wolf package, is quite intense and sometimes frightening. But they are not enough. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot; Cinematography is dazzling. The impressive appearance of the film is wonderful. This is undoubtedly a very lush production. <br /> <br /> Kate Winslet speaks the English version, but what little dialogue there is already very poorly duplicated. Also, the score is too fluffy, or at least it's nice to me; and the scenario, though subtle, seemingly jumps from one scenario to another, eventually leaving me almost confused. <br /> <br /> While the movie has a nice morale and Noël-Bruneau's pretty quiet performance is pretty cute, the real star is a fox. These fascinating moments that focus only on our furry little friend are enormous. Moreover, they are not nearly enough. <br /> <br /> - Keep up with all the latest movies, including reviews, news, discussions and more, be sure to visit www.mybluray. com.au
