This is undoubtedly one of the worst films I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> The plot is so holes that the story is like a bad temporary movie and actors. sounds like reading for the first time in a manuscript. The worst is Steve Guttenberg. He plays his character as he was the "Police Academy" - the same foolish woman - and it is not suitable for a leading person who should have been a thriller. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to believe that Hanson would be "LA Confidential" ten years later ... <br /> <br /> Avoid this as a plague ...
