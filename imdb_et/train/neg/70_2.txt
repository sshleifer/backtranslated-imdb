This movie never did it in the theaters of our region, so when it became available on the DVD, I was one of the first to rent it. Once upon a time, I should listen to the critics and pass it on. <br /> <br /> Despite the excellent lineup of the actors, the film was very disappointing. I see now why he went straight to the video. <br /> <br /> I thought Bloom, Ledger, and Rush might have some. Everyone has done a wonderful job in the past. <br /> <br /> The film was slowly moving and never pulled me in. I couldn't develop a lot of empathy for the characters, and I had to fight the urge to move on to reach the end. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie even if you think about renting it for "eye candy" only. It doesn't even match that.
