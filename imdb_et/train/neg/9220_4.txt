When the movie started, it seemed like the first four minutes of the California travel ticket, I was wondering if I got mixed up. Then I breathed into relief to see Paul Thomas in a style with a beautiful Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is pushed by Jimmy (young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is worried about her behavior as she hires her as a private school teacher (Kay Parker). I could do without an animal, a robot role play or an incest. There's one good sex experience between Byron and Parker, but it's not good enough to record this movie. <br /> <br /> My degree: D +
