One hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds of this flick and I decided it was pretty flat. It was right after Hopalong (Chris Lybbert) fell on a tree to restore a good man. I was pretty mystical with the whole Hopalong Cassidy / Great Bar 20 trick that didn't change at all. Of course, the name of Coppola in credits cannot do anything here for success, even if it is more than one. <br /> <br /> When you do this at the end of the movie, you probably have finished asking yourself the same questions I did. What exactly was a glove hook? What is a rodeo scenario? Who was the stranger to represent? Why did they make this movie? <br /> <br /> I can probably go ahead, but my energy is dry. Look, there is the Western "The Gunfighter" already in 1950, whose Gregory Peck is the title of the title. Looking at it, you feel as good as watching that you feel bad. I can recommend this.
