The inspector's gadget was probably my all-time favorite 80's comic. I liked both the first and second seasons of the series, and Gadget's 1992 special inspector saves Christmas. Some Gadget fans criticize the second season of the exhibition (1985), but they have to compare it with the release of DiC's 2002 "Inspector Gadget Last Case: Cynical Revenge" because they find the second season is absolute gold <br /> > Since this is a fan of the gadget, I couldn't prevent the opportunity to see an animated inspector gadget that was not related to the gadget. I bought a movie and swore to myself that I was objective; I knew that artistic freedoms were sometimes taken from the original series. I wasn't even ready to see what I watched. <br /> <br /> The initial exhibition was hardly hard. <br /> <br /> Here's a short list of just a few of the disadvantages of this movie: * The original series doesn't have humor. <br /> <br /> * Penny and Brain (almost equal to the original series) have disappeared from fifteen activities. up to twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> * Sabani & Levy's original music doesn't exist and the existing score is sub-par. (Realizing that Saban now has his own production plant, but at least "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" was good music, even without Saban.) * Don't expect to see any gadget gadgets that showed the show as fun as the gadget -Copter, gadget brella, gadget-mallet, widget coat (which was actually used but not even called the same thing), as well as its standard hat and hand-gadget. In this film, his gadget legs were telescopic instead of springs. Such things disturb the exhibition fans and simply do not need to change them. <br /> <br /> * The original series gadget is now a quick talk, supposedly a "hip" convertible. All fans of the original series enjoyed a gadget that became older and vice versa. <br /> <br /> * The Chief Quimby is now very short and even designed for the gadget. He was always terrible in the original series, but it pushes the situation a little. <br /> <br /> * Penny no longer has a computer book. <br /> <br /> Does this film have any positive results? OK, here goes ... <br /> <br /> * Maurice LaMarche does an excellent Don Adams as an inspector over the gadget. <br /> <br /> * In one scene, Chief Quimby refers to the actual offender from the series: Great Wambini (classic "Gadget" villain from the second season, which was expressed by Louis Nye). <br /> <br /> Looking for more redeeming factors for this movie? Well, you're lucky. Life is about making choices and living their choices. Most life situations have a purpose, even if it is a lesson. Lesson learned here: Keep the original formula! "If it's not broken, don't fix it." True Gadget fans should find out about this movie; you are definitely disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hopefully DiC and Shout! The factory continues to release most of the original series after the 2006 "Inspector Gadget: Original Series, Volume 1" release, which includes the first 22 episodes of the series. As a true Gadget fan, 80s animation lover and many DiC programs, I invite you to buy a "Inspector Gadget: Original Series, Volume 1" and "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" DVD that is great and will definitely come back Memories.
