This movie is beautiful. Unfortunately, he has no plot. There must be a conflict to get a plot. There was nothing in this film. He spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and couldn't put any activity into it. The picture tries to be artistic, but does not pay attention to the basics of storytelling. <br /> <br /> If you love the Montana landscape and fly fishing, you will find some value in this movie. Not one.
