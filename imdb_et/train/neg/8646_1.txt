This is the worst film I've ever seen. I went up and left Tape 4, but I stopped. I now consider Masochist! Afghanistan? Come on guys! Who is the idiot who forgot to hide the Sanskrit billboard? I thought the leading actor (George Calil) was particularly intuitive. In addition to the bad and enthusiastic shake of the camera, I thought I was using the events of September 11 because "Larson is in Lunatic Implodes, a screen near you," a disgraceful and uneven one for the September 9 victims. Using Larson's husband's phone call, Sarah, allegedly one of the aircraft on that day, was terrible. The shaking of the camera didn't make me bad, so this cold heartfelt stunt did.
