(Small spoilers only, except in the indicated cases). <br /> <br /> I've recently enjoyed a lot of Spanish cinema; both the actual Spanish cinema and people like Almodovar and the cinema in Latin America as del Toro, whose wonderful "Devil's Backbone" set in the Civil War in Spain was the best film of the last decade. So it is not surprising that this film is so well done, well-functioning, and also able to maintain this distinct Spanish atmosphere. But this is also a nasty and pointless film that you wouldn't expect to see. <br /> <br /> What is it? We have no real idea that caused the horrible central character to kill, despite the fact that a large number of narrative speeches come directly from your narcissistic magazine. In a routine unpleasant opening sequence that has been set more than ten years earlier, we see a central character who kills his girlfriend with jealousy and control-freakery ("if I can't get you?"). Oddly enough, this is probably one of the best sequences in the film, but it has no connection with his later killing, which seems completely different in motivation and performance. What happened to him in prison to make it change? We have no idea, though we later discover, as an absurd follow-up, that he was imprisoned in justice. <br /> <br /> In the UK, in many of our infamous "serum killer" or "sex" killer cases, there is a terrible question; But a woman? Did she know or suspect what's going on? to ask and the woman actually starts to emerge as one of the most intriguing signs, but on the contrary, the answer to the question is quite clear: "No, she does." Even if this dramatic opportunity is played on the disc, the film still manages to do it. get it, it's a bit of an immoral readiness for cash after the event. Compare it to the horrible revelation of ten in Rillington, where Christie's wife says, "Do you know what I mean?" br /> <br /> (The main spoiler in this paragraph) In the meantime, we should believe that the killer himself is a criminal who extensively crosses the police, thereby giving short-term incidents to the mental hospital before release so that he can kill again. How exactly did he achieve this? The plot can be highly outlined here; nothing to do with leaving a hint to the police; but how it all works or why or how the subsequent court proceedings will actually continue will remain a mystery. <br /> <br /> I really don't think serum killers are like that. The silence of lambs may be a comic book, but ?? Lecter aside? he gets his serial numbers. They are deeply disturbed, deeply inadequate, deeply inadequate; not a purposefully charming handyman who presented here (closely related to the same astonishing last horror movie killing or even to Man Bites Dog), although it seems to have not been a satire. <br /> <br /> This film has little intercourse and it looks like a little intrigue that the plot might have created. It has nothing to do with the motivation of serial makers, either in general or in Spain's specific cultural milieu. This is nothing more than a poorly drawn excuse to show women a lot of discomfort. And strange, which makes this violence even more reluctant, is a certain failure of the nerve even when it is presented. What is actually shown makes the character of the soft core even more sensitive. Just one time on time shooting would have been more and more shocking and would make all the other things completely unnecessary by releasing more movie time to refine the pieces and the testimonials. Instead, we just get endless images of young women who are wounded widely on their real but slightly revealing underwear. Very, very scary. I'm sorry to be rude; I love horror films and can even endure the most extreme, even when my partner worries. But I think anyone who finds this movie good or interesting, even if I get myself away. The purpose of the horror film is to scare you; it's just terrible. <br /> <br /> This leaves a really bad taste in your mouth. I only have to give this movie with more than one star just because it is professionally executed, but morally worth it at all and it should never be done.
