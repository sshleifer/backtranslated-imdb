Very outdated movie with terrible, clich√© and mawkish dialogue and very bad construction. In addition, Cassavetes and Falk are constantly moving. Pseudo "good movie". The catastrophic discovery of this intellectual turkey does not take time. The first scene is a complete cage filled with histrionics and hysterical shifts. The sound is terrible. Camera movements are as imaginative as building characters. No poetry, fine psychology, no interesting pictures. Actors constantly smoke and see ads for beer drinks. Very cheap, indeed. (one exception: Ned Beattie's nice and easy way to play a hit).
