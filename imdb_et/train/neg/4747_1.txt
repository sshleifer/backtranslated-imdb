I thought this movie was terrible. I'm Chinese, so I thought everything was totally wrong. Many facts were wrong. The only thing the film was about Chinese history was when Wendy's mother explained ShiHuangD's shield to her husband. I also thought that fighting scenes were very cheesy and fake. Many actors and actors were not very big. Some jokes that were supposedly funny were really stupid. I think this movie should get the worst rating it could get. Disney has really got more information about Chinese history when they want to create an extravagant movie. Mulan was quite accurate. Watch this movie if you want to waste some time.
