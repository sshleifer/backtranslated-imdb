How did you write a fat Italian language that barely touches heartbreaking movements? In this film, we see Steven Seagal at its lowest level - since his career has begun, it has consistently fallen due to the pathetic behavior that has shouted his career. In this film, it seems that most of his workouts consisted of ordering fetuccin alfredo in his restaurant every day. <br /> <br /> He is fat, slow and very old, watching this movie, hardly a martial arts hero, more like a ridiculous clover. <br /> <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to retire - this movie is about 2 hours a reason why. <br /> <br /> Plot: A fatty Italian man with a great reputation for strength can wind that a criminal group can play with a military-shaped medicine to create the ultimate warrior response. This pretense, albeit pathetic and ridiculous, gives some of the scenes of a global fight that include blasting through walls like a comic book. <br /> <br /> Did I mention this movie completely suck and Steven Seagal is a complete joke? yes. I did.
