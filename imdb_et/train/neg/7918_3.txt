I found the writing of this movie absolutely awful. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved this movie from me was when it was 1 out of 10, Lacy Chabert's play, who thought she was playing a lot of people really well. For me he was definitely the highlight of this movie. <br /> <br /> Dina Meyer was as always, but I found her role to be quite blissful, so I don't think I can say her acting was great. The man's leader, Armand Assante, mainly recalled his role in interpreting his role as a physician in the 1980's hospital doctors. <br /> <br /> All I could have lived. But the terrible, terrible, terrible end / solution, the role of the psyche and even the psychological role was just some of the worst letters I've seen for a long time.
