Little California City Diablo is plagued by mysterious death after the sheriff Robert Lopez discovers an ancient box. demon. "Diablo legend" is an absolute rubbish. The film has no fear and passion, the actor is amateur and the direction is bad. Animation is the only aspect. the movie I enjoyed. I am a big fan of indie horror flicks, for example I loved "Torched", "Live Feed", "Bone Sickness" or "Neighborhood Watch", unfortunately "Legend of Diablo" is a big failure.
