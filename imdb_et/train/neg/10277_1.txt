I totally feel free. Someone has to return $ 4.95, which I spent in Blockbuster to rent this homemade crap. It's not musical, it's a complete waste of time and my evening. What can't I do is why it was first distributed? ... somebody has had to do a lot of hard medicines at night. I have seen that film schools have come out with better movies and I've been to a film school so I can say that as a fact. The quality of this work is just too bad to watch DV ...? Sufficiently said. Songs are not songs, but just beating that sounds in all sections. Want to see good music? Then DO NOT REMOVE THIS MOVI.
