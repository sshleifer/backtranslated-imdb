This film could have been very good but short. Cheesy special effects and so work. I could have seen that if the story wasn't so bad. If there was more background story, it would have been better. In the middle of the plot, there is an evil Druid witch who is connected with the woman who is receiving migraine. The movie drags and continues and never explains anything, it just continues. Christopher Walken has a part, but it's totally useless, as is most of the movie. This movie was potential but some seem to be very bad for a TV movie. I would avoid this movie.
