This film doesn't even deserve it. It was a waste of time. It was a waste of movies and money. It was not offensive, but it was all provocative and disgusting. My spoiler is what I should all read. There is complete front nudity and nasty language. But not only that there is no plot line, the actors are terrible, the accents are terrible, the actors have little time and I was even EXCITED to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I rented it was Brian van Holt (who just got the fifteenth part). I think it could have been a mistake in the heads of the managers and editors, but they repeated the same segments two or three times, adding only a new sentence. <br /> <br /> A similar movie is Eraser Head, perhaps the most annoying movie. There is no plot line and it's not funny. Although it is not trying to be funny. DO NOT SEE OUR MOVI.
