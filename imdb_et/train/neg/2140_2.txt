The mission of Assassin Hauser (John Cusak) is to break down the Middle East oil minister named Omar Sharif (Neikov) in the Turaqistan country, led by American interests. Hauser is a trade show producer so she can enter Omar. <br /> <br /> Sometimes satire can be so superfluous that it becomes the most troublesome. There is too much here: government, politics, music, war, people who are not generally recognized by society, and whether I mentioned "war". And that's what we have here - the most irritating film that borders on a very bad nightmare. I still ask why I continued with the DVD. Here are so many Cusak family members that John Cusak seems embarrassing when the family is just staying there, or is it just me? <br /> <br /> It was formerly John Cusaki's film, while a little fun, was finally pretty good. Not here. Believe that John Cusak had a hand in writing and producing this mess. Do what you want. <br /> <br /> Too much continuous gun fire, bomb attacks, and shouting in the movie, so you really can't concentrate or have that point? Probably. It takes too long to reach the result, which is largely forgotten until the last 15 minutes. In the meantime, we have a senseless beating in the painful sense. And chemistry between John Cusaki and Marisa Tormei? I don't believe it, but you know: boy? the girl's thing and they needed something more time. Yes, for what they were supposed to be, (offbeat and annoying) Duff's performances and Kingsley were good. But when I saw Dan Aykroyd's character, at the beginning of the show, sitting in the lavatory, I knew the rest of the show was going to be in the tank. I wasn't wrong. I am sure some will sing the praise of this effort, but if the rose is any other name, it will also be a mess ?????????? <br /> <br /> Remember why I continued with a DVD. I was hoping that this story would in some way save and save itself. Never. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.
