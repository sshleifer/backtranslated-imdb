I saw it recently in the old VHS tape and I remember it in the dark. Looking at it now, it looks charming. <br /> <br /> When it first appeared, it was recognized by almost everyone who came out as a gay teenager. To get the point home, the mother sees "1 teenager from 10", the most popular book of the time. David Warner hugs it as a harassing vampire hunter [= gay-hating evangelist]. The list of viewing collections and jokes that were added so that no one could pass this point would be too long. Manufacturers enjoyed the fun and hoped to be brighter and brighter. <br /> <br /> But I have no idea how teenagers watch this movie today. In some places where there is education and culture, the terrible challenges that gay teenagers had to go through are a thing of the past. But I'm sure the dark, nasty corners of our continent are as bad as ever.
