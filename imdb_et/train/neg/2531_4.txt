The title of this movie song ........... is the greatest free spirited ballad ever written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw this movie in 1978-79 when I first ordered the cable. In 1979, the cable began to change at home. (or at least when it was common here in Missouri). <br /> <br /> It may be the first movie I watched on the "Channel Channel" payment channel, called "The Star Channel", then changed the name "The Movie Channel" in the early 1980s ........ I got my "Star Channel" free month with my new cable connection. "Van" was one of those films that were very rotating online at that time. <br /> <br /> I remember this movie, and I thought it was a typical service (in the same direction as other middle-aged servants ...) those where the plot revolves around nudity and parties. <br /> <br /> I completely forgot that this movie still existed until I saw this movie again after I saw it for decades (I found it on a DVD that was sold cheaply in the trash). I knew it and bought it for just $ 4.99. is). But despite this, it was a different experience than it is now (30+ years later). <br /> <br /> It was fun to see that children read music, smoking and weeding of weeds and proud of their backs (often all at the same time). This is what a good service party movie should be. <br /> <br /> There is not much plot besides the fact that the main character fantasizes sex with his arch rivals good looking girlfriend ... she blows all of her college savings prices to buy Dodge Van (shag carpets. mirrored ceiling) and the bottom of the water) to get his attention and eventually have sex with him. However, his arch rival discovers and searches for him (so these two can solve their differences with their racing cars) .... he and his competitor will finish both their vans and stealing his arch rivals girlfriend, he will win the heart preppy (less attractive) girl that she party / ass dates through most of the movie and she decides she is happier / better and the movie ends. <br /> <br /> The movie has funny moments. But watching this movie 30+ years later, it becomes more a memory card. Because I still remember the pizza parlors, pinball games, also brought back memories of riding around a small town when we smoked the pot, as we shouted at good-looking girls and hoped to put on (sometimes I was happy and somewhat decent looking for a girl to share with me and we we turn the back of the back, I remember many songs in this move (if they were new) ...... this movie is the perfect time capsule for these issues (brought many memories) <br /> <br /> what this movie has depicted that I do not remember honestly, is .... I never remember the time when full-size vans were remembering this era very well, and I don't want young men who want to have a commercial, instead of remembering The 70s young men (including) who want Pontiac Trans Am, Chevy Camaro or the hot rod Ford Mustang, but never, this movie makes it seem like vans are the most popular and that every young man wanted it (which just wasn't right for this era)
