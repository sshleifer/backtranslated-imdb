This is the most useless comment I've ever put down, but I have to do this to warn you about the fear of "Freddy's Dead". Not only is it the worst chapter of a nightmare, it is also the slowest horror trail there! It was boring, pointless and almost deadly. The terrible 3-D end and the top CORNY kill enough to drive this "movie" to the ground. But it doesn't stop there, just add bad performance, a terrible script and several cheesy cameos and you have this bunch of pile guanos! No wonder why Freddy, as always played by Robert Englund, has made two postmortem performances. Even when I went out. It's just a fan movie, don't look at our shame.
