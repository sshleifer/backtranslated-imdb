I have to say that I was a big fan of the series. The first 3 were great and others were their moments, but this new BETA HOUSE is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's shameful because it was a great series and it just gets worse. I know they're made for DVD movies, but some effort would be nice. <br /> <br /> Not laughing, but a few good one-liners that bring a smile. There's pretty nudity and very hot chicks. But neither sexy stuff nor jokes really work. <br /> <br /> Add all that it is also a movie RACIST or a movie racist that can be done without being called racist. I am not one of those people who think that everything should be politically correct. However, portraying minorities is very offensive. <br /> <br /> I don't waste this garbage. See previous versions, they make you laugh not sick.
