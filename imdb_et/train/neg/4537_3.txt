I really didn't enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the camp and we didn't rob it, we laughed at it. Of course, some parts concern, but action is terrible, the consequences are terrible, and the overall film idea is terrible (now, I know it was based on a book that I haven't read, but I hope the book was better than that, frankly I thought that this movie was very bad and boring). As I said, I went to the camp with a lot of people, and we were glad to be there, and I also got a caffeine drink, but still I was awake to stay awake. The only thing that kept me (except for my fear when I woke up was that I was blurry), which was pretty pointless. I just didn't like it.
