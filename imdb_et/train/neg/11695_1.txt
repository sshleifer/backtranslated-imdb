Calling a movie like "Thinner" bad is like calling a land circle or Pauly Shore un-talented. There is no news, but how they got this way is what people want to know. <br /> <br /> As for this movie .... The book was good, even if it was some other "Be careful what you want" genre. Burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills a Gypsy daughter and hugs her father (Constantine TV from Room 222) up to several pounds a day. <br /> <br /> As I said, it starts with a good one, but why involve a mobster (Mantegna)? Why shoot automatic weapons so much? Why make this something so heavily dependent on FX? I thought it would have been much more effective if it focused more on the subtle consequences of weight loss craes, diseases, death, gypsy animals and the like. <br /> <br /> But no, it doesn't have to be. Remember, this is Stephen King, which we are talking about. <br /> <br /> And it ends ... almost the same as the book, but a little too talkative. In fact, the whole movie is too much, feeling that it has to explain the appeal of each plot to us. Not that I was waiting for a "dead zone", but I could have done it without another "pet", which is also due. <br /> <br /> One letter at least tries to make a semi-proper make-up. But the rest of the movie is left ... tell me ... "Solvent."
