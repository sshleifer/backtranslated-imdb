That's why Jay Leno himself does not recognize this film. It's consistently one of the worst films ever. Operation is terrible, the script has no direction, and the director doesn't seem to be sure how to take this movie. "Friend", "action / comedy", "mystery". It seems halfway through, he gives up and is just down the road. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated performers. It is a disgrace that they wasted their time and gifts by making this film confusing. Before joining Jay Leno and Pat Morita, they had spent years running their craft in the Hollywood circle. Mr. Morita was already a star of his own, constantly working since the mid-1960s as a cult TV and film classics like "Happy Days" and a shameless but pleasant "Mr. T and Tina". And won American hearts with his role as a powerful movie "Midway", "Karate Kid" and many others. Mr. Leno is seen in TV shows from the mid-1970s. And was a top compiler in American comedy clubs. He's seen countless TV shows and great movies. The shame is that they agreed to see this nonsense.
