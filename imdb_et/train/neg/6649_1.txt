OK, anyone who can honestly say that this movie was big or even good is either misleading or knows the director, writer, and producers, and is trying to increase the buzz of this movie. I watched the movie because my friend was working on it and it was terrible. I am an actor and have worked in the industry for some time on big films and even on independent persons, and this film missed me tears. The reason I am so tough is that this film was clearly different: "Mice and Men" and they should dig, because it is such a horrible story. In the industry where Hollywood seems to be bankrupt creatively ... for someone who takes the classic book and "Of Mice and Men" and destroys this new spin, I get so many mistakes. The actors, accents, dialogue and direction were amateur and writing was frustrating. I mean, if you intend to take a new spin to an existing story, make sure it's as good or better than the original to make a new spin justifiable. I didn't like this movie.
