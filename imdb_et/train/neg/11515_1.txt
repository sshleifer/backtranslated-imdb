and forget about it. Completely. If you really need to see Madonna's actions, rent a "body of evidence", at least Willem Defoe is in it. <br /> <br /> In this movie, although the sets are beautiful, you can silence the dialog. You're not leaving anything behind. Bruce Greenwood is wasted, Jeanne Tripplehorn is in proportion and Madonna is so terrible, it becomes fun. Why they had to incarnate the original film into this mess, I never know; I think they thought it was "bankable". Madonna, as an actor, is NOT sure. <br /> <br /> If you rent the original movie from 1979, you will enjoy it and its participants can actually act. 1/10.
