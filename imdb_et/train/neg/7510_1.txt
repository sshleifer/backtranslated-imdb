The film is a collection of clich√©s that are almost there. It has no attention, no goals, no real message. Symbolism is postponed and stereotypes are abundant and outrageous. This film cannot resist the temptation to make a drama, if not. Every little change of conversation immediately becomes a long, unjustified dialogue that is so typical of a classical exercise. If there is no content for such an exchange, the participants (no matter how good they are usually) cannot help but compensate for the exaggerated emotions, namely "raising the stakes". To act, just to say. Leadership doesn't help here. Nothing saves this story. It's forced, fake and tears dull. Inaccuracies in portaraying punk rock with The Who, Flight and flashy 90's outfits. Characters are erroneous without role, detail and motive. Locations are arbitrary. This is Boogie Nights cum The Good Fellas cum on Saturday night fever, meaning and art ripped out. <br /> <br /> Good DP. I'll give it that way. <br /> <br /> Some movies have errors. This movie is Lee's mistake. He sold out like others. Being irrelevant. He no longer has any interest in saying more. <br /> <br /> I don't want to see anything about this man anymore (I will not be named).
