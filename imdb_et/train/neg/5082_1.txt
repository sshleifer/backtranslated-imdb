It is very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop making movies. They get worse every time. Niki and Flo (2003) are under pressure from the camera. Unfortunately, the films that are made in Romania every year are sent to the worst abroad (eg Chicago International Film Festival). This movie without a plot, exhibition or script is a waste of time and money. Price: 0.02 out of 10.
