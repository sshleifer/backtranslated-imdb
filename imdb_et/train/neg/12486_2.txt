Rich ditzy Joan Winfield (funny failed Bette Davis) is dealing with foolish egotical Allen Brice marriage (Jack Carson is missing). His father (Eugene Palette) has decided to stop the marriage and is abducted by pilot Steve Collins (James Cagney. Seriously). They attack the land in the desert and hate each other, but (sighs) are falling in love. <br /> <br /> It seems that this gives the evaluators a high rating only because Cagney and Davis are in it. They were both great actors, but they were known for the comedy of NOT dramas and this movie shows why! The script is just terrible - the whole movie doesn't have a real smile. The current joke is Cagney and Davis, who fall over the first cactus (this is done three times!). Only their remarkable talents will save them completely humiliated. As they both do their best with the sad material. Cagney is trying his best lines and Davis is driving every line of power, but it doesn't work. Carson has this "what the hell" on his face throughout the film (probably because his characters' emotions change in seconds). The only palette that has its own special voice and top reading mango to bring a few smiles. All in all, it was boring and ridiculous - a real chore to sit. It gets two stars only for Cagney and Davis actors and beautiful cinematographs, but in fact - it's not worth it. Cagney and Davis hated this movie in later years and see why.
