It is obviously a lot of people, but I found this infantilization and reasonably offensive codswallop stored in Jane Russell's unforgettable unforgettable musical number, especially the opener (but some inventions have been observed later). I can't get to Monroe - he should play a foolish blonde who's not that stupid, but he's just going to be so stupid. Russell can't be quite convinced when he says he has never been to a high school, but otherwise it's pretty wonderful. Men are stagnantly uninteresting, just like the plot. Under no circumstances is it terrifying, but so splitting that if it is classic, God will help us all.
