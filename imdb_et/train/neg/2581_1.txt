First of all, to get your personal feelings about how I promise to start by saying that I hate so-called comedies, where every symbol is written and played so stupid that you collect when they are all due to kinship. /> <br /> Now I say that I saw the first three American Pie films and although they weren't the most amazing movies I've ever seen, they were all fine (and direct masterpieces compared to the three "American Pie Presents" movies), I'm still forced to ask what the hell are they thinking about making this movie? <br /> <br /> I have some other questions. <br /> <br /> Who thought it was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources? <br /> <br /> Who approved the final script (and what did this person smoke when approved)? And finally, why did anyone think he deserved entry into theaters, with an average entrance cost of $ 10-15 depending on where you live, if he had been directly blocked by Blockbuster or Wal Mart? <br /> <br /> There's so much wrong about this movie that I can't write this in-depth review because it would exceed the maximum allowed words in this forum, so I just touch the biggest things wrong with it. <br /> <br /> The plot is general, but not buggy and stupid and the characters are all about as interesting as looking at the paint for eighty minutes, but the biggest thing I see wrong with this movie is While most cast is talented, there is no name that is probably forgotten in a few years, <br /> <br /> one and only big name in this movie is Eugene Levy who spends almost all the time on the screen, knowing his face, smiling, telling the viewer: "I know it's not funny and I'm wasting my talents, but hey I'm paying for who cares" he doesn't even try to make fun funny (he deserves better than this rubbish). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, most of the other cast is terrible, although some of them have been in some very big television shows, Tyrone Savage (from the classic Canadian Wind At My Back) is played by a person who is so unbearably unlikely and irritating. (there are things he could teach about tropical skin diseases) that you almost want him to die on the screen slowly and painfully, Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) just hangs around the screen and destroying the waste he has on this film. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the next movie in this series is just a soft core porn that has the story that they can get MPAA over and get the R rating this movie goes all out for nonsense nudity vulgarity and meaningless offencive sexual content that he would have received an X rating (rating on board must be drunk or drugs when they looked at this movie's rating). <br /> <br /> It is interesting that twenty-five years ago, when Wes Craven gave Nightmare On Elm a rating review for MPAA, they forced him to cut twenty-five seconds of material (I believe it was part of the death scene, having chest silicone casting) to avoid getting the X rating and had no choice but to do it or not to release the movie, <br /> <br /> the unnecessarily offensive trash can get R-rating today because it's all made comedy in the name of this film was a drama or horror movie with such content, it would have been content over a tremendous smell and it would be scared The last thing that greatly disturbs me is writing, this movie is written to play like a dream of a twelve year old child an extremely overactive sexual imagination, which is a fairly minor and extraordinary crass, almost every exposure situation that should move the body in this film invites the plot so telegraph that every intelligent viewer sees eb this miles away and the so-called characters are stereotypes of stereotypes about stereotypes, never like sex behaviors and constant unnecessary scenes, which are remote sexual behaviors, it seems that this movie is written in some incompetent first year hacking in a small rental movie school script writing class. <br /> <br /> Long and short it's time to kill this series before he gets more stupider crass and offensive, this pie is full of tea.
