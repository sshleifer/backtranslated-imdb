An amazingly unlikely and silly potboiler with at least some redundant, crisp location photography, but it's too unbelievable to create a lot of tension. I was hoping that Stanwyck wouldn't do it in time, because he was really wet, more than one spouse, and he was also an idiot of the child ... But the frustrating question remains ... what kind of wood was what the mule supported, when its rotten piece pulled out, didn't it swim? Stanwyck, which is always an impeccable professional, does the best he can with the material, but it's complicated.
