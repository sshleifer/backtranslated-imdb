This film tells a police officer (Ching Wan Lau) who is trying to reach a super-smart (Ekin Cheng) who sends an insurance company led by Kelly Lin. Basically, whatever plans the policeman tries early, they know them in advance. This film, which is covered by leading actors, beautiful actors and good camera images of Hong Kong scenes, has no content at all. It is all lightning and the flash quickly turns dim. I lost all my interests on a third of the film and after that there is no quality of redemption except for cinematography that looks good. Consider viewing this movie only if you can do it for free. Also, consider stopping the movie for 20 minutes in the movie because it is the same as ending with: BORING. 6/10
