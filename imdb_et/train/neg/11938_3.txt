The film started well enough. It had a companion, hit by a glowing green meteorite, receiving superpowers (telecoms, X-rays, vulnerability, flight, ability to talk to dogs, superspeed, thermal vision and the ability to make plants big and fast), fighting crime. From there it is all downhill. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man gets a costume from his mother, fights with the gangs of the inhabitants, and has many interrupted meetings with gang leaders to help you disappoint. and stupefying ends. <br /> <br /> It would not be as remarkable as it would be to watch a boxing game where two fighters pretended to hit each other while the audience was watching while the fighters were just continuing to dance. <br /> <br /> Despite this pointlessness, the film has good points. This clearly confirms that if you try to take the gang alone, they will come back home and hurt you. It says that gangs and communities must see their real enemies (great bosses who use their ghetto to break down the honest people with their ends). It is also noted that people do not need super-heroes when they are ready to work as a community, destroying the injurious predators. The only message he really does not have is that voters should ensure that their elected officials (Rudolph Giulian, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and George H. W. Bush) are not too cheaters. <br /> <br />
