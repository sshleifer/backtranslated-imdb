I have not been able to decide whether this film is so bad that it is good, or to quote Enid Coleslaw, "so bad that it is good and bad again." No matter, it forced me to look the same as weird colored vomiting, and it offers many scenes that you don't even want to forget. There's a sneering young Ray Liotta who tells Pia that her creative trophy looks like a penis. A little later, Ray is there again, torturing Piat, not a trophy with the right shape, but with a hose. There's a definite chinned Pia who tells her dominant mother she wants to sleep with Ray's geezer father Walter. There is an actress in the tomb who puts the best line written by Pia or someone else: "WWWWHHHYYYYYYY!" This garden hose is back, because Walter waves this Pia's face and roars "Is it more pleasant for you!?" There's Pia and her date so that each other's close areas split the salad so that they start tearing each other's clothes. There's Pia in the shower, but forgetting to remove her dress. Perhaps the best thing is there is a Pia typewriter, but instead of the keys there are their miniature speakers who have tortured him the most (after that I was afraid to open my laptop). And finally, Pia at "The Awards", which puts Hollywood on what it is, because it's the second best line, "I think I'm not the only one who has ever considered **** its way to the top "I see I've spent more time commenting on" Lonely Lady "when I have much better pictures so I finish. Be warned, however, that if you look, you may not take your eyes off the screen until two hours of your life has been lost forever.
