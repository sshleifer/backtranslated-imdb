Ah, the spirit of '68. The streets of Paris were wild with rebellion, the hippies were high in the spirit of love. How did Britain celebrate the age of this radicalism and revolution? Erm, by its appearance, was an expensive old Blighty who focused on making movies in boys' schools. If ... contains an evil body. It includes an oppressed uprising.

Instead of testifying to the dissident zeitgeist of the sixties, he can only succeed in the corrupted document of the top-class British education. Anarchy? Apathy likes more, the only person many viewers want to watch after watching ... is Lindsay Anderson.
