This movie is a joke. I mean funny jokes. Why? Because the only redeeming thing was that I smiled for a nonsense, ugly plot and terrible behavior. Wow! <br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions inside this movie, for example; why do these women get zombies and how? Why are there four black women who are zombie "caregivers" and what is their purpose? Since when 6 people form "people" zombies? And has the black eye mascara "scary" to anyone, everywhere? Even 2 years old? <br /> <br /> And finally; Why has this movie ever been made? Why? why? why? No answer? That's what I thought. <br /> <br /> In the claim channel, they actually gave this comment after the movie summary: we apologize for this movie beforehand "LOL. At least they had a lot!"
