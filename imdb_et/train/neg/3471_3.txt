this film had more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck has NOT seriously attempted to act in any way, shape or form. She sucked directly. Nothing about the film was credible. The first problems were in the introduction, where the man gives everything to the Salvation Christmas carols, but it does not show why. And then grandmother is truly beautiful in her head and has nothing to do with the film - it's not even the same tone as film. Ben Affleck's motivation to choose the house he chose was not explained; his chosen family did not find any plausible reactions; and people will go here and there without any reason to push them down (Example: Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck's characters are moving down the slope suddenly - this is a case that makes her suddenly fall in love.) was a funny moment or two - but they were rare in the movie. It needed serious second rewriting (or 4). Hope you enjoy!
