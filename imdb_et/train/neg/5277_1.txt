I hit this Showtime tonight and I was surprised at how such a film with such an interesting assumption could be so incredibly horrible. WHO IS WITH ISSI? Brandon Davis, who has been accepted by senior school Chris Hughes, is a geek who suppresses the legacy of pornography left by his biological parents. While the assumption that the film may be a lot of fun is that it has destroyed the first-time director Andy Fickman, the clich√© and the unfair management led by the foreseeable scenario, and the operation of direct video standards is even bad. Even the usual funny Charlie Talbert is surprisingly shameful as the best friend. Ali Landry is this flat and ununny dud the only good part. 1/10
