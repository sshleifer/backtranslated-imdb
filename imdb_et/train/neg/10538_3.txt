The first power (1990) was a terrible film that came out in the late 1980s / early 90s in a period of cheap horror films. I found this movie very boring but very fun. This film lacks the meaning and credibility that it is not even funny. The quick justice system of this movie makes it weak compared to Texas. Lou Diamond Phillips is in this role over his head (he plays a hard-boiled cop) and Tracey Griffith (Melanie's more attractive sister) plays psychic. Don't waste your time because it's bad. What a minute, I'll take it back. This movie makes a great party party. Look at the packing nun of the switch-over crypts, he has the most beautiful legs I've seen at Nun, who was not a Franco nunsploitation flick on Jesus. Yeow! <br /> <br /> This is L.D.P. His star was faded and could not drag the flies. It was D.T.V. to him until his "resource" in a few years. <br /> <br /> Not recommended if you are not desperate.
