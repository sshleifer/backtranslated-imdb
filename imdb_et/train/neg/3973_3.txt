Action was weak, but with horror glowing I can live when the story is good. It wasn't. The original event was a cumbersome and obvious idea to take advantage of the worship of most people. Okay, well. Quickly advance to a "place in the country" where they emotionally recover. I like the ghost revelation. Okay, cool - this is a supernatural horror story where rotting things are partially in our world ... wherever. Then the action begins to shrink like a three-speed dog in the swelling of cats and birds - is it a bad force trying to attack them directly? Is it an evil force that tries to attack them directly - to make people terrible things that they don't really do? Wait, wait, no, maybe the whole REGION is a psychological echo chamber where the surrounding mismatch can kill you? Okay, wait - maybe it's just one little mentally confused "Delbert"-style redhead boy who leaves his mommy and has some kind of horror like K-Tel Norman Bates? Oh, yes - extra points: the only black character seems to be the "Our Gang" pullman's grandson. The actor plays it as straight as he can give a hesitant dialogue, but the fact is that his goal is to "do everything to get betta out, Boss!" At least they wrote him wise enough to get out of the GTF. Little, when the little girl was silenced and pulled, was definitely horrible, as was the chick boy. These were just two delicious tidbits of such a movie. The problem is that they are combined in dishonest ways, such as frying bites, chocolate bites, and Gumm's bite bites. Each of them is great, but it's mixed? Bleah! Such a potential. Streaked.
