Another cult will hit again. It's not a spoiler, because REAL ends after you study people who brought this too long, pseudo-commercial commercial ... Ramtha School of Enlightenment. <br /> <br /> If you need to hide some religion / philosophy behind the screen of OZ-like fraud, I walk. I thank Ramthat I looked at the borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a "friend" ... so that this New-Age lobotomizer would have wasted valuable resources. I can only hope that they "believe they can walk with the water" to make this guide a "logical" conclusion ... in other words; walk, sink ... or shut down :-) As a film ... it deserves a strong "1" in the value of this entertainment, especially in creating the worst character of film history (photographer's roommate ... eeeeeek!). If you need to see this movie, borrow it from one brainwasher who suggested it.
