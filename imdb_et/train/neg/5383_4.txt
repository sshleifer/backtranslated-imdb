I think I should start by saying that almost every work style can be fun. The real test is whether it is good from start to finish, which is why I gave this review a similar title. Most of us would agree - even those like me who enjoy reading many blogs - that blogs cannot be compared for good novel writing for many reasons. Similarly, FEM cannot compare good film making for a number of reasons and I believe it is a bad example of independent filmography. From start to finish, FEM feels like a vlog. (Heck, even MySpace gets pimping.) If I wanted to see an hour lonelygirl15 - I didn't - I'd go see it. FEM, although certainly higher than the above-mentioned media bubble atmosphere, is so personal that it is not an interesting story. It's like watching life's sensitivity to life, which in my opinion is mostly agreed, very naturally boring. But the creators of FEM want us to praise it, their very postmodern movie about film making. Stop my awakening. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I don't have to worry about that. I'm shocked that I am really interested in writing this journal. It is not that FEM is totally bad because it is not; it has a few moments when I smile or think maybe maybe something might happen. Rather, it's just ... mediocre. I feel so indifferent about it that it is almost an oxymoron installation: passionate indifference. I hope that the creators of the film / "participants" get out of their efforts. They probably need it when one of them moves out and moves on with life. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you have time to waste and something you want to do; Otherwise, give it over and don't worry that you have missed some great, undetected talents. You really are not.
