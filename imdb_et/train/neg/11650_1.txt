After leaving the first one, you think the road brothers could come out with some new jokes. Although I don't think so. If the first one was not bad enough, it is just so bad that it is painful. With all the participants they found in this movie, you think they could do a little smarter. Though they couldn't, they had to take all the same dirty, not funny jokes first, and put it somehow in this movie to make people laugh again. Though the thing is that I didn't start laughing for the first time. They tried to make these films into parodies, even though they failed at every level. For the most part, it's just a randomly inserted joke that is so nasty and dirty that it's hard to watch and enjoy. Then when they try to make scenes that are movie parades, they finally make a 20-minute vacation from the scene, maybe having a joke all over the scene. Also for people who say it is not meant for an older and real young audience, I also fit well into the age group for which it should be funny. While people say that different people have different ideas that are funny or not, then if you find it funny, then you are probably not one of the more mature or intelligent people. It doesn't take as much skill to write such a script, though if you want a smarter and more fun movie, check out Spaceballs. It's a movie parody that is really good and well done, and it doesn't have to use nasty and dirty jokes.
