I couldn't watch it for more than 14 minutes. This is a very bad behavior and really bad management. The shots used are disgusting, they cut off a 180 degree angle all the time. My head is trying to look at this "know what" load. The dirt in the "Mystery Machine" window sees the illumination of windows ... annoying. What else ... it's so badly framed all the time, it's just that you want to scream into the leading lady. I only managed short films, but I'm pretty sure I'd be better off managing a feature film .... the story is incredible, just a long French kissing that is just beginning to say it's pretty terrible. So much, try to avoid it for bad movies at all costs, saving 5 dollars for rent and 1 hour 30 hours of your life never going back ...
