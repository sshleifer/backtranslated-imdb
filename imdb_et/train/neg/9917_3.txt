When Stanwyck's husband is killed on the eve of his wedding, he comes down to the mountain house where he slips (sort of) from the rock and saves the wealthy lawyers Morgan. Morgan loves him, surely bringing a one-sided marriage, spending a big mansion in Chicago (which seems to be surrounded by mountains!). Stanwyck is tempted by Cortez, but eventually he returns to Morgan with a very weak and convincing story. <br /> <br /> This movie has a great deal (especially Morgan is one of my favorites) and a big director, but the script is inclined and sometimes seems pointless. I was so ready to enjoy this movie, but I was finally disappointed. It is also worth the cast, and it is suitable for anyone who loves 1930s movies.
