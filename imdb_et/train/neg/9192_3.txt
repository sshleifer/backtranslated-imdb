I found this movie in the "horror" of my video store. This seems to make sense since most zombie movies are out there. Romero's 'dead' trilogy up to 28 days later. But while you watch it, you can quickly see what this movie really is. <br /> <br /> It's actually a music video that is moving faster and more and more. There are no people here terribly. Just a few semi-properly staged action scenes that will soon get tired because they will last ... and the last ... and the last ... and you will soon feel that you have a DVD player accidentally returned 3 minutes ago, but they didn't do the movie. Damage. I think somebody could find a better use of the $ 7 million in the film industry than do one-off. Although some of the 360 ​​effects were cool, but they were used again and they grew annoying because it was once again and again the same stunt, just different in nature. <br /> <br /> Also, what ROYALLY is annoying is splicing material stored in arcade games. I have played. It sucks. Why did they put it here? Oh, that's right, it's not a movie, it's a music video, and it's poor. Rated R: A lot of violence / anger and embarrassment
