Every year, I watch hundreds of movies, including many low-budget amateur DVDs that nobody ever wants to see. I've seen thousands of movies of my time, many great, many forgotten. Zombie Nation I remember forever as one of the most hopelessly ridiculous "horror films" I've ever seen? In fact, I still have not recovered from this experience of viewing. <br /> <br /> The next day, it seems like a weird dream. Did I really see what I thought? Why does the police work out of the warehouse? Did the voodoo priests really recommend that zombies eat cheese burgers? Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe? <br /> <br /> I wouldn't like Zombie Nation if you want to see a good movie and I don't recommend it "both halbana and good". However, if you are entertaining, if you are probably looking for the most secure movie ever? this is for you. Now, when someone asks me what is the worst film I've ever seen, I say Zombie Nation. <br /> <br /> Seriously? I think this is a bigger crime to make a boring movie bad, and Ulli Lommel deserves credit for making the film that actually hits you. He's really a digital era by Ed Wood Jr. And I can't wait to see if he makes the second film so ridiculously ridiculous as that.
