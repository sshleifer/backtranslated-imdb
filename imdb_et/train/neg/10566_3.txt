Although I read myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 TV series, the original film that introduced the series was a weak start. Although many of the series later mature and more convincing elements exist, the pace of collection is slow, the makeup is somewhat inadequate, and the plot is confused. Worse still, the performance of the premiere episode is bad. Although the rating scheme shows that many fans are willing to ignore these problems, I remember that Gathering has almost turned me off, which soon grew into a grand series.
