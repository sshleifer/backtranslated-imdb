I gave it three stars out of a possible 10 - because the stories are open and left inexplicable, and because someone who eats extremely disgusting eats insecure, and the splitting body scenes. <br /> <br /> Neither of the above had to be shown in such a graphical way. <br /> <br /> The film's graph, as it is, touches on three loosely interconnected stories, none of which can be reached satisfactorily <br /> <br /> The bounty hunter played by Bruce Dern is a character that unites all three vignettes. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have Dylan McDermott, who deliberately sought out a criminal, fleeing to Mexico to escape both the law and the honey as he travels through a border town and carries an evil-looking cabin girl played by Helen Hunt. <br /> <br /> Then we have one of Hemingway's girls not sure which of those who play western women on the lonely border, who goes to the neighbor's wife, has been an attractive redhead we will soon realize is too bad in the mountains. <br /> <br /> The movie's summary comes back to the bounty hunter and what happens to him, with the last scene in the movie being within reasonable limits.
