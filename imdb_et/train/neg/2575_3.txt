It is not compatible with Cagliostro Castle. Lupine is neither funny nor nervous or hyperactive. The landscape and music are endless and the plot just isn't interesting. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this is the unique (only uncut version) offered by Fujiko. It helped some tedious scenes. CoC had an amazing villain and created a movie for some imaginative sets. The locations of TSoTG are not very vivid or interesting. <br /> <br /> Zenigata, Goemon, and Jigen do not even offer good entertainment this time. It's like fulfilling a contractual obligation. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in full frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a good number of additives, including quite a few trailers. But one curious thing. When a player is entered, there is no chapter on the disc or time code. While using the remote control, you can still move to the next scene number.
