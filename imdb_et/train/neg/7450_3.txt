I've seen this movie in the cinema many years ago and one thing surprised me so badly that I didn't see any redeeming virtues in the movie. two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was cast as a bad guy, but most of the viewers' imaginations didn't get far enough to believe in that role. Also Jared Leto was not a believer as a former medical student. The tensions were not there because the killer was very early. Again, Finale was not dramatic or tense: no one around me worried about what would happen next. All we could expect was the end of the movie. All in all, the cinema is a disappointing evening.
