I was so disturbed by the real film at the beginning of the movie that I felt sick on my stomach and finished the movie. How can someone give this film more than one rating that bothers me. I know the purpose of the film is shock, but it shows the actual material from a live skinned dog (keeping vomiting back when I write) - PLEASE! I closed this scene with a decomposing child. I had had eyes for most of the time until then. No wonder this movie was found in the HMV package. I really have no desire to see this Uwe person in another movie. Anyone who enjoys it needs treatment. Period.
