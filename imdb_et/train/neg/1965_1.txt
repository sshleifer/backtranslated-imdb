Stephen J. Cannell apparently decided a few years ago that he would broaden his horizons and horror. The result, "Dead Above Ground," is a debilitating part of the junk. Now that I have noticed her name with this particular movie, I would have brought it back, but no, I didn't have glasses and so I miss it, hell, I really have to go with them to accompany me to the video. The first question would be who is the target audience? It's almost like a "scary" children's film, but then there are topless babes and some gore and some bad words here and there. The main characters are so cute that you want to see somebody, follow them with SOME farm tools. It looks like a man opens a bed and breakfast with a squared past, a child's murderous witch who collected children's teeth. Probably something the realtor mentioned. Of course, nowadays, there is a little ghost of girls to warn a real little girl who now lives there, something bad happens. It exists and there are also two Bubbat who crawled over this property when the new owner took over so that they could retaliate. All of this is a feeling of some of the cable junk made for Halloween children, except of course things that are not suitable for small children, so it's not only mediocre, but also confused. For Anchor Bay to display it, it is a big and lift, given their usual results with fine release, this is a new low. United Kingdom Gets Phantasm Box Set, Get The Tooth Fairy. Hardly seems fair. 1 out of ten, absolute rubbish.
