I have no idea why they made this "persuasion" version if they already had this little mini-series with Amanda Roots and Ciaran Hinds. I think they wanted to make a full-length version, but of course I had to delete a lot; Unfortunately, what ended up on the floor of the cutting room was all a lovely spirit and humor, leaving the film, which was rather a melodrama, than an amusing display of English state arrangements and mores. <br /> <br /> The characters were also low and uninteresting. They had a poor Anne who shared the streets after Captain Wentworth like a silly contemporary youngster (and if you're a stupid contemporary young man who reads it, let me tell you: running after the warming of male animals is NOT warm). This is something that a well-bred woman of the Napoleonic era would never have done, and certainly not a high-level heroine. <br /> <br /> Some have said they found this antics ridiculous; my reaction was not laughing, it was annoyance. Austen's idea of ​​such corruption is still contemptuous. <br /> <br /> It was strange.
