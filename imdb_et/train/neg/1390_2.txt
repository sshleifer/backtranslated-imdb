I'm a big fan of B5, I was only at the end of the third season. I watched carefully all the previous seasons when this syndicate was, concluding that it was one of the most thoughtful stories that ever hit television. Even stuffing episodes were interesting. Movies, too, were well produced and entertaining as something to capture theaters. <br /> <br /> What brings us to the "river of souls". Of course, I had great expectations after everything else. Martin Sheen seems to be acting in Ed Wood rather than a serious Sci-Fi story. The story itself could have been good in visual form, even a story for the board. However, it obviously suffers when it was time to make this concept a two-hour film. There are no special effects that would keep us entertained if there is no compelling story. There are places where they were obviously time-consuming and just improvised the dialogue to complete the story. If it had been done in a regular season, it would be rated as one of the worst episodes.
