Again, Canadian television repeats itself and creates a new exhibition that will fail after its premiere. The last time I remember, sitcomid had to call up the reaction that we laughed at. How funny are all white people who think all Muslims are terrorists? OK maybe one of the fun just to stick to the mass. But not 30 minutes. It's called beating a dead horse. Even the SNL would like to give up after business. <br /> <br /> These scripts also have little contradiction. Can he serve cucumber sandwiches to break Ramadan's fast? When does Ramadan begin? Ohhhhh is this Emmy winning stuff. <br /> <br /> And characters! What characters? These are all cardboard clippings that have nothing interesting that we would like to follow them from one situation. This is a point of comedy in the situation. We need to have strong, interesting and dynamic signs so that we can always draw attention to the TV every week. We need to look after these signs to worry about the problems they will face next week. If I don't see these signs, it's too early. Fortunately, I do not remember any of their names (note to the CBC - this is not a good sign). <br /> <br /> And the actor is so cute. It is rather a casting problem than the actors. None of these people reflect the characters they play. They just seem to be acting as if they were working on a weekly movie. Sitcoms demand that characters who live and breathe this character make us fall in love with them - when they become inseparable from the image image. See any American sitcom and see how easily identifiable characters are. The problem is that the participants seem to be dealing with this project as if it were a platform for bigger and better things, instead of being one of the great lives they will be depicting over the next 8 years. This unusualness between the characters and the project shows. But to be honest, given the flat concept and terrible writing, there is not much for the actors, but they say their traits and try not to get into the furniture. As the other commentator says, it seems to be a TV movie and not a sitcom. <br /> <br /> And there is control or absence! What I can say is that there are so many talents in Canada, see what the comedy channel does with the dolls that kill and kill. Watch the Trailer Park Boys (not a big helium dog because of the movie). Look at any American exhibition to see the potential of our talent because many of our stars go to find decent work. <br /> <br /> Give CBC credit, they really know how to create unofficial advertising disclosure. Remember "One"? No - well, even in this show, there are no signs of learning names, because it is sure to go on the dodo track. <br /> <br /> We all hope that ACTRA will strike a full hit so that something like this occurs in Ceebe for a long time.
