This movie was sucked. Functional sucked, script sucked and film sucked. The film had two yarns that were not developed and the viewer had to do a little work to find out what was going on. <br /> <br /> I am not saying it needs to be specified, but maybe you will find things that happen and say if you have the slightest idea what they are. Examples: <br /> <br /> Heroine negative comments about the hero. The viewer has never been shown how he even knows the guy and how he is related to the death of his groom. The viewer also has minimal exposure to a man's death. <br /> <br /> There is also a scene where there are a lot of boys who load up and throw machine guns, and that's all you see before cutting into other scenes. There is no explanation of the weapons and the people involved. <br /> <br /> We gave it 3 because we didn't feel like we'd be back. While watching the movie, it was a funny movie, so it gave us at least some entertainment. ;-)
