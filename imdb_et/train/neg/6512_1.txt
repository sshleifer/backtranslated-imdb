Without any kind of filmmaking and documentary health assessment, I can honestly say that I was angry to effortlessly sit all 20 days long. I don't waste my time on the plot, you can read other comments. I say, the Berkowitz hyper, Woody Allen's story was extremely annoying. You either wanted him to take coffee or eat some soothing substance. And it may be obvious to Berkowitz that this film was a bad idea because its parts describe his documents for documentation. Forgive me for hiding the insults, but I confess to Berkowitz that he has the skills to convince an idiot to fund this terrible money. I appreciate the boundaries and intentions of the film here, but even with the standards set by Berkowitz for myself, it comes down to fire and stays at all levels. Finally, I am sure that many of these female companions were not easily gone with the filmmaker of the time, and therefore I doubt the sense of authenticity of the film. Hi Myles, I loved my movie the first time I saw it ... when it appeared as a Seinfeld episode or was a film directed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
