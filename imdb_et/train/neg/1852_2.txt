Who made this movie must do it jokingly. I mean, it was a stupian movie I think I've ever seen! A killer snowman terrorizing a small town? Leave me alone. Love it when it is driving. More like a comedy than a horror movie. If you want to laugh, rent it. If you really want a horror movie, leave hell away from it!
