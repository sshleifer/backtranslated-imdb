I admit that my review is from 2006, nearly 30 years after this film was made and during this concept, it can be a brilliant horror / thriller movie. <br /> <br /> Since Halloween night in 1968, 6-year-old Michael puts his 18-year-old sister into a brutal murder. Michael is committed to a spiritual institution and 15 years later flees and returns to murder his hometown. <br /> <br /> From that moment on, it is clear that the film follows a basic and rudimentary path, which is very predictable. The beginning of each scene is easily predictable as it ends, while the music of each scene containing Michael (the murderer) is exactly the same throughout the film, warning the viewer of likely events. <br /> <br /> For fear / thriller enthusiasts, there is a serious lack of blood / gore compared to today's movies, although I am not similar to the amount shown for that day and age. A happy medium could have been found. <br /> <br /> A half-hour movie is not one scene unexpected. Fear / thriller action is quite typical of the era, and there is no punch in today's enthusiast. <br /> <br /> The film has positive camera shots and dark lighting that creates a terrifying atmosphere. Another positive thing would be the nature of Michael's doctor, who gives some clues as to how likely the story might be. his stages of acting as an actor in childhood and so does not give a really scared central victim. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to rate this movie as it was on his day, but also on other horror / thriller films in the 80s and, to a lesser extent, the 90s, far from being a really big horror / thriller movie. Cheers!
