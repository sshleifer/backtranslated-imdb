A great idea is a film starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two reputable and talented actors. Independent film sounds even better. Studios control less content, allowing participants and writers and directors more creativity. <br /> <br /> But why is this movie so cute? Ask for dust. <br /> <br /> This movie assumes that the bat is very accurate. Nobody gets the right backstage so we never know why the characters are acting the way they do it. I left at the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> I told a friend that I saw this movie and that I thought it was terrible. <br /> <br /> His question, "Not even Colin Farrell could save it?" My answer: "Even Colin Farrell's ass couldn't save it."
