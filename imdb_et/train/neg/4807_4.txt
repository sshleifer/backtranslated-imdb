"Ambushed" is not an ordinary activity. It's a lot of bad to be normal. One man walks with another machine with a gun. The other man burns one round and falls on the man with a bigger fire without it being as much as the hail of the hail that has fallen from him. Guess which one is a good man. Duh. This is "intertwined" through and through. Not a good act, not a good drama, not a good movie, "Ambushed" will fail at all levels, as B-movie veterans are mechanically moving as if they are aware that they are making a real loser. Not recommended for anyone. <br /> <br />
