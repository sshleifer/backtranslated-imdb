Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so good at MUMMY'S HAND, came back for this very small universal horror offer. But this time, instead of being regarded as the comedy "Babe" by the Wallace Ford, we can replace Fuzzy Knight with a silly friend called "Stuff". However, the results are far from charming and the level of intimidation is practically zero. <br /> <br /> Dick is a businessman who gets the idea of ​​leading a treasure hunt on a distant island inside a horrible old castle. Peggy is one gang who goes by. But there is the long and skinny look of John Carradine, a black navel and a big hat, known as The Phantom, who disappears from the party to bury himself. <br /> <br /> This "phantom" is not very mysterious and does not even try to try and keep your middle-aged man in the face to create tension or horror. It's always nice to see arrogant Moran, but otherwise you can encrypt it from one of the unforgettable misfire of Universal.
