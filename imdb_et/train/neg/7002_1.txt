I've seen this movie and the other. The Trinity is my name and I find it worse than the first. I have no idea why they even made another movie, it was stupid and pointless to say that I have them all. I've been sitting on these number of times and it still takes me 5 minutes to turn off the movie. I like Terence Hill movies and I like Bud Spencer, but this movie drove me to my wall. If he had a different story or at least more plot and more comedy, it could have been a funner and worth $ 5, which I spent on buying all the films. But you make mistakes that I would say to save your money and don't trust this movie or some of those who go with it.
