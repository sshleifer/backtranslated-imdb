I saw this movie for two reasons - I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor men were forced to wear a pretty stupid movie. I liked the idea that Dracula was actually a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot, because it explains his contempt for all Christian things, but there were so many camps that this idea was not realized as much as it could have been. I see this film more than the talented Gerard Butler's ability to pay his fees before he is truly recognized, and led legendary Christopher Plummer to remind the public (me and the 5 other people who saw the film) that he still exists. I liked the special features of the DVD more than the film itself.
