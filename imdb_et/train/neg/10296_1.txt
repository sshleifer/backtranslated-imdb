It was probably my DVD --- but I don't recommend anyone trying to watch this picture on a DVD. <br /> <br /> I had to show 80% of the dialogue to the highest level of my TV volume. Some of the speeches remained audible. If you are from Scotland, you may have the opportunity, though thin. <br /> <br /> Almost all the surrounding sounds were killed by people's voices, including bundling the package, even smoking cigarettes. <br /> <br /> Once the volume is set, I can ensure that at least one of your neighbors is calling the police when the scene becomes a loud environment, such as a disco. . And you hurt yourself by diving into the remote control to turn it back. <br /> <br /> There is art and there is art, even in the field of mixing sound. However, efforts made during the war would meet international criteria to be classified as cruelty. <br /> <br /> After about half an hour I gave up, seeing something that was redeemed in the picture.
