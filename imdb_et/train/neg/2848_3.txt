... so I thought I'd throw a few words about William McNamara. It's not a bad way to spend a few hours if you want to see him in his tight prisoners - it's obvious that he is pumping this role and he's seeing - or less - pretty rough. The cave has an extended queue where it has to slip with its underwear. There's a nice bit where he has to retreat from Miss Eleniaki, only his hands swarming into his groin. William McNamara is, of course, a bit skinny, but he has a nice, generous handful of catches. It is also a moment when she gets out of bed when you stop at the right moment, you see the whole enchilada. If you are ready to do it and come, there are half the people who decide to watch the ride of navy men on the "journey" of. I would like to thank Dennis Hopper for equal opportunities. Does William McNamara Work? Heck if I know.
