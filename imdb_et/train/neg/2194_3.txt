An important assumption. Very unreal. The film I learned is that exceeding the speed of going to the weekend salon may not be the best idea. I loved how Bill drove out of the car and down the hill without injuries! Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about his gal. Oh, and the police never knew finding a car or traces the owner of wrecks. Poor helper guy and his crumbly useless hand. I admit that it was interesting to see what the mysterious "thing" was behind the door, but when it appeared, I laughed. IF HA HA !! The girl seemed sadly angry after the revival. Personally, I would like to have a new body after such an exciting experience!
