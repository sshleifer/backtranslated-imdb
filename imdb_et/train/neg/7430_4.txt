It is interesting to see what shape Pierce Brosnan's career was before Bond arrived at the scene. In this "tense" thriller, Pierce Brosnan plays the delicate Patrick, who works for leading ghetto children on "confidence courses". She romanticises a woman who has a mop-top child in the mid-1990s. A woman's drunk ex-husband will soon arrive at the scene and start mixing with Pierce. At one stage, Pierce innocently makes "vegeburgers". The man enters. Pierce continues to cook vegetables. The man then attacked Pierce. Pierce comes out of the mouth with a little meal. The fight ends sharply without showing the result. It's as good as a movie. <br /> <br />
