ZOMBIES CANCELLATION (2 out of 5 stars) No, this is not the long lost ancestor of classical George A. Romero zombie-valves. It's a low-budget potboiler since 1936, which probably seemed very cool for the era ... but it seems routine these days. There is actually a pretty good scene at the beginning of a soldier shooting his pistol into a horde approaching zombie soldiers ... and close-up bullets entering the bare chest of one of them. The effect seems hopelessly fake these days, but in 1936 I am sure it had an audience. The story relates to the search for the secret of sensory control ... seemingly to create an unstoppable zombie army ... but later as a tool of one character to win the woman he loves. The film is barely an hour, but is moving at a snail's pace, so it looks like it's full-length, believe me! There's not really much to suggest there ... you can get a nice fun from the "fake" section of the studio through "sex". The end is interesting ... so I'd say the movie deserves at least once. More than likely, you'll see this as an extra option for some cheap "4 movie 1 DVDs" in Wal-Mart for five dollars. Hey, it's worth the money ...
