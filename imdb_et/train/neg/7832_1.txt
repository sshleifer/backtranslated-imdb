I just watched it through one episode ("Crouch End"). The dialogue was tough and down to the right. Operation was tragic. Eion Bailey, in spite of her best efforts to be dramatic, remains largely inexpressible. Her eyebrows suggest a recent botox treatment. Claire Forlan could have been just as easy to play in a quiet movie of enthusiasm. The characters were cartoons, each playing its stereotypical dental camp, mostly randomly, curvingly. The special effects of Cheesy can be excusable if the TV has mini- mized. However, the attempts to create a gap and surprise that creates disturbing cinematography have been added to invisibility. I have the feeling that the end was supposed to be witty and surprising, but it was flat and had a little story with the rest of the story. If I had to compare this general quality to something else, I would put this "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" episode in parallel with NBC Hercules.
