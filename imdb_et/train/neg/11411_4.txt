The story has been repeatedly repositioned; "life in the old home". Several games, movies, novels, short stories, poems and news articles have ended the subject infinitely, but it is still a great platform for characteristic research. <br /> <br /> When Gideon was more enthusiastic, it might be brilliant, but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is completely flooded with clich√©s (even Gideon's 'simple wisdom' subtitles and summaries made me almost ineffective). The last shoulder of this weak film is usually the act of indifference, but the rest is gentle enough to make the lack of attention of the participants almost unimportant.
