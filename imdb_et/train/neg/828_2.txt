Let's see. "Holy elsewhere" in the finals revealed that the hospital was not and that all things were in the mind of an autistic child. "Newhart" ended, telling us that it was a dream. And "Roseanne" ended, telling us that it was all in her mind. Very "creative". Great more. Yes, it was just a TV show and was not a reality at all. It's just that if you get a big movie or a TV show, you want at least to believe it's all "real". At least as much as the reality it represents on the screen. This type of series finale was done twice before and it was an old hat, frustrating and just not fun to watch. Now "Newhart" is all a dream? At least made in a creative way that surpassed many of those who loved the exhibition. The idea itself was not too tempting, but it was so brilliantly made that his allegedly was the best in the series finale. Roseanne missed me after such a loyal fan.
