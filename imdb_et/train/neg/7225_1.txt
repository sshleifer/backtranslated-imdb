I sat through this movie and I have to say that it only managed to keep my attention. The film would have been a bit more busy if I did not have to look at the terrible CGI to refer to industry in the future when you use CGI to watch it, so you know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> Probably this should be a graphic novel on the screen, but everything I saw was a bad film that is not like a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> All in all, the story was not as bad as CGI, I was impressed and thought that the casting was good and a little more character information would have been nice because it got me a little confused, but it's not surprising because as I said, I just keep my attention, but frankly I wish I had given one.
