Ah, the infamous "Guinea Pig" series ... I must honestly say I'm all disappointed with this series ("He Never Dies", "Mermaid Well" and "Meat and Flower"). Blood, what are the exceptions ... and even those that aren't big in any way ...), but "Devil's Experiment" just blows. There is nothing realistic here except climatic (or perhaps climatic, depending on how you look at it). It seems that the victim does not really care about what is going on and bothering with wilting or silencing, while being "outrageous" (often sometimes "fun") torture. "Muscle and Blood Flower" is a more violent and meaningful representation of fake "snuff" material, but this film also falls to the level of realism. I commend Japan for pushing the borders and they have come a long way in the past two decades to carry the crown in "extreme" film making, but "Devil's Experiment" just doesn't hold it. It is worth looking at if you are tough, if not for any other reason than to see what the noise is, but I can only give this movie a very generous 3/10 and this is just a scene for the non-needle eye ...
