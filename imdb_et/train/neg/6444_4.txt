Most college students lose themselves in the bubble of academic circles, cutting off communities where they learn and live. Their conversations take place with fellow students and college teachers. Steven Greenstreet's documentary is a great example of disappointed college students who appreciate the whole community with limited contacts with a small number of members. <br /> <br /> The documentary focused on a small group of people depicted as representing large population groups. As usual, people who scream most will receive media attention. Apart from the fact that the film was misrepresented, the documentary was well done. My only controversy is that the feelings and fear depicted in the film are attributed to the whole community rather than the few who expressed them. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is important to investigate this contradiction and make people aware of the differences between the political views, but it is ridiculous to involve the whole group in a radical action.
