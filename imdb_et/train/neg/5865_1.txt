I can't say enough bad about this train break. This is one of the few movies I've ever been tempted to go out. To begin with, was a bad premise, the first pregnant man, but then they tried to make it stupid. What were all those real pregnant men they were? It was the worst film I've ever seen. If it had enough votes, it would be at the bottom of IMDB 100. If it could be zero, I think I would have given her too much credit.
