Where! I've heard this disturbing review ... but one of my hardcore horror reviewers really found it to be disappointing. He was on his nose! This film was made by pure amateurs. They had to make one, maybe two in every scene, the movie seemed so fast. The script was also bad .... they had lines that tried to be unique but failed. Impatiently. "Get meathooks out of me!" Oh man, I hate it when the movies try to. It happens all the time with comedies ... but with horror and below average, the results are incredibly pathetic. These lines and scenarios were all very predictable. But what made me so negative about this movie was once again a fucking action. It was terrible. In addition, a small Asian man who worked in the cab. I thought he was great. <br /> <br /> The film is about 5 silly dark tourists who are on vacation in Asia. They get to the wrong place and fall into the mafia where there is sex / slaughterhouse. Sounds like a cool story. But even though someone sees diarrhea, it is probably more fun and more intense to look at. The only reason for this is killing. There was no trace. <br /> <br /> I love many other horror fans who died to get their bloody little fingers. But unfortunately, it was very amazing for the huge U capital. I enjoyed the ankle break and the blood effect. The narrow chicks were also so. <br /> <br /> All this film punishes the amateur. This is Ryan Nicholson's first game length and mostly failed. It cannot be denied that he has a sense of humor and a taste of horror. I pray that his next movie will not play like another B horror flick ... if he doesn't tell us that it is. Even after this disappointment, I'm ready to give Ryan another picture. What I've seen about him is a true dedicated person to the genre. Good luck next time because it was bad news.
