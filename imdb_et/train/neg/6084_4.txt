It is possible that the person called may have caused irreparable damage to the floor of the cutting room. Maybe someone calls the director for one day, but I doubt it seriously. <br /> <br /> James Garner decided to launch spaghetti in the western market and bring so many Americans over to fill the cast. People like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley. And of course we have Vic Morrow who wrote and directed this film. <br /> <br /> Garner always becomes such a pleasant criminals because he is as expensive as playing them. But he has played serious and well done in movies, such as childrens training and class. He can and has successfully left his usual stereotypical part. But the person you are calling cannot be considered one of his successes. <br /> <br /> He got the title role of Luther Singu's notorious law, which has a big price on his head. After his partner Tony Young's death in the cabin and Garner takes the appropriate Eastwood style measures, he follows the sedan John Marley. <br /> <br /> Marley spent her time in a nearby territorial prison and seems to have locked the gold shipment and take a break where people regularly travel. Garner gets his gang to be a legacy. <br /> <br /> Here's where the movie goes completely out of the wall. Typically, the hero films show that the protagonists go into methodological planning a lot. Certainly it was the War Wagon, which was mentioned by another reviewer. But in this, Garner decides to imprison a prisoner of the US Marshal Dennis Weaver in jail and imprison him during which gold is kidnapped. <br /> <br /> It was just too much to swallow. If it was so easy to take gold, it should have been done long before. But I say to those who like the blood and guts of the western Italian, there are enough films for three in this jail break. <br /> <br /> It's not the whole thing, of course, the laws are out and we have another gore festival before the end of the movie. But by that time, the whole movie has lost a lot of coherence. But during my life I can't find him in the movie. Perhaps the donkey's Serenad cream would have made it better. <br /> <br /> Couldn't hurt.
