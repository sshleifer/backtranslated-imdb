This British movie is really terrible, and it's hard to believe that Glenn Ford is in it, though he's quite a lot of sleep. The idea of ​​a train bomb sounds good ... but it turns out that this train reaches the majority of the movie! There's no action, no movement, no static train. The parked area of ​​the train is evacuated so that it doesn't like anyone at risk. In fact, this movie can be used in a film class to show how not to make an intermediate layer. True intercourse arises, letting the audience know things that do not happen, which is probably unknown to the director. SPOILER: The train actually has two bombs, but we believe there is only one. After clearing the first bomb, it seems that there is no longer any reason to watch the movie. But at the last minute it turns out that a villain who has no obvious motivation for his actions shows two. Nor are we sure when the bombs will go out, so we don't even have the order of the classical "marker bomb". A good 10 minutes or more will look at Glenn Ford's French woman thinking about how she's leaving, and then wondering where she is. It is such a tedious character that we do not care about whether he agrees with him, so if he does, there is nothing emotional. Most of the other symbols are quite personal and none of them have problems or problems. It's only 72 minutes, but it seems long because it's annoying and boring. Don't waste your time.
