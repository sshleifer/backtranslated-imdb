How did this movie escape from MST3K anger? "Gymkata" is a ridiculous action film that is filled (or is it empty?) On paper with thin plots, fools and unpleasant situations. But take it from me when you enjoy watching the poor, but in silly, movies, you enjoy a lot of "Gymkatat". <br /> <br /> Action centers around the gymnast chosen by government agents (at least I think they were government agencies) to become spy. You can see that his father was still a quasi-government agent who has competed in the game for missing, beautifully calling "The Game". So gymnast (played gently by Kurt Thomas) trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his missing father. <br /> <br /> Sounds promising, isn't it? Okay, so it's not that bare bones in the sipnops are not going to describe the joy of this movie. They can be found in the strange details of the film. Like a gymnast's mysterious Asian girlfriend who doesn't talk about the first half of the movie, she suddenly starts talking and won't stop for the rest of the time! Or really a harsh, unbearable bad guy who loves to make and break the "no rules" of the rules when he wants it. And of course, our hero is a cheerful romp through "Crazies Village" (Obviously this is the real name of the place!). A nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there. <br /> <br /> But if this movie really looks like, the action scenes are. As our main character is a gymnast, the director thought it would be wise to stick to gymnastic equipment in the Middle East town's back alleys and city squares so that our Gymkata captain could better use his gymnast skills to fight parallel bars and horses with evil scourges. It must be considered credible. <br /> <br /> One interesting note. Much, I'd say about half a cast, die of an arrow shot. Interestingly, the arrows are the only credible effect or action of the whole movie. If these were indeed consequences, then one of my praiseworthy signs of seeing these very realistic arrows. It was more likely that this was the way the film did not pay the extras. Nonetheless, "Gymkata" deserves a look when you see it without paying and you are looking for a pleasure that is a target for light ratification. <br /> <br />
