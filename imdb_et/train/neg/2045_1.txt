This movie must be the absolute worst film I've ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend rented to Zodiac (2007) and got it randomly. I thought it was fun before the actual movie. it was terrible when I was expecting it to scare and not. this film had no real evidence of the Zodiac killer. The filmmakers did not want to investigate anything about the killings ... they just liked the name ... so they decided to write a script about what's wrong with his name. I'm upset if I didn't know it wasn't a movie before. I'm trying to get something for every movie, I don't hate movies ... ever ... besides that. If you hadn't been able to give that letter, I would definitely. 1 out of 10.
