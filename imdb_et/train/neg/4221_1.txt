Quite possible. How Francis Veber, one of the best comedy leaders in the world (at least in his own country, arrested in France), was able to turn on a completely immovable film, not just the cause of a mortal man. It's not just that the characters are so unlikely or the film doesn't have the lowest form that it really is physically painful to look at, the endless parade of endless writing, showing and filmmaking that you can't believe is the work of experienced and talented filmmakers. Never before has the whole story in the talking room and on the shelf before its flashing and sa-miss-this theatrical release spent almost eternity. What did they mean?
