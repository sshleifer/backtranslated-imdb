At first glance, it gives the impression that it will be a ridiculous blaxploitation flick, and it includes moments where it moves in that direction. But the idea behind the basic idea is much stronger than one would expect, and it is a worthy effort to portray racial issues in the army of the Second World War. Known cast is a hit and a draw, Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor, and subconscious Billy Dee Williams. However, Stephen Boyd just stops turning his fluffy mustache into red letters. <br /> <br /> Obviously, a small budget leads to inconsistencies in production prices. Locations are big, impact and action are weak. Imagine that if Saving Private Ryan had been formed by half of the soldiers killing exactly the same way as Vin Diesel was on Caparzo (unless we see a stroke because they can't handle it), Hanks, Damon and Burns around Jeep and shot five Germans at their peak. Yet the condemnation of heroic soldiers not respecting their achievements because they are black and the Boyd's racist captain it is convincing is convincing, as is the writing of Turman's character in his imaginary magazine magazine when soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging camps. <br /> <br /> In short, the "Black Brigade / Crank Army" is not doing well. But this is a glorious failure, not a bad joke. It can be a very good movie, and it is interesting now.
