Terrible movie! It must be for the golden county against the candidates for true smugglers. They have taken the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and mated it under recognition. My complaint is not that they have freed the facts; if the story were good, it would be perfectly good. But it's just weird - on all accounts, the real story of this artist would have been a much better movie, so why did they come out with this color script? I think there were not enough bare people in the actual version. Ultimately, he is limited by the artist's life summary - we could have saved a few hours if they preferred the rest of the film with the same shortness.
