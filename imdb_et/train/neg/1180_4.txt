More than a quarter of a century (and often banned) is infamous, it was its greatest asset that seems to be vague. Hey, it's often better to talk, not really see if you can't bring back the legend with the content. <br /> <br /> The movie has been played in Los Angeles a few times recently and is available in home video so the veil is slowly raised. Though there are many more to offend the masses, they are more likely to carry than to create a lot of real passion. Except for the free and protracted XXX sex game between a pair of horses ("Nature Documentary" somebody?), Followed by almost an hour of boring organized marriage melodrama. <br /> <br /> When sex and nudity begin, this is a non-permanent sequence that encompasses masturbation, the loooooongong's alleged "beauty and beast" meeting, and a naked woman running around the manor (someone, even her allegedly aunt, even seems think she put her clothes on!). From the video, I think you can go straight through the banals, but it's not really worth it. Nudity does not go beyond what is seen in much more substantive, such as the Bertolucci soldiers. <br /> <br /> Try to find moral or symbolic muscle, I doubt it's worth every effort. Unfortunately, for LA BETE now that you can see the movie more easily, something that has never been banned has been canceled. And this beast is tamed.
