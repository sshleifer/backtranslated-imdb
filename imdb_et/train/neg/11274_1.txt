Just so that your movie fans understand this movie, I decided to write another review. I missed some things the last time ... <br /> <br /> First, the script. Secondly, acting. Third, Jesus Christ, what they thought to do such a trash, and then expect us to enjoy it if there is no redemption function from beginning to end, unless finally Joseph Fiennes finally blows in a very unforgettable peak !!! <br /> <br /> I can't believe I wasted my money if I could have given it to a homeless or busker or SOMETHING! <br /> <br /> Can you get a picture?
