The queues are an unpleasant habit of being disappointing, and the best credit I can give is that it retains that old tradition. These three stories are not as good as the original Creepshow. <br /> <br /> The best trio is the best wooden idol that comes to life against revenge by killing its owners. The second story is the monster of the lake, which seems to be more than a lot of floating corners, and makes you think about how someone might be afraid of it. The third story includes Stephen King as a truck driver, but otherwise it is a pretty unmemorable story for a road accident victim who has returned to a dead man who fell down. Look instead for the original Creepshow or, if you have already done so, be happy with it.
