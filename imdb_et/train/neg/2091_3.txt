I remember watching a BSG pilot. I can accurately describe this night. I remember what chair I sat. This exhibition was magical. It came alive. I liked the first two years of BSG. I even liked the third parts of the year, and I looked at every fourth year episode, being completely faithful to the great hopes that it would somehow turn around. Well, it wasn't. <br /> <br /> I looked at Caprica's pilot and was amazed. There was something good about hope here. Then I started to look at the usual episodes and they get more and more boring. <br /> <br /> It's too clear, too predictable. It reminds me of the political correctness of Virtualization of his last failed exhibition. When he focused on BSG in an organized way, it was good. This was especially true early on when they followed the pattern of episodes set by the first BSG series. When they left after meeting Admiral Cain and Pegasus, it all went to the pot. It was like he wrote the rest of the exhibition without knowing where he was going. <br /> <br /> Maybe it will improve. Maybe it was just a few initial episodes. But I'm very nervous.
