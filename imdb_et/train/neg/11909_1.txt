I think I found the most timeless movie ever since: Darklight. <br /> <br /> Film Content - Lilith was Adam's first woman and was considered imperfect and lost in the Garden of Eden because she considered Adam equal and refused to present her. Look, I took these words directly from the script. Then the film continues to function, and while it is the hero of the film, the only time it gets acceptable is when it does what the men say to him! He ends the film under the control of faith and all male groups. <br /> <br /> Apart from the predictability of the script and FX being terrible. Apart from the obvious hate for women, which is usually much thinner in today's film, there was nothing original in Darklight.
