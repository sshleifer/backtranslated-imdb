This movie has a smelly whole TV. Though it started with big intentions that contained great looks and authentic props and costumes. The film degenerated rapidly in the nose-chewing dialogue terribly, and rushed to happiness on television. The characters were so delicate that sometimes I thought they were going to break up, and that activity was so complicated and badly cut that it seemed that the soldiers were standing around each other and turning over. . The Germans were so unrealistic that it was painful to look. The only thing the German officers talked about was how wonderful the Americans are. Please take my word. I'm a big fan of the genre of war and this movie is a mess. Nonetheless, this DVD has a great extra feature that covers the front lines of World War I, so it's not a rent to waste my time.
