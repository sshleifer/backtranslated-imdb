"Party of All Saints?" Where ...? If ...? <br /> <br /> Have the holidays and themes of all the holidays been changed? <br /> <br /> What a great title! There is never anything in the story that has a distant connection with the "saintly saint". There is also nothing about "All Souls Day" that the term refers to. Why bother to use this title if you never intend to include a story or theme "All Souls Day" or "All Saints' Party"? <br /> <br /> Embarrassly Bad Script and Writing Amateurs <br /> <br /> How did they give such a clunker such a great talent? Writing is so amateur - characters who have known each other for their entire life will go to the public for big calls for their biography. Not at all how people talk to each other. <br /> <br /> What was the Director's Thinking? <br /> <br /> Management is equally bad! Forced and overly deliberate style knows amateur. In one scene, the sign "Take your hands off me" and NO ONE touches him! The worst-looking scene, however, is the surprising battle scene at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> Too much fear in very fake, foolish battles. <br /> <br /> Most fake battles have so many dead people. It looks like a Saturday night live skit! You can see screens to wait for your characters to move across the camera. Everyone plays their death scene like 4th grade boys - exaggerating every little nerve and twitch. The blood of the victim victims is so excessive and carelessly applied that it seems that someone used a ketchup dispenser and just sprayed red red lines on costumes. cheesy war movie. You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to ride on a horse and give a punchline. <br /> <br /> Who ever lives in this way in real life! <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous way of writing, directing, and casting is in focus: <br /> <br /> A little girl is standing under her hanging father's body - a terribly spoiled and literally dripping blood sick wounds. Even a completely idiot would know he's dead! Yet he repeats - very monotonously - over and over again "daddy, daddy ..." looking at someone's screen. He gave it about as much credibility and passion as you could expect from a non-actress boy who was repeating the line of cameras all day. <br /> <br /> Even if the poor child had the skills to act, the scene is absolutely incredible. The little girl was not even in the middle of the battlefield after killing lessons - it is surrounded by hundreds of corpses while she is calmly standing there! Natural instincts would have screamed and frightened the child, running blood from the massacre! <br /> <br /> Suppose we are scared or ridiculous ??! <br /> <br /> One particularly cozy detail that gives the scene a satire of SNL is dad's hanging, big hook through his mouth and cheek. He looks like a fish hook! Unintentionally funny details make the whole scene inappropriate, both fake and stupid. <br /> <br /> Fantasy La-La-Land has mothers and girls of the same age! Another funny detail is that you can see the central character - the little girl's mother - at the end of the scene, and the next scene that will happen 20+ years later will see exactly the same! She's still young and pretty, now she's the same daughter! <br /> <br /> I almost changed the movie from there because the direction and writing were obviously terrible - but I was trying to hold it because I wanted to see Louisiana settings and I like all the actors. I don't know what these great actors thought when they took over the roles! <br /> <br /> Who was the target group? <br /> <br /> Too much blood and badly acting violence opens up a scene that is strangely outside the following tone of soap opera narration. It is also a strange way to start a movie that, for the rest of the time, seems to be aimed at reading a novel of a novel for women. Strange contradiction in tone!
