I usually do not comment on anything (I read other opinions) ... but that's what I've commented on ... I was convinced you were watching this movie on worlds like F-117 and other high-tech stuff, but only in the first few minutes and I changed my mind ... Lousy acting, weak script and great science literature. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> Just ... don't worry ... <br /> <br /> And one more thing before I watch each movie usually user comments and ratings on this site ... 3.7 points and i give this movie a try, now i was wondering WHO will rate this movie by giving it more than 2 points ??????????
