Between 1937 and 1939, Twentieth Century-Fox made tons of Mr. Moto films. But at the end of the series it was obvious that the studio "jumped in shark", so to say. This phrase shows that the TV show has gone through its main and responsible leaders decided to enliven the sample, basically changing the formula. For example, with "Brady Bunch" they were introduced by the annoying "Cousin Oliver" and "Family Ties" introduced the freak to the baby who grew six years in just one season! With moto films, they jumped into shark, introducing a comic relief because they thought these intelligent films needed tools again. In the last film Warren Hymer played a tedious wrestler. And in this movie, the Archibald Featherstone symbol appears. Featherstone can just be one of the most annoying examples of a comic, as you thought in the hope that someone (preferably Moto) would kill him just to hold him! Though she should work for the famous yard of Scotland, she shows the whole brain damaged by laughter. Again and again, his scenes were nervous and unnecessary, and Peter Lorre just seemed to be painful when he was standing there, watching the "act" of the buffalo. It's so bad that it really destroys what could have been one of the best Moto movies thanks to its smart plot. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, the Queen's crown is discovered in the opening photo of Sheba. The motto, which is now more than an international policeman as originally immoral, is at hand to protect a valuable product from theft. In a big twist, every thief tries to steal the crown independently of one another. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is traceable, but there is also enough evidence that the Moto series should have ended. As the Second World War approached, the films would still not last longer, because having a sympathetic Japanese leadership would not be simply accepted in the US or in the allies.
