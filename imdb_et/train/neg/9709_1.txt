30 seconds credit opens, I had the feeling that it was a bad movie, but I didn't know how bad it was. Then the evil Nazi actress opens her mouth and my friend, and I decide that to survive this movie, we need to reduce the volume, make our own dialogue and double the speed on the DVD. But it doesn't help. About half way we turned it off. Now I have lived through very bad movies, with the help of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie", but there are only a few films I doubt I can even record. The biggest part of the film that disturbed me was that people who hypnotized believing they were zombies were rotten green skin. I think they were all hypnotized, then hypnotized. Get a true B-movie with a cult classic like "Plan Nine from Space Space".
