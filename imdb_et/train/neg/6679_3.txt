After PARDESI BABU (1998) failed, Manoj Agrawal got back with this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has 8-9 in the role of Govinda, because her father, mother, grandfather, sister and later hides her. In short, she is a useless detective who sends her friend's case to get evidence of her wife, whose photos he loses at the airport during flirting. <br /> <br /> She hides as a Sardinian on the plane and again as a girl A funny part is how easily and in a short time does she do it? <br /> <br /> Then she hides as a French singer and enters the TV to get proof lol and then as a leash (yes inside the TV) <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie has the same erroneous identities and ends with a predictable note. The direction of Manoj Agrawal is okay Music is fine <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Govinda proves once again that he is one of the most notable actors. Tastic, though he has done such roles before he fits well in all the resurrections and tasks, though a lot of mortgaged 6-7 roles do not really match the film Rani looks fat, competes well with Govinda. something great and have had to do such kind of roles The rest of Nirmal Pandey is like normal Johny Lever is occasionally too loud and funny in one role and irritates when Elder Tinnu Anand is okay Satish Kaushik is fun, Paresh is okay Tanaaz is okay
