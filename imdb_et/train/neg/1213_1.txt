I can't believe that Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger liked this part of the garbage! The script is so badly written and leading so weak (both of the same person) that it is difficult to find a single dimension in the movie. The dialogues are so flat that this so-called thriller laughed out of some of the fools that hit the theater. The setting is complicated, inviting you to believe that you are watching a cool thriller and suddenly it turns out to be the most foolish movie of persecution. Bassinger's character is so stupid that he actually stops to shout to God "Where are you!" so people can follow him, and then take a leak !! And then he probably went to the smallest wood in the world, he thought he was running all over the place and the killers would never open him, and that would happen at night. It's a surprise to me that Hollywood's best writers find they spend millions.
