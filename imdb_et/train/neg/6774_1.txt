As an enthusiastic fan of Cary Grant, I waited to watch this movie and laugh because AMC presented it as a comedy. I am never disappointed with the film! Cary's usual charm and relaxed comedy is all about this movie AWOL; he comes as tense, boring and just not himself. The Mississippi character is one of the worst stereotypes I have ever seen - his accent is terribly exaggerated (and wrong, according to which part of Mississippi he claims to be), and when he transmits it, it is several decibels higher than no other cast member. Mississip tried to stand out in the film as a lovable, rustic butterfly, but in the end he only managed to weaken his weakness. Mansfield looks more like a funny doll than a Hollywood sex kitten, and although he was never known for his ability to act in Hollywood, the film shouts that he never had the ability to start. Ray Walston's character was gentle and ultimately natural. For four men on the shore, this was what I had ever seen. I watched this nightmare until its end, and while I don't break it on, I tell you that this is the most absurd thing you'll ever see. The film tries to blame patriotism and debt for the fighting men, but the film is not able to make this point entirely due to its weak plot line and weak wrong. Sorry, Cary!
