I'm a big Charlton Heston fan. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors of all time, but what he meant when he made this film. Usually, when he made a bad movie, I can blame it for a scriptwriter or director, but in that case it's all. Sucking this movie is all his fault. This proves that even Heston cannot make Shakespeare's story interesting. I wasted 2 and a half hours of my life during this stabbing festival and I will never get it back. It's far from being a Heston movie I've ever seen. If you are a fan of Shakespeare, you may find this movie fun, but if you don't waste your time, you'll regret it in the long run.
