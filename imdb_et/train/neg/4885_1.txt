I should have listened. I was warned and I paid for it, having read all the comments, after knowing that the original is "so bad that it is good" and that part 2 does not fit into this category at all, still, even then, I don't failed to resist. Exactly what happened here? The first part was fun, it had so much political lies and other crazy entertainment, and it just couldn't be on the green earth of God, not Basket Case 2, hell, not even Troll 2. This is really the worst sequel to history and it's really saying something, taking into account the characteristics of the original barrel. Criminally Insane Part 2 was just a completely different bad brand. Video, zero point, zero entertainment value, 1/3 of the original setbacks and all that crazy, greasy Ethel has lost some of its circumference. Frankly, is that a sick joke?!? Thank you very much, Nick Milliard. 1/1
