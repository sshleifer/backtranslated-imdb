It was a really funny movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone in every movie tried to be serious, making this movie so funny. I mean, come on the shark on the human body. Can it get funny. Good work Sci-Fi keeps comedy movies. I've never thought that films could slow down anymore. If they keep it, they will have to rename the sci fie channel of sci fie channel or something like that. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for sci fi. /> Be prepared for a bowl of popcorn and beer or a bottle of liqueur and I'm ready to laugh it again!
