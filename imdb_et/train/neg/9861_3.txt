I just sat through GenCon just because it was quiet and I can sleep. What a waste of time. Beverly D'Angelo and William Katt? WTF? Was the woman who played Flo and Abe Vigoda busy or something? <br /> <br /> Really, a piece of uncomfortable garbage. The characters were stereotypical without meaning (I think ...) and wood, most of them seemed to be autopilot. The so-called fun situations described in another so-called review were so hacked, I was crying for the writers. <br /> <br /> I'm confused about how someone can find the value of their time, seriously. I only give him three out of 10, because in order to be 2 or 1, it should be either five hours or more of Kelly LeBrock.
