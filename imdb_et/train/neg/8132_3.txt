In fact, the use of a documentary film about the type of bat stock used by BAT BATTERIES is most effective. Bumps hanging from caves, bats flying from caves, or caves shaking near the mouth of the caves. That alone is enough to distract: Imagine they all after you? And they really seem to have been shown with a cap over a forty-minute mark, an inappropriately fun sequence where a good-looking bat seems to be attacking a police car, spraying over a windshield like bloody broken eggs. The problem is that this sequence takes about fifty minutes too late to record a movie, most of which consists of one or more people running around, screaming, throwing their hands around in jabbering with somewhat bad football who have been able to bite the bite of fear that he arrives with a rabies that really sucks so their holiday is destroyed because the plot summary BAT BATTER reference page is indeed out. So here's an effective summary of the film: The young couple goes on a romantic vacation that is destroyed when the boy bites. They are trying to be bold, but they're going to loot, trying to convince the people around him that it's a little more involved than rabies, that he can't control himself, and everyone should be banned. <br /> <br /> Now, when someone swims by the mouth, covered with sweat, the eyes talk like one of the cheapest Muppetes and scream at you to get away from you, you get away from him. You're not trying to give her drugs, you don't try to tell her you love her, you give her home her room, go home and try this picturesque vacation next year. <br /> <br /> But the people in this movie behave like moles, demanding that the guy be pushed to his edge, and he slips out, mutates into a part of the bat species, and kills a lot of less important secondary signs. There is nothing wrong with this, but the film forgets that it is a low-budget creature function and tries to be a psychological study. Instead of a Monster movie, we get a lot of people trying to try to take this man with a cold pill, and eventually he runs down into the mountains that look much more human than he would, people demand that they follow him and pay the expected price. <br /> <br /> The main thing in the movie is wrong, it should have been within the first fifteen minutes, the thirty cups and the movie were supposed to be for the boy who had become Bat-after that, not there. for the trip. This front is very good for eighty minutes as interesting character sketches that always include an entertaining Michael Patak small town policeman who has lost his moral edge, and late Paul Carr as a medical friend who doesn't get the real message. <br /> <br /> The movie is terribly boring, about fifteen minutes too long and missed the opportunity to be a nice, forgotten little creature function, like a mole that is like RATMAN, the favorite of Italian horror, which I watched today and was inspired by to see it. I and my bright ideas, though the police-assisted scene was: too bad for us not to have twenty minutes to do that. <br /> <br /> 3/10
