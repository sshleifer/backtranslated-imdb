Oh yes, Sakura Killers is a funny, terrible ninja movie, no mistake. But it is also incredibly enjoyable. This is largely due to the excellent presence of one of Chuck Connors, who has starred in the film, but with a few scenes. I think he should be a kind of Obi Wan Kenobi ("Tough ninja-buster", a copy of the box cries), but his "wisdom" is ridiculous. "Move Without Thinking" ??? My friend says this is a sign of mental retardation, not the highest concentration. But indeed, his two aides, Sonny and Dennis, have such a terrible dialogue that Brooklyn, as we call Colonel, tends to stand out. Take special care of Dennis's logic regarding Sakura's genetic splicing. If you know something about cloning, you will die laughing. And yes, it's a big landing point, people. <br /> <br /> Terrible fun movie, Sakura Killers is hard to find. I do not break the "trick", except that it is perfect for Sakura Killers 2. Too bad Chuck Connors died. :-( Because he has smoother ways to blow ninjas.
