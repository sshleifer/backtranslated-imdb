I saw the original "Chorus Line" God in Broadway, who knows how many times and felt passion, despair, and joy from this theater experience. Michael Bennett knew he would have to imagine "Chorus" for the screen again, but he never realized how to do it. If the person who came with the exhibition is stumped - it should answer your question. There are some exhibitions that are just seen by the audience. But Richard Attenborough's recent "Ghandi" musical and dancing with "Doolittle", led this film that had little or no resemblance to the stage show. Terrible songs (Surprise! Surprise!) Were added, big songs were abandoned or given to other characters (which didn't make sense). Michael Douglas was wrong cast. People who could not dance, tried to act and there was a sexy "Landers" woman who couldn't sing, act or dance - I think she had just finished Ghandi's wife. Jeffrey Hornaday's dances look like "Flashdance" refusing to hit and nothing works. I was sitting there stunned, how to drain something moisturizing and emotional. If you really love this example and get back to Broadway in 2006 - look at it, but don't think that the long-running musical event "A Chorus Line" is all about this movie.
