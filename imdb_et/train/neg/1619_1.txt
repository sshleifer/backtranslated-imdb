At the start of the movie, beautiful photos and fox scenes were amazing. But this story was so slow and boring. And then the girl starts to flee, which leads to tragic events. We live in the woods and often see foxes. One thing anyone should know is that you leave wild animals wild and enjoy them far away. This film sets a terrible example for children watching it, trying to make a pet a wild creature. I don't know what the story should be. Even after the terrible events of the main fox, the little girl wanted to play with the sets. Will he never learn his lesson? And there are other phases where there are animals of predators, which only adds to the trauma of the children who produce this film. What a disappointment this film was. And what a terrible story he is talking about. The last narrative dialogue was so stupid when my wife and I cried on TV! I absolutely hated this movie and wouldn't recommend it to anyone!
