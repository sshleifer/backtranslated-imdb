What else to say? The actor was almost exclusively amateur. Leadership and continuity were bad. The scenario was predictable until the last scene and dialogue annoying. One of the features of the DVD was labeled "Gag Reel", but it could have been a description of the viewer's response to most of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the funniest things was the DVD in the director's comments. He said he had made a high-value film and a cast name on a straight face - and that he had succeeded. It is easy to understand how the film showed up with such disapproval. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster. The Darkwolf suit was a modified ape suit (about the "making" of DVDs) and was more likely to see it. The mask and claws were little better than any shelf industry in any costume store. Cgi effects were painfully obvious and the quality was similar to a cheap video game.
