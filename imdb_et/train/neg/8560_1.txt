What time do we live when someone like Joe Swan - no matter how hell is considered a good filmmaker ... or even a filmmaker at all! Where is the new harvest of film and talent filmmakers? We need them with mumblecore bad and hell! <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing, just as movie characters don't mean anything. It is this terrible, so-called Gen Y, full of bored idiots, some of which admit to being filmmakers who don't bother doing anything before they shoot. Well, Orson Welles was a filmmaker. John Huston was a filmmaker. Fellini was a filmmaker. Dreyer was a filmmaker and so on. Current movies show how young, so-called "filmmakers" can be when they believe they won't start without a script, no direction, no thought, no legitimate "camera work" (all shot terribly) DV), no editing tool nothing, "rebellious" or "advanced" filmmaking. No, it's called ignorance and laziness, or just pure cinema masturbation (and actually your face is a "jack-off shot" so be prepared). <br /> <br /> Watch the early films of any "indie" filmmaker: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee or Herzog. this, but Swan-hell, goes every year to SXSW and welcomes it as a new, new talent. It's a mess! I can't imagine anyone who would like it, and all the other so-called filmmaker has done (everything I've seen) is just as bad (newer things are clearly made to appeal to a more general audience, one to sitcom calling). Be clear if you are not involved in these friends or family ... in another thinking if you are a family member or friend you would probably be embarrassed to see a family member or friend in such dangerous situations. . <br /> <br /> Use garbage. It's not art. This is its final opposite.
