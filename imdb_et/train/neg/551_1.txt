I've gone through AFI's top 100 comedy list and I have to say it's really one of the worst. Not only 90 movies I've seen, but any movie I've ever seen. Drudks are sometimes funny, Dudley is not. Liza almost changed its worth, but unfortunately ... just look at Arrested Development if you want to see something good for her. Seriously, Dudley laughing and drinking should be funny? I'd recommend almost every other AFI for 100 best comedies to laugh more. If you want to see the funniest "drunk", try Thin Man. Funnier movie in general, every Marx Brothers movie kills (especially if you're as drunk as Arthur).
