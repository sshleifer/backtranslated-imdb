Body Slam (1987) is an amazing film. Low budget goes, the direction is pedestrian (at best) and writing and acting is flat. But if you're in an old school wrestling (around the mid-1970s in the mid-80s), you'll get more entertainment than the average viewer. I have to warn you, this movie smells of ice. I gave it to two because I felt I was generous. This turkey was "led by" the stunt master Hal Needham. The stars are Roddy Piper, The Tonga Kid, and a number of scrimmers and c-list participants (Dirk Benedict). <br /> <br /> The summary of this "movie" is about a promoter who wants to combine "hair stone and wrestling. But they are others who don't want him to succeed. There's more, but I don't want it for you If you can make a bad and unsuccessful story in the stomach, then there are a few surprises for the fans of the death race. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend it to my worse enemy (and I mean it).
