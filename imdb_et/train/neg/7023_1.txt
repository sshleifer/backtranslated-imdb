OK, my girlfriend and I borrowed a DVD and about 30 minutes of film, we exchanged a lot of "ehhh, what this movie is, and more importantly, do I care to find out what it ends" we needed drugs to keep us "plot" interesting or just stop the pain there and then and look at something else. We chose the latter. <br /> <br /> I liked "But I'm a cheerleader," but Mango Kiss is too silly and surreal for my taste, sorry! I definitely prefer "D.E.B.S", "Better Than Chocolate", "Fucking Åmål", "Goldfish Memory" and "Fire". <br /> <br /> Sorcia
