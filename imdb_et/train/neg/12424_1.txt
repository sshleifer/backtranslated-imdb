If you want to laugh like crazy, rent a Cage. Cage is about two war heroes, Billy and Scott, who are the best friends. When Billy is sent to Vietnam, he can't take care of himself so Scott takes him in. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a movie with more gay references to two main characters. Billy and Scott love "wrestling" and Scott tells Billy that he is still "painful at night," among other things. <br /> <br /> Wonderful catch phrases like "Shut the sh! T up" and "Ping Pang Pong, cut sh! T" keeps you laughing. Native American guys who should play Mexican gang members are also top notch. As they say, it's "party time now. Ba-ba-ba into ba." I could go on forever, but just watch this movie and smile my $. It was so funny that I went out and bought a DVD for $ 5.99
