I thought these films were standards of hope, which I expected it to be so much better than it was. I'm so glad I didn't pay to watch this movie and I didn't sit in that cinema. Where to start from this movie was the average in this movie, humor was terrible, and the overall story of this movie was not special. I thought this movie was probably big, but it wasn't more than a waste of time. I think acting in this movie was terrible because none of the participants in the film was chemistry, it just wasn't. I think if we could have been another actor Kirk as Jay Baruchel, it could have been better, but all the time I watched this movie, he saw it high and I didn't feel like he wasn't in the movie. Now, Alice Eve did a great job as an actor, but there was no chemistry between her and Jay. All the participants in this film were not names and had very little effect in this film. The humor of this film was not funny at all, there were a couple of lining in this movie that were OK, but nothing was told by the friends to understand. I think Jim Field Smith had a hard time with it because he couldn't decide if he wanted romance or comedy. I believe he must stay with the ads of Burger King. I think this film could have been better if the writers had gone to another director. The story of this movie is like every other hot girl just OK boy love story? Bored, I think it would have been better if it had more originality but nothing. Frankly, no one would recommend watching this movie. I think you would be more entertained in dentistry than in this movie. So save yourself embarrassing and just don't look at it.
