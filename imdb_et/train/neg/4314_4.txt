I firmly believe that in recent years, the best Oscar ceremony was in 2003 for two reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Host Steve Martin was his strongest: "I saw teammates helping Michael Moore with his body limo" and "I don't want to mention the gay mafia better when I wake up with my baby's head in my bed" <br /> <br /> 2) Surprise winners: nobody was Adrien Brody the best actor (Genuine Applause) or Roman Polanski for the best director ( Genuine jeers and boos) but they won <br /> <br /> Last year's award ceremony wasn't too bad, but the surprise was little and I was glad to review RETURN WRITE WRITE even when it wasn't the best trilogy (FELLOWSHIP was a lot better), but let the BBC cover Jonathan Ross, who got some of his cytophantic companions and pretended they were fun when they were something. So when I heard that Sky was dealing with British television coverage, I expected Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to make links, but instead we came to Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne! Oh gawd when British TV is desperate for filmmakers (Obviously they are) I'm sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly to LA to give their honest opinions about winners and losers. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock wasn't too bad, but he's not Steve Martin, while the location seemed similar to the gym where the seats are placed! I don't like a lot of bright arenas. The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the "minor" Oscar issued to those who sat on their seats! There is no such thing as a "small" Oscar and precisely because the prize is the best animated short or best costume art they deserve as well as the best picture or best director. All winners should have the opportunity to enter the podium. What a chord is becoming a disgraceful snob and I totally agree with the comments that this format is shameful and, if it wasn't for surprises, it could have been the worst ceremony in history. As for the awards themselves <br /> <br /> Best supporting actor - Cate Blanchett. There is no big surprise for a competitive category <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is the best supporting actor. There are no real complaints, as Freeman is one of America's biggest actors in live characters <br /> <br /> Best Actor - Jamie Foxx. The most predictable prize. Yawn <br /> <br /> Best Actor - Hilary Swank. A big surprise because everyone thought that Annette Benning just won the Academy's policy, but Swank deserved it and gave the best speech at night. <br /> <br /> Best Director - Clint Eastwood. A big surprise, because everyone thought Scorsese was just getting a prize because he never won it. Actually, I'm glad about it because if he doesn't deserve it for TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS, he didn't want it for the AVIATOR <br /> <br /> Best Movie - Million Dollars. Another big surprise, because everyone thought that the Academy would award the prizes for the best director and the best picture when I thought that the AVIATOR Hollywood friendly plot would have made it the best picture, while the controversial theme of MDB would have changed a lot. > <br /> What these prizes are likely to show is that this year voters have decided to ignore the Oscar policy and give real rewards to people who deserve what they haven't done in the past, I mean A HIGH Beating ring for FELLOWSHIP ! And for a long time, the Academy can vote with its heads instead of its hearts
