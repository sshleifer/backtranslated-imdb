This movie is great, remember - but just the way it says the BAD story. Stella is so terribly raw and never learns better. His wife is incredibly nervous and small. Neither learns better. Is it realistic? Something, Stella realizes that her daughter is ashamed of her harsh customs and dresses, but she can't understand that she just needs to push it all down? I do not belive. Stella is a good woman and a very good mother. Turning to yourself so that his daughter can be linked to a large number of big snobs is disgusting. <br /> <br /> Much of what we see could have been normal for ages - people who have beer or two who play the piano are dancing - but it has developed into a moral inferiority. "I can't live my child like that!" Save me. <br /> <br /> This story tells me one thing is that an unwashed working class can never hope for desires for the upper class. And it's just a hogwash load.
