I think that if I went deep into the first school in the countryside and asked for a script for the English sub-set, it would make more sense. I could then go to the first year of the drama group and they would do better with the jokes in this movie. It sounds really, but I'm sure they did it for fun and are fully aware that they have (see what I did there?) No skill to act or write anything, ever. <br /> <br /> Look at it only if you are incredibly drunk, high, or you need a good excuse for finding your decaying body with slits. I'm going to my fish bowl now and I'll collect all the poo. After that I shaped the shape of this disc and put it on my DVD player, waiting completely for it to produce something better than this trick. <br /> <br /> Acting - 0/10 Plot - LOL / 10 Breasts - 9/10
