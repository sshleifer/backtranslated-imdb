If someone is filming a classic movie again, this new original will always be less favorable. There is also the possibility that the remake is so radically different that it is just too rare for the audience. <br /> <br /> Well, the 1973 Double Indemnity TV version has almost identical scenes and dialogues, like the original 1944. The main difference is that the remake seems to be no energy at all. Fred MacMurray was great as the original, insurance agent Walter Neff; Richard Crenna just seems tired and tired of the world. Edward G. Robinson has played his role as a great mania energy as MacMurray boss Barton Keys; Fine actor Lee J. Cobb seems to be almost boring in the proceedings. Samantha Eggar is all wrong, uniting, upside down Phyllis Dietrichson; while Barbara Stanwyck was just great in this bad role, Eggar is too polite and polite and just looks in place. <br /> <br /> Robert Webber, in the role of Richard Richard Gaines, Robinson's chief Norton and John Fiedler, taking Porter Hall's role as an important witness, brings to life a film. In particular, Webber restores Norton's role in the context of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> But after the movie starts, the whole thing is right there, without any life or electricity. This is one movie that shouldn't have been rebuilt.
