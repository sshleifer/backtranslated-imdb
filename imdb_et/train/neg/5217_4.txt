Get acquainted with Peter Houseman, a rock-star genetic professor at the University of Virgina. If he's not in court, he blows lectures in his classroom and drops the panties. Dr. Houseman works with a serum that allows the body to continuously regenerate cells that allow people to become immortal. I would also like to be immortal when I looked at Christian Bale and got a sweet female lovin that only VU offers. The choice of old and ugly university professors is not interested in the popular Houseman and, due to lack of results, interrupts the funding of its project. It causes Peter's own serum guinea pig. To my surprise, there are many side effects and he gets this metamorphosis! in our genetic DNA, which has been repressed for "millions of years". He also slept with Dr Mike in Sally after the whole day when he felt. He has a son. His name is Tommy. He's an angry little boy. <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis is not a terrible film, just not well produced. All the time I looked at it, I couldn't get it filmed in 1989. The look and feel of the film is the quality of the late 70s. It doesn't help to be packed with 1970's movies, because Metamorphosis is part of the mill's 50 cools of classic entertainment. There is basically no difference in film quality. The last five minutes is a clean bad movie thread that at least saves the film's lower rating. Pay attention to computer terminology such as "chromosomal anomaly". No wonder Peter's attempt failed. Your computer can't write! It deserves a view, followed by a trip to its local tavern.
