The three-dimensional "Man Who Was Not There" stands for DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This intuitive comedy contains bad 3-D effects that make 3-D effects "jaw 3", "Amityville 3" and "Friday 13th part 3" better. Not to mention the movie is an extreme asinine. It was one of many 1983 movies with a pop-off screen effect. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor would confuse it, but at least they didn't kill their career. Tambor goes to the star in HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show" and Ron Howard's ticket office "How Grinch stole Christmas", while Guttenberg followed the flop "Police Academy" and "Cocoon". What do they do in these projects instead of "The Man Who Wasn't There". If you do, you will regret it. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (of four)
