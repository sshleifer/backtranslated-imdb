This movie was based on real facts? I sincerely hope we can't see! This is a great idea; Try to armor! ... excuse me, but how to cry out loud with the heads of these big fats or with their feet. Or were the invisible tanks that protect them? were they from Crypton? Do I miss anything here? this documentary style did not work for me, but it is just something that is pleasant or not. br /> 3/10 for editing the fine.
