It's one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. It almost never hangs on the type of thriller and manages to blend them. <br /> <br /> There is no good line or character in all the confusion. If there was a plot, it was aftertaste, and as far as it goes, there is nothing good to say to say something sick. I really do not understand how this type of crap occurs and actually gets rid of it, no one at any time thinks "Oh God, it's really a Scottish load" and call it a day. Such a mess with illegal downloads looks like a completely different movie, at least when you download it, you don't waste your time or money Don't waste your time, it's painful.
