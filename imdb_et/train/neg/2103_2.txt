Bela Lugosi is an evil botanist who sends brides to poisoned orchids on her wedding day, steals her fake ambulance / celebrity and takes home her dwarf adviser to extract glands to keep Bela's wife forever young. Some secondary actors who play a detective are trying to solve a terrible and terrible secret. Bela Lugosi hands it nicely, but you can say he needs money. <br /> <br /> This movie is terribly terrible and most of the actors would have been better hit by waiting lists, but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous. Tell somebody what's going on and they tend to laugh and demand a movie. I got a DVD at a discount price of Â£ 2, which is, in my opinion, a very accurate estimate, anyone who pays for it would be out of their mind.
