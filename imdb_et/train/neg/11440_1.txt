Otherwise, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen - and I mean. My wife and I missed our mind in 10 minutes. Not to mention that it's boring, it's totally unbelievable. Women (not lesbian) do not swim together - nor "accidentally" kiss. Brothers and sisters do not live well in their 30s and run around and dance together and play in the central park. Men do not find their wife and sister romanticly kissing the wedding evening and then never discuss it with their wife. Absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham is the worst actor in films today. She smiles when she should cry and vice versa. The only movie he's ever had is Boogie Nights - and because he didn't work. <br /> <br /> I can't stress enough how bad this movie was.
