that's what you get when you promised a 10-year (manic-american) to write a month's journey. Absolute garbage with no redemption properties Maybe it was nice in the 3D department. but as a narrative and entertaining animation, it didn't hold anything to make the hour and time worthwhile. Save your time and money and see <br /> <br /> Devil instead of BOLT. There are not enough traits, but I think it will come together ... well, I agree with the above review - it's like a cold war propaganda story. Perhaps it would have been more interesting if they had done the flies to reveal the landing of the poppy or if the flies were dead at the first minute. BTW - Why were all the main characters deformed? No one had a complete compliment to the limbs!
