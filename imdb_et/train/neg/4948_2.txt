I've always been enthusiastic about a period of drama, a form of art in which the BBC has stood out in the past. This "Byron" presentation was incredible. Incredibly bad! The script was terrible, unruly, and all the characters were disgraceful. Obviously, Byron was "mad bad and dangerous to know" and set the hearts of the ladies everywhere. Not in this production. Here he appeared with a ridiculous leap from a small splash, not a girl's hero and a Greek independence struggle. It has been said that Byron walked with the hip. This human portrayal was just stupid all the time. <br /> <br /> I was watching for two and a half hours to wait for something alive. Not splutter, not even bright. It was completely tedium, if not completely boring, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Considering that no one can ever make Avon Bard better, I also believe that Byron's poem is overestimated and I think it should be burnt down and this dramatization of his life should be the same. <br /> <br /> I think the BBC lost this one
