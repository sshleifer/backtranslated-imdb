I haven't seen it for more than twenty years. OJ was a bus driver, Arte Johnson was a guide, Lorenzo was a kid. <br /> <br /> Yes, Lorenzo looked very much at home, like a villain, natural. I think I looked mostly at OJ I saw in Towering Inferno and Cassandra Crossing, but also in Arte Johnson. <br /> <br /> I was a little bored that Johnson was so serious. > <br /> And yes, it shifted the plots. When I read other posts, I remember that it was some plot that they kidnapped some rich girls, but then this priceless temple turned out of the blue. <br /> <br /> I went to the temple? If that were to happen late, I'd probably record it again, but I wouldn't be nostalgic over it. Not yet anyway. <br /> <br /> In the seventies, there are better movies to watch.
