Skippy from "Family Ties" plays Eddie. When his favorite funny metal singer Sammi Curr dies, he throws hissy to fit all his bedroom wall posters down. But if he later publishes an unpublished record that keeps his dead "metal" idol spirit. First of all, he is sucked into the idea of ​​revenge, but he does not want to take this Samm. It's not as far as his main victims seem to go to the hospital. This movie is completely ridiculous and has as much real metal as "Rock Star". OK, maybe more than that junk, but you get my point. And how ANYone can be guided by a boy Skippy played in "Family Ties" has no idea. Gene Simmons' fire is OK and Ozzy Osbourne comes to unity, I praise him for that, but otherwise skip it. <br /> <br /> My Degree: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elise Richards gets topless, surcharge for the pool
