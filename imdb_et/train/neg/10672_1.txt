It had all the clich√©s and matter of this type of film. The plot went somewhere and at the end of the film I felt it as a mammal. Production was good; the script and the action were, however, the quality of the B movie. The casting was bad because there were good players who were mixed with crumby actors. The good actors did not hold on their own or raised others. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth more words, but I'll say more to meet the ten-line minimum requirement. James Wood and Cuban Gooding, Jr., play cartoons of other films. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for meaningless entertainment, I would not recommend this movie.
