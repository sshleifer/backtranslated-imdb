This film is a social commentary, when in fact it is as ridiculous as the very racism it condemns. Prerequisite for this film: African-American = Strong ... any other race = weak. The worst part is when Rapaport pulls a gun to Omar Epps and a Jewish guy. A Jewish man, stereotypically, crumbles fear and begins to seek his life ... but big, strong, defiant Omar Epps stands strong without fear. We also have the condemnation of every brotherhood as an arrogant preppie drunk or rapist. Of course, a raped white girl will begin to consider lesbianism because she is only a weak white girl. If the brotherhood is a joke of white boys, he must naturally fall with the head of the skin, who is an incredible coward; a particularly big muscle boy who is being beaten by strong black men. Wait ... BUSTA RHYMES BEAT UP GUY TWICE HIS SIZE? Yes, right. <br /> <br /> Of course, black men will never push their people back and Omar Epps will easily move with them. Scenes where Ice Cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in the line are just stupid - of course, he is dominant, while his weak white roommates sit for him and eventually. This movie was just terrible and ended up laughing out loud. The lengthy slowdown between Epps and the banks becomes fun for the faces they do - it's like my nephew and cousins ​​who face each other (and they are all under 5 years old). Make yourself a favor and leave it out.
