I went to this movie, thinking it was the next secretary, but it was unknown. Humor was weak and the characters were pretty flat. This does not mean that it was all bad, the idea of ​​a presentation service in the grocery store seemed quite fruitful, but the director changed the focus to the cliché, "to save the bad guy of the mother and the pop shop". He has come out with a much more memorable movie. Now, to make the film fair, I am from the Rochester area and loved the way he portrayed Webster. In fact, the best Kevin Smith (officials) honored his hometown props. Webster, NY is for Checkout by Red Bank, NJ is on Clerks, the director kicked Nick Tahou in. Trust me when there are things in Rochester on the landfill list, and I was lucky enough to see this movie in Little Rochester so everyone knows when the cities came and appreciated them.
