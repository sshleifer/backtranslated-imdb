There are many problems with this film, but I try to mention the most outstanding and annoying ones. First, while the topic refers to many vignettes about Manhattan's life, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and television, was about strange, usually sexual. The story lines were thin or nonexistent and almost all scenes, camera pictures, dialogues and expressed emotions were completely and completely fake. Finally, after it was so pointless for the hour I left out the garbage I went out of (I've never seen anything rare in recent years) I would have thought fi9lm was run by some wannabe author who left a third course program but I believe that (at one time, before Amelia, talented) director Mira Nair took part in this nasty traverse, so maybe the American director's talent has been depressed.
