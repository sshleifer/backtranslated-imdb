Fortunately, I didn't pay to see this movie. Also, I can't even publish any spoilers because I was ready forty minutes after the movie. It was so bad. I laughed once when Yahoo! stend crashed boy and theme song came. But it was just because I thought it was funny, but then I realized it was another product placement. <br /> <br /> I loved the comic. I looked at it almost religiously. (though I missed the last episode. I heard they show Dr. Claw and it was nothing but a claw, someone commented on the show page.) In the figure, Penny and Brain were much more than on the film. I hated setting up the whole thing, recalling Robocop. Broderick then screws the entire inspector with the gadget. He's almost as clumsy as the comic. Another fact is that his gadgets actually work as much as I saw, except for the oil cut. He also twisted the "Wowsers" tone, which was previously a thrilling tone. I was so disappointed that they killed the cartoon so badly. All others knew it. Our 14-17 year olds remember the beloved comics and we loved it every minute. <br /> <br /> I went to the movie with an open mind knowing that they would be screwed with cartoon. I was surprised when the film slowed down. It was based on eyesight and stupid humor. Disney relies on pain and physical humor to push a child's film. Product placement in this film is pointless and it shows. An intelligent cracking car is not as good at cracking. The gadgets look nice, but they were almost too shiny. The cartoon had a better look. The stupid scenes were crap. In 40-45 minutes I watched a movie, not a laugh, and they laughed at Dudley-Do-Right preview. This movie should not be watched by people who want their entertainment intelligence. I highly recommend "Iron Giant", which was sad but very good. This movie is a drama for the whole family
