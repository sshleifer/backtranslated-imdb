I thought Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was a pretty horror film When the US military recovers the body of terrorists infected with a stolen chemical, the body is cremated by releasing the virus into the atmosphere of a small island. The soon-to-be-infected infected locals will become flesh-hungry zombies and a group of retired soldiers will be holding a group of tourists and an abandoned hotel if they try to fight aggressive living dead. I didn't find this movie as good as the original film, Zombie Flesh Eaters. But it was still an OK horror movie with good action. I didn't think it was one of the best in the series. 4/10
