I would have liked to give this film a zero, but it wasn't an option! This movie sucks !!! Women can't act. I should have known that it sucks when I saw Bobby Brown. Someone in my house couldn't believe I didn't change the channel after the first 15 minutes. The idea of ​​black women as weapons miners on western days is ridiculous. it's not just a race thing, it's a sex. the combination of these two things is ridiculous. I'm sorry because some people in the movie aren't bad actors / actors, but the film itself was terrible. it was not plausible in the film. it can be "entertaining" for a group of people, but I'm not in this group. lol. and using a big line from a great great movie ... "that's all I say about it."
