I have nothing new to say: 4 hours of people die again and again on the same hill. The cast was in letters, but unfortunately the producer / director / editor / God was. He should have eaten a humble pie (if not then dead men in Kargi), hired one of these brilliant Bollywood directors, hired a real scriptwriter, hired a real editor, hired a musician who wasn't involved in any way (and who seemed to hear some bad India) in the pharmacy "Apocalypse Now" bad version), hired a real professional team, throwing away all fireworks and telling the real story. Unfortunately, like the great armies of the Indian Army, he made decisions that were terrible for his actors and terrible for his audience. We all died again and again. Please don't do it again, sir! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal <br /> <br /> ps: The next time an Indian director decides to praise the Gurkha regiment, I suggest that he hire more than one Nepal to hire a team. There are certainly many men in Nepal working in Bombay - the last figure was 40,000 to half a million.
