Revenge is one of my favorite films. Moreso, "the void of revenge" is one of my favorite works in the film. Having seen Gaspar Noe's irreversible (2002), I was expecting an even more important expression of this topic. Instead, this film is a weak half-hearted experiment that did not only express the lack of conviction and focus of the film. sometimes as little as a fantasy of rape of a woman's revenge. But it doesn't even reflect that movie. Instead, the scene (which the FAR goes beyond the rape of the original rape to the extent that it was graphical as well as this ritual) is crowned with Dawson's facial strike either regrettably, or "It didn't fix anything when the rape of his rape continues to be heard in the background." I mean, do we feel bad about rape? Are we happy about Dawson's revenge? Are we all talking about its cruelty? Do we feel the moment of Dawson's regrettable clarity? Apart from this failure, the film is really more inconvenient than the subject. The characters are thin. , dialogue is monotonous, etc. I usually try to make movies on my own terms, but Descent didn't really know what they were.
