The definition of abomination defined by Webster's Dictioary is "a cause of intimidation or disgust". If someone can think of a more appropriate word or definition than it is in the dark, please let me know because it is the best I can come up with. But I don't think this word would describe how really this terrible movie is. <br /> <br /> I went to watch this movie with two of my roommates. One has a very similar taste to me, the other is an action / adventure clip. This last man usually does not care about the size of the plot hole, if there are many explosions in the film, which he walks peacefully. <br /> <br /> Having said that, we went alone in the dark to see Friday. To the surprise we were the only people in the theater. When it started, I knew why immediately. <br /> <br /> It starts with the worst opening of any movie and unfortunately I have to admit that it only gets worse. The opening scene is a narrative 5-minute scrolling text. But I understand why it was told. The director must have realized that only illiterate people could think of PAYING to watch the movie. But not only this first scene is the longest scrolling text in cinema history, but it doesn't make sense either. It seems that in the same order we hear the movies completely separate. One of them is the ancient civilization and the violation of this portal, the other is the crazy scientist and the attempts of his orphans. If you read this and you are confused, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Then the terrible story, action, effects and camera work begin. Tara Reid is terrible as an actor. He doesn't take any seconds to think he is a curator of the museum. Slater is just bad, not convincing and has no chemistry with Reid. <br /> <br /> The piece is probably the worst person. All the time, a roommate with similar tastes is asking questions like: What is it? And what's going on? In addition to this scroll waste, Slater itself has some narrated sequences. Are they good? NO. Do they explain something? NO. Are we at some point when the audience is the least, why should we take care of what happens? Again, NO. <br /> <br /> Then we have random sex. We are told that Slater and Reid are together, but they never act as if they were caring for you. But then BAM ... sex. Again, I don't know. <br /> <br /> Good, oh, I don't know, 30 seconds after this terrible end of the scene, we've got 20 or so military and similar aliens. It's set on a heavy metal track and causes more brain hemorrhage than ever thought. <br /> <br /> And if it wasn't enough ... <br /> <br /> There's no main villain. It is a scientist and there are "foreigners" things. At one point, the scientist checks the aliens' things and stands on a hill that tells them to attack the military outpost. Why? How did he become chief of these things? Why are they listening to him? I have no idea yet. <br /> <br /> The movie ends in the city evacuated by Slater and Reid. Why was the city evacuated? Were foreigners out? Did the army tell them? Who knows ... and at the moment who cares? I didn't do it and you don't. <br /> <br /> Up, Slater and Reid are attacked by an alien thing. Although it was said that foreigners are killed due to sunlight. And that's right, you guessed it, it's the middle * &% $ ing day and it's bright as it may be. Maybe an alien bought sunglasses, I don't know and I don't care. <br /> <br /> Now, after the end of the movie, I ran outside the theater, all 6 feet 6 inches from my hands and shaking my afro, telling everyone not to see this movie. Even my gung-ho action / adventure roommate (who is considering a movie that just cut and pasted for 2 hours of an explosion into a single movie that was once the greatest thing ever created) admitted that the plot holes in this movie were very obvious. <br /> All in all, this CRAP-FEST gives me 0.0 / 10 and would make it smaller than I could. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the worst movie ever made. I wouldn't want this movie to be my worst enemy.
