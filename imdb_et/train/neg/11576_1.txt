You saw it at the UCSB Reel Sound Festival and was * shocked * to win the golden throw price. I was not the only one considering that the audience had a mixed reaction. I thought there were many other better pictures, but then I found out that the judges were strongly involved in film theory and other artistic mess. While cinematography and editing are equal to many other short pants, storytelling is nothing but your average student. "Serious" student films seem to include one of these categories: gender, intrapersonal struggle and possible suicide - Nick and Kate hold on and contain all three. Please, be more original! <br /> <br /> Oh, and this may be my bystander's opinion, but the montecito man sounds a little fake. Is anyone else so?
