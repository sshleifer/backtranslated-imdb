This overpriced, short-term series (double season) is about as experimental and unique as the truck driver goes to the strip. I'm not sure what they mean by "groundbreaking" and "original" when they abandon all of Lynch and his stupid little TV ops. What exactly are their criteria that are original? Of course, compared to "Bill Cosby Show" or "Hill Street Blues", this is the original. Certainly. In addition to "law and order", the TP pulls the originality left and right. <br /> <br /> The fans of TP often say that the show has been canceled because too many viewers were not smart enough, open enough to show "strange" exhibitions, its alleged wild ingenuity or whatever. a fan of myself, I have to fix this misconception. There is nothing too far from the TP, it is simply traceable, quite silly, circling around, spinning nets at every angle, but (or because of that) eventually does not go anywhere. is always forced; characters do not behave in a strange way when they behave in the way of IDIOTICS for half a time. Difference ... <br /> <br /> When I look at "Life in Oblivion" where the dwarf criticizes the director (Buscemi) tired old let-use-a-understandable-dream-scene clich√©, I mean Lynch. You want a strange? "Eraserhead is weird - in fact, it's weird, it's basically abstract. Do you want unique TV shows? Watch" Vang " You want a strange picture? Felini and L eon movies offer it.PP looks like an overly skinned TV crime drama, where all young people look like fashion models. Pain gives TP a plastic look. Kens & Barbies Massively. <br /> <br /> In fact, one of the TP manufacturers said Lynch was looking for "unique faces" for the series. Unique faces? Like Lara Flynn Boyle? Sheryll Fenn is? Like these feminine "pieces" directly from men's catalogs (or gay magazines)? Don't do me wrong; there is nothing wrong with getting an attractive casting, especially beauty like Fenn (how would Madonna look if she was 1000 times more beautiful), but then don't go around saying that you are making a "strange example of people with strange views" ". that Lynch's erroneous charm is with Kyle MacLachlan (I should get a medal to disturb his name right), he is not unlikely, but he has no charisma, which seems a bit too sharp and polished, his ridiculous "eccentricity" was not at all interesting. only one of Lynch's many events to force strangeness, trying hard to live his reputation - he lost his edge completely. Everything that Lynch did to post-"Elephant Man" was very low for his first two films, often followed by mediocre efforts based on Lynch's relative a small but fanatical fan to keep him in the eyes of the public, interpreting the meanings of his poorly assembled stories that have no closer look In other words, Lynch is expensive for every intellectual wannabe. <br /> <br /> So his father killed Laura Palmer? He was obsessed with the fucking or some nonsense. This is the best thing this "great spirit" could come ... You have the B-movie horror movies that end with more originality. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not as bright or hard to make a terrible story. <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and see my "TV and Cinema: 150 Worst Nepotism Cases".
