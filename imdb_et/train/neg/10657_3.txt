I had many hopes for this movie and so I looked at it with much expectation; mainly because of Kamal Hassan. He is an amazing actor who has celebrated his foot step with time in the sand forever. But this movie turned out to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. After watching it, the film's brutality and violence are much better than the tenebras and the clock in orange. <br /> <br /> Prime Minister, Raghavan, is a very brave police officer. Who is destined to investigate the brutal series of murder. Here, Raghavan effectively finds the connecting thread and is close to solving the murders and looking for psycho-killers, two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students, but they flee again and get killed. Finally, Raghavan kills both after saving the lives of many innocents. <br /> <br /> These two psycho-killers are the ones who keep the audience going to theaters. Murder and sexual harassment and rape have been very clearly demonstrated by the film that could have survived. <br /> <br /> To even imagine teenagers and kids watching this movie in the theater and the kind of picture he needs to think about is definitely not beautiful. Director Gautham should understand that he also has a certain commitment to society and his audience. I will never go to movies that look like Gautham in the production list.
