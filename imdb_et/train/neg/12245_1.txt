Why, O 'WHY! ... did I pick it? Well ... I needed no-brainer on summer heat and the coat seemed cool. <br /> <br /> Of course, I should have felt better. This is really a bad movie. And it becomes embarasing when the makers know it's bad, and try to cover it by adding some sexy / beautiful women and some sex scenes. Well, people ... it won't cut it, is it! <br /> <br /> If you would like to cool a movie from a great reptile that is really very, very good, well played and funny: go to Lake Placid for rent! (this is an order)
