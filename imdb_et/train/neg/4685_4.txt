Until the last few minutes of the movie, I would have received 7 or 8 stars. However, the end is so terrible and "Hollywoodized" that it completely undermines 80% of the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is rotating around the submarine and there is a chance they could order their nuclear missiles. Captain, Gene Hackman, is all on the run, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, is in favor of approving launch orders. The problem is to run both the master and the first officer at the same time to use their own trigger keys. Hackman has decided to launch and Washington will stand firmly until it finally brings an armed uprising on the sub-board. Finally, an error is detected and missiles are not triggered. Cool. However, here comes a part that just doesn't fit. After they have returned to the country and undergo an inspection board, Washington and Hackman (who just spent half of the movie trying to kill each other) shake hands and are all buddy friends! Ah ?! The end is too crushed to make the film worth for me.
