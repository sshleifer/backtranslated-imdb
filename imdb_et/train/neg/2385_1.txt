I watched this movie because I'm a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I'd give my sister a try, Rain Phoenix. I'm sorry about that. He was embarrassed and the film just has this weird plot if you want to call it. Sissy was just strange and Jellybean just sat on the toilet, both sleeping in the old mountains, what's going on? I've never been so happy in my life. It was just all the garbage. I cannot believe that the participants agreed on such a waste of film, money, time and space. Is Sissy beautiful? I thought he was everything else. These thumbs were just foolish and why do we care if he can grab it? WHAT POINT? 0 out of 10, shame poll is not 0, doesnt even deserve 1. Hopefully Rain is better in other movies, i forgive him for this one performance, i mean i won't do much better with this movie.
