I can't say much about this movie. <br /> <br /> It was a terrible movie ... I can't even tell you what made me look at it. It had so few redemption features that I don't even know where to start. <br /> <br /> The plot was unlikely to be absurd. The whole body was tense throughout the film because I couldn't wait until the terrible thing was over and done. At the end of the movie, I found myself feeling. <br /> <br /> Editing was bad, the actor was the sub-parameter, and the story was weak. Francois Robinson was cast as an American indigenous, although he is not even like the Indians. <br /> <br /> If the film is idiotic, it should be at least ridiculously stupid. It wasn't. It was just pathetic.
