Not very impressed. It's hard to offer any spoilers for this movie because the plot has almost no development. Everything turns out in the first ten minutes and from above, as it looks. The actor also seems very poor and reminds me of old black and white Maoist films that are occasionally shown on Chinese television. Although it is difficult to say about a female role, Yuwen, because the story seems to be demanded only by her as a wooden dummy. It reminds me of the bleaching star Gong Li, who somehow got a reputation as a good actor in the West to face all the time. <br /> <br /> Tian Zhuangzhuang's "The Blue Kite" was a much better film. But do not be fooled by the fact that the small town of spring was set in the late 40s. Unlike Blue Kite, the fact that this film is in a groundbreaking time is not insignificant for the plot itself, it seems that the city's ruins are nothing more than a picturesque background. <br /> <br /> I don't know if Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to drive the popularity of Chinese films in the West and to turn to foreign audiences who can't say the difference between "beautiful" "deep" or "hypnotic" and just annoying If any movie matches the "overpriced" description, that's it. I see no reason here to justify the concern about the situation in the Chinese film industry.
