I watched it with my mother and we were like ... <br /> <br /> What the hell? We didn't get it at all. I may have this wrong, but the chair had nothing to do with the death of this woman's father. This movie was terrible! This is not a movie for those who love good account. Bad temporary movie! * shakes the cane in the movie * I never see it again. And I'm a big fan of live movies! They have to leave the events to make the movies out. It drives me crazy. <br /> <br /> Whit was a butt and ugly, but she loves her more than Hugh, who was a bit nicer look at TINY. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 1/10
