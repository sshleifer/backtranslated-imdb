I got this Cuban movie at the arthouse movie club. It soon appeared after the 1935 Silly Symphony cartoon, where the symphony island was agreed with Jazz. With the recent death of Ruben Gonzalez, this old cinema-ballroom speaker and Cuban-flagged Cuban motif, this scene was set to celebrate filming and synchronized with Helms-Burton's idiotics. But then the film started. And the cinema peeling color gradually became more interesting than the messy mess on the screen. <br /> <br /> Nada Mas's story promises a lot. Carla is a boring wrapper-stamper at the Cuban post office. His only escape from the general unlikely existence is sending letters and rewriting them, making BrontÃ«n's breath-taking outbursts of fundamental human interactions. Cue has a lot of photos of photogenic cubes with joy, sadness, harm, fear and the like. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the simplicity of narrative is undermined by endless excursions in the film school, the latino caricature, the Marx brothers, and even - especially during the under-editing of the trick - the sign of the inter-school defect celluloid scratching on the face. <br /> <br /> One-dimensional characters are numerous. The post office, Cunda, is a humorless dominatrix-nosferatu. His boss-eyed accomplice, Concha, partially points to fingers, eavesdropping and butterflies. Cesar, a metal head and romantic interest, reveals the hidden writing ability when Carla leaves Miami. In an emergency (oh-so-hilarious fast-forward) a good measure is thrown. All of this would be fine in Mortadello and Filemon's comic, but with a high-quality claim with a black-and-white zero-FX valve, ahem. <br /> <br /> Nada Mas is trying to tilt "Amelie" and Il Postino's "poetry-great-redeemer" heroes-heroine-matchmakes-strangers, like Amelie, the main character is eccentric, one white woman fighting and as Il Postino, the film does not consistently reflect the constant concepts of poems, and the postman of the bicycle takes a romantic leadership position. Unfortunately, Nada Mas cannot capture the lushness and transcendence of either film. <br /> <br /> There are two One of the things that could look at this movie late in the day on television, the first of which is Carla's opening airbag made on a square floor that cuts the crossword that she is working on. Secondly, see Nada Mas's cautious example: our post Buena Vista social club obsession with Cuban artistic output can often make us blink in order to accept the noise of a bongo sound. This film should not serve as a global release - D films such as the Waiting List and Guantanamo cover much more of a similar thematic territory.
