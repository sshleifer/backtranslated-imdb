I think it's nice and trendy to see great things in the absolute emptiness of such a movie. With the many useless redundancies of many Hollywood films, we can relax and enjoy a scene without explosions, unpleasant tongues and horns with a single liner. Minimalism has its place and it can be very effective in working properly. But this movie is not one of those cases. <br /> <br /> Take long scenes without dialogue and tough, weak landscapes. I am sure they must have some great meaning and understanding because the implicit message is hidden. Action is bad ... for a happy and pedestrian ... and it has one of the worst scenes in history (at the end of the movie, if you can sit through it). The terrain is drab, and a ridiculously long ending walking walk is just as pleasant as pulling a tooth. I would call it extreme, but because the film didn't build any climax, not even in "erotic" scenes ... it would be wrong. I'm sure the script was used for filming, but with the size of the dialogue I thought it might have been written on cocktail sage. Basically, this movie doesn't offer anything interesting or amazing ... there's no big story, no stunning, no visual drama, no excitement. In addition to two or three fun moments, this movie is for two hours. Tragically boring and tough film.
