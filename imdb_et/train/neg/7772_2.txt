This is one humble film. He has no real plot. We are never given any motives other than wealth. Characters are some of the worst actors ever to film. The threat seems to be supernatural but is then controlled by the three older people. Why do they do what they do; to fear other members of the group? I do not know. There are some fog machines that roll around and everyone seems to be scared. Does it do anything? I do not know. There is nudity in itself. I'm always surprised to see it in old movies. Things have actually started these days. Anyway, people move around like chickens, ax ready. They have no plan; there are no resources; nothing. There are about five foolish peaks in the movie. Who are these people and "is" there a ghost or demon. What happened to other people? I'm challenging someone to tell me that trust. What a mess.
