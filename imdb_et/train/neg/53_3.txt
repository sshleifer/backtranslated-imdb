I learn Catalan and I was glad to find El Mar, which is mostly a Catalan dialogue, in my art museum store. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... is not so happy to have seen it. br /> <br /> Yes, as other reviewers have said, it's well done and captured. Although the opening order of children is shockingly violent, it has worked well and convinced. (For the most part, this is ... Is Mallorquins splitting the body of a dead body in the middle of the middle of the city, looking at the dead man's 10-year-old boy?) Oh, well ... little details. Until now, he had something of a self-evident non-magical labyrinth of Pan, which was also the Spanish Civil War. <br /> <br /> Fast forward and three kids who survived have come of age. Francisca is a nun who works in a tuberculosis sanatorium and two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, both are patients. I know, but hey, things happen. <br /> <br /> The problem, as with so many Spanish films (excuses for Almodovar fans), is that with one exception (Francisca) the characters are just as dangerous *. Their motivations, personalities and dialogue are often simply inconsistent. <br /> <br /> What's more, it falls into a somewhat terrible saddle surplus. Get ready for a lot of pain and lots of blood. The reviewer, who called it "potboiler", is on the right track. If it had been done 40 years ago, the poster would have said: SEE ALSO LOVE! RAPE !! MURDER !! MUTILATION !! FANATICISM !! ANIMAL FIGHTING! BETRAYAL !! <br /> <br /> The opening order is not nearly enough to make the characters' personalities and relationships credible. In order to work, there should have been several setbacks to complete the characters. As it is, the strange and frustrating cross between the Sun, Sister Moon and Pulp Fiction seems to be. If it sounds like something you have to see, enjoy. I think I'm going to do something that doesn't make me feel like I have a shower to wash clean and dark. <br /> <br /> In Catalan, it is the Mallorqui break, which is relatively different from the Barcelona dialect, although I was surprised by the commentary that even Barcelonans needs Catalan subtitles to understand it.
