I wasn't particularly impressed with this film, which has weak music and lasts only 40 minutes. Thanks to God because I slept. I use the time well to show the passage of time for light and shadow movement, people, water, clouds, and so on. Unfortunately, that's all. <br /> <br /> My preference is preceded by the excellent Koyaanisqatsi, made in 1983 in 87 minutes, and to prove that the sequel may be better than the original, Powaqqsi was made in 1988 in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Try them both.
