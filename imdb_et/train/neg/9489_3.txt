In theory, films should be a form of entertainment. Although it does not include documentaries or other forms of experimental filmmaking; most movies, especially genre films, do not only have to tell the story or message, but also in some way to the entertainment of their target audience. All this says that, in my opinion, a bad movie with a low film production value or a low budget is a bad movie that is boring. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" or "Damned", as is known in the US, is a bad film simply because it is not simply involved and irreversibly boring and tiring. Although this is a very good prerequisite, it is just a bad development and mediocre action does not improve things. On the other hand, the film would probably have been a good or even classic B-film, but here it is just a bad attempt to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Director Philip J. Jones talks about James Bishop (Matt Stasi), a young psychiatrist who just got his dream job in St. Petersburg. Andrew Mental Hospital; but the old shelter seems to be a hidden secret. After some of the mysterious deaths of some patients and constant rumors of satanic practices, James decides what is going on; only to find the disbelief of his boss, McCort (Bruce Payne), who believes that the bishop is going as mad as his patients. much to wish. In an effort to make a supernatural psychological thriller, Jones is going to be an easy way out and full of clichés from every genre. Of course, there are many good films that are full of clichés; But in "Hellborn", every single person is wasted and has become a cheap scare to get things moving, resulting in a boring and predictable story. <br /> <br /> Action is mostly mediocre one big exception: Bruce Payne delivers top-notch performance that makes the film worthy of such good deeds. Matt Stasi is very weak when the driver is characteristic and the rest casts unforgettable performances. <br /> <br /> Despite all these errors, one thing must be written about "Hellborn"; it has a visual appearance for a very good budget and is very similar to today's big budget Hollywod's "horror" productions. Also make-up and prosthesis are done very well and the main antagonist designs are pretty good. Unfortunately, the other special effects are terrible and outdated, making a huge contrast to make-up and prosthesis. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" is a movie that has some good things beyond its grave shortcomings with terrible results. Hardcore horror or b-movie fans may be interested in this premise, but it is a boring and tiring experience. 3/10
