This is probably the worst film I've ever seen. Worse than the most terrible American dross; worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey America dross par excellence. I can only imagine that the writer and the manufacturer took enormous amounts of recreational drugs, and when I was discussing the plot, I thought it was a good idea. this is not. This is a surprising garbage in Satan's own intestine (who would probably have written a better script if he had given his thought to it). Robert Jones, as an Exce producer who spends our taxpayers' money (lottery money people) on this piece of thought, should be responsible. Who on earth thought the restoration of Deathline would be good? I ask you - camp as a Christmas tree, death ... "The doors of me" is a classic really bad British film, we really don't need a reminder. And we definitely do not need this bad, the second level, the poorly written, the badly developed and the bad garbage. That's all about the UK financial institution that brought us the Sex Animals for potato men ... I'm talking about my case. <br /> <br /> Don't pay money to see it. It is an absolute and perfect mess - one sustainable producers of grace is that they got huge cash ... our money ... to do it. They should hang their head in shame. <br /> <br /> I am divided on the low and low level of this movie. This makes me Mgr that our national film support body thought it was worth supporting. The British film industry has no hope, while the idiots are showing it. Harvey Wienstein where are you? Come back, we'll forgive you !!!
