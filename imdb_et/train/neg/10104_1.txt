I only looked at this first 30 minutes and what I saw was the whole piece. The scenes I saw were so bad as Ed Wood's film. No, it was a hundred times worse. Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director, but it's not true; The idiot who drove this spam is the WORST director ever. <br /> <br /> American policeman with German accent! "Police station" was on the table with a wall-mounted sign "Police Station". There's a fist struggle where the strikes are clearly out of the TEN FEET. <br /> <br /> This cop pulls the women, confirms them and takes them to the warehouse. He tells his police partner to wait in the car. Then he comes out of the warehouse, carrying the bag. The police partner thinks maybe it is not right that his partner may be a bad cop who murders these women, but he is not sure if this will happen because - he's a moor! The dialogue is totally stupid, the actor is terrible and the characters are acting in a stupid way I've seen on the screen. It is quite obvious to the police partner that he is abducting these women illegally, and he is killing them and taking them in stock and returning to a car with a companion, but the same partner who is there all the time doesn't know what's going on! <br /> <br /> The director of this movie is a complete cage. I stopped the movie in 30 minutes because I couldn't take it anymore. It must be one of the WORST movies I've ever seen, and I won't waste any more writing this review. <br /> <br /> Totally WORTHLESS.
