I'd put it at the top of my movie files, which is invisible in the Trash category! There are movies that are bad, but the worst are those that are invisible, but you think they like it because they should be good for you! Sex sequences that are so shocking today could not even produce a rabbit. The so-called controversial policy is strictly the amateur high school Marxism of high school friends. The film is self-conscious in the worse sense of the term. Photography is roughly black and white. Some scenes are not in focus or in the wrong corners. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art? <br /> <br />
