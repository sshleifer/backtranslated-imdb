This film comes directly from the dark cave of Full Moon Entertainment. In the first half of the 1990s, this production company gained fame and happiness, producing terribly bad and cheesy horror films. The most famous disasters in their ouvre are "Subspecies", "Seedpeople" and "Trancers". None of them are recommended or Dr. Mordrid. The hyperactive director Charles Band came to his movie to the right company. Doctor Mordrid is amazingly stupid and cheesy and almost completely humorous. I only saw it because he was marking Jeffrey Combs. I learned that he may have several drawbacks when you are his fan. For every good movie, it seems he has made 5 lower. Anyway, there is a story about the battle between two old witches. One good person who has been here for 150 years to protect people (Jeffrey as Dr.Mordrid) and one of the freaks called Kabal. For some reason, he wants to destroy any human life. The combs get their guide from the mentor. This "boy" exists only from a pair of space eyes. Very very cheesy, that's it! Each time and at the same time a dazzling beam is displayed on the screen, but it is the only special form of effect that this film has received. The whole thing is just a bit of whining and chewing and when two wizards end up coming in, it's over before you know it ... I'd have been waiting for the evil wizard to start fighting at least a bit, but nooooooo .. .. In some scenes you can really to discover some originality and creativity (such as Jeffrey's lecture on the impact of the month on criminals) and if you really pay attention, you may even find very small but nice aspects (such as a log called Edgar Allen), but in general it is a terrible waste of time and energy. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey and maybe he's a superhero in my eyes ... but he doesn't have a foolish maill for that.
