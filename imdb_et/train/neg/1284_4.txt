This film was a long-term structure without top level. People who end up with sword fighting as big as they should, must be in their minds or not. Too often this film became soft. I'm not saying soft films are bad. But no matter how much sugar you have, the T-bone fry should not have room. This film was supposed to be a revenge for crimes against culture, but ultimately it was a small bar-brawl. And there was only one of them who really knew what the sword was; The character of Tim Roth (and yes, he plays him well). Rob Roy was a weak hero who didn't know how to use the sword, and the way he "won" was disgraceful. For the drama, it was the periods of the film, but the best results have to go from Scotland. This is one breath called "soap" in my book.
