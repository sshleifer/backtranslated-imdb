Poor Tobe Hopper. He was leading the all-time horror class "Texas Chaimsaw Massacre". Since then, everything he has done has been terrible. It's probably the worst ... and it says a lot. It's about a man (Brad Dourif) who has the ability to ignite things (and people) ... or something like that. Hardly an original idea (someone remembers "Firestarter"?) This is a real confusion ... literally everything is wrong! Pathetic acts (even Dourif!), Asinine script, harsh production values, special special effects ... everything is BAD !!!!! Must stay ... not even laugh.
