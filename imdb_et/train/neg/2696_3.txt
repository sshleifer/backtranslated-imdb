I know John Singleton is a wise man who made Boyz N Hood, so how did he write and direct it? It's like a bad "pilot for the first time to college" teen, soap, boring stereotypes and clich√©s parade with some free violence to make it a commercial proposition, I think. Who would have thought that a rapeseed victim would be seafood in the form of a sausage? An angry loner would have been attacked by a neo-Nazi group (and would be in the black-Jewish room - just laugh!) Even Laurence Fishburne's creepy reactive history Professor just annoyed me and I love this man. like all the people involved in this movie lost the plot. Except Busta Rhymes, of course. Big ups.
