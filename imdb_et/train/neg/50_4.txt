The movie of the three parts "horror", where some guy is in an abandoned house, which makes the viewer go "out" and (unfortunately) gives us three stories to prove why. <br /> <br /> The first story is a young couple in a car accident who meets two psychics. This leads to up to two completely predictable revolutions. However, it is fast (about 15 minutes), violent, well-behaved and well done. Predictable but enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The second involves a man who runs after a big sum of money is stolen. His car breaks down, the dog attacks and stops at a nearby clinic. Very obvious, badly done and very slow. Even after 30 minutes it's too long. Good operation is fine. <br /> <br /> The third is just barely a story. It includes a beautiful, lonely woman who is looking for Mr right. It has beautiful designs, nice erotic feel and nice sex. But (again) predictable and not even far scary. <br /> <br /> It ends very foolishly. <br /> <br /> First of all, you should look at the first one, but that is the case. Adjust it, then turn it off.
