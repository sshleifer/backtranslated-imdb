The only quality of redemption of this movie is the real story ... Otherwise, this movie was terrible. The action was ridiculously bad and the design was cheesy and very sticky. The story was decent, but it was very difficult to see because of the very scary behavior. I wouldn't recommend watching it ... The only redeeming quality of this movie was that the actors were somewhat attractive ... Especially Ryan Bauer, the man who plays the soap opera star. Some edits were well done, but there are consistency errors all over the place ... I'm just getting sick and tired of watching bad movies that are bad ... Can we get good right now?
