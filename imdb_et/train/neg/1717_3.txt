Here we have 2 misunderstood children who never stood before a cruel and anti-poverty existence: Robin Hoods, who was stressed by the police for persecution because they were sometimes wild. Gad! According to this, Bonnie Missouri was the most wonderful little thing west of Missouri, taught to be a psychopathic murderer who loved someone who didn't want to hurt anyone ... he just wanted things without much energy to get them. Poorly worked, poorly filmed, incredible dialogue, unrealistic use of weapons, gore that seemed like a grape jelly as a real thing. Avoid this bilgewater. Slightly down. -5 stars.
