I admit. I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and has made it a mission to see all the films she has (unfortunately, it contains terrible movies Batman and robin, The Avengers) and that. /> it must be the worst film I've ever seen. (Yes, it's even smaller than Avengers). everyone sees it lost and it is insecure. Even if you think Uma is a goddess like me, please don't leave yourself under this movie. you hate yourself next morning.
