Simply put, this is the worst movie from "Police Academy: Mission to Moscow" (if you liked the movie you probably like). <br /> <br /> What did they mean? Some ideas should remain just that, the idea. The fact that this idea could be filmed should be a crime. <br /> <br /> What was so bad I hear you ask. One word ... ALL. <br /> <br /> Postpay: $ 4.50 Watch Time: 89 minutes <br /> <br /> I want a refund for both!
