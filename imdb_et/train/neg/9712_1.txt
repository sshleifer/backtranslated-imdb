This film is one of the most wildly distorted histories. This film does not speak terribly inaccurately in respect of the hundreds of thousands of enslaved labor of the Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous peoples, which sadist Japan died and tormented. The bridge was built "over the white man's body", as the Japanese chief engineer said. It is disgusting that such inexplicable horrors by Japanese prisoners are the source of the film, where the bridge itself is not close to the real bridge accuracy. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, not wood. What are the survivors who are still alive? They hate the movie and everything he should represent. Their friends were hungry, tortured and murdered by cruel sadists. Those who do not die in dysantry, hunger or illness are deeply hurt by the film that makes such a dark time.
