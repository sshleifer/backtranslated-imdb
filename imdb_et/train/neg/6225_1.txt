I doubt it is even a cult film. I loved Gram Parsons to be sure and I didn't expect much of this movie and got even less. What could have been smart and touching was campy. It lacked music that made the Gram and was more filler than cheap dog food. There was no Gram or the colorful people of this era in the background. Even the Gram fan and all fans of his famous "afterlife adventures" versions did not even know the characters shown. The rock and the role are full of stories, also good, but they should take salt with the blade. They can be great stories, though exaggerated. But this movie took a good story and became faithful. The stealing of any body and the ensuing consequences should never be a boring story, but they did it forever. I am tempted to steal all the copies of Grand Theft Parsons, direct them to the desert and burn them all.
