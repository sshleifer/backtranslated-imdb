Ok, I've seen a lot of movies about witches and occult, but it was just weird. This film begins with the witch cult, which is really led by a bad Orson Wells, who plays a powerful role (did not get anyone who saw and acted more than Satan), he just didn't belong to this movie at all. But anyway, the sand takes on a new member and picks up a doll that resembles someone and makes him squeak. A woman who had a failure and her husband went on a bus to a place called Lillith and a woman in the meantime sees her sister or who calls her and warns her to stay away from her and never use her abilities there or she dies. After they have settled in a strange city, a couple will discover that all the inhabitants are all witches and it becomes nervous and fears all its neighbors and friends. Then a strange thing will happen because the lady will discover the funeral that takes place on a hill that suddenly breaks down (it was horrible), as well as saw a little boy belonging to Orson Wells at the playground to later ask her to bring her back. The woman soon tries to escape from the city, but only to find the trap of her inhabitants and authorities and finds that she ignores what the spirit is trying to warn her. This movie is ok, it's hidden, but it really could have been much better than Orson was there.
