First of all I would like to say that only user comments left me with tears in my eyes. One remark that bad SF movies become good comedies is the right sign. MST3000 made it alive. <br /> <br /> If you look at ANGRY RED PLANET as a 10-year comic book reader's dream since 1959, you have the handle of this importer. All the elements are there: pseudo-science, sometimes logical, more childishly. Young boys' attitude to gender, "gigolo" captain (good invitation to it, boys!), Making eyes "scientist", hair so red, it is a miracle that it does not erase fire signals. Mars's ridiculous idea as such a strange planet that all glows red, but one alien monster has a mouse face, and a bubble alien has an eye that rotates like a child's toy. Comic relief, overweight astronaut (!), Who sounds like he has never finished 8th grade in Brooklyn and has his own Pistol Psychotic fixation. And of course the mere fact that the alien is dangerously evil. If these people had met with E.T., they would be flat for two seconds! Indeed "OW"! <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong. I rated this movie low. However, it is never boring (unless the scientist tries to explain everything - just to make it all sound more ridiculous), and you have to admit that your little boy's heart does it a few times to jump. <br /> <br /> Okay, don't admit it. I guess you never had 10.
