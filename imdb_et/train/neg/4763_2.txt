The main reason for this review is that I found this great gaming and worthy movie experience that is worth the 1972 movie. If I can save anyone from watching it, I have done a good job. <br /> <br /> This "new" version is full of talent and it all goes wrong. Kenneth Branagh OK is a ugly, sterile, one set of notes. He continues filming the film from every artistic, disturbing, self-centered angle. We see reflections of stainless steel actresses, security controls, over 200 feet, close to eyes, jaws and on and on. The Nobel laureate introduces somewhat unpleasant lengths of homosexual torture, which both sides are falsifying. Given this character, how do I know? Characteristic features that are so richly drawn in the original are crass and unsympathetic. The running time is cut by one hour, which is either the real problem or the coolest thing the director did to us. Participants perform their rows efficiently, but something they say or do is far from believable. The Jewish law is over Caine, but if he is a credited producer, he must have Branaghi's blessing. <br /> <br /> All in all, I found it ugly to look at the former classics. Why was it even done? The paying public spent less than $ 4M worldwide to see it! Vanity piece that fails every step.
