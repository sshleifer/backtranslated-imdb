I agree with the last comment that may be the worst film ever made. I also had to move most of this movie forward. Michael Madsen must make this movie for someone's benefit. The quality of the image is grainy all the way. And what a small plot is, it's just stupid. I'll give this movie to 10 out of 10 if I could give it a lower score I would like.
