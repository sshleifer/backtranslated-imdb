There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? And why are they doing this whistle? The premise is absurd. Action is one-dimensional. Special effects have been overcome. And this movie is one endless battle of weapons that is from any of the most busy Hollywood-produced shots. But if they had been good pictures, all the first five minutes would be dead and there would be no movie. Too bad that didn't happen. The temptation to turn it off several times, I stayed with it to see how bad it might be. I'm glad I did because (SPOILER?) Is the last line of all the burning, depressing scenario of crowning stupidity. In addition to the general horror of the film, I am deeply concerned about its impact on young audiences. The Americans threw this in a mess, and then they don't know why events like Columbine happen. This is a truly banal cinema on the Brobdingnagia scale!
