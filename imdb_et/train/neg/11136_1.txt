This is only the second time I have felt compelled to comment on the film about the film. The first time was probably the best movie I've seen and what was for Memento. <br /> <br /> Darkwolf's vision is at the other end of the scale compared to Memento, as was the worst in the film. In addition to the two scenes containing naked women, there is nothing in this movie to bring it out of the trash. <br /> <br /> Let's see, effects, cliched script, bad behavior, and about 90 minutes. My wife and I laughed over the majority, how bad it was. Amazingly, I looked at it until I knew it! AVOID !!!
