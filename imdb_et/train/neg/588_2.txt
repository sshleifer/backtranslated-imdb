I'm forced to write a review of this IMAX feature to warn others to save their money. Almost any episode of Desmond Morris's "Human Animal" or David Suzuki's "Nature of Things" could make better use of the material presented. Not only does the director use the incredible 65-70 mm IMAX film and a huge screen, but everything on the screen is remarkable, given the availability of the above mentioned programs. Viewers will be introduced to pregnant Heather, her husband Buster and their brothers and sisters. We watch them endlessly forty minutes when they eat, sweat, listen to music, and so on. While we are given access to scenes within the digestive tract of humans and we learn the natural diving reflexes of babies, do we really learn more than the graduates of the highest level? Are we even with the transatlantic Heather entertainment? Do we care? Avoid this movie at all costs. If you want to see the IMAX feature, I offer a beautifully captured "India: Tiger Kingdom" or technically exciting "Space Station 3D". Trust me.
