It says that the girl named Susan Montford wrote and directed the film. No wonder he doesn't have any other credits to write or manage his name. He made a serious professional mistake in choosing a career. This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium. <br /> <br /> The main thing about this movie, except for the ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak strokes, is LOGIC's blatant and complete lack. ** After leaving the mall, he approaches the four thieves when they surround him. Tell me what a woman aggressively SHOVE a potential attacker surrounded and insulting them orally? I don't think after the attack begins, because then it is naturally normal for someone to win back. But he pulled this man and increased it to the next level. No woman would do it if she didn't have 1) a weapon, 2) is sure knowing that the backup is very close and so it is a relatively safe threat, or 3) the attackers are so young and weak that she is pretty sure she might take them. No such situation occurred, so that he acted like someone who asked for rape or looting. And by the way, when the security guards approached, when SOON, when he reached Kim Basinger's sight, why didn't he just want to turn to help or shout? <br /> <br /> ** If he drives after the security guard has left his head, he will drive into an abandoned district and run together. He had a three-minute leader at the head, instead of just walking behind the houses and climbing the gardens and continuing, he gets out of his red toolbox and starts to mess around. I understand he was trying to repair his car, but he should have run. <br /> <br /> (I didn't even want to read this chronological summary of the movie because I lose people who do their reviews, but it happens that every major sequence in this movie has something so blatant that I have to comment on it ). <br /> <br /> ** Why should she wear a white red toolbox when she's trying to go out in the dark? When he catches, one joke requires that he open the toolbox. First of all, on the contrary, it finally opens. And takes out the wrench. This scene is so rich as the complete failure of the dramatic effect lies in what I need to break, this is one of the most stupid scenes in the film. If you are asked to open the box, it will first resist, as if it were going to somehow get one of the rogues to open that anger after it didn't open, just as someone in some feature film might have some device that the enemy requires a person to touch / push / open / manipulate, and if that hero refuses to open it, the enemy grabs this device only to let the device automatically release the chemical / let him face / render it was unconscious, which was the whole hero's plan. It looks like this is what they were trying to do with Kim Basinger because he opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out WRENCH and sends him one of the rogue and gets somehow from him and three others. <br /> ** The rest of the movie, what you see is the suburban house woman sliding around the forest when she carries her red toolbox, taking out a variety of tools that are used as a weapon to kill her soldiers. <br /> <br /> ** When he fled, how did he finally go to BACK where the thugs were? I think it was the scene where they had the radio that played the respect of the dead guy. He somehow threw them up when I thought he was moving for them. <br /> <br /> ** Finally, this whole assumption is so weak, because the whole reason he first drives is because he was guilty of persecution, he was a witness for the murder they had previously committed against the security officer, and they they felt they had to kill him. How ridiculous. If one of the rogues even said they could just leave the city and return to any city they traveled from, but he didn't see them anyway, and he probably didn't get a number plate. Even if these opportunities do not benefit them, how can hell and kill them who kill them improve their chances of getting their original murder?
