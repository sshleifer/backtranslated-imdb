Although I had some hopes for this movie, especially since I enjoy so much Jason Segel (Freaks & Geeks, undeclared), I have to say that it was one of the worst films I've seen in the last memory (Loser and Dr T and women) is also in this list). <br /> <br /> Yes, from a loud moment the couple was laughing, even though the film might have been so much better. The prerequisites were not bad scammers who cheat their way through the college to meet when someone has discovered them. The problem is that the characters were all so unlikely that I didn't care about them. An extremist (gifted by Jason Schwartzman) was such a psychopath that it wasn't that funny to watch him - he wasn't very funny or charming, he was just a crazy loser who was actually quite dangerous and not fun to watch. Editing a movie was hard to follow - it was a cut between fantasy and reality, and it was often unclear what. Only two or three gang scams were really shown, you just had to believe they were indeed scam artists - their schemes would have shown a better movie. The so-called love story was absurd and unbelievable, in fact it was silly and poorly written and directed at the whole. I can go about the shortcomings of the movie, but you get the idea. Not worth the $ 4 rent or gas it takes to record and exit the movie!
