The same old old Che. It completely ignored the truly interesting facts of Che's true character. Sodeberg updates Che's same boring story. To attract silver, the Argentinean boy, who was so shocked by poverty, became Robin Hood, the fighter for the poor, until finally CIA was murdered. Yes, yes, I heard it before, BORING AND UNTRUE!. Che Guevara's reality is very different and much more explosive! The facts show that he was totalitarian with the messiah who wanted to openly establish the Maoist tyranny in the world. He was so fanatical that, at the hottest time of the Cold War, he even asked the Soviet Union for a doll in New York, Washington or Los Angeles and brought the end of the world. CHe invited Khrushchev to launch a nuclear attack on US cities. For the rest of his life, he announced that if his finger had been on the button, he would have forced it. When Khrushchev supported and literally saved the world, Che was angry with "betrayal". If Che's recommendations were followed, you will not read this review right now. How would a murderous maniac become a much more interesting film for pop art? It is unbelievable that no filmmaker is brave enough to show Che's actual side and his posthumous media. HOW TO OSAKE Oscar Oscar! I thought making an independent movie meant taking REAL RISKS and GROUNDBRAKING! They only stick to "safe counter culture", "Che cool", "Wall Street bad", "Republican = Nazi", "Bush ex Hitler", "NRA is worse than KGB", "Christians are fanatics and stupid", etc. .. ad nauseum. Oooh, how brave how the mind blows. Tres anti-mainstream and edgy. I want them to have real cojones and fight for an independent movie oligarchy! It would be really bold!
