This movie is a special Pia Zadora! Looking at it, I was reminded of a classic comic book with a Hollywood star. needs an urgent need for a second role, but is afraid of getting a B-film or a soft porn role as a standard prediction; who says in his staging session: "Of course, I don't usually do nudity roles, but if it is artistically necessary for the movie ...............". This memory highlighted a very nasty image of a similar drawing showing Piat at such a session, saying: "Of course I don't usually take any tasks that require actual action, but if it really gives me a position to improve my status symbol ...... ............ ". This is probably an extremely unfair, but a shining story is the guilt of Harold Robbins's book; Given the nature of the story, Pia's risk positions will certainly not get too much attention and maybe Pia (who ever won a butterfly-winning prize) will deliberately play its part instead of trying to act almost in an inexperienced role. Critics usually point to participants as a problem when the film proves disappointment, but it is extremely unfair; screenwriters and directors are more often culprits. The real problem with "Lonely Lady" is that the scenario, like the original book, looks for sensation rather than substance, and nothing can help. <br /> <br /> The scenario of this movie is debilitating, but whether the story could have been filmed with a better script, tauterian leadership and truly competent action must remain a matter of personal judgment. When released, my viewer's judgment will depend on whether I appreciate my personal opinion or appreciate the extent to which the film can deliver what it intends to do. My personal rating would be two out of ten; but to some extent, this film is likely to give exactly what its sponsors intend to do, and it makes four out of ten quality judgments reasonable. Being a charity and wanting to make it clear that I don't blame Pia for his disappointment, I give the IMDb rating to four.
