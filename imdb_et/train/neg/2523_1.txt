R O B O T J O X. <br /> <br /> Burn the captain. <br /> <br /> Grotesque's terrible. <br /> <br /> Unfinished; not closed. <br /> <br /> Fully and completely the worst movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Replace "Pluto Nash Adventures" as always the worst movie. <br /> <br /> I hate this completely missing, unmodified, unwritten, undirected, without confusion about what is called "Robot Jox" - and I just discovered - they did another!?!? I apologize for Adma Sandler (Zohar the Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) for hating their films. The confusion of this thing makes these films bad - not terrible and grotesque. This is the only movie I've ever said - remove it from NETFLIX - NOW !!! Out of 10,000 people in 10 found this comment helpful.
