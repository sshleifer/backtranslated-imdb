Okay, if you've seen a circle, you've basically seen The Grudge. He's trying to be scary because he just has a clever camera job and loud sounds, but it's not unhappy. The plot, if you call it, is weak and quite full of holes, for example, how would a care center know that Yoko did not appear when the people who lived in the house were not there? And it's not quite clear what Bill Pullman's character was to do. He just came out somewhere to develop the plot. It didn't make much sense what happened to the original family. Who's hanging in the room, little boy or dad? And was Yoko alive or dead when the care center man found it? Too many unanswered questions and I was too bored to think more.
