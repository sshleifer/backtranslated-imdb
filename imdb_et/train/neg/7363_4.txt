The only reason I saw "Shakedown" was that it was Erika Eleniak. She is sexy as always, but she plays Wolf Larson, the other violin leader. It is a pity because it has more opportunities for action than it is allowed to show here. The film is largely composed of endless beats that are rapidly becoming monotonous - especially when you see mostly armed boys with machines constantly from Larson and from him who is only armed with a revolver (which may never end up on the balls). quite easily. The effects of the earthquake are decent, but there are also many blurred movements and bad CGI explosions. As a psychotic "spiritual leader", Ron Perlman is trying, but the pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo he has to pull out is just boring. Graduates of Eleniak, Perlman or Larson (assuming they have it) may want to look at it, while others are hardly worth renting. (* 1/2)
