If you want an unwanted and reasonably amusing hour or so, that's right. It's not that bad, really. Yes, it has lost more of a logical sense when I take care of it, and can tax people's patience - like myself - I have to admit - sometimes tossing things on TV, but that's at least funny. Just because it's not always funny, there's no need to let it go. <br /> <br /> However, if you have read a book or any other book from Brookmyre, it would probably be best avoided. I've read all of them and when I first watched this movie, I despised it. I have thrown it thoroughly and somewhat on the second site. The TV channel has virtually no importance to the book, and it is only for annoying and many loyal (and certainly robbed) Brookmyre fans. <br /> <br /> The best bit of advice ..? Look at it, read the book and only do your comparisons and send your decision.
