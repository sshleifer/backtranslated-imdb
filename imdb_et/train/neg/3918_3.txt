This film may be the biggest backlog of films on the basis of IMDb surveys. In general, I found it to be a secondary film. <br /> <br /> Leslie Cheung is definitely satisfying, because the antihero and Ma Wu are joyful in their character. On the other hand, I'm Wu makeup (facial hair) so obviously fake that I just couldn't take her seriously. She looked like an overweight teenager dressed for Halloween, with a $ 4.95 sticky beard. The tongue was seen as a bad monster of the 1950s, although POV's pictures of language were more reminiscent of Sam Raim's trademark pictures in the latest Trilogy of Evil Dead. Pyrotechnics were busy and the last battle is about as dull as you can. (Actually, it reminded me most of the "Lost in Space" episode where Robinsons were caught in a sand break and ...) <br /> <br /> The plot was not very original and has been spoken countless times in the form of European fairy tales. There is no intercourse or twist on the plot. In fact, you know as soon as you introduce to the good who are bad and who will survive. <br /> <br /> I just returned this movie to Netflix and then I sat down to write this review. The first thing I did was the date of production. Yes, it says 1987 ... not in 1967 that I thought it could be. And it comes from quite a few: production values ​​and FX are typical for the 1960s. Plot and action seem much older, because Hollywood was actually an interesting and challenging movie in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> ** *****
