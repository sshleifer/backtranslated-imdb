I have to admit that I didn't finish this movie because it was so stupid and didn't look at it. I looked at it with the kids in the full room, who also didn't laugh at foolish and raw humor. Director Bob Dolman seems to be so obsessed with sphincters and genitals that it's more important to the real story that I grew up. It's not a good movie for kids! In addition to being so raw, it's just a stupid movie with a bad stream and no intelligence. What is a waste of a perfectly good story. If you read a book, if you were younger and loved it, don't waste your time looking at a movie that so badly bounces that it makes you angry. Buy your kids instead of the book.
