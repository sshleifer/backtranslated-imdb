Every time a movie that takes me out and reminds me that my taste in the movies I watch is not always impeccable, so often. I usually stayed away from such things, but some glowing comments and the Rohmer lineage deceived me. <br /> <br /> The original and intriguing news is in production, where Rohmer is basically actors in the painted (digital) era of the Revolution in France. It accelerates quickly and becomes as interesting as looking at the color shape. What we are left with is the boring and cumbersome film of the 18th century French aristocrats. No character is appealing or compassionate. This pace is so funny, the dialogue is so difficult, and the relationship is obviously a stranger to Rohmer that I didn't care about whose head rolled, who kept, who or what the devil should keep. The film would have benefited somewhat from the emotional structure and music score (there are very good classical music). Despite the fact that the film is so "talkative", it plays a lot like a silent movie and the worst kind of movie, a boring and uninteresting movie about endlessly interesting topics. Only the most intelligent French historians find something for this film because this dose seems to paint well-known events from a new angle (Lady is English and royal). Otherwise, avoid this cost at all if you do not suffer from insomnia (I left twice).
