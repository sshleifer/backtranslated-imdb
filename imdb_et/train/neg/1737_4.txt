The final film, Ernst Lubitsch, graduated from Otto Preminger after Lubitsch's premature death during production, is a dramatist of complexity and stupidity, romance and music, fantasy and costume. The 19th-century castle in south-eastern Europe falls into the hands of its sworn enemy, the leader of the Hungarian uprising leader; he is assisted by his ancestor, whose painted picture magically lives. Betty Grable, a long blond wig decorated with flowers, has never been more beautiful and her songs are very pleasing. Unfortunately, this script (taken by Samson Raphaelson, Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch) has different ideas that don't succeed or entertain. The results are good looking, but unabsorbed. * 1/2 from ****
