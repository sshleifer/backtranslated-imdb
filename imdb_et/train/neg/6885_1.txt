... otherwise strange, falsely existent, Oedipal comedy. <br /> <br /> I was a single victim of 7:20 screening today (3 days after the movie was opened), so there's some satisfaction knowing that moviegoers are listening to warnings. <br /> <br /> Bloom is off. The nascent double chin is not his fault; but his geeky child shticki reversal in another bad wig just doesn't work. It would be another crime if it were Eli Wallach's last screen. Diane Keaton is likely to survive this increase in wages - basically because so few have seen it, the worst vehicle she has chosen in recent weeks. <br /> <br /> Tonight I was alone in the theater (laughing, even) when Daniels was given a latitude to give the film the only three-dimensional character. He's really our best actor. <br /> <br /> All in all, even Jeff Daniels' work cannot redeem this picture.
