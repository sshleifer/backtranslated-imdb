The cheap exploitation of mothers is looking for her daughter, kidnapped by people who make snuff. The trail is run by the mother all over Europe when she is looking for her baby, and we need to fall asleep before our audience. <br /> <br /> This is one of countless soft-core movies made for people who want to get excitement from porn with stigma or the dangers that appear on their credit card bill. Personally, I would like stigma, because these films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we see. Suppose this is a sexy thriller, but not. Most often people talk about their things, followed by a lot of walking from place to place and leading to management. Periodically through the movie, different people get rid of it, and everything is more than a touch of S & M. Violence and fetish material are kind of provoking laughter as horror or even excitement, all of which are so incredibly fake. Worse still, there is not enough nudity to make it interesting. (Basically, this is the course for many of these movies) <br /> <br /> You forgive me for the lack of details, but it's just a boring boring film that I missed in the hope that something will happen remotely. , but nothing. The most interesting thing was a blonde hairy woolen shirt with a big bite and the size of Buick's nose. I looked at her with admirable admiration, thinking what she had looked like a young girl and wondering if she had had plastic surgery, not the type of things you should think of in a thrilling thriller. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
