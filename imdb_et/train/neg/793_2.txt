I wasn't sure how to rate this movie because it was so bad that it was really funny. I'm not a fan of Gackt in any way, though he's gifted, despite the strange pseudonym that sounds like a coughing cat with a hair ball. I always thought Hyde was talented, Faith is an interesting album. <br /> <br /> But the theme here is people. This movie is ridiculous. It is so up and meaningless that it is a parody of almost supernatural films. <br /> <br /> The film has almost no plot here except that it is gangster friends with vampires. In a way, this film reminded me of Spider-Man 3, how there were too many ideas that didn't allow enough time to pay attention to one of them. <br /> <br /> The locations were ridiculous. Fast to deliver, almost hard to understand with choreography that is so ridiculously bad. Although Hyde saw a very stylish style of action, but this is the redemption of the movie. I'm a mammal for good movies, but it was terribly done. Although the final shootout was OK and highlighting this otherwise depressing movie. <br /> <br /> It's moving between genres, not good. She wants to be a drama or a momentum or a horror or a romance ... what the hell. <br /> <br /> If this review makes you crazy, why? Is Gackt and Hyde your love? Don't be fooled, this MOVIE IS BAD.
