The only redeeming quality that is in this all-embracing melodrama is the South France landscape and the voice of Nana Mascour, who sings the thematic song. Stephanie Powers is an unsuccessful and unfair accent. As already said, is he too old to play 18 years old and looks too young as a grandmother with a college age class? Lee Remick is good, though he is bored in his later years. The talented Joanna Lumley is still being used and will be able to watch forever when her middle-aged son (Robert Urich) finally marries grandmother Stephanie Powers. Stacey Keach's ceaseless arrogance doesn't know what these women saw her. Don't you know how any of the viewers could be over-depicted? The most reliable results are Ian Richardson, who makes the remainder look like amateurs. It draws the fidelity that the beautiful male persons of this epic will never be alone when patiently waiting for the subject of their beliefs to end up accepting. Can anyone believe that beautiful Robert Urich will remain decades alone, waiting for Stephanie Powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposals? The connection between the Wehrmacht and the Marius of World War II is ridiculous. First, the Germans had not occupied France until the end of the Provence State War, which was controlled by the Vichy French puppet government. We see that French resistance stands in Mistral's villa as a daylight to steal the leaves, after which they all hold the bridge, waiting for the Nazi forces to overwhelm and destroy them? If you want to see a well-run mini-series placed in a foreign country, don't look at Mistral's daughter. A much better alternative would be The Thorn Birds.
