The sense of Japanese spirit, editorial and musical performance must be different from American taste, but it would have been so much that there would have been more production work. <br /> <br /> Somebody in Hollywood has to make this movie again and I think it's a big hit. The story is interesting and horrible. There are something from the edge of the city, sharp policemen, earthquakes, sanitary and mysterious salt water killings that are fascinating enough. But this story must make a little sense and maybe about 40 minutes shorter. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the "sixth-minded" effect was fully effective in this movie and it appeared from the beginning. <br /> <br /> As of now, only this hard Japanese film student should struggle to see this oh-boring movie.
