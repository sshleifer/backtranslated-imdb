Half of the reviews were good, so I took the opportunity for $ 10. Of course, Priscilla Barnes had a talk, but it wasn't much. The whole plot later that he could be another actor for the mother and the young woman a falling documentary, stretching it. He's not funny, not that it's dirty, not much, but a waste of time. Boogie Nights was based on real people who were in the adult industry. It is not based on cases that have ever occurred in industry. It may have been shocked by the popular films of today's popular films that mocked today's gonzo videos and that great orgy that they had 5 minutes to shoot a bigger orgy for bigger and better decades in the early 1970s.
