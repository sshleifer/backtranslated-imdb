I'm curious that, in fact, two films are Lena's sexual experimental side and the other half is her curiosity about political / socialism. Regardless of the director's intention, they are not twice. The director would just have to stick to Lena's romantic side and make a separate political film. Political / War Meetings, Dr. Gift, serious political interviews, hair and hairs are odd. The film seems to be a fictional documentary rather than a film. In addition to interesting sexual scenes, you can dry this movie in every way. Unlike many other reviewers, I think that naked / sexual scenes are superfluous for what it is. If you want to see real porn, then I'm sure there are better choices. Overwhelming nudity is a big attention from any plot. I think most did a good job. They played their parts credibly. Since then, American films have been so accustomed to being so used to it.
