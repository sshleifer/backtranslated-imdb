A terrible pointless and inferior film. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say, rather than characters beyond the unobtrusive stereotypes, and is based on a nervous central concept that is not very original and vaguely innovative. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell is completely wasted in what he hoped would be his answer to Jim Carey's Truman show, and replaces his usual quarry routine (really funny when you discount the Led Nights), pretty much nothing. <br /> <br /> Emma Thompson is not only slightly irritating (that some of the reviews I read here tell her about the Oscar nomination, is ridiculous), while Maggie Gyllenhaal does a decent job with a very weak script that allows Nothing besides being a character of a former law student who gave up Harvard to become a baker because he liked to make people happy. Please. The fact that he fell under Ferrell's "character" is completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Marc Forster's attempts to jazz a computer graphic show only what material he has to work with. <Br>> <br /> I was able to see or see Prestige for the third time. I would like to choose Prestige.
