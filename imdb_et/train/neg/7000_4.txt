Hollywood, a mortgage, a glamor home, and a search for profit, have barely decided on spiritual values, so it's no surprise that his attempts to study spiritual life are thin and often stupid (better go beyond studying spirituality images for Bresson, Dreyer, Rossellin, and Bergman films). "Strange Cargo" is no exception. This adventurous hybrid of adventure film, love story and religious parable trivializes the very concepts he is trying to communicate. It seems ridiculous for sure judgment and salvation to work to match Verne (Clark Gable's most furry and self-conscious) and Julie (Joan Crawford, accusing and spitting every other word trying to be the queen of harsh games). Is this a Star System patron's work at work, matching warlike egos before sending them to the M-G-M batch for further punishment? BUT. . here are good supportive performances and visually arresting moments: shady prison barracks; a fleeing boat against moonlight or a picturesque cloud image; Julie walking along the coast when the wind breezes; Julie and Monsieur Pig (Peter Lorre) Negotiations on the Blood for Freedom in the Storm; an unusually amazing gay prison prison between two convicts. . First of all, Paul Lukas is a dignified and segregated play, like Hessler, a murderer who appreciates Cambreau's virtues, but turns him back. At the most arresting moment of the film, Hessler is leaving Cambreaus outside the cabin. We hear the wind through the jungle, we see a shadow on his face that transmits a moment of fear and confidence. Then he leaves at night. At this point, Hessler achieves vagueness, depth and existential strength that no other star can achieve. is the secret of the film that his deepest compassion is against Hessler?
