Stereotypical, derivatives, unoriginal, and boring Western. Two popular stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) give performances that are far from their best and rightly so; both have superficial roles and traits, which are mainly expressed through dialogue. Heston is a sheriff who "liked the world better than it used to be" and Coburn is a "who owes something to a man who locked him and has to pay his debt". In addition, Heston is so old that he has difficulty riding a horse and Coburn is an average and tough but not as cold bloody killer as some minor villains. Apparently, the filmmakers were unable to present any original idea of ​​how to distinguish this film somewhat. (* 1/2)
