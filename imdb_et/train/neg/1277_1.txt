This film caresses me for thinking about this bone. This movie was not only bad as low budget, badly acted, etc., although it was definitely all these things. The problem with this movie is that it seemed to have deliberately tried to disturb the viewer and do it very successfully. What do I want to know if it should be a horror movie? I mean, it's definitely terrible, but not that horror movies should be. I saw the first segment that is trying to be horror and failure, but what the hell is another segment? It's just annoying. The third segment is like watching an artistic student film, which makes it an amazingly painful segment. It is frightening that this movie is not low on the bottom 100, so you get your votes (1/10) on people !! I know some people gave this a good overview, but they lie to you in a sadistic attempt to trick you. Believe me, this movie can't be liked. The only advantage of this movie is the amazing life-prolonging effect: it seems that you have gone through this film for years after the first half hour.
