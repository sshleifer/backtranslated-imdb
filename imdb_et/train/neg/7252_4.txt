DECOY is one of the independent productions made by the obvious newcomers, but it does not have all the common mistakes that most of these films sink. It has a definite story, it has enough action, photography is very good, a hero and a bad man are both terrifying men and background music is not superfluous. This is a new DVD edition, so people look here to see if it's useful. I don't know where all ten come from, because this movie is not so good even if you are the mother of a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The last movie we saw in the theater was Warner's Jw Rawlings, a very loved and wonderful book, the Order of Phoenix. Compared to PHOENIX on DECOY, think that PHOENIX (which was made by Warners) had no story, the director did not promise to act, photography was terrible, and the scary musical result was just a mess. I appreciated Phoenix "1" because the scale doesn't go down. DECOY is 4 times better - in all matters. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, give DECOY a chance. Remember that this is not a "decoy 3 - shootout" or such a meaningless one. This is the original. If your expectations are not stupid "10" scores here, you may not just enjoy the movie on your own terms.
