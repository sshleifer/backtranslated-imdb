Oh dear! What a disappointment. For decades, I have been looking at old western British television and I didn't know it was shown yesterday - most other Scott West people are coming around every few years and are usually worth seeing again. <br /> Rich colors and outdoor kits were good, but that's all I can say about this movie. I have to agree with most of the negative comments that have already been made. How many times I felt it turned off, and finally I did halfway, something I hardly ever did. <br /> <br /> Scott seemed extraordinarily greasy to girls, his two sidekicks were annoying and so Mexican bandit boy. And I feel that the military uniform was 20 years old or too modern, not that it disturbed many other Westerners. <br /> <br /> Maybe it got better in the second half, but I couldn't barely wait and see.
