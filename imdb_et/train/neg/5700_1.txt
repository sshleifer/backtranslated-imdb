How does this film score 6.7? It deserves something better than 2.0 and should clearly be one of the 100 slowest movies in IMDb. National Treasure is a violation of national intelligence and is just another attack on the Hollywood American audience. Critics spoke about the holes in the plot that you could drive through 16 wheels. <br /> <br /> I love the legitimacy of this movie ... "Nicholas Cage is cute." Come on people, no wonder people around the world think the Americans are stupid. It must be the most stupid, offensive film I've ever seen. If you really wanted to see a decent movie this season, Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby, or Connect. Unfortunately, the National Treasure got a lot more advertising than those horrible movies. I bet most of you have not even heard of it, because some have not yet been widely released. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is a terrible actor - when he's in the right movies. From time to time I have seen Cage wasting in her terribly talented films like Con Air, Rock and Face-Off. When his talent is well used as a customization by Charlie Kaufman, he is an incredible actress. <br /> <br /> The bottom line - I would prefer my hand on a wood chip if subjected to this visual cruelty.
