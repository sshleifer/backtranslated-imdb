I came to this movie that really wants to draw it. I thought that the assumption had many options and was mature for an interesting movie. Don't get me wrong, did not expect Citizen Kane, I took it for a B movie. Nevertheless, it remained unchanged. The history of the story is glazed and the end was a bit cold for me. Acting in the movie was very wooden. All in all, I give him 4 great ideas, but the film could have paid much more attention to the basics of making a film. Is it worth seeing? I didn't want my two hours ago, but I don't know if I would recommend it to others.
