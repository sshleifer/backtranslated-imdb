A fairly amusing piece that tries to show how intelligent Orcas is, but in the meantime (and quite attentive to them), makes the audience stupid by making the most ridiculous movie. Richard Harris plays Quint. Sorry, this is wrong, he plays Captain Nolan, a fisherman who is trying to live sharks, but is attracted by a great harvest and tries to catch a killer whale. If a female swordfish catch fails (don't ask), this companion (don't ask) goes to rampage (don't ask) and starts Captain Nolan (Don't Ask). Soon Captain Nolan understands that they have something in common (not asking). Pretty amazing movie making here for people. I have to tell you that the start (whale noise and nothing else) is pretty haunting and the final credits (the most godawful song) are quite fun.
