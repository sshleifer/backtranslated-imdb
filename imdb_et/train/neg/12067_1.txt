You know that the movie doesn't work well when John Carradine tells (a.k.a. reads the script and plot summary) of his character's funeral, which is just 5 minutes from the movie. Narration is the last will and testament of his character. It states that his legacy will be shared between his four children and his servants. Children share $ 136 million equally, but if someone were to die, that part would be shared. If all children should die, it is divided among the employees. To be eligible, they must live in a family house for one week. It looks like a typical plot of reality show. <br /> <br /> There is little text on the nature of the Deans. They are a powerful and seriously disturbing family, but the real problem begins with the drowning of this dog. From the opening of John Carradine, you expect this film to lead to the turning of Machiavellia's cat and mouse game. <br /> <br /> This trip is painfully slow and pointless. Within minutes, we look at people sitting around, playing in the pool, throwing darts, misusing a fish bowl, striking conversations with men's silk, constant slipping, in the wrong place circus music, strange setbacks that resemble faux-German. Expressionism, the fourth-class horror aesthetics and the dramatic heaps of overpowering. All this will inevitably lead to the expected and unhappy end. You're lucky you're still alive, but the pain can be quite big. Share kids, share. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
