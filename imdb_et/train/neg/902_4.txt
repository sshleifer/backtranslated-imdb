I think this film is important today because it was an early Sofia Loren movie. He was 19 when the film was made in 1953. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because I wanted to see some of Sofia Loren's previous works. I was surprised when he came into a camera with a brown makeup to resemble a princess from Ethiopia. Certainly, today it would have been seen as a salmon and avoided in making a movie. In fact, it became annoying when looking at Mrs. Loren's skin colors. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie would have been better if the real opera singers had made this movie. Then the true artists would have sung and the actual facial gestures would appear. I hate other people's comments on whether the actual opera singers are older and heavier. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as Loren was 19 years old and still today, the film would have been better than it did on stage. After all, we do not see beautiful youngsters behind the song on the stage behind the song behind the curtain! Don't promote the success of heavy opera singers. Only the Wentworth company has to refer to the most artisticly produced television trade when the performance opera singers sing so professionally the praise of the company's product. This is one of the best and fun TV commercials ever produced. <br /> <br /> The quality of film printing makes this production somewhat smaller. Color ink is faded and cannot be helped. <br /> <br /> To improve this movie on a DVD, the production company should include English subtitles so that we, who do not speak Italian, know what the songs say. It would help the story and teach it more than the narrator, who gives 30 seconds to introduce scenes. <br /> <br /> Look at this movie not Aida's story or being an opera. Apart from Mrs Sofia Loren, this writer has neither known nor remembered any of her associates. Instead, watch this movie if you are a fan of Loren and want to see her at the age of 19 - no matter what the production. <br /> <br /> Larry from Illinois
