SPOILERS PRODUCTS !!!! <br /> <br /> I had read "1. die" and wanted to see if the movie followed the book so I watched it. Mostly it did. There were some MINOR differences (for example, the location of the last violent scene), but not much and most of the movie was more correct for the book than most movies. <br /> <br /> It may be a mistake - although the film was completely cast with Pollen and Bellows, it wasn't impressed with the book. Or let me take it back. I started to get very impressed, it gradually became frustrated and finally it was completely dissatisfied and almost felt out. There is no difference with the film. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There are no payouts in the book or movie. I have rarely read who made this thriller that has created such a final solution and I hoped the film would vary. <br /> <br /> Collectively (he did it, he didn't do it, they didn't do it himself) - wasn't interesting, not exciting and confusing, annoying and frustrating. In addition, Lindsay's love of life ends (after clearing HER's disease and crying out of her grave) .. and then being cut off, where she weighs suicide, maybe she is fighting her life with a REAL cable who was deleted after arrest, but it turns out that she and the wife were in this ... HELLO !!! This whole thing has now become a good old fashioned thriller instead of "GENERAL DISEASE". I felt that the book was deceiving and hanging, and watching the movie (I have to admit that it keeps my attention nicely when the TV was a very good thing) hoped it wouldn't follow the book it finished. /> <br /> I still think that the movie is traceable and for some reason it doesn't leave as bad in the mouth as the book (or maybe it's just that I knew what was going to happen) But I have to say the story that was open , wasn't well done at all.
