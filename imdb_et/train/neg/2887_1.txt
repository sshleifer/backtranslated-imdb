I just watched this movie today and not just that terrible and terrible, but it seems the director has just a few friends to make a movie about a sick person. I also think that this film has a porn movie with a clear, sharply filmed view. <br /> <br /> Thank you for the heavens I work in a video store, and I didn't have to pay for it because this movie is nonsense x infinity ... NO OR FREE IN THIS MOVIE !!!!! You would have a better time to watch Dude Where's My Car than this cute piece! And it doesn't talk much about this movie either. <br /> <br /> The actor is weak and the movie is just very unobtrusive. I watched this movie and wanted to kill myself during and after the movie. <br /> <br /> I went home and threw up the dirt film after watching it, then I was showering and burning my clothes. <br /> <br /> If I had half the spirit that I took a movie outside and burned it too, no one should subordinate it ... maybe even Al Queda members ... especially those we have Custody and also the child's rapists who are in captivity in lifetime punishments are deleted .... just do as the clock work on Orange and then force those chefs to watch it over and over again.
