Greenaway movies are both smart, erudite and innovative. However, his style and grammar come from and recalls the viewers of films made during World War I: the composition of the frame, the average shooting, the static camera. This style can be rubbed against conventional films, but it is not new. Perhaps, like another "innovator", TS Eliot, he pulls more away from the past than waiting for or an authentic innovator. <br /> <br /> But Greenaway's biggest failure is that she can't write. His dialogue and even the structure of the plot are mechanical and logical, but without the other dramatic logic, Brecht, the viability. If this weakness is most obvious, his humor is balanced and logical, so that the joke is dead before it is edited. The result is tedium: if it is not funny, it has failed: ask a stand-up comedian to justify your action if the audience does not respond. Perhaps a well-read director can learn something from Freud with humor. <br /> <br /> Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway has manipulated its participants over the years to work as clones. They talk bored and insidious about lines, like narcissistic adolescents. <br /> <br /> This film, despite its design and lighting, is meretricious.
