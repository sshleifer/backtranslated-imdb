five minutes after viewing it, I logged in to IMDb to warn all of you there that this movie will not be disturbed ... genre: horror? it had nice tense moments and throughout the movie I thought, "something has to happen soon", it wasn't ... when the movie ended, I felt so for the writer / director that I've never been the biggest fan of this guy just patrick do not know how to make movies and after that excuse for the horror blow, I'm not the biggest fan of watching your work. <br /> <br /> I made a plot summary, please don't make the same mistake. <br /> <br /> I gave this film to 2 participants .. they weren't bad and were not at fault there. bad direction ...
