Another example of a complete waste of UK lottery money. That's how this film proved. The film council, which funded this unfortunate garbage, would have to leave one of the unused stations at a London subway station to allow this clich√©, a fine copy of the film, a half-mutant thing consisting of all the horror films the director has seen and felt fit to imitate, especially Deathline. Among his many sins, there is a rather obvious failure to lead the wand sympathetically until the last minute. Then it's a little too late! Certainly, all these UK Development Councils in the UK Film Council would have noted this at the script stage. Add a terrible act to it and the ridiculous appearance of the creature, and you get an excellent example of how not to be intimidated.
