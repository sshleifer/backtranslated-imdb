I've seen thousands of movies and have never written, but the red eye I saw is so inconsistent with the glaring honors here that I am forced to offer my two cents a protest and vote with the lowest possible score closer to the average reality. <br /> <br /> This is a boring and boring film that is memorable only for the images of the apologist of this terrorist target (John Bolton's diplomat who is really a big man, don't you know) and o-so-beautiful and popular Dr. Phil (whose best-selling book, one studying, reads frequent flyers around the world). The only real red-eye I experienced was rubbing my eyes in astonishment. <br /> <br /> Before you pay $ 10 for this B movie, read the "Quotes (from trailer)" selected above and ask if you really enjoy the movie in which they were the most inventive lines. Unfortunately, there is nothing else in this movie. The main premise is silly as hell; functioning is more blissful and uncovered, there is no complete pro / antagonist chemistry; the distance potential is hindered at every step - except for the last five minutes - by poor management and preventive editing; the script is full of inconsistency, such as: early revealing of the heroine as a lacrosse star in the university when he later fights with an antagonist hockey stick; and the plot holes are wider than the first class (while the character development is strictly a coach). <br /> <br /> And then it is extremely ridiculous moments, as when a high-level employee's daughter, EI, directs you to airport security, as soon as possible warn them against the plot of murder against both the chief of internal security and his father. Or, if the same woman runs hell-cord-leather along the slippery airport linoleum, arms punching, and veins in the veins, she has 4-inch stiletto heels. Or, if his chaser runs the same way with a nursing wound, his trachea. Or, if terrorists use a fishing point under their weapon resurrection port. I'm always ready to stop unbelief, but I'm not going to jump 30.00 feet without parachute. <br /> <br /> One good thing to say about this movie is that it depicts women who are able to handle the most extreme emergencies - even in the form of bimbo - such a gender image that is very inadequate in American films . Moreover, this movie never lets down and is no longer exciting than a red-eye flight from Boston to NY. Remember the last time you are deceived by deceptive trailers and glowing honors - in this forum or elsewhere? It's one of those times. Wait for Red Eye video and don't look at it.
