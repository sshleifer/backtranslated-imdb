I think I've seen worse movies, so I'll give it to 3, but it's a fight to remember what they might have been! Chances are that Xtro (nasty & dull) or maybe Creep (just empty), but it's hard to think of something worse. It's hard to know where to start. Let's just say it's a poor man's siege, starring Jean Claude Van Damme, a poorer person. The only redeeming feature was to see Casper Van Dien - I was always thinking about what happened to him after the Starship Tropics. Yes, he was Johnny Rico if you really wanted to know. <br /> <br /> Based on this site, he is sticking to a TV movie in hell .... Casper, be more selective .... please !! !!!!!!!!!! Arghhhhh, I've just passed, and half of the good movie has criminal law ...... now I'm very annoyed after the last 1.5 hours !!!
