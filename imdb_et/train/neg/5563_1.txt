Dolph Lundgren wears and strikes his way through this inconsistent mystery / thriller that is not nearly as cool as you would believe. In fact, he's pretty good here, but the story is B-movie clich√©s (detectives, revenge, tycons, prostitution, S&M) that looks like it was together. The film rises a little in the second half, but rent a RED SCORPION instead of a good Lundgren slip.
