terrible, just terrible! my old room-buddies used it to see junk and it made me crazy. this book is one of my favorites and it is a disgrace that some people never know what they really like because their first impressions are such drifting. they changed so much that it is hardly recognizable. which drives me as the book reads as a soap opera anyway, providing enough feed for today's entertainment. it is like one of those lifetime movies that say "based on real story" but is totally fictional. there is no emotion or depth of the book, but no frantic melodrama. if you are a high school student looking for a chance to get out of reading, I suggest you try another version.
