Hey. In twin cities we have a station that shows "Big Bad Movie" from Monday to Friday. Tonight it was Carrie Fisher's movie "She's Back", which is really annoying for a woman who gets into murder when the handles penetrate her house. Bea (Beatrice) comes back to haunt his wife. He wants him to seek revenge for his killers, so "he's back". And he won't let him rest until he does it. He irritates him endlessly ... and also the viewers! This movie is really one of the worst films I've ever seen. Hey, I like bad movies (my fave movie is Xanadu). I really shook the whole movie, wondering who thought it would be a good idea for the film. Bea is just so annoying. The plot is silly; it is bad; story ... you get my drift. Anyway, if you want to see a really bad movie - really a really bad movie, check it out. You don't have to be disappointed. Heh.
