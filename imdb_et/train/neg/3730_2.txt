First of all, there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah, and other prophetic scriptures. There is nothing wrong with making such a movie to try to present the gospel message. So my films are not about their sincerity or their aspirations. As a Christian, though amillenialist, I believe there is great fear and I believe that Christ will return as he has said so much. So, although I disagree with this movie, it tells me why I think this movie is so low. <br /> <br /> No, which makes me rate this movie so low that it's not her sincerity or message, but rather the lack of production values, a terrible script, mediocre action, and a bad FX. This film is there with the finer sci-fi feed of the 1950s. No, this movie belongs to Plan 9 Outerspace. This movie didn't work well and was probably dated from the time they followed. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers of the apocalyptic genre could have learned how to make a film out of this end-time. The left-hand series, the Apocalypse Series and the Omega Code Series could not be learned because they were dealing with FX problems and a dated appearance problem, but their scripts are still poor and their functioning is wood. There are very Christian movies with an extremely low budget, but this movie is not one of them. I'm surprised that the MST3K team will never let it.
