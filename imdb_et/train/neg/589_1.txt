Honestly, I went to watch the film, not because of the actors, not the plot, but because it was appreciated here in Luxembourg 17 and the film must be really cruel or pornographic in this category. Believe me, being the freak of the movie, I've seen quite a lot of brutal films during my lifetime (Ichi killer, Irreversible, Hellraiser), but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture I've ever seen. The plot is a common stupid, management is terrible, action was mediocre, even music was a cheap copy of the so-called "Horror Soundtracks". There are no intelligent aspects in the whole movie, and some scenes are really hard to stand. (especially the scene where you can see the embryos of the glasses and you hear the cry of the baby - terrible). I do not understand why in Germany the film was rated for 16, where these criteria are usually true (eg a kill-bill (brutal, but it's fun, and with great hints of Asian cinema and excellent management) even a movie like a grace condition has been rated 18). No one can call it a horror film, because in fact it was a show of gore rather than intimidation of the public (the "Creep" face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision); for me (sorry for my expression) there is only one crazy leader who lives on his disturbing fantasies. In some scenes you can see violence that has nothing to do with the plot and nothing to explain. The plot has holes and flaws, the dialogue is boring, frankly one cannot mention one positive aspect of the film except the British and Scottish accents. <br /> <br /> If I had something to say, I would like to ban this movie from the theaters, I fully understand why no money from big production companies invested in it. <br /> <br /> Look forward to some interesting feedback on my topic and I would be happy to discuss one or another topic. <br /> <br /> "Livin's Dream Baby, Live the Dream" by David Aames
