I can't believe that this inert, rotten, and poorly staged movie is a filmmaker whose other work I've enjoyed quite a bit. The experience lasts LADY AND DUKE (and no other word but "enduring") left me in the mood of the whistle, a condition that was only relieved by IMDb user commenting ali-112. Not only has Rohmer tried (successfully) to see us through the 18th century French genre, but, as Ali has shown, has shown (at the price of his audience) both classes of consciousness, and this revolution inspired his unlikely elitist woman of his time. The director has achieved something unquestionably complex, but I ask if it is worth doing it - or that we look at the hardest results of our work.
