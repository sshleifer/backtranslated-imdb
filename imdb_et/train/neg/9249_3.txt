When watching a movie, I'm not sure what temptation it should take. There is a reason why a writer should not direct his work and even act, you can't do it. I felt that the story really suffers in this movie because the director wore so many hats. Mrs McTeer is a movie. To add to his amazing talents, his portrayal of this woman was the reason I was doing. Here is a British actress who can do something. In my opinion, the conflict is what makes drama and great story. I felt that this movie didn't have it. Everything was somewhat simple for the characters, there were no real obstacles that prevent the chachrators from getting what they wanted. Watch the movie for sweetness, but above all for the excellent performance of Mrs McTeer.
