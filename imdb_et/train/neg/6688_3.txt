This movie is pretty terrible, but I have interesting information about it: <br /> <br /> It was filmed in 1976 at the University of North Arizona in Flagstaff, AZ, as well as at Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, AZ. A good part of the film's extras is then NAU drama students. I was a newcomer, a minority in theater, but for some reason I was not involved in production. However, I knew a number of people who did it and could offer this rather strange fact: <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are scenes where two principals who are part of their knight ritual must nude to put down forests. They are viewed from behind the film, just doing it. The thing is that they are not actors, but two men I knew from the theater department. These "stunt-posterior" identities will remain anonymous at least on this website if they do not decide to "reveal" themselves!
