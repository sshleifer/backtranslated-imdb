The time they released this movie on DVD. I know some will say that WB is rushing to release this movie due to The Dreamgirls movie. But how can you rush to release a movie that has been in your catalog since 1976? <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with the DVD release of this movie, no special feature, 5.1 DD sound. come to WB, you can do a lot better. The sound and picture quality of this film needs serious help. <br /> <br /> WB did not see the film so much time and attention as it is a black film and my selling is fine. They would have been able to keep a CD that did not contain all the songs of the CDs by dose. <br /> <br /> Would you like to buy this DVD. Yes, because it's a classic movie. But WB needs to add some more features. Take notes from other group videos, The Five Heatbeats or The Temptation, if you only see a performance, and both sounds much, much, much better than this DVD.
