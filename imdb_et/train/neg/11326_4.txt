This is one of the two postcocalyptic fantasy films made by Albert Pyun in 1993 - and that's bad. Apparently all his energy went to "Nemesis", which was a fun non-stop action film and had a much more expensive look. "Knights" is a dirty and cheesy, a head-sci-fi that is too often similar to a video game (new opponents appear all the time and must be destroyed as soon as possible). The only thing that saves this movie from the trash is Kathy Long; not a particularly attractive woman, but undoubtedly a brutally effective fighting machine. As for Kris Kristofferson, given his age (58), I hope his double payout was good. (* 1/2)
