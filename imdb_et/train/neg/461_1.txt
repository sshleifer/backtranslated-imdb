Warning: Avoid this superduper terrible movie ... if you watched it, you are disappointed with SOOOOOOOOO. <br /> <br /> Pam and Denise are grandmother's age they are doing now? Trying to be so innocent and sexy young, just not working everywhere. Pam and Denise are so terrible in this movie. <br /> <br /> Plus Script is absolutely cruel, I can't believe anyone can get out of such crazy ideas. With the development of the film industry, film students are not as simple as in the last century. I bet the visitors of the last century's movie hate it too. <br /> <br /> Stay away from it. I think I'm looking at "White Chicks" since 2004, it's so much better than that ... it doesn't make a mistake at this time, I thought it was the worst movie I've ever seen.
