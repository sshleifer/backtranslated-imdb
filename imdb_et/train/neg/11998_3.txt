this is a terrible, terrible movie !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> First, TOO LONG. the longest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The songs are too fucking over !!!! <br /> <br /> There are actually too many stories that the story line has been corrupted. <br /> <br /> Comedy wasn't a comedy !!!!! it wasn't funny at all .... <br /> <br /> The story is so reluctant and badly written that it doesn't matter if the characters live or die ....... <br /> <br /> I had some expectations about this movie ......... but my expectations went completely over the first few minutes ...... <br /> <br /> The only thing that was good about this movie was Music ...... and probably Vidya Balan. he gives the best result and stands out among all the senior actors ...... he's just a new comer and he still looks and makes the rest of the light so Pathetic !!!!! Govinda and Blonde, who play the interests of their love, will help save this catastrophic movie. Govinda is perfect for the role of a taxi driver. and Blonde also delivers very fine and consistent performance .... <br /> <br /> Ayesha Takiya, another talented actor, is completely wasted in this movie !!!! so is priyanka !!!!!!!!! Akshay does his role well, but it seemed too up !!!!! Anil and Juhi are also completely wasted ...... <br /> <br /> The only one who doesn't waste is Salman because he doesn't have the talents that will be wasted forever !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> All this is a very impossible movie with the Mishmashed scenario and TOOO Masladar that the story has been designed according to foolish comedy scenes. Imagine how stupid this movie is !!!!!! <br /> <br /> 3/10 is four hours long !!!! Think and RETHINK before going to the cinema !!!!! better to avoid it !!!!!
