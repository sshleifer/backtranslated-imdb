If you want to know what music the white people listened to in 1974, this is a movie for you. But you also have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins (see my comments on my girl's 1). <br /> <br /> Pleasant reception: I approached my girl 2 with cynicism and resentment, just looking at her predecessor. But when the adopter is finally preparing to look for her birth, my girl 2 saw me looking for a mother to look for. <br /> <br /> In other words, what I liked about my girl 2 was nothing to do with my girlfriend 2, but it is related to the protagonist who asks like many other adoptive "who is my mother"? And if my mom is at home with acting troupe, I'll definitely make my movie. <br /> <br /> People are strange. Movies should not be counted. My girl 2 (like my girl 1) is just ... pointless. <br /> <br /> Avoid if you are not full of juice that is comforted by many small annoyances.
