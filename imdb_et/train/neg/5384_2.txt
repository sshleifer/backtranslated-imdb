All Hype! What better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can't release their movie through the mainstream distributor? Consequently, they do it themselves. Otherwise, the movie's hype does not justify the content of the movie. The story is missing and can easily be short. The actor is poor, but animation and music are pretty good. Otherwise, don't waste your time - don't believe the leap! If you can see the movie for free, do it. Then you don't have to waste money. Still, filmmakers are making a good story by pushing their story and creating their own self-sensitive mini-series. Otherwise, they will be one of the wonders that have never hit.
