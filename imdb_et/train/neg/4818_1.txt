I was about 7 years old when DIRE MONSTROSITY was released. In the United Kingdom, it was advertised on television in the summer of 1977 as if it were an amazing cobar film. In fact, it was the first movie I ever saw in the cinema, and I was put off for years. The following week I was invited to watch the new movie "Star Wars" and I refused. To date, I've never seen it, protesting against Sasquatch! Seriously, even at the age of 7, I was able to say I was looking at garbage. It's just so bad, it's almost incredible. A striking crap that should never be put into cinema. However, I was delighted to read all those years later that the director has never directed again, as well as I am concerned. OUT OF ALL COSTS !!!
