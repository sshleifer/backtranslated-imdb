Another in my delves, this film gave me exactly what I was expecting - a crunch of fright with daunting ladies. <br /> <br /> It all started so well - I liked the little intro "newspaper" about the contact of young couples with the nuclear explosion and was completely absorbed up to the first person's fire ... <br /> <br /> foolishness and sometimes it was almost embarrassing to look. When the heroine turned out to be the main character (the same ability to enlighten the spouse) in the same condition, it seemed almost as if someone had thrown away the idea at the last moment ("" Okay! "You can almost hear that they say ...) Soon and almost between the nuclear power plant The psychic connection, well ... <br /> <br /> The film came so cheap tat - if you pay more than Â£ 1.50 for it.
