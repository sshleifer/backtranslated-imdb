The film is boring, characters and scenarios are unrealistic, incredible, action is fun. This movie is a big mess. It seems almost as if the action music starts, the most impressive stunt works. Both voices were dubbed by Mr. McGregor or steven sang too much and changed his voice. There is too much dialogue in this film and extremely bad acting on behalf of everyone. Film is a great sleep care. The fight is ridiculous. The eye shape displacement effect on malignant drug users was decent. The main villain was a joke and his character was poorly developed. The main cable was used to explain the story through interrogation, he simply threw away random plots like (spoiler) "CTX (his designer) is in the water supply", which has never been discussed or even mentioned in the film again. This movie is highly recommended to pass.
