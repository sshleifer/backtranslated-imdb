WARNING! This review shows the end of the movie "Scoop". If you don't want to know how the movie ends, don't read this review! <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is so bad that you think "Annie Hall" was a fluke. <br /> <br /> It's one star because you see Hugh Jackman's bare breast. This is the only thing Scoop has done for it. The plot seems to be promising: the ghost, Ian McShane, drives a fluffy student at Scarlett Johansson to see if English Lord Hugh Jackman is the infamous killer of the Tarot Prostitute Card. The wizard, Woody Allen, helps the girl. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film does not have enough charm, humor or atmosphere. It's an amazingly leading, amateurish effort for someone who has even made one previous film, never tens me. Perhaps Allen has had an unreported stroke in the press. It has been a lot of work that, unlike his previous films, Woody Allen, who is now a septuagar, has finished that the younger man brings a girl. <br /> <br /> Not so. In fact, the plot is built so that the girl doesn't get anyone. <br /> <br /> It is an early scene where Johansson has no reason at the heart of the film to become a drunk, powerful, senior director. "Seduced" is the euphemism that happens. It's "slam, bam, I have to go". It has nothing to do with the plot and it reduces Johansson's eyes. Why did Allen add a movie to this unnecessary scene? Because it shows a powerful director - like Allen - who has female lead. Allen also has his own cake and eat it. <br /> <br /> Johansson is not yet an actor. She doesn't know how to command the screen unless she's dense and shallow. She mimics Allen on a couple of scenes and it just looks strange and sad. <br /> <br /> It does not help that his character is written as a doll that cannot work without a ghost, or an elderly and less than awe inspiring magician, telling him what to do at every turn. <br /> <br /> She is about half the age of Jackman and she is very stylish on her scenes. <br /> <br /> Audience members who are not breastfeeding deserve better heroes, and Jackman also deserves a better script that gives the heroine some intelligence and representation and an actor who can pass on these qualities. Hugh Jackman is also cheated by the script. Allen probably can't keep up with that, so Jackman is so amazing looking and young, so he doesn't give Jackman anything to say or do. Like Johansson, he is only used for his good looks. It's shameful because, as Jackman has shown in any production, "Oklahoma" to "X Men", he can act. <br /> <br /> There is a big plot here - Jackman, a sage, a charming Lord of the Lord, is really a killer. So, although the movie says it means someone other than Allen is putting the girl on, she doesn't get anyone. Jackman, the man he loves, is a man who murdered a prostitute. Nice, Woody. A beautiful way to punish your hero when you have crossed your grip. At the end of the movie alone. <br /> <br /> Final Note: No one member of the audience laughed at the screen during my screening. It is always a bad sign when a movie is advertised as a comedy.
