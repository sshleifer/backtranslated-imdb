The female leader was a terrible actor who made the whole movie mediocre. She smiled too much when she first stepped in to talk to her daughter. It should have suspected the police. I would have been unconvincing in the same situation. She seemed so calm to her mother who couldn't find her daughter. Just as he didn't even want to be in the movie. Jennifer Aniston would have played this part better. And that would have made much more money for such a controversial, important subject. Everyone else was great. I don't know where the leader is, but I hope he got some lessons.
