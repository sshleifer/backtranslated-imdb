Just that shouldn't have been done. It's predictable and clich√©. The screen chemistry that made the first "My Girl" so appealing is not here to be found, and the acting as a whole is stylish and forced. Writing also leaves much to be desired, some "memorable" lines, such as listening to "barbaric practice", are simply shocking. When "My Girl" created a real sadness and some really funny moments, as many of the following "My Girl 2" try to restore those emotions that are generated by the audience and fail. Maybe I'm hard on this movie because it was great, but to be honest, it offends the quality of the original when it makes a contribution. Certainly, it must be close to the "mask of the boy" because it is one of the slowest queues. In both cases, the old saying goes; "If it is not broken, do not fix it".
