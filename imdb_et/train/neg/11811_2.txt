You know when you're on the bus and somebody decides to tell you about your biography and you sit there with your merciful smile, if all you really want is to fool and walk? Well, I had the same feeling of watching the film. Okay, I decided to actually go and see Aprile, and I knew of Nanni Moretti's taste that I got the only letter from Caro Diario, but about half an hour after the last deposit, I wanted to give Moretti all the secret. Caro Diario was funny, unusual and at least a few other characters were able to search the word. In Aprile, however, Moretti has exclusive rights to dialogue, so everything you do for an hour and a half is high on what its policy is best, or what a peculiar popular culture is at its present moment. He also finds time to split up the movies he does not like, something I thought was reserved for my losers. Certainly in a situation like he would think he would try to make the cinema a little smarter. Maybe making the right movie, one with some ideas and a decent structure, or perhaps one that his evil voice does not dominate. And when he went over to his newborn baby, I wanted to go and be with a normal business, preferably not a self-established film director, with a strange confidence in sticky music. The next time someone you don't know is trying to read your life, give them hell. Each shot is a small victory in the fight against moretism.
