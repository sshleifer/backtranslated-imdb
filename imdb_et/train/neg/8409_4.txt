Eddie Murphy for Best Supporting Actress? What is the insult to Alan Arkin and Djimon Hounsou. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx (who can act) is walking through this movie like a zombie. <br /> <br /> Beyonce ??? Did it work ?? <br /> <br /> This movie is compared to CHICAGO or to some other recent music. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't for Jennifer Hudson's great singing and performance, I would have given it to ZERO. Typical Broadway vs. Hollywood Rap.
