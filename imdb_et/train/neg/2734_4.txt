But let's face it ... it got some nostalgic victims for me. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is so consistently large that it has little hiccups. I get a new season and just power through them as I have two days to live. I like to wrap the idea, but it was much more to the end of the season, which explained: <br /> <br /> Dr.Cox shouldn't be bald on a few occasions. the only explanation I think is that they changed the rotation of the episodes or they had to shoot the start again. <br /> <br /> and my friends are why hell cook is bald. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this show is fantastic ... to bring the 7th season.
