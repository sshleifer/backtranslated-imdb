The Danish film "Slim Slam Slum" surprised me with the worst film I've ever seen. I didn't think my list of bad b movies was possible, but it deserves gold. That's not funny. It's bad action, it's bad filmed and the story is bad. The only positive thing to say about this movie is three girls. I really believe that this flick has the potential to knock the second Danish movie "Stjerner uden hjerner" as the worst Danish movie ever made! And that's really something. Congratulations!
