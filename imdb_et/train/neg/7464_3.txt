I didn't watch the whole movie. I couldn't watch the whole movie. I stopped the DVD after half an hour watching and I suggest someone who thinks about watching for themselves to stop themselves before they pull out the disc. <br /> <br /> I like the Mafia movies tragically as well as comic, but Corky Romano can only describe it as a tragic attempt at mafia comedy. <br /> <br /> The problem is Corky Romano, who is just trying to laugh at the audience, the plot seems to be an excuse for moving Chris Kattan (Corky) from scene to scene. Corky himself is completely superfluous and lacking in nuance or loyalty - all of his strange manners have come across - Chris Kattan is clearly "acting", not playing a role - it bounces you off the story. Each scene is completely predictable, the "comedy event" in the kit is obvious as soon as each scene is introduced. In comedies such as Mr Bean, catastrophes caused by the character of the title are funny because you get empathy against the motivations of the characters and the initial event and the situation where the character arrives is not a telegraph. However, Corky feels that he has deliberately cut off the desperate attempt to laugh at the audience. <br /> <br /> When Chris hadn't played such an alien character (who was never really involved with other characters), and whose behavior is totally inexplicable (except trying to laugh) and comedy scenes were not as predictable and stereotypical - all the jokes seemed too familiar) this movie could have been traceable. But it is not. Don't look at it.
