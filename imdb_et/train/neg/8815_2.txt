Yes, I just tell you about it, so don't read if you want surprises. I got this Christmas name bad. The DVD also had another Christmas horror called Silent Night, Bloody Night. If Silent Night, Bloody Night (not to be confused with Silent Night, Deadly Night) had a lot of potential and was very good, it wasn't quite as good. It started to look interesting enough to the villain (if you can call him), watching the neighborhood kids and writing books that are naughty and nice, but after a while you are looking for some activities and this film does not produce. You need to develop a character, but it goes overboard and you're still not sure why the devil guy sees it. About an hour he kills four out of four people, while the entire crowd looks at fear, and the guys he kills are not even his targets, which they just entertain him. This is one of the many attempts by murderers to knock off the rogues. He then tries to kill that other guy and tries to get into his house by pushing himself into the fireplace. He'll get stuck right now and get out. Then he enters the basement and then tries to kill the boy in his bedroom. He cannot kill such a man so that he grabs the star from the tree and cuts the boys into the throat. What the hell was the tree first in the bedroom? Oh yes, the killer before it killed the stop at the party and was also fun. Well, this is except for the city people who burn him with burns and the unresolved part of his brother and the voice he wants to play. What was that? He continued to talk about something that was never explained. How it ends when you ask, well, because I have the spoilers I tell you. He runs his way through his van and goes, well lets say it was flat !!!!!!!!!!!!
