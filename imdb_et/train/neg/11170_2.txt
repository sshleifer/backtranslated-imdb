This is why this British TV movie appeared only at the 1977 Toronto Film Festival. It is boring, thin and incomplete in tension. <br /> <br /> The amazing performance of Peter OTools and the appearance of playwright Harold Pinter are the only elements of interest. <br /> <br /> Note: Some British movie fans enjoy Philip Jackson, the best known for his inspector Japping in Poirot's TV series, one of his first roles.
