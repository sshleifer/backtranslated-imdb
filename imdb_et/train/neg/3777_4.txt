Flat, breathless computer images with less than amazing backgrounds bring a terribly predictable story to this movie. Absolutely nothing goes beyond the surprise, you can even say when Bryan Adams's vocals come in, which is always at the wrong time. <br /> <br /> The main character, Spirit Horse, gives a tedious voice when he tells what is happening. However, there is no need for talk, because everything is really obvious. You can even say what the horses say, although everything they do is close. What would be good, but all the horses make exactly the same sounds - one for warning, one for sadness, one for laughing, and so on. There are no differences between horse votes. <br /> <br /> Young kids can be like this movie. It is enough for the family to sit and look, and there is little danger that someone is scared. If you have nothing else to do and want to watch a movie with your children, this is not a bad choice. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is not recommended.
