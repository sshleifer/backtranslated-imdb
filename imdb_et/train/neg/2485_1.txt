The use of a movie like Bulletproof is just one: it reminds you of how bad it is to be. We often see films that we describe as "pretty terrible" or "not much good", but then you see such a movie and you see that while all these other films are not "good", they are in no way strange bad as Bulletproof. It was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds with their local supermarket through a DVD transaction to fulfill their obligation (ie give me a gift). It could have been amazing, but it wasn't: it was so clich√©, so badly written, so badly managed, so badly acted that I was surprised that not all those involved were arrested and sent off for 10 years. God, it's terrible. I suspected as much as about 30 seconds, but I continued, because sometimes - sometimes bad movies are so bad that they can be enjoyable. It's not one of them. It's just bad. I finished watching after 45 minutes and tomorrow I threw it in the trash.
