** 1/2 for the Diane Keaton farce. <br /> <br /> Somebody should tell Mrs Keaton enough about her Annie Hall philosophy and hats. <br /> <br /> Keaton's daughter, Sara, dies in a traffic accident when her boyfriend lives. <br /> <br /> Keaton, who was unable to access the phone first, because he was bagged with a bag and pulled it out. phone plug, scares the new way. <br /> <br /> She returns to the summer camp where all Sara's friends stay. He cleans the house, sleeps two days and then begins to reveal things that were not better to manifest. It seems that sweet Sara was sleeping with her girlfriend and boyfriend who was last married. In addition, he had an abortion thanks to this man. We've all put it on the rocks now. <br /> <br /> His only hope is to find a hard-to-read diary kept by Sara. He also hopes that boyfriend Adam, who is a playwright, will not take it all for another game. <br /> <br /> When the diary is found, it is written in Japanese. Sara was in this language a Ph.D. This is not so good news for the mother when the Japanese chef translates the translation service from the Japanese restaurant. <br /> <br /> Of course, everything seems to end up well at the end. <br /> <br /> The title of this shmaltz comes from Oz's wizard. Every time Mom and Sara talk, they would both talk about Surrender Dorothy. <br /> <br /> As it is not enough, Keaton says that during this bizarre extravagant grief, Woody Allen is not in his movie Interiors, where he tried to emulate Ingmar Bergman successfully. Mrs Keaton is also trying to get a group of drugs. Come on, people, can we realistically believe that someone in his right sense can mourn such a thing? <br /> <br /> This movie is fair and mediocre.
