How many fear times do we have to look at the spook walking in the background and at the top through mirror reflection? It's made in two dozen movies in the last memory and four dozen times in this tough, badly made movie. There were only two terrible moments for the evaluation, when the ghosts invaded the two-character personal space. When talking about characters, 64 oz worked. cup I drew. The side markings could have been drawn from various Scooby Doo cartoons. There was a friendly, outdated sheriff. With the Alabama draw, kooky weirdo lived in the backwood. Lots'o 'developments without development. The most worrying thing was the picture of the murdered child at the beginning. But instead of investigating the child's murder, which would have been interesting, they told us that he was dead and that his parents had a hard time agreeing on his death with the community and with each other. When they get to the salon, scenes rarely run together ... with flashing images of a dead daughter that was missed here and there. Oh ... and the dim sounds were also over. You know what I mean .... the doors that open themselves, crickets in the woods, yada yada yada. Ooooohhhh. You haven't seen it before. Again, you can see the movie with an amazingly new door again and again. NOTE TO THE DIRECTOR: A scary scene is only scary if it is not repeated every 5 minutes in the same movie. Think of these things before you call "it's a wrap!"
