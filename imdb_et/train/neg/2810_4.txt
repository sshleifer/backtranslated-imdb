I am surprised at many female voters who even give this film better signs. My idea of ​​this film was that the target audience is an adult and a man. Pricked and tortured women, ruthless revenge, and high body volume are typical ingredients introduced by the spaghetti source in film history. Open and manual breakage is DJANGO rip-off. For example, SHOOTER does not have a style. DJANGO. The result, performance and cinematography are at best mediocre, but if you are looking for the ingredients mentioned above, you are in the right place. And the actors aren't an Italian accent. <br /> <br /> 4/10
