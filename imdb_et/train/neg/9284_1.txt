A man, even a plan for 9 outdoor spaces is better than this film. This flick doesn't have enough land for half an hour, but they managed to extend it for more than an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are pretty good, especially in these exaggerated combat scenes, but things like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk are much better than this unfortunate thing that would be better off.
