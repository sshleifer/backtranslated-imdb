This exhibition was ridiculously bad. Writing was sucked, dialogue was sucking. The man who played Craig couldn't get out of the paper bag. Being on Thursday night, it was definitely a beer to watch. Enjoyable music, bad acting, poor writing, everything came together for my entertainment. <br /> <br /> It was a drama / involuntary comedy. I don't care what happened to any character, they were all bored and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst because they could not reveal who the victim was, they had to rewrite it, which was terrible. I want to say that the burial of the funeral was ridiculous. In fact, all the current events were absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> Let's look now. All that is happening right now, sucks. Renewing Scenes, Writing, Dialogue, and Craig's Wonders Wonder. The music prevailed.
