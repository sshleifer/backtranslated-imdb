First ..... <br /> <br /> What the hell? Why are they trying to sell a small budget piece in the late night on television with a promising, offensive sick garbage that every ordinary real person with the soul cannot watch. <br /> <br /> What is funny when a dog is injured, a grandmother who knocked her head, ... a boy blowing his hand and two girls in the bathroom? In hell, this world has come, so people find that comedy is in any case so sick. Anyone who thinks such material is funny should not even walk on the earth. <br /> <br /> But what I hear is not even offensive ... so they allow comedy through sick bins ... and they can't even pull it out.
