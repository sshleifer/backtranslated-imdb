What to say about this movie. Well, this is about a good number of good students who have bad drugs and become criminals selling more bad drugs to people. Two of these people have adverse effects when it becomes a poison control and his girlfriend throws some creature that grows in the basement of the school. It's all there, and they stretch it for 84 minutes. This movie is pretty bad and should be locked forever. Although not fair, some people like Troma movies and they want to watch it. However, Troma movies are the worst films for me. I looked at it under the curious curiosity.
