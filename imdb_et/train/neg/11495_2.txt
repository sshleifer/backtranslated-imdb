It was one of the most flattering films we've been watching in recent months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad effects (mostly with supportive characters). The interview with Hugh Laurie on DVD was actually much more profitable than the movie itself ... <br /> <br /> Hugh Laurie obviously made a lot of effort to learn how to dance Samba, but his character was only needed to dive into the pool at the end of the child. The film is based on a beautiful girl and great music, but they are not enough for good entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen Rio or inside a British bank, this movie is for you. 2 out of 10.
