Something that doesn't really go with Al Gore's (and his supporters') theory is "consensus." <br /> <br /> If there were such a consensus, why do "believers" feel in the all-powerful global warming that it is necessary to try and tempt someone who doubts them. <br /> <br /> Why is that Anyone who does not make a global warming line has met with incriminating accusations to be either stupid or in the oil companies' payroll (apparently, this is not a professional global warming scientist that you are on a payroll in this marvelous world ...) How the whole question is resolved when it is the nature of science honestly ask for assumptions? For some ideas to answer these questions, read the well-known oil industry prize from Michael Crichton ... oh wait, he's rich and not the oil companies' wages. he did not remain in the line of green and other Kyoto prayers and spoke the truth when he examined it, by the way, did you know that adherence to the Kyoto Protocol would lead to its own supporters? RGI almost no drop in temperature? Just a few questions that Al Gore definitely kept in order not to receive every cent of the environmental protection board when he decides to ride again. <br /> <br /> So who's stooge ..?
