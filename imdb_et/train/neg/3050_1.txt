Just when I thought I was going to finish the whole year without the rating of one movie "Bomb", a friend brought the house to the infamous house last night. I was afraid that knowing this reputation was the worst, and it was so pious as I thought. This is a Mexican confusion called English and produced by K. Gordon Murray. It has terrible sets and effects, and it has a pretty scary Santa Claus, who doesn't act on the North Pole, but on a cloud in space, and who doesn't have a few gnomes to help him do his toys, but rather all the different groups of children from virtually all countries. The opening sequence in which St Nick laughs cordially when he monitors that the monitors show all the children working hard when they sing terrible holiday songs in different languages ​​seems to continue forever and without a story. Obviously, it doesn't see Santa's child's labor law! <br /> <br /> Finally, we get some evil and subtle devil masters who travel to hell on Earth to make little children grow up and turn Santa Claus on a Christmas Eve nightmare. Watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience, and it's terrible to scare small children and turn them off from Santa Claus and the holidays forever. Strangely enough, the name of Jesus Christ is often mentioned in this Christmas film, which makes it somehow possible in all the contextual contexts that are underway. This changes my personal list of "the worst movie I've ever seen", but it's sure it's not unique.
