One of Frances Farmer's earliest films; at 22 it is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby is in great voice, but the songs are not his best. Martha Raye and Bob Burns are interesting, but their comedy, probably big in their era, is really nervous. Roy Rogers is also a singer. In my opinion, it is only worth looking at whether you are a fan of Frances Farmer and perhaps a fan of Bing Crosby.
