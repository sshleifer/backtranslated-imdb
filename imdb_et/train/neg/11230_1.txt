In the sixth grade, any teacher I had decided would be a great idea to make this film a curriculum throughout the semester. Every class had something to do with this terrible show. We looked at it in English and wrote in magazines as if we were one of those characters. In mathematics we talked about charts and other sea crap. In science we talked about whales (which was actually somewhat interesting, so it wasn't a 100% waste of time). All day was torture. Not only that, but they would put us in this horror twice a day, changing us in the school. I saw it was a new series or something, but it was like '93. I'm still trying to block it.
