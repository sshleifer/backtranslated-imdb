Scary, but mostly in the sense that it has passed before the 70th anniversary. I saw it again late in 1976 and thought it would never end. Like crackers, it's better than nothing (but just). <br /> <br /> Ray Milland is a bit frightening because he looks like he's filled with a taxodermist. Yvette Mimeux looks like she has smoked all the beautiful Downtown Burbank Browns. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of Roy Rogers version of Rosemary Baby. This is one turkey that should never have been done. If you have insomnia and this is Saturday morning at 1:30 and the 1972 Roller Derby Chamionship has nothing but I think it will win. But God will help you if this is your only choice for entertainment.
