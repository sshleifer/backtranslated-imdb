In Yikes, it was definitely one of those sleepless nights where I surfed the channel and got into the stinker of this movie. For some cast names I look forward to a much better movie. I'm almost embarrassed to see that Oscar Winner F. Murray Abraham is such a terrible part. I hope the money was worth it. And the students, they talked about the fences, as they spoke of survival in war or a terrible disaster. I mean, I'm fenced, it's a fun sport, but I'm never so intense. The only reason I watched this movie was that remote control fell on the couch and I was too lazy to get it back.
