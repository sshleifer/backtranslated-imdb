Antonion's films are not outdated. What surprises me about them is that apart from the undeniable plastic beauty, the dull and didactic "psychology" of characters and situations is. Remember, for example, the conversations between Mastroian and "malicious capitalist" that want to sing "La Notte", or Monica Vitti, who laughs "La aventura" on the flirting peasants, or Ferzetti, who fires the glass at the end of the same film. <br /> <br /> I looked at "Zabriskie Point" yesterday. In this movie, there are many nice and sophisticated shots of Rod Taylor's office, LA's streets and highways, advertising ads, deserts, etc. that show the author's charm on his American journey, five years later than Wim Wenders. Unfortunately, there are too many hippie-left clich√©s that violate the film: - The boy leaves the meeting, steals the plane and flies over the desert to get rid of and find "something else". The leaders of the gray suites are talking about speculation all the time. - The girl looks at the swimming pool for "objective women" and leaves because she doesn't want to be like them. Caravan's couple of fat middle class talks about the beauty of nature in building a hotel and making a lot of money. Last but not least, many couples who love the desert. What is Hippie Spread! <br /> <br /> Sorry, today, half a century after the "La Aventura" revolution, we see that the king is naked and his films (except "Le amiche" and maybe "Il grido") are just a handful of aesthetics and conventional places.
