I remember that I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old, I had a Commodore 64 and loved playing Rambo. That's why I was really happy to buy this movie very cheaply. I put it in my video recorder and started off: man this movie is really bad! Sylvester Stallone says like 3 words in the whole movie (except for this terrible sentimental speech at the end) and he has the same expression on his face. And this stupid love thing in the middle, it's just so amazingly predictable. I quickly finished the whole thing and went to change the movie.
