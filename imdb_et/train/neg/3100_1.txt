Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... Where do I start?!? <br /> <br /> This movie gives Manos - a fate and a future war - for his money, ever made. It's fun to laugh, where Manos was just a painful watch. Hobgoblins reach somewhere in a time capsule, the perfect film that describes the concept of "80s cheeze". Functioning (and I use this concept loosely) is terrible, Hobgoblins are some of the worst dolls you will ever see, and the garden tool must be believed. The film was the perfect vehicle for MST3K and this version is the only way to see this confusion. This movie gives Mike and bots a lot of ammunition to pull some of the funniest liners they've ever made. If you are trying to watch it without the help of Mike and robots ..... God will help you!
