The whole thing is very nice to look at. Taking a European location was a good idea. Leading participants are attractive. The result is usable. <br /> <br /> IF YOUR BIRTHS ARE! And the non-plot developed! And it was downhill from there. Pacino is in sleep mode and Keller talks about how he's bored, dear, you're not alone. If she does a Mae West imitation, you may have to hide your face so it's painful to look. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine how the actor or director Sydney Pollack is related to it, or the better question, why did it end up stinking? <br /> <br /> Since death is present in almost every scene, in one way or another, perhaps you should be a little enjoyable here. Maybe it should be as empty as cold as death. But I can't recommend it.
