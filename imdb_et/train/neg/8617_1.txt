After looking at 10 minutes of this movie, I was confused, having been watching for 30 minutes that my toes were running - I just couldn't believe it: the movie is really terrible. In fact, it's so terrible that I just had to look at it all (!). In this process, I realized that it reminded me of some of Denmark's so-called comedy from the 60s and 70s. The pattern is as follows: Take one very popular comedian, make a script that puts this comedian in as grotesque situations as possible, add a bunch of jokes (especially with a single lining) and add a couple of beautiful young girls - film it and have success! I don't know if this film was a success, but unlike the Danish tradition that died quietly (with some great comedian), it seems that the US has such a movie market.
