I'm familiar with the fantastic book "Goodnight Mister Tom" at an absolutely age, and it was only recently when I got the chance to see it adjust. I have heard a lot of positive comments on this, so I had great hopes. When that movie was over, I was scared. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a good movie at all. "Goodnight Mister Tom" was an extremely poor adaptation and almost 4.5 / 10 books were missed. I especially found that there were not many such signs and great scenes in it. There was not much dialogue, it was in a hurry and too fast, but I was mostly upset by the fact that you have never seen the bonding and love between William Beech and Tom in this movie, which was a real shoot. Casting was not so good either. I thought it might have been very good, but it was so different! Especially bad adaptation, one of the worst I've seen. It deserves a decent remake that is better than 1,000 times better than this bunch of rubbish.
