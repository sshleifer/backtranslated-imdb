Throughout the day I have been looking at dinosaurs and all day they have had the same basic problem. <br /> <br /> They don't believe in firearms. They just didn't see them or something like that. Bullets _bounce_ off dinosaurs! Maybe it's because they got dead millions of years before the gunpowder was invented, and the laws of physics were just different ... Ah, no. Come on. If they are close enough to work today chemically, they have to be vulnerable to fast (even subsonic) flagship projects. It's that simple. <br /> <br /> Watch, today the most heavily skinned reptiles, alligators and crocodiles, are completely vulnerable to the fire of the main weapon. They're nothing magic. The gun can be done on the back through heavy weights. They don't take armor-piercing bullets or anything special. Small bullets penetrate them, they just don't kill them. Somewhat (but not really) big balls are preferred because the challenge (as with most games) is to kill the animal with a single shot so it doesn't run. (Hunters consider it immoral to allow prey to fall off and die.) <br /> <br /> Most animals, including predators, are easily repelled. Most of the noise and even non-lethal wound pains go away. The exception is the big bears that are so fearless that they just die by mortal wounds. Cape buffalo is considered extremely dangerous because they are well-known for being wounded. We have seen a video of large bulls equipped with bull bull, who saved the calf from the pride of the lion. The big cat runs when she can, but if she can't pay for it, it's the final act of despair. If T.Rex fits into this spectrum, it is not known. Their behavior is simply not observed. For these large animals, safe hunting is the application of an appropriate large and powerful projectile and / or implementation of several of them sufficiently fast against this charge. This can be a serious problem with T.Rex. I have seen T.Rex's skull (they have one in the museum center) and carry the gun big enough to be impractical. Gnawing down with a much smaller fire can be a more viable approach. The small balls would still be down to them, they just wouldn't hurt just because the animal is too big to easily kill! <br /> <br /> So here we have Cortez and his men (that is, before the famous Mexican campaign, probably) American natives try and sacrifice on the pyramid. It seems that all these human sacrifices meant attracting T. Rexes's massacre that terrorized the continent during the day. Instead of just cutting the hearts and feeding them to the lizards, Cortez et al., Said that they are dealing with the Aztecs to hunt and kill them. OK, maybe they don't have M-16s like "Carnosaur" boys, but they have clips, shrubs, sharp sticks (big, made of trees) and swords. Perhaps it is a little less uneven than groups of fully automatic soldiers, but they are several men and I quickly put them over the dinosaur. Oh, wait, there's _cannon_, about 4 inches. It's just a ticket to break the Tyrannosaurus skull! So they put a trap, a team of men, a cannon, a spike, and attract the first T.ex using a pretty brown girl as a feed. Cortez points out that they do not have time to reload, so they need to close the range until they are confident about their goal. T.Rex completely ignores their fireball and we see both the crossbail _ and the cannonball _bounce_ off! Forget it. The end of reliability. The crosshair would not be Cortez's torso-winner and a 4-inch cannon ball can penetrate the wooden ship's hull! It would also help every animal hide, rib or skull to walk the planet. I think _whale_ can tolerate a 4-inch cannonball? And here is T.Rex, which still stands, not even bleeding. So Cortez attracts the abyss where it falls on a sharp stick that (I think magic) penetrates and kills it. Yaaay, sharp sticks! <br /> <br /> Dinosid is not completely vulnerable to a firearm - they can stand out with the gun in the eye. It runs it out, so it's not as medium as a bear or buffalo, at least in the movies. <br /> <br /> They are killing another dinosaur with a gun made of gunpowder and precious stones. My money would still be a cannon. It has a designed function to concentrate all gunpowder energy in one direction - towards the goal. Bomb is a much more widespread application of force. _Real_bombis (NOT gourd bomb) is a steel housing that contains an explosion at very high pressure. (Think of a tube bomb vs. fire.) A heap of fire attack just goes to POOF. (Trust me in this.)
