If you have seen very few movies, it can be great for you. If you've seen many movies, it's a joke. The behavior of actual heroes is portrayed very badly. Not to mention that there are songs, there are many setbacks and, most importantly, the fighting scenes have been stupid. New characters, good direction, would have done a better job, but since it contains all the Bollywood heros / heroes, you can predict what follows. You don't feel sad when something happens, the emotions they protect are terrible, mainly because we've seen this actor in 1000 other Hindi movies. This presupposes that it is a realistic film, but it is not shown. There are times when you think you have thousands of soldiers full of soldiers and shelling bombs and no bombs hit them. Is the package really badly targeted or when the director saw them as stupid? There were only a few characters who did very well, but as far as the plot is concerned, it is badly targeted. This film could have been short when they took songs, setbacks, points.
