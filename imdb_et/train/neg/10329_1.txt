I'm trying to take a picture of Dark Angel pitch. "I mean Matrix, I mean Bladerunner, I think a chick playing an angel carries glossy black skin - or some chicks like him, leave it with us. Only - get it! Let's do it without a plot, dialogue, character, decent action or budget, but a few loudspeakers and a hot chick with glossy black leather bordering on a big creepy bike, right?

Live activity anime without any action or any life. SF just like Joe Fanboy likes. (
