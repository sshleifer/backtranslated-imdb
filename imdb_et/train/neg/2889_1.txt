The case is the best part of the film, but it is not worth the purchase alone. I was expecting the movie "Based on a real story" to find a hit at home video hodge-podge on badly fired clips associated with pathetic acting and not related to slaughterhouse scenes. Video scenes had numerous rewind situations that were likely to be used to extend the function rather than impact. I started this review before I was halfway through the movie and waited until it was finished when it had a better end, but low and see it only worsened. If I could mention this, it would have been negative for ten. Learn from my mistake and save your money and time with it.
