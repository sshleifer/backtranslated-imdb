I have no idea which audience leader George Schlatter was hoping to sell this comedy. Redd Foxx has a central role and enough pimpy outfits and polyester to wrap around the 1970s. Sam Bobrick's and Ron Clark's play-based story of this alienated couple (Foxx and Pearl Bailey), who is hard-working that their son is a secret gay - and who lives with minced meat, dancing white homosexual - - baptized jokes to disgrace the early episodes of each of the three companies. Bailey keeps his dignity and the confusion of Foxx alone is good for a couple of women, but the rest of the performers are down. * from ****
