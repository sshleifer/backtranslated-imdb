Few films have left me with such anxiety and this is not a compliment. Since I saw it in the theater (how it ended, I can only wonder), I got 90 meters of hateful, derivative garbage, the main impression of which was a little bit of another sick movie "Don't answer the phone" - but worse. Its hesitation, rape and everything is shown without distance (unlike strong things like "The Last House on the Left") and total contempt (perfect?) Towards the victims and all involved, leaving the viewer terrible. sadistic voyeur. Finally I felt in the shower. No credit is given to the director
