This film reminds me of a lot of films against the 50's and 60's, because it was done by people who have probably never experienced social evil that they warn us. Tom Hanks and his friends are "role-playing", but there are no dice, many candles, and then you wipe out the bad assembly that shows Hanks falling under the group's wife. pretty funny but wrong. I do not know how many poor children had destroyed their D & D and were told that their imagination was the way to destruction. As a film, this is mainly a post-school special, bad actor (although Hanks shows some of her talents) and talks about relationships and nobody seems to be fun. These films seem to have psychological attention to adolescents who start their way to adulthood, which is more serious, probably and requires you to lock and do everything else. Despite its two votes, it is worthy of a unique genre, frightening movies that I personally am quite funny about.
