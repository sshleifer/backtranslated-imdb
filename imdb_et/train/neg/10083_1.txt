They made this title of cruelty to unexpected love. The only thing worse is the film itself. The script contains a dialog that would laugh out of the third-class game phase. At one point when a woman leaves her husband, all the music is played by everyone! Without joking. Actors are trying, but incredible, to capture an incredibly terrible script. The direction is amazingly bad. No wonder Lifetime has such a bad reputation. How such things are done. I'll turn off the TV before it's over!
