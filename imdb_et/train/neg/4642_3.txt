I saw "Rachel's attic," I thought I would be pleasantly visceral, ride. But that was not the case. Visceral, yes, but enjoyable? It would be big, greasy, no! In fact, the only reason I gave him "3" is because Gunnar Hansen appears (ever so briefly) as one of the film's deplorable characters. How they ever attracted Hansen to these pieces ... I never know. The story idea is interesting but poorly done. The direction is pedestrian and the actor is mediocre. The only thing that is worse is special effects. YIKES !!! I've seen better effects in classroom learning. Give it up, Mr. W, it's time for a career change ... I hear they hire Mel's Diner! There are very few, well done, Inde movies that come to Michigan ... and "Rachel's Attic" is not one of them.
