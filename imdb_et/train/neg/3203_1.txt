Human Pot roots Joe Don Baker (MITCHELL) stars in this dull, unnoticeable "action" movie as Deputy Geronimo, a greasy, gassy slob, sitting in a dumb looking cowboy suit, listening to country music and eating too many donuts. Meanwhile, Joe Don has a vaguely criminal man named Palermo (played by Fulci GATES OF HELL). Joe Don slowly gives Chase and Palermo a brother after his legendary fishing statement, "It's your move." You think you can take me? Well, go ahead. For some reason, Texas lawyer Joe Don must drive Palermo to Italy ("Mr. Palermo has been the main embarrassing source for the Italian government," says Mr. Wilson, another vague character played by MASTER NINJA, Bill McKinney. 1, SHE FREAK and many good Clint Eastwood movies). Anyway, the Joe Don plane must land on the island of Malta, where Palermo escapes with a suitcase and with the help of a seeming boy, Jon Lovitz. And this is where the movie stops. For the rest of the film, Joe Don Palermo, loses Palermo, arrives in jail, shouts Malta's chief of police, and then warns that he will no longer look for Palermo. Then Joe Don looks for Palermo, loses Palermo, arrives in jail, shouts Malta police commander, and then warns that he will no longer look for Palermo. Then Joe Don Palermo, loses Palermo, arrives in jail, shouts Malta's chief of police, and is warned that he will no longer look for Palermo. This is one aggravating film. <br /> <br /> At one point, Joe Don is thought to be dead at sea. All other characters don't know if he's dead or not, finally concluding he is. But then he appears (he was saved by a poor family) and no one mentions the fact that he was lost at sea for several days. Even her cute, Julia Louise-Dreyfuss-esque sidekick doesn't support her back. However, he offers help to help him find Palermo, so Joe Don is looking for Palermo, loses Palermo, arrives in jail, punishes the Maltese police chief, and then has a warning not to search for Palermo. <br /> <br /> The highest points are the odd carnival with strange colored floats, some sexy strippers, shootings involving a boy dressed like Napoleon, and a cart with tomatoes, a chase scene with a boy who is dressed monk and every scene without Joe Donita. The lowest points include Joe Doni, who is threatening with fur. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that it comes from ANGEL's REVENGE manager Greydon Clark, who appears as a sheriff. Ick! <br /> <br />
