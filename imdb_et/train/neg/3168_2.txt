I had to turn it off after about 15 moments to fill. <br /> <br /> I hoped it could heal, <br /> <br /> What I saw was badly behaved, directed and written. <Br / This movie should never even be released directly to a DVD. <br /> <br /> The HELL bride head is a leading figure with huge ice sculpture. He was such a rebellious person I didn't even regret. He was blowing there in some sky, and was still reluctant, I left right after that. <br /> <br /> Eve Longoria depicts her and I hope I never see her again, she can't even act. Paul Rudd, an actor who usually can't do anything wrong, was also a dud. <br /> <br /> Jason Biggs (no longer a teen) is also there, <br /> <br /> I like comedies, but not stupid people about stupid people. <br /> <br /> Rating: * (of 4) 30 points (of 100) IMDb 2 (of 10)
