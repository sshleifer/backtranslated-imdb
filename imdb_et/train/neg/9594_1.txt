I signed up for IMDb to comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> I just did a movie session and the only thing that impressed me was that I had the willpower to stop it. <br /> <br /> I've seen quite a lot of action movies and not, but the princess has some of the worst fighting I've ever seen in the movie. Most of the sword fight includes sword-like swords back and forth and hoping the opponent won't do the same. I've seen a lot of student movies with better action and stronger parcels. <br /> <br /> So now we have a "futuristic" feature film that has bad action and virtually no future sign. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie doesn't even have any action and shows an evolving relationship with the princess and peasant / terrorist and his disturbed sister. There are several plot lines in the movie and none of them are worth anything. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem was that I watched a dub, which was pretty bad. The whole cast mumbled all of its lines, so it was hard to keep track of what was going on. But I got a general idea. (Knowing exactly what the movie would not have saved in my eyes) <br /> <br /> If you have heard that this is a futuristic action / ninja flick, you have heard it wrong. What I thought was when I heard about it, and now I've lost 90 minutes of my life. Don't let this happen. Clear it out.
