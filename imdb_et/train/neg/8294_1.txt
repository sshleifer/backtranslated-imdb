There may be something poetic about seeing dentists' suffering. Suffer them, in this harsh, truly terrible movie, but they also cause the audience pain that is not dental. If you've ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids, kids, sick kids, a lot of long, meaningful gazes, a dead body wife, and a relevant husband: it's all for you. Bored, protracted, it stands out as one of those examples that scream: why? Is there salvation grace? Yes there is. Nabucco is a short scene with a pretty good song. Save your money or save time if it is on a TV or cable. You can always read a book or make an omelette.
