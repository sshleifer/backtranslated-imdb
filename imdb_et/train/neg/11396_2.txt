Captain of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, finally makes a movie that doesn't go straight to Playboy. "The Hazing" borrowed heavily from all that was before Nightmare on Elm Street, Evil Dead, but manages to do it with enough humor to be traced ... barely. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wood, the story is thin and the actors couldn't go out of the grocery store. Put it all together and you have a crushed powder of film. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to eat paper. Watching this movie is very similar. Chew it for 90 minutes and the mouth of the frost for unpleasant taste and nutritional value.
