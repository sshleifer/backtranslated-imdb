What a terrible movie. I love monster strikes, but I couldn't even look at half of the terrible, cartoon characters and sad special effects. Nothing about this movie is being redeemed. The characters originate either from endless suicide cannons, or else they are empty, uninspiratory sockets. The plot is shaped, cut and pasted. Even CGI is terrible. You know it's bad if you can't even depend on the movie to provide good eye candy. There are no surprises here, old old. It's really one of the worst movies. Director Roger Corman should be hung from a light post so that children can use it to pin it.
