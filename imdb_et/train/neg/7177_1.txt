Having fallen in love with the original "Caligulat" even with all his mistakes, I have to say that this remake trailer was exhausting. <br /> <br /> Listening to Yovovich in this lazy American accent "Mmm cuhligyooluh ..." I feel bad. The set doesn't see Rome at all ... it seems the rich actor in the Hollywood manor house, and Roman costumes look like a cheap mess you buy in a suburban costume shop. <br /> <br /> This "adorable" Adriana Asti looks like a fifty-year-old Spaniard woman who was amazed at her mind, as if she didn't know it was a trailer. <br /> <br /> The actor must be the worst I've ever seen. most of the lines I hear are random actors screaming "CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!" so loud and reluctantly irritating when they get. <br /> <br /> Random sexual scenes were also full of 40 or 50% of trailers and scenes with remarkable actors / actors such as Gerard Butler (who loves the screen shade for all three and a half seconds) that doesn't do anything but sees inconvenience or all that is up, under your minimal lines, just by dragging it with their ridicule. <br /> <br /> Courtney Love's part is made up of her vision as her usual garbage dump whip, who leans against six or something. You can't tell because he's either drunk or high or just idiotic. <br /> <br /> Karen Black is just annoying ... randomly laughing and shouting to irritate you. <br /> Helen Mirren ... she was in the original and her return to "Caligula" consists of ... "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Especially "love" (and love, I mean hate) Ennia line, "Caligola ... j00 doesn't mind me * anything inconsistent * .... * something that sounds like j00nalo *" It is also extremely arrogant to say Caligula's four-year reign was greater than the birth and death of Jesus. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this must be the worst, most exploitative, selflessly arrogant cute piece called "art" I've ever seen. Even if Gore Vidal hated the original Caligula, he would not have had to show or give his name to this devil, no matter how much they paid him (unless it was a billion trillion yen). The worst trailer ever.
