So ... we see Brando's extra material ... an interesting but not exactly Oscar-worthy stuff. Susannah York was hardly slouch. The new scene, where Lois discovers Clark, is somewhat incredible at Superman because he doesn't notice that the weapons are empty instead of real bullets. Real balls would have passed through her clothes and then bumped into the floor, but forgot that ... listen to Donner make Lester's version more fun. The President speaks of the "defect" of the Washington Monument, when it was originally the Rushmore Mountain. Changing this scene made this line completely absurd. The line of Superman's "freedom of the press" sounded foolish when compared to "..Care to step out", which was better and was connected to Clark's earlier scene at a truck stop. Then it ends with "returning to the world to go back in time". It turned back to the whole movie and made you think about exactly where N.J. Rocket because it no longer releases the Zod and the company.
