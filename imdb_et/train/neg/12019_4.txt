I read a couple of good reviews on Mr Scarface's table, but for everyone who is not in the genre of Italian gangster movies, like me, there is probably little point in the picture. Indeed, after the initial set-up, which involved ten million lyric scams, the picture was divided into a rather routine revenge that emerged with a small twist by the character of Rick (Al Cliver). The whole gang warrior plot got me a little when Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli) was involved, but as most other viewers commented, he was the only one who gave this picture to every life with his often ineffective attempts at violence. I found it somewhat unbelievable that the Manzar ghosts who went through the Tony streets did not really hit Tony's hands. The waste of Jack Palance due to the character of the title was rather vague as it was in the extreme finals, which is why the title of "US Scarface" is quite controversial. I've seen enough spaghetti in Western countries to find out they're not working; I think in this case, my first look at the spaghetti gangster flick hasn't done that either.
