The main picture of this movie is not bad. The woman makes it big and returns to her alma mater to respect her. But despite the good actions of Robert Young and Eve Arden, this film is confusing. To blame for this, either Joan Crawford or the director, or both, because his performance is just terrible. Instead of being a real person, he makes a miracle of deer caught in the headlamps. In other words, he stares at the cosmos and has the "golly I SOOOO" stunned expression. In a few minutes, it was annoying for me. It is definitely not the only Crawford movie that I do not like for my performance because he had done more than his share in excess films - in films such as JOHNNY GUITAR or many of his later films, such as BERSERK! My advice is to try another Crawford movie - there was definitely better.
