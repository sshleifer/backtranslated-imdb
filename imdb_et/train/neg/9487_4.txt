Cast, though not special, all make OK work, the story seems like a good idea, the script is tolerable and at the end is a pretty good twist; So what's wrong? <br /> <br /> At first, the special effects are very bad (when it was done in the 60s), it may sound OK, but in 2003 there is no excuse that visual images are as bad as it is. It makes me laugh that the DVD is very proud of "Jeepers Creepers' special effects creator". Second, the direction is weak, this film does not make the story essentially, the doctor hospital prisoners feeding the devil (or demon type) should be tense or scary; it just isn't. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a pretty bad film, and although it is tolerable and sometimes slightly entertaining, it's probably alone. <br /> <br /> A pretty sad 4/10
