I admit that I was a fan of the original production. I've never seen a movie version until recently through the cable and looked at it to see my memories back in life because I adored the original exhibition. Imagine my fear. <br /> <br /> This must be the worst translation of a Broadway play ever made. They changed the story, changed the songs, lost the soul. Waiting for a trip from the memory card, singing in the exceptionally touching music and mirror, ballet and Hello Twelve, Hello Thire. Not! Not only did they fake the music to an almost recognizable point, they confused the story by adding songs and exterior lines (hello Cassie and Michael Douglas) that were not in the original, and injecting the "drama" where it was not necessary. The original was self-sufficient enough to suck. If you were a fan of the original Broadway show, don't worry. I'm sorry I wasted my time and diluted my memories by looking at it.
