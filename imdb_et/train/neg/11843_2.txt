Just because the event really happened does not mean that it does a good scenario / movie. Cat Bogdanovich claims that the cat is based on real events that took place on a cruise organized by William Randolph Hurst. The writer paid more attention to creating strange signs of taking time to create a story for bold characters. The main moments of the story seem unreliable; for example, if Hurst accidentally seduces the manufacturer, believing he is Chaplin. The basic element of the story is based on someone who is wearing the wrong hat, tricked and animated. The story tries to be in the dark comedy, but the cat meow remains an important part of this equation, comedy. There is also no empathy. There is hardly anyone who is beaten, killed, guilty and innocent. There is no strong character to rejoice. As a result, conflicts are difficult to care for and the end result is accidental.
