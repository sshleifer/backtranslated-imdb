Look, I'm sorry if half of this world gets offended, but life is confusing. I don't have to look that way. I take a long time with Anthony Hopkins. I even looked at the fracture and knew it would be a steamy heap of Quentin. But this thing is not good, and it is not bold - even if it is artistic. Well-produced films have reasons for cutting and fast editing, not "oh, but this is a realistic interpretation". This thing will hurt your head. This is the fastest moving picture that never takes you. I still love AH and I always give him another chance, but if you don't have time to look at bad ideas on the screen, skip it.
