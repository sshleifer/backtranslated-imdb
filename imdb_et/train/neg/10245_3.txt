I waited for this movie a lot. Kindle like Lee like Naustradamous as a caracter, but instead of getting it, it was a waste of time and a boring film. I can't even explain that movie. It had a dreadful wood-based script from the Bible, such as hurricanes, tidal waves, and earthquakes. But it was at the end! The rest I had to wait for and I hope something meaningful happens, but it wasn't. This film talks about a couple trying to find out the changes that are happening in the world like places in China, where there was an earthquake and ended in a monastery led by eight nuns and a priest. The monastery is the key to misshappenings. The whole movie is leading and boring. One of the worst.
