Poor Robert Englund makes another flop and Tobe Cooper, who usually makes good horror movies, but he didn't succeed. Englund plays the well-known Marque De Sade, who in the 17th century was imprisoned for his obsession with pain and joy to bring pain to himself and watching other pains. The story is so confusing that the flip is from one century to another and I got confused about what's going on and what the purpose of this film was. I saw a young lady who was stuck with a strange lesbian who wanted to keep her and a young lady got a lot of money fascinated by this arabic and discovered she was trying to kill her and then go to England for another century, claiming she was de Sade's descendant and trying to kill her because she reminded her of Mrs. Momoselle (written wrong) or who was above the wall of De Sades. The film was terrible, I'm surprised at Hooper's letting of Englund in this movie, and the special effects were so fake and ridiculous, especially on the eyes. Englund is trying to take his rebound in his turn "Nightmare on Elm St." using them pull and pull the needles to put people's eyes out. Terrible, totally terrible.
