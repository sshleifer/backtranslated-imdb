I was eagerly awaiting the first screening of this movie because it was given to me on DVD during Christmas. Having booked a special slot last night, I sat down to look at it with my daughter (17-year-old and film-learner), of course, eagerly waiting for chocolate. We love Jane Austin. <br /> <br /> After the first two minutes we knew we were drowning. Dirty camera shots and corners, general bad cinematography, direction and wood performances had already left us flat and satisfied. Desperate, we looked at it. <br /> <br /> Anne, played by Sally Hawkins, looked at the camera several times strangely and without any special purpose, breaking our hard-won "momentary fantasy" and attracting us to "I find you" immediately. <br /> <br /> Poor Rupert Penry-Jones, who played Captain Wentworth, made his best script and direction, blessed him. I hope they will pay him well because he once dropped a huge wave, predicted to break the sea, shaking him and his co-worker. They were almost in the sea. Health and safety should have been a field day! Poor Rupert was left to break off the seawater to deliver his line. The cat was not expected to have enough money to reuse this scene. Anyone who has any idea wouldn't have tried that first on that day. <br /> <br /> After Mr. Penry-Jones, Alice Krige was the only convincing result like Lady Russell, but her efforts were soon balanced with Anthony Head's incredible imagination of the annoying Sir Walter Elliot. <br /> <br /> The long-awaited tip of the movie showed Captain Wentworth Anne a strange grace to visit every two seconds, taking great pains to avoid him for most of the movie. It would be like he would have developed a memory barrier that made him forget his reason. On the other hand, Anne ran out of the pillar by hyper-venting to look for a good captain, who in the meantime had been able to summon almost all of the Baths we had been told for almost three or four minutes. even without developing sweat. <br /> <br /> We weren't experiencing any of Anne's charms over the screen. Indeed, we left to ponder what charismatic captain Wentworth ever saw is a simple, spineless, opinion-less Anne and why no one, no one, said, with wings Sir Walter just shut the heck up. <br /> <br /> An important kiss, usually our favorite girl moment, was painfully pulled out. As they approached, Anne continued to open and close her mouth, which affected the screen as if she were chewing gum before her lips finally met. Eww! <br /> <br /> The most pleasant thing last night was chocolate and half an hour between mother and daughter, how bad the film was. <br /> <br /> What a terrible and interesting story that has been filmed in some of England's finest landscapes? <br /> <br /> Sorry Jane.
