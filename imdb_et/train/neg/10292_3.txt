It has its own characteristics; Morvern Callar is both content-related and disappointing. He is so mysterious, so original. Is it his method of dealing with the pain of a lost person, which makes him so distant and relative? Or is he, as one reviewer, calling him revolutionary? Personally, I would call him dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> Morvern is completely separated. His expulsion, informing the unthinking family, or the money he gave him the right funeral splashed spontaneously on a trip to Spain. It looks like he does not have such a relatively human greed of bar. The only element that allows the audience to see his human side is his close friend, whom he rides with him. Though his friend is finally dumped and Morvern has nothing to do with his humanity. He can also kill himself. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Spain looks as grim and horrible as the UK, the director's shots were excellent, lighting and color making the film visually stunning. It's really a shame that the film doesn't have anything that keeps interest. It's just over 90 minutes, but it looks much longer. They can make Morvern interesting to grab your attention, but do not do anything to him, but to transfer him more to you than to care about characters or the movie.
