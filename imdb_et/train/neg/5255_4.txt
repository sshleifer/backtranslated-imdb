Visually, this movie is stunning. It has some pleasant black comedy moments. In general, the plot is very clever, as is its apparent message. If you are a fan of overwhelming violence in mainstream movies like a hostel or saw, then you will love it. If you are looking for something of a high standard, take it away. I saw it as part of the Edinburgh Film Festival 06 and I chose it just because I was looking for something disturbing. Ultimately, it is not disturbing. Just grinding and unpleasant sitting. If you really want to challenge it, look at something that's gone. If you want to be grossed, or tell your friends a really confusing film, that's for you.
