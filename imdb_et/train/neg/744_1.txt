The Holy Striking God is omnipotent. This movie was so bad, I thought I was drugs. In a bad way ... The character is the poorest thing I've seen for some time. This film was more like the G-String Lord, IMHO (this is a real film). Most of the movies seemed to be made on a green green screen. My favorite part was when they were in the shipment, and you can say that there is no horse. They flee from aliens' monsters and rush at the same speed as fast. Then it goes into a far-off shot of a ridiculous CG horse. And the CG seems to be generally in sight of the 1992 Beyond the Mind. I know, Come on, really. It seemed like a terrible episode of Hercules, only if Kevin Sorbo didn't save that day. Worst. Movie. Never.
