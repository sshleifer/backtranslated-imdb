I have said that in other comments, without telling the story, you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want, but nobody gives you a damn. <br /> <br /> The director has a big eye on the art deco of the 1930s, and I think that the idea of ​​using all digital backgrounds and such might indeed be the future of film making. However, it is obvious that the director became so interested in the digital transformation of his film, he forgot to shoot many scenes that would have greatly contributed to the surprisingly thin film. (SPOILER) shouting out loud, they forgot about the crime in this matter! OK, they have one, but he's been dead for 20 years by the time of the movie. Conran is struggling with evil. As for the action, let's see that Sky Captain (Law) fires one robot, two or three sliding wing planes (before Dexi (Ribisi) says he stops firing !!!) and a couple of robots, but spends his time mostly silent and fight for others. Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or Punky, or what is completely wasted in this movie (the reviewer commenting on his lack of chemistry and law is so right) and I got a little sick to see the repetitive techniques at the top of my camera, showing he has only two pictures to the left, both of which remain in the movie later, one uncomfortable, quite funny, even though I saw it after 70 years. No one except the law and Paltrow doesn't have any significant time on the screen and this is the real mistake of the movie. Audiences don't recognize robots, they need a hero to root, and a visible, despicable hate. Without it, plus a happy story, CG doesn't help the world.
