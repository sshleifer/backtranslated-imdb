I'm just ambiguous about my potential spoiled comments. In this film, there are enough preserved elements of the plot that have been essentially damaged in advance. <br /> <br /> This movie comes from some of the Southern classic ideas to kill the buggy. I think maybe TKOM got his ideas from some source ... anyway after you look at it, you say, "Oh yes, it's ripoff." <br /> <br /> I think the really fun thing about these McMovies is if you have identified the plot element, find out if they will stick with the original or try to turn it around. There are not many twists in this.
