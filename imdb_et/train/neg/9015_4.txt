Dragon Fighter's first 45 minutes are perfectly acceptable and surprisingly observable. The characters are plausible and interesting. The cloning lab seems really high tech. After that all this collapses. The characters start to behave idiotically, and the new sub-block is moved to a fusion reactor (and is said to be "today's") critical, the only reason being that the dragon needs to be killed - only that. The finish is incredibly weak. One wonders what made such a movie that started so well that so wrong. <br /> <br /> All characters except Dean Cain are played by Russians. This results in some strange situations and details, as characterized by Vessela Dimitrova, called "Bailey Kent", despite her heavy accent (and despite being inexpressible * Spain *!). <br /> <br /> Because of a decent start, I considered it to be a movie rating of 5, but it was really more disappointing, so I only give it 4.
