Similar twin sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen climbed in fame like "Two of a Kind", I had never seen them before, but I had an idea what to expect, but it was much worse. Basically, Hunter's sisters Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in summer for the Intern program in Rome, but not long after they start working, they are fired immediately for a number of mistakes. But the man who owns the company where they work, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), gives them their job back and they slowly prove useful assets and talented (fashion designers) and help stop the company taking over. Also starring Leslie Danon Jami, Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan, Ilenia Lazzarin like Dari, Archie Kao Nobu, Valentina Mattolini Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso Paolo and Matt Patresi Enrico Tortoni. You can say that this film was made directly to the video, the work of the camera is totally inappropriate and it does not help to admire the sights of Rome. In fact, the only good viewing background, twin sisters are the two most disturbing fame, I knew they didn't want to care about me in any way (not even theirs), this is a terrible waste film. Pretty bad!
