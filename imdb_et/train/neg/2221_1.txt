Sorry, but it may be scary in 1978 when it came out, but nowadays it just doesn't hold. The only interesting scene in the film is the opening plan where Michael kills his sister, Judith, wearing her Halloween mask. The most amazing moment of the whole movie is when his parents cut off the mask to see how their son killed his daughter. The film goes down there and doesn't rise until the last fifteen minutes, but by then it's too late for the audience to lose all interest in that story. There's hardly any character development and people always rave about Laurie's kind of extraordinary heroine when there's really not much of her. I'm sorry I don't agree with all the people scared by this movie, but if you want a big horror movie, check out The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. These are the two best fear films ever made. Halloween is definitely not in their ranks. I can't believe that Roger Ebert gave him four letters because this film has no chance of deserving such a high rating.
