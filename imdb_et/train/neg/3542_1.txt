Having read the site's comments, I have been forced to write for the first time. It seems like this movie is like Marmite and it has shared the audience. I have to say that although I agree with the movies, you don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE), but they still have to deal with the characters. Now that I have been fully absorbed by Lynch's oppressive lesbian case, I have to say that I was unable to give Mr Green or other cardboard gangsters who lived in the world of the day. <br /> <br /> Also, although so many people seem to try and say that you didn't enjoy it because you didn't get it, I'd agree - I didn't enjoy it because I was bored. I wanted the movie to end and listen to these quotes constantly and again. Call it wise if you want it - I think it's repetitive. <br /> <br /> But my main reason for writing is to ask all other authors about the question - I didn't see the end result I saw. Just music with black. Did I look at the print or is it proof of GR? Or have all the people involved in the film looked at the raw paragraph and their names have been removed ???
