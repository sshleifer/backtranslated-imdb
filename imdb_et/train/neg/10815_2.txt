I love the book "Jane Eyre" and I've seen it a lot. Everyone has their strengths and mistakes. But it was one of the worst I've seen. I don't care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost tolerated and certainly saw a smooth part, but he had no emotion in any of his ranks. I couldn't imagine what Mr Rochester saw him. <br /> <br /> This brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Huril had even less emotion than Jane would have if possible. How two such insecure people could fall in love is a mystery, but it was certainly not my attention. Maybe the director (Zeffrelli) was asleep during production. <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton (too beautiful for Mr. Rochester!) The version is much more reliable for the book, but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect version of Mr. Rochester's 1997 A / E (which isn't all right for the book). <br /> <br /> Trying to find something positive about this movie: Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in her role.
