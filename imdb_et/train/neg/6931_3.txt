A stupid, rich boy, about 1800, wants to visit a spiritual refuge to see how a famous doctor cares for his patients. Despite the initial hostile response, he will soon be called heartily and given a good doctor's report. And as the doctor tells him, he speaks and talks and talks !!! And when he speaks, loonies run here and there's nothing particularly productive. Although here and there are some activities (and some of them are quite disturbing), it is amazing how dull and brain is the whole thing - the lack of life and energy that is weird for horror. Even a boy who thinks he's a chicken and a dress is quite tiring. The farther the visitor is, the more troublesome you finally realize that the inmates have taken over the hospital and torture their possessors. What's more, despite this twist, the film is amazingly lifeless in many places - especially when it moves very slowly when a strange ceremony is taking place, or when people just migrate around. Only if the staff in the shelter are starving to prison, does the film have a real impact. Given this plot, it's sure it's hard to imagine it's boring, but the people who made this cheap exploiting movie! Now, with the same plot and competent in writing, acting, and directions, it could have been an interesting and worthy movie. the original "Star Trek" TV show! You know that one who has "Lord Garth - Master of the Universe" and Kirk and Spock is crazy and his crazy followers in prison. nudity here and there and includes rape so be careful - it's not for kids. In fact, if the movie is worthless, it's not for anyone! But the version of "50 Movie Pack - Chilling Classics" is so incredibly bad that this meat is hard to see because the print is so dark.
