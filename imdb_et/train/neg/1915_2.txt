This is a pretty good light, but the film doesn't have the grace of the almost original Italian comedy "Big Deal on Madonna Street". Anyone looking for an entertaining caper should visit the original. William Macy can be one of our biggest living actors, but here he has little use. And his role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroian, so I am sorry he's trying to fill them with a gift. Maybe you would try to imitate Bogart or the young De Nirot. The direction of art is rich and textured, but the story doesn't produce anything, the extra letters they add to the story, feel completely unnecessary, and the things they take away are missed. Even if they start with how they look, it seems strange that it is beyond the surprise of the original. Sam Rockwell has his strange and brilliant charm, and Luis Guzman has such a strange charisma, but the film's love story is as clever and flat. It is too bad that no one has understood this film and its first creation, but then it is too bad when we live in a culture where we feel we have to do amazing things instead of just learning enjoy the original.
