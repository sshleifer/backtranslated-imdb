"Major Payne" is a film about a larger person who makes his small group of living sail hell. This movie doesn't really have much to offer, but it offers many fun moments that are worth watching. Don't expect this to be a memorable film. Just wait to laugh your way through film and other people. Major Payne and the chubby boy's confrontation was fun, and that's all I remember about the movie except for the guys who want revenge on Major Payne. Again, it's not a great movie, and it's probably best to watch the rainy day when you need laughter.
