I looked at the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between the 3 pounds and the House, M.D. Tucci's character is brilliant but socially unfair, similar to Laurie's House, but without Acerbic wit that Laurie brings House. In the meantime, Tucci's "straight man", the empathetic doctor Seger, has developed into a more interesting character, such as the flawless "straight boys" Cuddy and Wilson. Adrienne Holland, a character from Indira Varma, is too similar to Jennifer Morrison's doctor, Cameron, to accompany her. <br /> <br /> Some of CBS apparently noticed the success of House's MD and told his staff to get him a similar show, hoping the mimic would succeed. Copying an exhibition, such as a House, requires the same high balance between spiritual and temporary, and not just a challenge for Tucci and the company. <br /> <br /> I didn't know the show was canceled before I read the comments on IMDb, but it is not a surprise for me.
