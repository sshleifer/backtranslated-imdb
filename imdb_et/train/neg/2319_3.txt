The film has many stupid holes. First we see him seeing his master practice in kung-fu and dying in his practice. It suits me. And then at the end of the film, we see that he uses the kung-fu he studied, looking at his master when he was still a child. Is it even possible? I do not believe it. <br /> <br /> This show is only for Jay Chou fans and the film lacks the depth of character development, cinematic styles and plot opening. <br /> <br /> Nobody notices that the basketball captain (forgot his name) and the idolized player Li Xiao seem to be so similar when you think they're the same person? Long hair, sunny boy, long and strong. These two saw that they came out of a mass production company designed to bring out products that make teenage girls orgasm screaming. Not that these two participants had any value to contribute to the film as a whole as a whole. <br /> <br /> Jokes were flat and not funny at all. Regarding the four masters of Jay Chou who come back to help him out on the basketball court, they degenerated into a useless plot as they began to scream their opponents' area. What's worse, when the four masters won the fight, the crowd began to rejoice and the race continued. Was it really WTF? At the end of the show, when they win the race, thanks to Jay Chou's excellent kung fu skills. How he acquired these kung-fu skills is a mystery because the exhibition shows him in some way the acquisition of skills simply by tracking his master. And then his long-lost father comes out of wood to testify Jay'd Chou as his long-lost son just seemed too quick for the director to capture the film. . See it only when Jay Chou is your fan. If you are one of those whose flavors in the movies largely coincide with IMDb's 250 best movies ever, this film is not for you.
