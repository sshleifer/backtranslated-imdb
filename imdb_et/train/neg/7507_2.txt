This movie is bad news and I am really surprised at the level of great talent who would ever accept such spam as such. I imagine there were some strangled agents in Hollywood Blvd. as a result of this fiasco. What really gets is that it could have been good. The directors' complaint and topic was enough bait for interest and ticket sales, but it's a flop. Multiple story lines all go for bad silly pictures in the end, and you end up feeling like a mouse maze looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten. What Spike is able to achieve is vengeance against every Italian who could have offended him or her, because the film makes a lot of obsolete and probably offensive Italian stereotypes. As with any Spike Lee movie, some have really thought of provocative and magical camera work. He has given his psyche a grasp and you are in your sight if it is just a few memorable scenes. But the question remains ... can you withstand the other 2 hours of scratching the head and looking at the clock if you don't know and wait for the end to be there somewhere.
