Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and serve it so I am happy to see their films. Basically, the horn factory is the fourth person to crack, and soon it will be enough for Ollie to crack with all the horns. He rested home with Stan next to him, quietly needed, and Doctor (James Finlayson) phones to say he was coming to check out Ollie. After understanding the water supply and the electric current, the cross-eye repair shop has come across, the doctor needs to check and after some tests he recommends drinking milk and ocean air. After Stan, he plays trumpet by hanging a window through a telephone cable and a car crash, he and an Ollie ship in a dock. They keep the boat in the dock, trying milk milk and Stan has brought his trumpet! Meanwhile, the newspaper reads on the front page that Killer Nick Grainger - the escaped convector (Richard Cramer) has escaped and is sleeping on the boys' bed at bedtime and chewing the goat through a boat ride to the sea. In the morning, look at their location, and the killer will be demanding something to eat, and he will put Stan and Ollie in for making fake food, eg. spaghetti, cheese soap, bacon, meatballs sponge and force them to eat. When Ollie starts to stifle something, Stan blows his trumpet to help, and Ollie's rage strikes the killer and goes on until the police arrive just to put Ollie's rage into prison. There were little moments in comedy, but this is not a big black and white film. "Well, here's another nice mess you got into me!" was 60 for 100 years, 100 quotes and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were comedian comedy 7. Okay!
