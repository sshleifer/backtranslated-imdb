I sat down to watch this movie with friends with very low expectations. My expectations were not low enough. I couldn't honestly say what genre this movie was watching, and when it was comedy, humor was completely lost. The plot was non-existent and the action was terrible. My friends and I managed to watch about 30 to 40 minutes of this movie before we turned it off and asked for it back soon. I do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you try to watch the worst movies all the time. I really do not know how this movie in the cinema lasts for more than a day in theaters and, moreover, I do not understand why anyone would like to watch it, not only because of the very interesting title but also the lack of famous actors / actors. This review is not a joke and I honestly think it can be the worst film. This is definitely the worst film I've ever had to sit on.
