Put it on the flick DVD Time Capsule, and it will definitely show future generations an ideal example of what will provide a minimum rating on a 1 to 10-star scale. <br /> <br /> Bill Cosby and Ray Romano have been on the chart and tens of millions of revenue a year - with their TV series. However, everyone has not been successful in the big screen offerings. This also applies to other TV shows - perhaps because many of the songs that have been played for two hours or seem to fit more than 10 minutes or at most 22 or 23 minutes of drama half-time. hour program. <br /> <br /> This movie, however, does not have one element that would be justified for two or three minutes on MAD TV, SNL, or anywhere else on the screen or stage. <br /> <br /> Its start date is listed in 2002, but the release date - DVD only - is shown in 2004. It was also filmed before Rodney Dangerfield's death, so the redemption of this value is that it is probably a few hundred thousand more dollars for his heirs. <br /> <br /> I would never have heard of it, but I found it when I turned on my set, and frankly it got it. Some movies are so terribly appalling that they appreciate the top rating in the opposite direction - so bad that you can turn the selection disc upside down to 9 or 10. "Space Plan 9" is the best example - and Bruce Jenner / Village People opus, "Can't Stop the Music," is another. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this flick even remains there. Even though Rodney's earlier work (as well as some of his fellow Members) remained under "Citizen Kane" or "Casablanca", there was a lot of sense of humor and a story that offered at least interest. <Br / Unfortunately, this presentation does not seem to have such material even in a few minutes or two.
