I didn't expect much when I saw it this weekend at the Palm Springs Film Festival. This was an alternative choice when two other films were sold out. But I kept the hope. It sounded a bit much like "bride and prejudice" (L.A. boy falls into Indian beauty, parental conflict, blah blah blaa). B&P wasn't perfect, but it was an enjoyable movie with some good laughs and nice characters. <br /> <br /> "My Bollywood Bride" was nothing about it. The actors seemed cunning and led to remote numbers. The characters were so clich√©s that the story seemed to have been written by high school fresh drama students. Technically it disturbed me. There seemed to be a lot of reversal of the dialogue. I mean a lot. I sometimes know it is necessary, but it sounded like a half in the movie cabinet and it became very annoying. <br /> <br /> The two stars are somewhat generous.
