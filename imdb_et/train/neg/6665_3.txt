OK, the story - easier loony enters forever to a young chick and his son and destroys his life - is a little interesting. Anyway, the idea is nothing (everyone has ...) - filling is everything. <br /> <br /> This is what disturbed me. And it disturbed me enormously. The rhythm (targeting, editing) was slow, the pace was uneven and the expected peak. We've seen these ways, six, seven-time highways - why? Norton's character's worries saw a childish game that was not deep enough to understand his problems / soul / blah and root or accept him. Is he a coward, manipulator or just loony? The references to the taxi driver were ridiculous and unnecessary, and certainly not in favor of this flick (or E.N.i). <br /> <br /> And IMHO, it will be filled endlessly at the end. Cheap emotional tricks for teen lovers in Mid America. This man should have killed the child, blame the father, create a true destruction. Or should the boy eventually kill his father, etc., but no, we've got the end of the cheese where kids can't create, Dad is puzzled by his life and relationships with them and of course dies loony. The happy dysfunctional family will remain unharmed, safe and happy forever, so that we can enjoy our pop corn that would be undisturbed. long and hard to find something stupider than that! You won't let such a scene with a hidden camera and a hidden team. The creators of this movie probably thought it was a good idea, but it was more than annoying. Again, if you are a 16-year-old girl somewhere in Kansas or wherever you dream about having sex with a madman who is twice older, OK, you can enjoy this movie and its "message".
