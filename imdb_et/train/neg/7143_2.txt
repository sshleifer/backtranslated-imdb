This movie has some of the most amazing cars I've ever seen in the movie, and definitely the hottest women, but I have to say it's still one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There is a plot here, and if you read it with a little slip, you will also be active. <br /> <br /> Begin, bring characters, hot woman sings (obvious lip sync). The music agent or producer arrives, thinks he is fantastic, asks him about the race. He turns down, too many bad memories. The hero of war, the Flash that has returned from war, is in the fight and becomes the hero of the film that it is better than everyone. Drive fast in an exotic car. Brother races, then dies. Hero to death, cut off to get weapons for a friend. (You have never seen this friend before or after, but it looks like he cares) Are you sure you want to do it; Yes; I mean, are you really sure; Yes, give me weapons; are you really sure; Yes; I don't think I can talk about you, be careful, I love you. <br /> <br /> Now he goes to his big house, who drove his car. He finds the woman, decides to save her, she drives away and she does not stop killing her uncle. Now it's a competition to finish the movie. Oh yes, you have to throw another scene with bad people to beat people who are not really the thing, but maybe it will add a little plot. Race is not even so exciting, of course, it ends with two car races, and one that should win the victory at the end of the surprise. <br /> <br /> OK, I just saved you $ 7.00. You can send all your money to me, because I should have given you the same enjoyment as the movie. Don't do me wrong, cars are fantastic and Nadia is beautiful, but it's a really terrible movie.
