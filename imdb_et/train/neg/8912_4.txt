Dark Rising is your typical bad, probably quickly produced horror / sci-fi / fantasy movie. This is a strange, unexplained plot with holes that are so large that you can install an elephant through them. Most of the time I didn't know what the hell was going on, but it wasn't really important, it was a simple demon player who returns from the hell dimension to save the tent of the campers with a mess that has been added to the witches and the evil book of plot elements and characters that have no sense or character lose for some reason. Action is bad, but to be honest, there is not much I think of this script. There are a couple of topless scenes, which is probably the only reason this bad movie got (like many other bad movies). Give this one pass if nothing else T.V.
