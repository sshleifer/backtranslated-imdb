I like Fulc's movies, I really and not a bit boring ironically, but I know they seem hopelessly intuitive and spoiled for many people. <br /> <br /> Conquest is a place where Fulci tries to make an epic fantasy genre and fails. Structurally, it's like most of the Fulci movies you've seen. Some things happen, more things happen and from time to time one scene may be tangentially related to another. Really this is like Conan, with no set, no script, no real actors (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is hardly an actor), no budget, stupid looking dog soldiers and a bunch of gore. <br /> <br /> It was hard to get through and I could have lived without the camcorder fading to give the hair a Metal Music Video.
