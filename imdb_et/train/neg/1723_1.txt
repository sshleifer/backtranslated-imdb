Man, what this fraud turned out to be! Not because it was not good (because I didn't expect it), but because the DVD sleeve misled me, which inevitably ignored my "stars" as Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Of course, their names didn't appear in the movie opening loans, much less the rest of the !! As it turned out, the only movie that unites these three actors is the equally hidden LAS VEGAS LADY (1975)? but what is it related to CRATER LAKE MONSTER, anyone think? <br /> <br /> Even though I paid $ 1.50 for my rent, and I was always in the mood for a monster movie, I chose the movie, and crap, it was stupid! Apart from having names and an anonymous team, the invisibly amateur air was visible miles away, and most of what I could do was laugh at JAWS-like claims and deliberately so resisting two moronic robbers-cum-boat owners often confused with the local sheriff. Being yourself? plesiosaur, ie a half-dinosaur / half-fish? has been imperfectly realized (of course), but as it was with GIANT CLAW (1957), which I just saw, it didn't seem to be disturbing to filmmakers because they hit it as much as possible, especially on the other side of the movie!
