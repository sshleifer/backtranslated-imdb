There are two remarkable events on the Descent plot, if it can actually be called a plot. One at the beginning - one at the end. These events make up 5% of the total movie time. All (and I mean _everything_) is basically a desperate attempt by the director to complete the minutes. I like disturbing movies, I like dark movies and I'm not worried about sharp scenes - but if you expect me to sit through 60-minute blurry / literal (literally) scenes with no NO style, you have one more thing . Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses, has been completely wasted here. And no, he can't get naked, even in the NC-17 version I saw. <br /> <br /> If you have a few hours to throw away and want to look at "Descent", take the sun instead - you probably have more interesting dreams.
