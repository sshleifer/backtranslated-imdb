This is clearly illegal. Pedophiles pray for such things. How did they get away from making such a movie? This movie is summarized in one word, SICK. Where people give up and watch such movies. When I watched the film, I didn't think they would allow the child who might say 12 when she was actually sleeping with her. I'm sorry if it's a spoiler for you, but I wouldn't have seen it. Where are the mysteries of these people gone? Perhaps the makers of this film are pedophiles? Our society today is full of all kinds of sexual predators who pray for their children, but filmmakers do this type of film that does nothing but provoke this type of behavior. I noticed that in the previous comment someone asked if there was a version where it showed them naked. This is a baby here and someone asks for something like that? What's wrong with this picture?
