They would hit this story! Finally, Nell is all heroic and takes on a team to save all his asses from Hill House and a bunch of nonsense like that! They added fine heads, led the peoples face, and became the giant hand! What the hell is that? I own and love the original movie, I read the book and I love it! The reason why the original film and the book are so big is that it scares you so much without showing the ghost. No gore. There is no download hand. It's just a ghost advertisement, how ghosts can actually kill a person. They can't kill us, they can't throw us into the room or knock our head. No. They can only drive us mad. Taking away all our sense of security. Nell was a selfish woman. He wanted only good things for himself. Yes, he took care of others, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont have taken off this great story! I hate this fucking remake!
