Notorious B.I.G. as a fan I was expecting this movie. I'm sorry it's a terrible movie. Jamal Woodward is neither convincing nor realistic to portray Notorious B.I.G. A lot of story follows the true son of Notorious B.I.G, Christopher Jordan Wallace as Notorious B.I.G. as a child. Unfortunately, he is not convincing enough to express his father's respect. Derek Luke is as incredible as Sean's "Puffy" combs. In short, no one is convincing enough to play their role here. The big problem with this is what they actually play. It was boring and did not know Notorious B.I.G. that fans and non-fans have not yet known. I was particularly disappointed with Angela Bassett, who was a very good actor here under Voletta Wallace. The film slides and slides with thoughtful Notorious B.I.G. fans spend a lot of money on it. I'm sorry it happened. It's not anywhere near a good movie. I waited so much for this, but unfortunately I didn't get anything I wanted. I think you should definitely skip it.
