This TV thriller is a speech, a little action. It works hard to create its own twisted plot, but writing is so confusing that exposure is at best cloudy. Finally, I didn't know these characters anymore than at the beginning. It has a quasi "ten small Indians" scenario, but it dives in the middle through the illumination of Sally Field and the discovery of his killer. The field crosses the grace that I rarely see. Early introduction is good, but writing quickly accelerates and ends at the top. Lots of hysteria and constant thunder and lightning effects (which adds something). Curious failure from Aaron Spelling & Leonard Goldberg. With all this talent, they couldn't give us anything more than a script full of red herring and Sally Field, hiding in the closet?
