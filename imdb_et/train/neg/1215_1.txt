I don't often give one-star comments, but my computer won't let me make negative numbers. <br /> <br /> Open headlines tell us that we are already in deep water. Although it is a low budget movie, 17 manufacturers are credited. No. No. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story, his wife, Kenneth, is home to a high-quality gateway for his family. The house is a pig. His wife, Della (Kim Basinger), has been running children all day. <br /> <br /> OK. We are already in deep water. Basinger was 55 when the movie came. Are they his children or grandchildren? This is Christmas Eve. Della travels to a shopping center, a long scene that could have been cut. In order to get home the idea of ​​the eeeeeeev in the unrestrained universe of male aggression, he drives the last footballers to play a complete uniform by pouring rain on Christmas Eve. Of course. For an extra charge, he sees a vehicle that is associated with killed deer. <br /> <br /> However, we get real tension in driving scenes. Rain and traffic are bad. First of all, we see Della trying to ride and smoke at the same time. Then, at the same time, Della tries to drive and talk with her mobile phone, turning at one point to completely reverse the phone for the charger. <br /> <br /> She travels in the mall, sees her old friend from college, tries to buy things, but her credit card has been rejected, maybe her husband is dirty because she's broken but it's too complicated to follow the script. <br /> <br /> When it comes to parking, she runs gently in the most ridiculous gang of film history. One white boy (Lukas Hass looks at his career in the toilet), one black, one Asian and one Spanish. Imagine a company with people who have gone bad and have an idea. <br /> <br /> Although they have a weapon, they give them an attitude. The department store policeman needs to be investigated and they shoot him with his head burning more than once. Parking is overcrowded as possible, people everywhere and no one knows. <br /> <br /> Della escapes in her car, and not choosing a police station or a well-lit safe area will drive to a construction site where she kills all four bad boys one by one with tools (literally). <br /> <br /> MAJOR Spoiler Front. <br /> <br /> He is driving home. The car runs out so it runs through the rain. Checking the children, falling, and when his wife asks what he got in the mall shows him to the gun and lets him score in a blank space. <br /> <br /> The four-point experience has resulted in Della's personal enhancement. Instead, we know that his children spend the Christmas in a nursing home or in a group home because the state collects them when he accuses him. Four mites can be classified as self-defense for legitimate slaughter. Man, different story. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I saw it on the cable. If I could see it in the theater (did it get some release?) I would have been furious. Just as I'm just sad when I see talent like Mrs Basinger and Mr Haas waste such rubbish. <br /> <br /> One very good thing. It was written and directed by Susan Montford. Mrs Montford has not received another writing or referral after this newspaper. There is justice in the world.
