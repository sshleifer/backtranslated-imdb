Please save me from movies that teach us that crime is fun and legitimate. Couple with a flawless script with an intense desire to be Farrelly or a Coen brother, as well as another group of allegedly middle-aged people who work with their Dawson Creek brand teenagers along with the GenXYZ soundtrack that is trying to cool the "feel" of the movie and we are intensely and painfully intuitive. <br /> <br /> It's not even "Ferris Bueller" relaxed ... I'd rather look at the traffic light change. <br /> <br /> Only one scene looks remarkably affordable when Betty's masked girls meet Richard Nixon masked friend, this is a surreal moment.Exclusively smooth. <br /> <br /> For the rest, I have toothache, at least I can use some benzocaine (tm) to stop the pain.
