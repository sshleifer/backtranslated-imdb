OK, I know that many people will probably annoy this review because Watership Down is a "classic" and standard part of most people's childhood, but I see this movie for the first time at the age of 18 when I have to admit: I really hated it. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it, and many people who threw the word "Watership Down" - their memories of seeing the movie kids and their emotions have been torn on the seams - suggested it . Frankly, I wish I didn't bother. I questioned him; generally, I don't want to stop watching the movie halfway. It was an exception. It was really, really, scary, painfully boring. This movie was probably the slowest thing I ever watched (imagine a doped-up snail in a room) and really didn't do it for me. Art was fine; The backgrounds were nicely made, if not very blissful and paired, but the rabbits themselves were not very cute and the animation was quite nervous and poorly produced. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to get into a big detail story; Basically, this is a story of a group of rabbits who leave their horses due to human infiltration in the area. In general, the moral story is about the dangers of human interactions with the environment that uses anthropomorphic rabbits to transmit the message. For me, I wanted them to get gas, not because I was a terrible sadistic person, but because the characters were uninspiring, annoying, boring and generally quite rude (though I'm so terribly English). I found that watching the movie, I constantly watch the clock, and it took 20 minutes or before something really happened, and even it was a terrible anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> When I approve of something, I have to admit that the concept of showing children the danger of building land and hopefully opening up people's arrogance and etc etc is quite understandable. Perhaps this is generally holiness and sermon, but the message he is trying to bring out is good in nature. The music point was also not bad. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this movie is pretty bad. I couldn't look at it all the way, or I would be forced to eat my feet in boredom. In this case, this "torque" is not bad, but it is still not highly appreciated in my eyes, so I have given it 2/10. <br /> <br /> Hope this helps.
