After watching this movie on the SciF channel, I can only conclude that this film has been made by a number of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives. The film is a series of endless events or "joy", as a friend tells me who reads my shoulder. The plot is not really worth commenting on, but basically running football players to Yeti territory. Before the end of the film, we are treated with a heart-pulling, still trying to ride before the 50-meter jump, but we hanged the man's feet and beat him together, a woman who kills a rabbit 30 meters wide and Yeti, who lives over several bullets and has a fire without obvious injuries, is a jet that hangs from the cliff, holding a man's shoe, but then jumps, and a whole bunch of additional, odd cases. Basically, if you are not on Saturday to look at the worst of the original SciF channel, don't do this movie like a plague. Or, as my friend read on my shoulder, says, "This is the best film I've ever seen." What my friend says to the right: "Only Battleground music could have made it better."
