Facts about the National Lampoon go to the movies, the madness of the national lambon film: <br /> <br /> 1. The film is poor, even according to the typical standards of the Lampoon. 2. It's not funny. 3. No one is going to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> So, after I finished, I began to think about why this country is called "National Lamp Goes to the Movies" and why it was ever created, much less actually done. It would be like the Austin Powers 'American Guy goes to the movies.' When flat. He's not American, and he's not going to the movies. No Lampoo "satire" characters are funny and no one can see movies that cause a bit of a problem. I had hoped it would be something in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 vein, but that is not the case. <br /> <br /> It was the first film of the National Lampon after Animal House, even though you couldn't say it about quality. film. Poorly developed, harsh and amateur, with any standard, causes headaches? is not a good sign for a 89-minute film that seems to double twice. <br /> <br /> I've noticed a pattern. Really bad films are usually renamed? and this small disaster falls under this category. It has two separate titles - probably to help people get too stupid to remember how bad 1982/83 is. "Hmm, crazy about the movie?" I've never heard of this movie! We rent it! And then, the realization: "Hey, wait, it's just a national lamb that goes into the movies!" appears on the TV a few times in a decade, which is almost the only place you can find. <br /> <br /> Is it divided into three tracks? parody of self-expansion videos, or, and company merciless, and police brutality / policeman-movies (I think). The first segment marks Peter Riegert (the animal house) as a disappointed man who divides his wife and does other things. I'm not sure that because it was so boring, my mind started to drift. Until the appearance of the sex scene, Part II is an exotic dancer who is raped with victory (not asking) who decides to become the Queen of Margarine so she can be beaten. Milk products. Ouch! It contains the only funny line of the movie: "Only I can love my son!". If you think it doesn't sound very funny, are you right? this is not. And imagine? this is the highlight of this movie! <br /> <br /> Part III is related to a police officer who is driving a serial number (Christopher Lloyd) only to lose his nerve and shoot a boy. It contains one funny scene, but has it worked really well? only Lloyd really exhibits some humor by playing his character dry and compassionate but still strange. The part where he suffocates his victim and husband's police officers is looking at it all opening up at least two or two. <br /> <br /> It is a shame to look at the wrong low standards of semi-famous names. Writers in each segment clearly believe that they are very ironic and clever about the violation of so-called stereotypes? the mistake is that the film becomes one big contradiction, preferring a plot of land instead of a standard R&D; sharp humor instead of a moody dialogue; desperate, not inspired. It is easy to see that none of the actors enchanted the material, mutating their lines, often so embarrassing that they could rarely come into contact with the camera. <br /> <br /> The film is not funny as I said before. I laughed once, only in one row, and even then it was half-hearted. Two smiles, a smile and a very weak laugh. Compared to Movie Madness, a number of other decent comedies seem to be like ordinary smileys. <br /> <br /> I like the National Lampoon holiday series (or at least three of the four parts) and their classic Animal House, but their recent direct hit by direct-video bombs like Golf Punks (with this great comic genome Tom Arnold) is a good example why their magazine was printed more than ten years ago. It gets really old, really fast. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, seeing a new movie called Gold Diggers is released with their "approval mark". It's like condemning a movie before it even hits the theater? maybe they should start advertising their name all over the place ?? <br /> <br /> Distributor: 'This movie is bad. It gets the approval of the national lambon. It teaches you not to do anything so terrible. '<br /> <br /> Forget the death penalty. Simply paste a bunch of criminals into the room and make them every day more and more each day. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I can't even start my dirty affliction. I'll give up.
