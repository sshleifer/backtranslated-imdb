The weak Bobby "Pineapple salsa" Flay and Mario Batali bring it down. <br /> <br /> Fear is the worst. Certainly there is one trick in the pony, I think they could have received other American chefs to come to the table like Iron Chefs. The dishes that this duo really offers do not reflect the creativity of the original Iron Chef Series. I don't think Batali didn't even go to school. There are many great chefs in America, I just don't know why they are not in the food network. <br /> <br /> It would also help more regional ingredients and perhaps also compatriots who can handle the pressure. I like Alton Brown, but he's a little too funny / funny for this role.
