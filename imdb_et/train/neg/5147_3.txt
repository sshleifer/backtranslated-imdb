"Blue Desert" could have been a semi-credible and enjoyable thriller with the main character, Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox) was not so stupid. When he is the victim of a new attack on the streets of New York, the comic artist Roberts moves from the West to a small town. In his early days, he will meet suspiciously crazy Randall Atkins (Craig Sheffer, who is playing this part well) who will eventually not leave him. Frightened by his security, when he had been twice before, his friendship and relationship with a suspiciously friendly city policeman, Steve Smith (DB Sweeny, who doesn't seem convincing, unbelieving, who would otherwise be convinced that writers are red are not convincing enough) herring). Smith needs Roberts collaboration because, as he says, Atkins is a former and guilty of sexual assault. But the police have not proved enough to take him away. <br /> <br /> The movie had enough plums to make at least an interesting movie, because soon there will be a mess that Roberts should trust. But it seems that much of the planned arrest is too forced, because the character of Roberts never seems to respond to simple things, as we think a reasonable person might be. And his late responses allow for a large amount of such a difference easily and convincingly, especially in the finals. Perhaps Sweeny was the wrong choice for this role; too baby's face, how to recall Kevin Anderson's personality, manifested by his character "sleeping with the enemy". Or, if Lisa Roberts is written with a stronger character, it may be enough. In the meantime, this movie is not as big, even as a low-budget B-thriller.
