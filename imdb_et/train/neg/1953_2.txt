The first episode of this new exhibition was today and it was terrible. Shaggy had not only a little new voice that listened to his lines of torture, but it is so far from the original concept and animation that it is hardly recognizable as the Scooby-Doo show. <br /> <br /> Even on the dark days when Fred and Velma were gone and Scooby's nephew Scrappy was there, the team solved the secrets. With this new show, Shaggy and Scooby are living in the building, fighting James Bond's super-villain and his henchmen. Not even a van called "The Mystery Machine" (and the next episode that allowed a transformer-type robot, teaser) NOT my mindset. How can anyone take Scooby Doot and do it? <br /> <br /> The exhibition serves two points for two scenes containing the entire Scooby Doo gang, all speaking the right voice, except Shaggy, and even then I'm too generous.
