This movie is another good example of what Jerry Bruckheimer, from around 1997, seems to be the best - a year before the release of the film and not a high quality movie. I'm not a film critic, but this movie was as predictable as they come. Every event, joke, moment of every experiment, and pathetic attempt at the love story was exactly what I predicted. Make yourself a favor and save your money for it.
