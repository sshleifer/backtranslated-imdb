The good lord who made this turkey must be buried alive. Sorry, but another reviewer must not see this movie, he must look at something else or never see a movie before ... 9 out of 10 stars? He says what is as good as Ben Hur or Wind is gone? Inadvertently funny, tremendously incredible characters, absurd situations, looks like it was in Griffith Park (which works pretty well - MASH was shot in Griffith Park), a crappy script, almost everything that might be in the wrong movie with one package. All future filmmakers should be required to see how the film can be terribly wrong. It reminds me of what a USC student can do for a film class. <br /> <br /> Give this one pass if you are not taking drugs and you are in a high camp.
