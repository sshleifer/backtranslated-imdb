It was a disappointing horror film about the young man and his nightmares. For a horror or "thriller" movie and hype, it's too tame. Here are just a few tense moments, not as close as if they had been a genre of this genre. Even these "tense" scenes were not much. Music made them more dramatic than they were. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of symbols here, so elite critics mark this horror film of the "thinking person". Well, if they think about it, I'm sure they will come to the same conclusion I made - a waste of money in a video rental shop. and generally do not work well. Greatly overrated and certainly not what it is advertised.
