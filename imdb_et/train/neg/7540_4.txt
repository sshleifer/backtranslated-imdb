Wicker Man, who plays Nicolas Cage, is not a good movie, but I can't really say I have to look at it with regret. I could go on about the negative aspects of the film, such as terrible acts and long scenes where Cage is looking for a girl, hallucinations, followed by second hallucination followed by a sequence of dreams - hallucinations, etc. , but it's not just worth it to come up with such a movie. Instead, there are five reasons why you should look at Wicker Man, although it is bad: <br /> <br /> 5. It is hard to deny that he has really horrible ideas for this, the only problem is his cheese-free, inadvertently funny implementation. If this is nothing else, it is a movie that can inspire you to see the original 1973 movie or even read the story on which it is based. <br /> <br /> 4. For a strong horror / thriller, it's really aesthetic. It is obvious that it was filmed locally, not using a green screen or using complex kits, so we see great landscapes. There are also many nicely drawn frames. This is a very good looking movie. <br /> <br /> 3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as he is a natural force. Whether you are a fan of your own or not, it seems as though Cage would play a "normal man". There is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness he plays with his characters and personally I am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does. Whether Nicolas Cage is big or terrible, he always brings his own unique energy to play and he's never looking bored. He's a terrible Wicker Man, but in the most wonderful way. <br /> <br /> 2. The student could probably write hell about this movie because it seems to be the strongest antifeminist film ever made. "Look?" you could write, "this happens when women are allowed to lead society!" Similarly, the similarity of this "Summersisle" society and the colony of bee is quite interesting and worth noting. <br /> <br /> 1. If you read this, it is probably a good way to see a YouTube video that has become very popular: a "highlight" movie, including a Cage who runs a bear suit and of course the infamous "AAGHH" !! BEES !! MY EYES !!! " line. These scenes are fun from the context, and they're still pretty funny in the overall viewing of the movie. <br /> <br /> I bought a used DVD blockbuster for about $ 5 ... it's about a dollar per dollar. That's a pretty good thing. <br /> <br /> NOTE. The Unrated version is the best thing to look at, and it's better to watch the theatrical version of the little epilogue that contains James's camouflage. Franco.
