Some kids hike in the mountains and one of them goes into the big tunnel and finds some old mummified gladiators. He puts the gladiator helmet on and spends the rest of the movie that kills all other hikers. <br /> <br /> This thing is just so pointless that it is crazy. Here is a short list of things that make no sense: <br /> <br /> 1) The boy and the girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside. The man is going to explore and find another tourist. Then he hears the shouting of his girlfriend to go back to the tent arriving next morning? He was just 50 meters away! <br /> <br /> 2) The two duffheads then hear another girl yelling (which, 100 meters away?), but don't look at them because they fear they will disappear. 3) Another boy and girl are around and in about a tenth scene, the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances the protocol no longer requires him as a professor. I mean, what ...? First, it's just a really stupid thing to say, secondly, he never summoned his professor in the first nine scenes. <br /> <br /> 4) The wounded girl attacks Demonic and stops her, telling her this part of her gladiator training taught her how to kill her. Yes, yes, we noticed that he was wounded and not dead because he was walking. But thanks to this information release. <br /> <br /> 5) One girl is connected to the Demonicus nest and if someone tries to release her, she will instruct that person to seek help. Look, idiot, if he puts you free, which takes about 5 seconds, you don't need help. <br /> <br /> And it goes on and on. The whole middle of the movie takes two idiots that disappear in the forest, then fight, then pitch the tent and ignore the screams of their friends, then they migrate even more. It's just so damn boring and pointless that I turned the DVD off halfway. <br /> <br /> None of these characters are sympathetic, especially those that get most of the time on the screen. Demonicus himself made me laugh every time I saw him - he looks like a boy in a Halloween costume hugging his face to look evil. She's running, or should I say hell is like gay. Special effects are comedic, actors are mostly awful and nothing makes sense. it is released from a ridiculous dialogue, creating characters with real pleasures that have some logical flow to the action and maybe even make Demonic a female character in a sexy gladiator dress. But no, instead, we get this nonsense crap that suffers you from death.
