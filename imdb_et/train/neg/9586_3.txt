After the catastrophic revolution, this film was a pretty final pound in the Goldcrest Church, and thus in the British Film Industry. The film is absolute pants, it is full of music from the mid-1980s on the revival of jazz and is based on a book and an author who was short of popularity at that time and has died down. The temple was looking for ages trying to find Suzette and came out with the 8th Wonder Patsy Kensett, who was at the same time briefly popular. By the time the film came after the production process, the Jazz Revival was over, as did Kenset's career and the film met a completely non-public film. <br /> <br /> A mediocre would be some superfluous / cheeses acting for some of the worst / campestides ever to grace the British silver screen for almost 20 years and the film is really cringeworthy.
