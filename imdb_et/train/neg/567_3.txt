This movie is one of the most amazing films ever made. How can Jon Bon Jovi play in the movie? He's a singer, not an actor, what? Did he kill the vampires with his guitar? And what is a terrible plot? Oh my God, this movie really sucks. Ultimately, the vampire queen, played by the eternal vampire Arly Jover (Blade), is surrounded by the vampire army, but when the "fantastic" killers arrive, there will be only 4 vampires! What happened to the other 10-15 vampires? They run out of the sun ??? And how does "Grand Finally" when Bon Jovi blows with a head shot? It's really "NO". "Buffy Vampire Slayer" in 100 episodes will not be killed with one vampire A SHOTGUN ??? It's really a lack of originality!
