I love low budget independent movies and I have great hopes for it. But this movie is static. Do not forget the value of the output, which is very noble for your budget, but it is lethal. Indeed, these people achieve little, but the film does not work at the most fundamental level. It's boring. Editing is a glacier and a stop. It should have been 65 minutes. The best Dr Jekyll is Mr Hyde, who is hardly visible. He had the most dramatic potential. Instead, we have to endure the Baltimore-Brits through endless and tiring exposure. It seems like an underwater stage game dedicated to video. <br /> <br /> All manufacturers' dedicated efforts, but this tired story needed pants and funky new low-budget technology should have given it a fresh voice. Instead, it's just flat restored.
