was this tim meadows the first acting role in the movie? Character, leon, is funny enough, but soon after, sexual jokes and humor are mostly stupid. some movies may get sexually annoyed and your audience will realize that advertising is coming soon. some movies that do this are an American pie and a scary movie. The scary movie was stupid and the American pie wouldn't have done without sexual jokes. the only role, besides the leon that followed humor, was ferrell. The character was really stupid and it was all, stupid humor was all I had. the movie was ok, and nothing else. I really do not understand why people who die to leave will always get a movie based on the display. skits last about 5 minutes and if they can bring out the movie with a 5-minute sketch, what is the world coming up? Molly Shannon was a superstar, Cheri O'terri was a scary film, but he was not a leader and had an elf. but it was good, but he did some stupid movies, but I don't remember, and mike muersid with the Wayne world. How Crazy TV Team Will Never Get Movie Offers? saw only one man but only 2 movies and andy dick on TV. but this man relies on comedy to continue his life, funny or not. this movie is not good, but it had some positive humor. what is the waste of movies and people money.
