It's not very good about Tarzan's epic. There was only one reason for this movie. John Derek wanted his beautiful wife buff! Bo Derek in the 10's was at least a humorous film and there was a reason for nudity and sex. This movie is nothing but soft porn. Once you get in there, then fast forward and skip! This movie (like Bolero) was again Bo Derek's vehicle to show off his terrible action. She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but her poster is more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better player; it was one of his few mistakes! don't waste your time with this movie ... go to this book.
