I wish I could give this film to zero or even lower, because unfortunately it is what it deserves. I'll never step out of the movie, but it was so terrible that I couldn't stand it for the second minute. Please, please, skip this film for the sake of humanity. If you want a hot lesbian movie that can really get deeper then this is not the case. <br /> <br /> It is an unpleasant, unpleasant management, a dirty structure, a ridiculous dialogue and it is absolutely incredible in every conceivable sense. At absolute level, it is not entertaining with entertainment. Everything about "Mango Kiss" is so stagey, it's WORSE than anything I've seen. <br /> <br /> As it would not be enough, the entire film relies on a continuous (and I mean CONSTANT) voice over narration. A script writer may also have written a novel because they demanded everything from TELLING instead of showing it. We should just assume that Lou and Sassafras are the best friends and have a special connection, although it is not possible to illustrate. It is also introduced to the new characters after the first five minutes, not in the natural way, but in the freezing of characters, the name of which is written on the screen. No introduction, no characters are developed. We don't really know them. <br /> <br /> This is the most amateur movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I am a gay woman who watched this movie from my roommate (another gay woman) and we both found this film to be a depressing film of a depressing cinema. I think lesbian and gay movies are like a Christian stone - it doesn't matter how frightening it is, people are still flocking and fighting for it, no matter how bad the quality is. Please do not rent it !! Instead, we encourage you to produce QUALITY-gay and lesbian movies by hiring "But I'm Cheerleader" or "Fire" or "Heavenly Beings" instead of swallowing any meaningless hell they want for the gay community (eg Queer as Folk ).
