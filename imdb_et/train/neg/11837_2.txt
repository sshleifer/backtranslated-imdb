Can anyone make good CGI movies in addition to Pixar? I really mean that animation seemed to be outdated by the 2006 standards and even with the 1995 Toy Story standards. Or maybe they spent their entire budget on Hugh Jackman. Regardless of their thoughts, the story is really wonderful. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is somehow a rat - a rat that is flushed under the toilet. Yes, I know, it seems stereotypical. But then the sewer imitated the ways of London - to some extent. Throw a promise to the jewels (????) and the evil (??) frog and you will get a pathetic attempt to entertain. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that I liked something. Maybe joining the movie? Or maybe the ratio of successful rats. But nothing was done. He had a talent, but it blew up. D-
