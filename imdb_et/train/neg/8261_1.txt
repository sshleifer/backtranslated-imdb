I was looking forward to watching this movie and then realized that any hope of a consistent dialogue between the participants was overtaken by unnecessary swearing. Now, I'm not in any way a bride, but screaming at each other is not a good movie. Ewan Bremner is undoubtedly one of the worst players in the world (witnessing his appearance in godly life) and his "Cockney" accent is almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent. Avoid. How much more of these "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", "Beautiful Creatures" have to suffer before filmmakers realize that f-word, word, etc. does not replace the right dialogue.
