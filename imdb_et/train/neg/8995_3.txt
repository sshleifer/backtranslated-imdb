I missed the beginning, but I saw it mostly. A friend got it on a DVD in a FYE cheap room. <br /> <br /> Skits are all very short, but most of them are still too long. Most of them seem to have forgotten something funny! Quite a lot of racist / sexist / "homophobic" humor, stereotypical sketch or sketch that use racist concepts for people. <br /> <br /> I try to remember what was thought to be funny and I have problems ... The logo of the tunnel's vision network is a lipstick with an eyeball inside. The mouth opens and closes like eyelids. Dreadful. <br /> <br /> With disappointment. Most of the participants went to better things and it is fortunate that this bomb didn't hold them back.
