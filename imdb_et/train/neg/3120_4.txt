I didn't expect much from "Night Listener" and I never heard of it until I saw the camera on the camcorder. But the film is very effective when it comes to stopping and creating tensions. Sometimes it drags a little, but in fact it helps you think about what happens and more importantly: when. As the film progresses, Robin Williams' game he plays into some kind of "cat and mouse" spiel to the point where he becomes obsessed with finding the truth and existence of a 14-year-old abused child no one has ever seen personally. A night listener is an interesting story that is great when tension is created throughout the film, and you're pretty much in the dark who's lying and what's real. Ultimately, however, it is such and it does not live the potential it could have. It does not give you a really detailed or credible explanation of another main character that would have been useful and interesting.
