Just too many holes in this movie to be enjoyable and ALL the bizarre almost Hollywood-like ending that's completely out of context with the rest of the movie (it's not a spoiler because you never think it ends!). <br /> <br /> You must also be thick skinned to any politically correct subtons. White and black conflicts were extremely weak and one-sided. I did not understand why the author had had the local black community behaved in such an unacceptable manner, whether he was trying to be racist? <br /> <br /> Really bizarre movie. Just observe if you want the holes in the plot to be really angry and want to discuss all the things that might or should not have happened. <br /> <br /> But the positive side is filming and showing. great.
