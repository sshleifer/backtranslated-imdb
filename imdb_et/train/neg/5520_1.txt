This movie was portrayed as a comedy in a trailer. This is an extreme tragedy. It stayed on my stomach. I hated it. I think if they want to make such a movie, they should be enough men to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer. I wouldn't have seen this movie if I knew it. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intent of the film. I'm tired of it. I really wanted a fun comedy and I'm very disappointed. There have been several days now and I still have a bad taste of this movie. I've never been disappointed in the movie and never wrote a comment about a bad movie. I really think that this trailer was involved in real fraud, because if they show the true intention of the movie, no one would have seen it.
