I've been ready to catch a lot of fluffy movies in late spring / summer, but in general it has been due to the fact that most of them have reasonable profitability (ie cool special effects, interesting land turn, comic value, Steve Buscem, etc.). But there was nothing in this film. All we had was the excitement of several minutes of Eva Longoria's splitting (Maximi's question is cheaper than a movie ticket). There is an unpleasant shortage of plot, passageway, back story, character formation, continuity, etc. I'd get into a specific, but frankly, I've forgotten most of the movie. > All the time I was in the theater, I was beaten to not only spend 24 seasons watching a DVD on the afternoon. Save your money on it, people. If you really do, really, like Eva Longoria splits.
