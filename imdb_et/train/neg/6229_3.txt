First of all, here's a few things: a) I AM an anime fan - I've always been real (I always looked at Speed ​​Racer in a preschool school). b) I like several B movies because they are fun. c) I like many Godzilla movies. <br /> <br /> Moving too far when the movie first comes out, it looks like it's your usual B movie until Crappy FX, but all of a sudden - BOOM! anime comes! This is when the movie goes down WWWAAAAAYYYYY. <br /> <br /> Animation is very bad and cheap, even worse than what I remember from the SPEED RACER, crissakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie "Vividly" I remember when a school has a whole lot of kids ... & it's the same kids over and over again! FX is also terrible; dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, the transition to a living animation is unorganized, the dialogue and the voices (especially the English language I looked at) were terrible and I asked my father to take out a DVD / VHS player; The only thing that survived me was breaking up jokes and comments like robots and Joel / Mike in MST3K (you choose the season). Frankly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie and survive at the same time. <br /> <br /> Heck, I plan to show it to another companion for a otaku son for Halloween. Since it is stupid, quite painful to look at and unwittingly at the same time, I give this movie 3/10, which is an improvement over 0.5 / 10, which I originally intended to give. <br /> <br /> (According to my rating scale: 3/10 means pretty much so boring and bad. As fun as reading three, if you can't find the opportunity to entertain it, it becomes as fun as 15.)
