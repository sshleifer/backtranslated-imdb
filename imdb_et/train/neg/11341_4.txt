In a sense, this is a disaster that Fellini has been working on throughout his life. The line between the absolute masterpiece and the ox of the NGO is very small, and which category of film ultimately fits, often depends on personal feelings. That means "Casanova" left my set as a cold admiration and a little more that Bukowski can no longer put together: <br /> <br /> "Casanova also died, but an old man with a big cock and a long tongue and not at all to say that he lived well, saying that I could get into my grave without feeling, it is also true that the ladies usually go to the biggest fool they find, which is why the human race stands where it is today: we have developed smart and enduring in Casanova, all the hollow inside, like the Easter bunnies we support our poor children. "<br /> <br /> As far as I can do, this is Fellin's position toward him; more, empathy, but reluctantly. <br /> <br /> Casanova's environment has been caused by decay and incest, and Fellini dealt specifically with Satyricon. The plot sequence is characteristic of soft porn, just without unity; and Donald Sutherland is distracting and dirty. <br /> <br /> However, there is only the idea that Casanova can be depicted as an unpleasant fool. And I invite someone to formulate this point without it being obvious; Fellini couldn't. More than ever he seems to be here like a black man - maestro, certainly, but one whose impulse is more than anyone else. I find it hard to imagine an audience who enjoys this movie. It was a story that's not worth saying.
