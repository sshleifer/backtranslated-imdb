For every television series, 100 ideas are created, 50 scripts are written, 15 pilots are made, and one, just one, makes it. As a result of this selection process, we believe that the final product must be a crop cream, for what other reason so many ideas can be rejected to give us one television series. <br /> <br /> And it goes with True Blood; all the stars were aligned and what started as a series of novels became an idea, a screen game, a pilot and finally a series. Unfortunately, it can sometimes be a long journey and there are many turns along the way that will eventually change what was good and clean and show that manufacturers feel they are the best. Oh, how wrong they are so often ... <br /> <br /> True Blood is an example of a creative concept that has become one of the poorest stories, worst acts, and dirty sub-blocks in the history of television. The international light of this relatively unknown actor struggles to find his own voices, but he continues his counterfeit southern accents. Alan Ball is not such a secret desire that Ryan (Jason Stackhouse) gives us fresh nude every week, although often nothing is involved. Tara's angry black character is unable to unite and you find yourself secretly hoping that the vamps will quickly take her out before she goes to another speech about white suppression, while taking part in the Confederacy's brilliant death ceremony. Sam thinks Sookie is in love, and suddenly we have to believe he has to look at him in the morning, noon and night, despite years of work and avoiding such relationships. <br /> <br /> His moral high ground area is being surrendered as soon as possible to love Sookie, and he has no problem to make him a quick snack (although he remains somewhat harmless). We find that other vampires are not as mainstream as Bill, but want the public to accept them when they look at life like Happy Meals on their feet. <br /> <br /> Despite all the first months of the episode! I have come to understand that, no matter how long you look at a bad example, it is still bad. Something dies for a reason, even vampires. Maybe it should show.
