I got a library DVD, provided I get a good idea of ​​how things are doing in the background of big opera production. I have to say I was very disappointed. There were so many options on the subject. Wagner's production kits must necessarily be detailed and impressive, and their story of creation and use could have been a great educational experience. Instead of getting people moving around the big landscapes, the help is vaguely helpful with a comment that couldn't keep my attention. I found myself mainly in the background clips of opera music. I had the impression that the enormous amount of effort required to make the production, which happened quite well and the next time on opera, I am sure I remember that part of this video - but was somewhat deceived by the lack of detailed comments and explanations.
