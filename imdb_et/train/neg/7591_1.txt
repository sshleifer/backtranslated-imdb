This film is based on John Fante's novel. Could anyone tell me why? I see no reason to adjust this fine book in this way. If you want to make romantic melodramatic production of Hollywood with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek, how can you connect with Ask The Dust (novel)? -And if you want to make this story a movie, why do you want to make it a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farelli and Selma Hayek? I can't get it. <br /> <br /> Customizing the story is bad and when you read and liked the book, I'm almost sure you don't like what Towne did. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, you may find somewhat superficial pouring odd, functional bad and cinematography. But you hope for the best. I was hoping a lot during this movie. I wanted it to be good. But it only gets worse and it's so simple: whether you read Fantes novel or not, it's not a good movie. Just another romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with bad behavior, lack of structure, and, of course, a lot of Colin Farells bare back. <br /> <br /> I can make a lot more complaints about this movie, but why do I waste my time. I've seen it. All right. I had to see it because I liked this book so much and was curious. And I'm very disappointed. So cute ... Would he have done it all the time, I gave him 2/10.
