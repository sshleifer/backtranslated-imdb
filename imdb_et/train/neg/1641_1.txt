This movie is not funny. It's not fun. It does not contain any originality or intelligence, nor does it lead you to characters or situations. It added that it was about the same as the last memory. It would be like the children of a 14- or 15-year-old high school who had never actually met or had any relationship with a real girl, sat down and wrote a film based on their false fantasies about the adult man. . This movie is boring, uncomfortable and sometimes offensive and disgusting. This is the one or two moments that make you laugh. It also looks twice as long as its 85-minute working time.
