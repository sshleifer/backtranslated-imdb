As a young pastor, I heard good things about this movie. Then I looked at it. Operation was not the best. It's forgiving. This is a message that is not: Give your life to Jesus and everything changes - you can cope better, make amazing catches, stop beating, start landing and even attack. Everything because Jesus makes magical undersized weaklings for all American athletes. I laughed loudly when the coach quoted the scriptures to explain to the kicker why he was missing the field goals. But wait, that's not all. You'll get a brand new truck, $ 6000, and you and your wife's fight for infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy - twice. Then you win the national championship, because God will help the weakened victory to reach the goal of 12 meters if he has ever been beaten - and the wind, not just - all because "God wanted him to do it." Then you will win the national championship next year. None of these good things would have happened if the team had not decided to follow Jesus, all their hearts. <br /> <br /> Here's what I took from the movie: God can do what he wants to do when he wants to do it - and that's all that makes our life better, easier and more enjoyable. He chooses his favorite team and helps them win the games. Which Bible is this story based on? I bet Saint Stephen wanted him to know the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death. Someone should have done this before ten of the 11 apostles were killed for following Jesus. It would have saved them all a lot of trouble.
