I don't want to go here, but ..... it's the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse than Avengers. Lack of leadership, divorce writing and terrible action are the only consistent elements throughout. Looking at a very cheap video, it looks like a high school project, but without emotion. Lighting often looks like a Sun-Gun. The sound is somewhat better than one camera camera, but everything else about this thing is just terrible. The plot leaders are strange instructions without basics or later resolution, the techie elements are obviously absurd and the editing seems worse than the rough section. It's not that funny. It's just bad. BTW, the package is deliberately misleading. <br /> <br /> The Lion Gate owes me $ 4.00.
