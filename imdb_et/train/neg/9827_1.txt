First of all, this film reminded me of old films, which I used to be in a class of religion at school. It's not a good thing. Basically it's just a preaching and pretentious dirty piece, as well as a terrible "left" series. I'm not offended by religious movies ... but I'm offended when these religious movies just happen to be terrible. I would just like to say a nice thing about a Christian movie, but it doesn't seem to happen any time soon. I bet, if you gave the proper budget for the Bible writers, they can't do anything good. Just avoid it. The fact that the American Family Association (mainly the lack of Reverend Wildmon) can withstand this film on its website is another reason for hating me. In fact, after that I went to see that I went home and looked at the copy of David Cronenberg's NC-17 "Crash". Forgive me the father that I have sinned. Hahahahaha!
