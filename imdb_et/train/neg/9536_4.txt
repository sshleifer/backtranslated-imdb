Best of Best 4 is better than 3, but hardly. Basically I say this because part 4 is not in conflict with parts 1/2 (like 3) (ie they don't refer to Tommy Lee who has siblings). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked the Russian plot story, and especially Sven Ole-Thorsen's little bit like Boris. In addition to this and some fighting scenes, the film is not special. A limited budget is also very noticeable (especially on the airplane blowing ground). <br /> <br /> Part 4 is also not really moral and says nothing like Part 3, there are a few more well-known actors (Hudson, Thorsen) in Part 4, but unfortunately there is nothing like the series start (and even these characters are very small). <br /> <br /> Best of all, the best Rhee shows and it is true that she can't wear a movie. <br /> <br /> Saw surface, Rating: 4
