I like musicals, but as a fan of Dickens I hate it. ** MILD SPOILERS ** Hungry boys who have enough time to sing and dance in the workroom? London's poor come to sing? Fagin and Dodger Walking at Sunset? Not exactly true to the novel. I remember Dodger was openly hung and Fagin crazy in prison. ** END OF SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes doing a little more than anxious to show his evil. But the worst thing is Mark Lester Oliver, who often comes as uncomfortable and passive, do you know if he is really the main character. His portrayal does not help in any way to say that the best they can do when they sing are the girl's voice. I think they didn't realize that the boy's triad can be found in almost all churches in England. <br /> <br /> Self-respecting Dickens fans: stay with David Lea's amazing 1948 movie or BBC 6-hour adaptation in the mid-80s. Avoid this music poisoning.
