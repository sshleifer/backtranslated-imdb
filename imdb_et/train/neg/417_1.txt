I go to the cinema every week or so, and check this site regularly, but never before have I felt the need to comment on the movie. <br /> <br /> The last man in my all-time shockingly bad movie list Permanent, Chewing, Bone Collector - I can now add a hollow red "hollow man". <br /> <br /> Spooky openings - ridiculously overflowing cast and team with alphabet spaghetti - up to the offensive finals - world record clichés and some of the most absurd dialogues and action to ever put it into the movie - this movie is frustrating and only impressive computer graphics keeps you long lasting before it is not just my opinion - it was around my friends and all of us. When big parts of the audience are laughing and rushing during and after a serious thriller, it is clear that the film is hopeless. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but also sick. Instead, the director stepped into a violent film within the realistic ticket price and in the areas of the upper-blooded B-film. It's hard not to imagine a director as a dirty old man because the invisible man's way out of the lab and the outside world only extends to two attempts to get some breasts. Maybe, when you become invisible, sex can be the first thing that comes to mind, but besides the aesthetic pleasures of the women involved, it will not be a fun movie. <br /> <br /> [Spoilers follow] <br /> <Br /> Go on sick external movies and things are even worse. While Kevin Bacon is doing a good job because he is becoming more and more complicated than a "hollow person", the rest of them - perhaps the scripts of the disabled with a disability - even make the work better. One long time crew member is discovered by the invisible man's locked clothing, "He's finally struck down", shrugs one colleague without emotion. This is a parameter for the course and the lab team swings between exclusivity and total indifference so quickly that you don't know how they work. They make the way through the lab corridors frightened, the guns boys, but then a second later, one team jumps happily off the corridor to hurt the blood for a colleague. The leading woman treats the invisible man with good humor and good humor even after her insult and abuse, and it seems that her breaks do not respond, even after she drowns the Pentagon commander, "She drowned in her pool last night". two and two times. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> The script is is full of such badly-behaved pedestrian dialogue, and the rest are just film clichés AZ, which are thicker and thicker. faster when the film progresses to complete belief and amusement. <br /> <br /> "eureka" moment, female undressing window, looped security video - the list is actually endless - predictable failure in strength numbers, the decision not to kill the two main stars, but to put them in a likely deadly place and leave them in their devices, an almost dead good boy who has nothing to record a woman, a bomb and a widespread state timer, a fireball explosion that just burns before reaching heroes, a falling elevator that just stops before they hit, and more than anything else, a bad boy's immortality. <br /> <br /> An invisible man is burning with an explosive with an electric shock flame blower, bowed to the head with a bar straight straight through one of the smaller actresses, and then, apparently having survived the explosion, fireball and complete destruction of laboratories, there is more as a life enough to go through the fireball for one of the last pop movie heroes - at what stage is an incredible audience stretching and watching their watches. The cinema is amazing. Even the film's name is as hopeless as the film itself and not even the impressive special effects cannot get close to the recording that should be avoided at all costs.
