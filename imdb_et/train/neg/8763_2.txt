I thought I read somewhere that it was the last monogram production, but is it not true or not, because if it wasn't, it should have been. This is a deadly boring thing starring John Carradine, who has some gray hairs to appear like an older scientist experimenting with his young apprentice (Robert Shayne) to bring the dead to life. Every time their subjects are revived, they seem to have a whitish face, like marble, because they lie on the laboratory's desk (big deal). Carradine is able to restore her faithful dog to life after she is dead, and the mole reaches an unusual ability to walk through walls in a strange way (wooooooooohhhh). That's all he wrote. <br /> <br /> For the ultra-cheap monogram high-speed line, this thing actually uses more fabrication-lab settings than usual. The fun of the movie is that "older" doctor Carradine constantly refers to his "young" assistant Shayne as "m'boy", when in fact Carradine was actually 40 and Shayne was 45 when they did it!
