Otto Preminger directs this light from the feathers. Bohemian Jean Seberg and his equally bohemian widow David Niven leave with Mylène Demongeot in southern France. Things are good until a family friend Deborah Kerr appears. Nivens, a degenerate female, finds Kerri's conquest too difficult. It is well with Seberg as long as Niven loves him and leaves him (as he has done with all his past women, including Demongeo). If he seems to be becoming another banana in Niven's life, Seber's easy light revenge. Preminger tells the story of setbacks from Seberg's perspective and combines black and white and sunnier scenes. The art of Georges Périnini is stunning. The film contains some of the most difficult lines of Preminger's hands, although it rarely allows close-ups, making it difficult to find out what the actors really know. Arthur Laurents wrote the script and it is full of acidic dialogues and funny scenes (mostly birds are flamed with Demongeot). Seberg learns quite well, but Niven is his least tempting ... and he doesn't show any chemistry with Seberg or Kerr. Preminger really misleads this pain. This is a role that seems to be tailored just to make someone go to Charles Boyer. Geoffrey Horne as Seberger and Martita Hunt as her outraged mother. Juliette Gréco, who is playing herself, sings the title song at Paris nightclub. The big titles are Preminger regular Saul Bass.
