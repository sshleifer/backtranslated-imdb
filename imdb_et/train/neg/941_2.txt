This movie is just bad. It's not even worth seeing. The happy professor is just annoying. Even if you stop the disbelief to allow invisibility (which I am happy to do in the interests of bad movies) and promise the most foolish victims in the horror film, this film will ask even more. If you are looking for shower rooms and casual sexual meetings for women in the dressing room, get porn when you are looking for a good bad movie, get something else. If you just want to waste time on an annoying bad movie, rent it.
