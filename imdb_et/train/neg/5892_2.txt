It is clear that Hideo Nakata's Ringu (Ring, 1998) and Hongurai Mizu no Soko Kara (Dark Water, 2002) refers to the Ju-Oni tip (The Grudge, 2000), but the gore (green body with red eyes! and a weak subject (i find it very difficult to find a picture message scary). There were two moments in this movie that made me tremble, both unexpected and after Oodishon (another Miike Takashi, since 1999), I had a feeling of vision and all the movies stealing from it were really scary, I didn't see this movie as a sale to the western popularity of big Japanese horror movies. Two out of ten.
