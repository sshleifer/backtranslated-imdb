I remember this movie at an exhibition in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970. Although it may seem unbelievable and I cannot provide any explanation on this, the film was exhibited in a theater dedicated to artistic life and high quality films (Bergman, Resnais, Malle, Bu√±uel and ... Predicted Man). Few people saw it (luckily people, no doubt) and no reference to this very boring SF movie is found in Peter Nichols Science Fiction Encyclopidie or the author of the original novel. Very recommended. I remember it after all those years of non-story, many special effects that seem to have a ridiculous effect and no more. Some countries seem to have a working time of 90 mm. and parents 77 min. Well, that means just a little more pain.
