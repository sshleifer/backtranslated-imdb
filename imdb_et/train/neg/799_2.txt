In some ways, the concept behind the focus was an interesting combination of several typical movie types. But in this movie, no point was so obvious that it didn't deserve constant close-ups. I felt like I would have beaten over the so-called mysterious explanation for killing the disease. <br /> <br /> The writer seems to have simply raised clich√©s from other films that are a substitute for writing lines. in actual letters. Participants didn't help questions. No chemistry. I think they had to develop some kind of attractiveness than just because it is an important part of these stories. But the writers did not work very hard to develop chemistry. Of course, they are both attractive, but whether they are attractive to each other, it seemed an open question. <br /> <br /> Trust in the Turner character shows Sabatos too fast and for some specific reason. The Sabato character should be a discredited doctor who just can't play with the rules. Think of Jeff Goldblum's character on "Independence Day". Typically, such a character should show some talent or shine. The nature of Sabato is not. He's just Cassandra with mad and all eight ball prophetic skills. He seems to be randomly random at random. Every actor was really trying a little harder to show them the embarrassment they caused. The symptoms looked like a bad claymation, like such a video in the 80s, Peter Gabriel, I think.
