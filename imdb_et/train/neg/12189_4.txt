I'm surprised that this movie is so highly appreciated, though if I had to go to a typical grade 71, it's c or d, so maybe that's okay, but this movie was just a typical thriller, except for the boring slow and unreal. Not that the typical thriller is realistic, but it seemed to be trying, and the one who stumbled did not need the charges because he did not want the court to investigate the cross, even though he would put the man who broke his hand beating his mess and he raped him not for life, but also defended the lawyer he had with feelings and family, not just the random people he didn't even know. Other similar problems were with the film, which would have been fine if there was some moral to take away the movie, but some moral issues like whether it was right to try Kady to kill / win before he did something illegal. He presented a little to one side, as Kady was like a mad revenge that was revenge, so the lawyer was justified in defending his family because he was expecting Kady to rape his daughter so that he could do something legally would be a little absurd. So now I have shifted my life more to this live movie, so please don't see it so that at least your life is not shifted and so my 2 1/2 hours meant something.
