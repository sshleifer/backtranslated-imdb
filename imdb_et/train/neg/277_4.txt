Lillian Hellman's game, adapted by Hashman with the help of Hellman, becomes a curious project coming out terribly from Warner Bros. Paul Lukas, who repeated his Broadway role and won the Best Actress Oscar, playing the Nazi German underground leader who fights against fascists your American wife and three children across Europe before finding asylum (via the Mexican border). They are based in Washington with their husband's rich mother and brother, although the mansion living in the mansion is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends a lot of time playing poker at the German Embassy. It seems that the focus of this drama is forever and when we understand the heart of the material (wise, honest, direct refugees who teach the helpless, head-in-the-sand Americans, how the world has suddenly changed), it seems a bit patronizing - the viewer is literally a relative, a lecture. Lukas has several speeches in the third window, which certainly won him the Academy Award, but for a big picture he seems to do little but enters and leaves, enters and leaves. As her husband, Bette Davis says, like someone else, and works for the good of her wide eyes, but the role does not let her have much color. Their children (all with different accents!) Are alternately humorous and annoying, and Geraldine Fitzgerald has no role to play as a woman's upbringing (and the uncomfortable text she suggests seems totally wrong). The goal here was to show us only tastefully, tactically, that a (WWII-era) man can be a German language that does not make him a Nazi compassion. We'll get it in the first few minutes; the rest of this delicious and tactical film consists of exposure, defensive confrontation and finally compassion. It should be a tiring mixture, but it is rather a dry eye and inert. ** from ****
