"Scary Movie 2" is a scary movie franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good, but it was kind of boring and not very funny. Luckily, they chose their act after that and made two more terrifying films. <br /> <br /> This movie speaks of a group of teenagers beaten by a professor in a ghost for a night. Things go wrong and they realize they have to flee. It's a little fun, and if you liked other movies on the Scary Movie franchise, give it a clock - but I don't think you like it almost as much.
