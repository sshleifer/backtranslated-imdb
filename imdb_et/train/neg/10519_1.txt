I've seen many movies and rarely would I rate "1", but this movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> The actor was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, the effect was unrealistic and the characters were annoying. Typically, when I look at scary movies, I think it's DUMB when the characters hear the noise in the house / forest / school, etc., and then punishes "hello is anyone there?" - But at least they are plausible when they do. This movie didn't even get better. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that makes other B-horror films like Venom and you look like fog at the Academy's award winning masterpieces. <br /> <br /> When I watch movies, I am always open and I can only say that this movie was a waste of time and I am writing this comment so that someone else who thinks about watching this movie is thinking again. IT IS RELIABLE!
