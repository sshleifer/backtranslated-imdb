Shirley Jackson's novel "The Hill House Bullying" is an atmospheric terrorist who transmits supernatural phenomena in an old mansion. The atmosphere is well-developed and the chills are staged well. A haunting masterpiece. The Haunting chiller of 1963 is close to the book, but also adds details to the plot. Fortunately, they are very small and the fear of the book and chills is even better on the screen. Black and white photography adds only the courage of the film. Great! And then, Jan de Bont did it. In 1999, The Haunting hit a new release for cinemas - if you could call it a revaluation. Why they had to make a 1963 movie is in itself a mystery, but at the moment it allows you to watch the movie itself. <br /> <br /> It starts on average as most of the horror movies do. The set used for Hill House is beautiful and strange mysterious, and for a few minutes it seems that the film is actually fair. And then the first intimidation comes: the open harpsichord leader falls on the woman's face (Dr. Marrow's assistant). It's fun and the truth is, it was almost tears to me. <br /> <br /> Since then, the film has been shooting down. The film seems to change somewhat from wood, because the character of Owen Wilson is particularly irritating (so it's a relief when she stops smoking). <br /> <br /> Special effects make this movie practically This is a disgrace because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated. There are many examples of them, so I'm not worried about listing them. <br /> <br /> So, in general, I would suggest with hundreds of other people to look at the original cooler or alternative, buy the Shirley Jackson novel. But please, stay away from it. And if you decide to watch it, watch it on TV (because many channels love this movie, not the original), or rent it, but please don't buy it, whatever you do. Don't waste your money! <br /> <br /> Final rating: 4/10
