I know people and made some animations and graphic design and the show is terrible! They are rich little kids with no talent, and probably just asked Nick to accept them! Alex has been playing drums for one year, I've played 4 1/2! The movie is terrible and so show! This is the toughest, most disturbing comedy that is even funny I've ever seen. It's so stupid to make me want !!! It's just so bad that Nickelodeon accepts something like that and so stupid! They are so stupid and weird! I hate them and their show and think if Nick understands how foolish they are most likely to take it!
