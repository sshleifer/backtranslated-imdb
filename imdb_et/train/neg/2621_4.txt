I'm not a child under 8 years old to see it. If the puppies hang from the dangerous machines and listen to Cruella's terrible laugh to name a few events, there is too much tension for the little child. <br /> <br /> The lively action gives you a more heartfelt feeling than the comic book version, and there are quite a few worrying moments, including some men who seem to be transvestite, tense moments that worry and scare small children. <br /> <br /> I don't know what Disney people were thinking, but neither the story nor the actors were at their usual level. Puppies are cute But this film is at best spotty.
