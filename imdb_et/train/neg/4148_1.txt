I hurried this movie to get a bad zombie movie. But I had no idea what I started. <br /> <br /> I started to film and soon put me in a world of pain and torture. <br /> <br /> Finally, I know what the hell is. This is the movie. Forever. This film is of no value. He didn't even have a plot. There was something in every scene, but a general explanation of why something happens. <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this movie, I suggest you bring the nearest mixer with oil and try it as much as you can. You'll find that the result is much more pleasant than this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't even look at it. Not even see how bad it is. I ask you. When you look at it, it means they win.
