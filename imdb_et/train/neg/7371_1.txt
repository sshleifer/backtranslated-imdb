Steven Seagal .... how could you be part of such a terrible movie? I rented this movie because your films have usually been pretty clean. I've lost a lot of respect for being a terrible movie like this. Very very bad taste! I'm embarrassed that I even rented this movie. Steven, if you continue in such films, I believe your career is over. My husband and I have liked watching many of your movies, because you can always get a "bad guy" with a hand maneuver and make it clean ... and the language is pretty clean in your movies ... but that's something else. I think twice before I rented your second movie.
