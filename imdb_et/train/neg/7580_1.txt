It was a terrible movie. Basically, Jane March was a half-Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to make South Korean American troops terrible. She becomes a servant of the American military family, they all consider her Korean, although she sees more white (I believe the actor is either 1/4 or 1/8 in Southeast Asia, not at all in Korea) and the teenage boy household starts to hate him and sleep. with him. The depiction of Korea and the US military in Korea is totally crazy. Of course, the screenwriter and director were obviously white men who had never spent the film with Korea before and had no intention of showing any real understanding of life in Korea in the geographical geographical geography of Korea or America. their pathetic african fantasies, irrespective of how incredible this film made. Anyone who has ever been to Korea knows that this is a complete waste. Ultimately, the North Korean Hongyi spy girl is clearly killed for "paying for her sins". A very bad movie with a sense of television.
