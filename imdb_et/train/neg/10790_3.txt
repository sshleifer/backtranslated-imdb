First of all, I am not a big fan of today's Turkish cinema, which is because the pattern of creating a box in a traditional box is under the belt. This film is not an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos, as shown by the director and marketing ads. In my opinion, the sole purpose of this film is to earn money by touching sensitive morale (in fact, it is generally considered taboo in the home). Cheap populism can give a short definition of what I was thinking. But action is almost perfect. In fact, most have cast a theater background and have tried to compensate for what Altioklar missed; talent! All cast members were perfect for their role and were qualified for work, even for less experienced people. (Like Janset) Altioklar deserves little recognition because he knows well how to choose cast. In addition, he is just a media converter who expects to be a director with artistic talent. Come on, art isn't just about dealing with naked / half naked women. And just because the media is proud, no director will be a milestone in Turkish cinema history. Just close your ears and o something real art, I look forward to your next work. I hope that this time you will be able to achieve an artistic approach. <br /> <br /> In short; Pros> Good actress, hot women (just joking!) :) Cons> Every single thing except cast
