Unfortunately, this movie, 54, was a pathetic test of the true story of Studio 54. The only thing that was good in the picture was "Mike Myers", who was happy to watch. "Neve Cambpell," though her role was little, unfortunately bad. The bottom line is that this film did not have a good job from the participants except one, and that changing the true story was a desperate attempt to create a good scenario.
