The hood of the living dead and all the other films that these guys directed, they looked like they came together and filmed it with their friends, who have one talent in the afternoon when they were bored (the lines are completely unpredictable and convincing). I find that 95% of amateur films and 90% of home videos are better than this film (although the similarities between them justify a comparison). "Hey lets see if anyone is ugly enough to buy our movies!" Hopefully no one was ELSE. My excuses for flick-related people, because this review is somewhat harsh, but I was the one who read your fake comments and bought the movie.
