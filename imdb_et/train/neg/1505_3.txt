Quite normal trashy Italian-west, stupid, full of clich√©s and lack of logic, some mediocre actors, dirty settings, lots of punch-fighting and people dying massively. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with Django. - At least not in my German translation, this German DVD is called "Adios Companeros" and Macho Callaghan is fighting against Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because their gang killed one (he is the only survivor). Then you have Butch Cassidy and Ironhead are fighting against each other because they quarrel and the gang is divided. And you have an ironhead fight against everyone because he's the biggest and greedy anyway. Yeah, that's right, it's no longer wise, hehe. <br /> <br /> The small role of Klaus Kinski as the Cotton of Honor is remarkable (that's why I bought this DVD). In one scene, he tries to separate two men who struggle to beat them and shout: "I said love!" and in the second arena he won the race by throwing the horse-rack and goes to the nuts another - FANTASTICFANTASTICFANTASTIC !!! <br /> <br /> It is also noteworthy that JOE d'AMATO, the Aristide Massacces, made cinematography - I love this master's incompetent exploitation-thrash, so it was "aahhh" for me.
