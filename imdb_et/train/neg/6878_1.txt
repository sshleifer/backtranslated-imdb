I'm in Puerto Rica and it's one of the worst documentaries I've ever seen. You see people are helpless. They don't know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They claim to be in Puerto Rica because they come from descendants of Puerto Rica, but they probably know less than others who aren't there. You see when they say they are in conflict. If you want to see the real, and I mean the real real documentary from Puerto Rico, you have to see "Mi Puerto Rico". This is a serious, real documentary. Not like this spam. Rosie Perez relied on the documentary itself. I thought it should be Puerto Ricans. They repeat, I didn't know. Well, this is the only thing they got with this so-called documentary. I hate making such pieces of rubbish using the name of the island. It creates standards.
