After reading the previous comments, I'm glad I wasn't the only person who was confused, especially in the last 20 minutes. John Carradine is shown twice walking down the grave and pulling the cover after him. I look forward to any explanation for this strange behavior ... of course I assumed he had something to do with bad events in the house, but because he was killed by the first growing body ("Zombie #"). 1) these scenes make no sense. Please, if somebody knows why Carradine climbs into the graves, let us rest it! <br /> <br /> All operations are limited to the last 20 minutes, so I'm trying to make a summary. John Carradine leaves the cemetery to investigate and block Zombie # 1. So far, it's okay. But then we get a confusing scene in which John Ireland and Jerry Strickler at the cemetery discover a Carradine body for a small moonlight. Strickler repeatedly tries to push Ireland into an open grave where Zombie # 1 appeared, but in Ireland he succeeds in opening the grave and PRESTO instead! Strickler comes out like Zombie # 2! Yeah, I think we can conclude that Strickler was dead everywhere (witch?), But why when he drove to the Zombie # 1 tomb, he turned into a rotten meat version of the usual look. (Considering how these zombies have moved astonishingly slowly, I thought he would have preferred to stay in his "normal" form until his business ended. This scene also brings to mind the question - just who the hell is Zombie # 1? that Zombie # 1 is one of the original victims of the murder, who was shown at the time of the film opening credit, but who knows which one is not, and why he is especially grateful to the film crew. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Ireland sees this transformation after that and run away, we see the Zombie # 2 TIMES STOPS, which smashes through the trees, as we saw for Zombie # 1. (This causes momentary confusion about how many zombies there are.) comfortably headed to the dead cat of Faith Domergue (not so nice for John Carradine that he had a familiar cat that he barely knew?) <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Zombie # 1 has destroyed the house. Three movies crew member then starts the stairs. Faith Domergue listens to her and thinks it's a lover of John Ireland at night. When she sees it as a Zombie # 1, she lets her scream out and retreat to the bedroom where she looks for the Irish Revolver. Although the constellation Carole Wells is in this place in the shower and doesn't hear shouting, her companion Charles Macauley (who in her bedroom worships and worships) does. Finally, he decides to investigate taking his sweet time (and only after some more in his hip flask). (One of the things that the observer hits in the last quarter of this movie is how to slowly solve the stars screaming and striking). Domergue comes back in the corridor armed and ready, but the mistake for Macauley Zombie # 1 and lets her six times! He makes a beautiful acrobatic flap, then the terrifying Domergue pulls up the Zombie # 1 in the dorm. <br /> <br /> Carole Wells is now out of the shower and dries when she hears shocks and Domergue screams; he also does not know the speed of exploring. So at this time, Zombie's # 1 time is to build up a rope with a rope. Wells sees Domergue's hanging body and faints dead. The next time we see him, there is a stream outside the house (???) - but more about it later. Meanwhile, Ireland has restored its senses and invaded its home, where it finds Zombie's # 1 bloody killing. Although Ireland has just hit 3 murdered people, she is more concerned that her film has been exposed and destroyed! He (and the audience) graciously, on the 2nd floor of Zombie # 1 throws some film on his head. This is the last thing we see in Zombie # 1. Then the audience is treated with the assembly of all the deaths, which indicates that the new "reflect" is old. Zombie # 2 is in the meantime near the house (keep in mind that these zombies are moving so slowly with molasses in January), where he finds that Carole Wells is floating and fishing out. How did he get there? Did Zombie # 1 carry her down, throw her in, then zoom up to crush John Ireland? Apparently, one of the original victims was drowned in the bath, so Wells has to overflow (but why the flow, never in the bath, has ever been explained). Zombie # 2 will never do it to himself (everyone is dead to this day, anyway thanks to Zombie # 1), but he will return Carol Wells to the graveyard. Like the final credit on the screen, we see Zombie # 2 with his dead love in the open grave. <br /> <br /> The observer keeps thinking: yes, is it not the Zombie # 1 tomb? Why Are Zombie # 2 Living? And what if the Zombie # 1 comes and wants to climb back - let Zombie # 2 let it go, or is there a zombie fight? Do zombies share both the grave and the newly dead Carole Wells? And now what's dead John Carradine - where is he left? After all, based on previous scenes, we know that he is clearly at home in the grave ... If this summary of the final summary has left you confused, don't worry that you are not alone.
