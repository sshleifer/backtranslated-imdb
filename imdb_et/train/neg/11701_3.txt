Just one example of why Stepehn King's books should not be made in films. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is spoiled from the book screen.) The story is a prerequisite for a greasy lawyer, always on a diet that "accidentally" kills an old woman. In court, with the help of a judge and a local police commander, he gets off though the accident was his fault, because he did not pay attention during the ride. The dead Gypsy-father's father puts those 3 whose main character Billy (lawyer) becomes thinner and thinner. Although the film was mostly kept with the book and has its own typical king, it worked stylish and forced itself. We went from one scene to another without much in between, as reading works in the game. The king made a film (like Dave Barry) in the film, which reinforces my conviction that the authors should remain exactly this: the authors. Leave actors to act. Not that anyone in this movie would be so big. I've seen the biggest characters in the movie where they were much better.
