Have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into Thai prison? If so, this is your movie. This is for the Midnight Express MTV crowd. That would be ok, but the story was badly done. Lucky landing, poor dialogue and unresolved issues are abundant. This light film did not serve the right to be as secret as it arrives. Possible spoiler and the impossibly insecure plot line - the tense time of faux, when a hotel worker discovers that girls do not have room and starts to beat them. (This moment is inevitably played with the same solemnity and degree of difficulty as the moment they were arrested at the gunpoint). Later on, the same hotel employee has somehow been found - and Bangkok is a big city, remembering that I've been there and testifying against girls as if a couple of free Mai Thai were entitled to 40 years in prison. C'mon. Instead, rent another day in paradise.
