I had great hopes for this movie because he has Charlton Heston and Jack Palance. But these hopes crash on the ground in the first 20 minutes. Palance was ridiculous. Even the beauty of Heston's actor or Annabel Schofield (or short naked scenes) cannot record this movie. Some cosmic effects were pretty good, but others were cheesy. The plot was ridiculous. Even sci-fi fans should skip it. Grade F
