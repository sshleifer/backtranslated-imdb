Over the years, I have seen a number of them directly on Segal films and everyone has the same amount of entertainment; Unfortanetley, entertainment level is low. Of course, the action sequences were fun, but it was pretty much. Seagal was really in his main movie when he made films; Siege, the Siege 2, and the Executive Decision (at least from the point of view of action), but in the last ten years such films, which Segal's star actually meets his previous qualifications. <br /> <br /> The more positive is that the film used time, such as some action sequences and the use of spirits. Just when the film seemed to just drag, the pretty cool action out of the scene. I honestly believe that more Segal movies would be better than being the only ones fans know in the movie. Supporting actors and actors is a very important thing, and if his current films were known as a supporting actor and actor, perhaps the most popular results of the film.
