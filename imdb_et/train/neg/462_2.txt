It must go like the worst movie of almost all time. Amazing, terrible script ... and these were good points! Definitely one! The jokes, if you could name them, were both predictable and pathetic. Pamela Anderson still relies on her body to reduce her plasticity! I sat ready to give him a chance, hoping it would improve, which, unfortunately, wasn't! If it were a choice between this and the book, I suggest you calm down with good reading! I like Denise Richards, so I gave this movie a go, but why did she let her film out in this movie!
