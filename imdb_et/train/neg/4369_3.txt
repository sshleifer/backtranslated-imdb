*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Juggernaut is a British-made "thriller" that appeared in the US by First National. Karloff is Dr. Sartorius, who has to leave his studies because his resources have dried up. Karloff is forced to return to France and start medical practice. His suggestion is to accompany the woman who wants to get rid of her much older wife. He knows that Karloff needs money. <br /> <br /> Karloff agrees with the proposal and will soon become a man's personal doctor. All the time she is married to a city where the local is not a good playboy. Finally, Karloff injects the old geyser into a venom and starts up. But his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before killing and finds that the will has changed. When she flows into her beans, she goes horrifying and even bites the son's hand. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Karloff's sister, Karloff, has misplaced the old man's killer. When Karloff discovers that he is not getting money, he asks his wife to poison her. The nurse doubts Karloff and finds the missing hypo. The analysis shows the poison, but not quite in time when Karloff kidnaps the sister. <br /> <br /> To make the short story short, the sister escapes, gets the police, and succeeds in rescuing the son she is going to inject. Karloff. Karloff instead injects himself and dies. <br /> <br /> This movie has some good points. Karloff is in possession and playing the type of mad doctor he did in the orders of the devil and the man who once again lived. But it is peculiar to see that he walked rigidly around and lightly around. We'll never know why he's walking this way. I suspect the director thought he made him more sin. <br /> <br /> An actor who plays a 2-year-old woman is overwhelming. He has a French accent. Even if he is moving badly, you can still hate yourself (or maybe you hate him because of his behavior). <br /> <br /> The Karloff vehicle average is slightly lower. When you buy a copy of Sinister Cinema VHS, the sound is a bit dirty.
