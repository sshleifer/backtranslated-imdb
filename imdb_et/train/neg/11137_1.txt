All the exposed women in the world could not stop me from pushing the stop button about a third of the way through this terrible garbage. Weak, equally terrible script and bad CGI FX fit; this film is an insult to werewolf genre. It should be serious, which in itself would be funny if the film even got a bad joke level. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films where people behind the camera are obviously competent, but too lazy to do even a quarter of a decent. Avoid at all costs and watch classic werewolf movies instead. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10!
