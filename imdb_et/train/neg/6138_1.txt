This film was godly, from concept to execution. Does the US have to set up a Star Wars site in this distant country? Is this their premise? The way of access, the US concludes, is to overcome an obstacle course, such as a crucifixion, where the winner can ask something about the leader. And who wins the race better, what is called "game" as a gymnast? Of course! A gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission. And do not forget that his father was operative. Our hero is happy that happy places have gymnastic equipment, such as a rock bomber horse in the middle of the square (without reason) in the middle of a mad city. Perfect. and the worst climax. After winning the victory, our hero will present the wishes of the US government. And, look, all the efforts were worth it because the US gets its "Star Wars" site! Huzzah! IT IS YOUR TRIUMPHANT FINAL? Wow. <br /> <br /> But being a bad movie can be nice to watch. The cover alone, which depicts ninju machines, was enough to let me rent this movie. hit her face after a double shirt with 2 1/2 twists in the placement position.
