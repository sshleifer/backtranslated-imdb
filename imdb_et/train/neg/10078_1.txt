Boy-girl love / sequel songs, only this time he's punk and he's a straight arrow. Movie buffs there really like this movie? Do you have fans? I have to say that the mind rolls ... "Grease 2" is a really flat company that doesn't even have the courage, the sale, or the fear to take on the memory of its predecessor in flames (such as "jaws 2" or "Exorcist II"). No, it will slow down and just play dead. It looks and feels cheap, a large number disappearing in the midst of dirty directions and unintentional handling. It was the first time a notable audience had a look at Michelle Pfeiffer, and although she did not bother her, it was worthy to forget. Malfunction at the lowest level. NO STARS from ****
