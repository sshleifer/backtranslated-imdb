A set of deleted scenes and alternative collections that are edited together and accompanied by a voice command to take place after the first event occurs. The pretty cool idea, but the deleted scenes remain on the floor of the cutting room for a reason and this is an additional proof. Since it's not just as funny as "Anchorman" and let's face it, this movie wasn't exactly the comedy gold, so you get a "movie" worse than what was moderately funny. In my eyes, STILL puts one or two notches "Kicking and Screaming" or "Bewitched" in it. Cross your fingers that "Wedding Crasher" is a return to the old school form (not for red) <br /> <br /> My degree: D
