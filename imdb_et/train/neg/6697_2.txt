Crazed Shotgun toting-in-action-revenge-seeking truck drivers and obsessive-compulsive disorder "daddy raped me when I was 12" handcuffs, all prostitute-bearing latexs are just a few of the features you introduce to the full stigma of this movie that can be easily viewed by any cable television station ( IE: Skinemax) Sunday evening at 4.00. (And yes, I know it was a whole sentence, but revealed to me people, this is a short pointless movie in a short time). <br /> <br /> Filmed "somewhere" in Canada, almost no budget, the plot of this frieze is nice, the police probably never heard of "state jurisdiction" because they reach both Miya (Hookers) and Trent ( Idiotic, Anal Retentive, Generic, Insecure College Student). USA (and I thought only the FBI could do it). The camera is trembling, the sexual scenes are mediocre and the actors are so bad that it can actually cause inadvertent acidic repercussions on films like "Ishtar" and "Leonard Part 6". <br /> <br /> Skin scenes (which is the only reason to even rent this movie don't even think about buying it) are two. The first one is the only one worth seeing what is the Dominatrix Sex scene with Kari Salin and ____ (add an unknown actor here, obviously not doing anything worth mentioning) in the abundant motel room (the type that is crushed by the sink that drips, and soda) the machine outside is only blue toned water, all of which is S&M (riding crops, handcuffs, hot wax and underwear) and finally it remains in the motel room where there is no money and the police are waiting for her door (it will show you, the whore will not let you bind you Unfortunately, Kari does not show the skin that is worth remembering, and it can only cause some deeply rooted traumatic experiences for some gentlemen, so this is definitely a slipping down. <br /> <br /> What about the end , * Snicker * Snicker * I know you probably don't mind if I show you this, but I don't want you to spend your hard earned money on it. Imagine giving it a 1/5 for action, 3/5 for the skin (see last paragraph) and 0/0 for showing, developing character or turning complex plots. <br /> <br /> - Man laughs
