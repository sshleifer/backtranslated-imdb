For Daniel Auteuil, Queen Margot was much better. For Nastassja Kinski, "Paris, Texas" was much better. The biggest disappointments were from Chris Menges ("CrissCross" and "A World Apart" can't even compare it) and Goran Bregovic for the same version of "Queen Margot" for this movie (Attention at the end of the movie). If it were an American pop movie, I wouldn't be surprised at all; For a European film with more independent actors and directors, a similar common approach to child abuse is very easy and disappointing without the initial review. There are those bad guys who kidnap and sell minors. There are those poor children who hate the people who sell them and expect someone to save them. Finally, this is a great hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor kids from bad guys. Each character is shown in simple black and white: between good and evil. Plus, I understood from the beginning how the story would end. Is this the end of the history of sexual abuse of children? I believe that the difficult issue of childhood and pedophilia is much more complicated than how it is not shown in this very original film. I think this movie was not disturbing, but very disappointing.
