The makers of this film have created a future where not only abortion and contraception are illegal in every country, but women are accused of murder and sent away to serve long prison sentences. In other words, this movie is every liberal that is the worst nightmare! The political agenda here is so difficult and the movie style is so low that it just loses steam quite quickly. Regardless of which side of the fence you are, I recommend skipping it.
