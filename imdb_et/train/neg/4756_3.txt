Redefining the superb 1972 film of the reproduction, nicely choosing Caine as the first film of his character. But nothing else happens at all. <br /> <br /> Downs, Acts, and Caine Downhill, which is still weakened by a weak self-direction. <br /> <br /> In the original place, super-modern homing is left. The reflection between Oliver and Caine, which made the first film so traceable, is replaced by a terrible, dirty arrogance that immediately distracts the viewer. But it is not smart, buggy and amazing if no other character in the original did so well, it is an obvious murder of the OTT label for both words. <br /> <br /> This version of Sleutti is not really worth seeing the original film and dazzling the opening act.
