I've seen every episode of this spin. I thought the first season was a good effort, given the expectation of success following Gray's anatomy. So I have continued to watch. I'm afraid that in the second season, its predecessor, Gray, does not have the charm, chemistry and even more important of anatomy. Relationships seem to be settled and action is so-so. Writing does not have the intelligence and comedy hints in GA. There are examples that the formula, but does not feel it is formal and natural, unfortunately, PP is not so. I loved Kate Walsh's presence in GA. I'm afraid Kate Walsh's life in LA is not just interesting.
