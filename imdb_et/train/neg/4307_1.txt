It seems to be a movie thriller that is almost ridiculous. It prompted me to shout, "Oh my God!" more than once to pieces that were just stupid. <br /> <br /> Pleasant or absurd places that are only for novelty or dramatic situations and are unlikely, almost impossible, human reactions and circumstances are too great. understand why they exist. <br /> <br /> If you have time and want to know how bad a picture may be, you will want to see it. Otherwise, spend some time drying some paint to get more productive! <br /> <br /> (The July 2003 film has already been shown on television in July 2003, may signal the quality of the film)
