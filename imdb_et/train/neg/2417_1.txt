It was undoubtedly the worst thing I've ever spent on money. I feel I admitted that I rented this "movie" and paid for it. It doesn't even fix the trash. No no. It is a juice that collects at the bottom of industrial dumps, which are located in a particularly unpleasant area after an exceptionally wet summer. To name this, the trash can worsen everywhere. It was so bad that I felt I had to register with IMDbis and warn my companion. This luvahire sign says this movie is great. You need to ask for your understanding of reality. Let's take some of his comments and analyze them. <br /> <br /> "An actor who played Ricky (forgot my name) did a great job." <br /> <br /> I see. Well, if the director saw beating and worshiping his audience for every Ricky sentence, or alternately bursting with uncontrollable laughter at moments when most of the directors would want a more awful reaction from their viewers, yes; Ricky did a great job. <br /> <br /> "I am an aspiring actor who takes my own theater in my school, and I had to play where I had to cry and not be emotional in the scene. I give props to actors who have to make an emotional scene and can to pull it out. "<br /> <br /> Wow. I also have to give props to participants who can take away emotional scenes. Disappointing, you might want to look into another area of ​​work if you think these butterflies pulled it out. However, they can help you if you need to practice crying. Just look at the movie. ha. ha. ha. <br /> <br /> "RECOMMENDATION IN THE COMPETITION" <br /> <br /> If I were in your school teacher's school, I didn't just rely on that comment. <br /> <br /> I'm too annoyed to continue. Now, I'm turning my movie bashing to my companion, Mr. Bangladesh. <br /> <br /> Shame! If you've read this far, I'll assure you that you've already seen the movie, and you're now looking for one of these two comments: 1) The extra-vitriol disclaimer of what you agree was an extremely bad film. 2) The additional vitriol degradation you feel was a good movie that needs protection from a libel hit like me. Do you want to help your reluctance or ammunition to interfere with a repartory when I say something good then I just have to be disappointed - so let me assure you that there is little chance of such a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Other negative comments here IMDbis has already described the special shortcomings of the movie (eg, exhibition, soundtrack, guidance, dialogue, editing, etc.), but all these errors can be easily forgiven by themselves. Few people rent a movie called "Hood of the Living Dead" when they need these elements at the cutting edge. Hood's final failure, however, is his inability to fulfill the plentiful promise of his name. "The dead hood of life" jumps from the video store on the shelf, which affects the creative killings of a single liner and gruesomely. Here was an opportunity to mix the zombie-film ghetto ghetto with the reality that the gangsta-thug zombies would be bombarded with innocent lives as rock-do-rags, so that the undead-pimps would be over-mortal boys in their misleading rides. A mixture of these two genres could have been fun. Instead, the film is more like looking at middle-class students who play wisely in the game they play but don't understand. In order to avoid the feeling of betrayal of your video audience, I suggest that Quiroz's brothers release the movie again with the following title: "The Dead Hood of Life: A Homemade Horror Video That We Made a Camcorder With Friends at Summer Weekend, Because We were Bored. Or maybe they could release it as a documentary." "The day of creativity died: exploring how a low-budget movie might not be a completely smart and original idea, despite having no links to large studios." A potential tenant whose interest is not deleted should On the back of the case, find the following barrier: "Quiroz Brothers has once again proved that looking at things you can do is not very interesting.
