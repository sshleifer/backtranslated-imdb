The participants were guilty (they all did great performances), the overall story was not very well fulfilled. The film opens with great zinger: the crazy old man forces the young aboriginal girl on the road. But then we are forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with a brand new character ... and we don't know why up to 40 minutes. It turns out that they are the ones who finally discover the girl's body ... and the story progresses there. <br /> <br /> Although the story goes up at this point, it really goes a long way. In two hours, I asked myself: was it here or was it to see if the characters were fighting racism and stupidity with the accusations of how they discovered? The story was ultimately happy and unfinished. Although it works well, the film does not have a strong backbone to recommend it.
