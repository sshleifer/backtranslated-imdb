Ohhh man! Now I'm talking about it! As far as bad / cheesy horror flicks go this movie was really in its class. A real pearl! <br /> <br /> First, the movie was not originally in English. That's okay, because copying the votes was really extraordinary! Here's my favorite output from the dialog (and there's a lot more from where it came from)? "I feel a little better. I'm just thirsty? For your blood!" <br /> <br /> And what drama! Here's a playful game about communication between the military and the scientists? <br /> <br /> Scene 1? Scientist: "You can't do that? It's a disaster!" - Military Officer: "It's just science fiction" (he continues to cause a complete catastrophe, as the scientist predicted). <br /> <br /> Scene 2? Scientist: "If you do, many people will die!" - Military officer: "You don't know what you're talking about." (he does it and many people die). <br /> <br /> Scene 3? Scientist: "Don't do it? It's killing everyone!" - Military Officer: "It's a mess" (then he kills everyone) <br /> <br /> Scenes 4, 5, 6, 7? (you get the idea). <br /> <br /> If it wasn't enough ?? there were some scenes that really looked like classic classes! In one scene, the army literally has 10 men carrying arms to two unarmed men. The leader shouts, "Go out!" and all 10 military boys, one at a time, will drop their weapons and fists against two opponents! Instant classic! <br /> <br /> Don't worry. No attention to detail was left out! This movie even had a tree / amazing 80th keyboard / synth soundtrack to set the mood. <br /> <br /> And trust me? I understand that this review may include some spoilers, but there are so many good things in this epic that I just scratched the surface. The movie about this caliber is only available once a decade! A true movie viewing experience! Masterpiece! Wow!
