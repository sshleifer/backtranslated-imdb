When I decided to watch BARBARIANI, who saw these two bodybuilders, Peter and David Paul, I thought it wasn't so bad because the film was directed by Ruggero Deodato, who has a reputation for sleazy films, but well-made sliding movies. Well, BARBARIANID is a remarkably unpleasant action / adventure movie that wants to be another CONAN THE BARBARIAN and can't go on every level. The film's appearance is wrong. Some of the scenes were well captured, but the shades of clothing and hair for people and Å¡inty, the sticky "disco" look is adorned with just no sense, even a small budget flick like this. <br /> Richard Lynch looks like an old ridiculous hairstyle and costume. He should be intimidating, but he comes over the buffer. And it's funny to see that Eva LaRue Callahan, one of the stars of MY CHILD, appears on her first film, walking around in a hostile fur bikini. I'm sure he wants this dreck to disappear from the earth! The so-called barbarian twins are good muscle-binding heroes, but it is almost impossible to construct the right criticism for their functioning, as their roles are really badly designed as in any other confusion. The only way the film tries to distinguish one from the other is that one twin has a back cover while the other twin covers its muscle mass. I'm not kidding! Don't ask me who is. <br /> <br /> Deodato must be very desperate to make this movie. And his despair is perfectly reflected in this trash trick. It's just bad.
