The earlier part of the movie was quite enjoyable, but eventually it became fine. Although Turturro is an actor I generally love, his Luzhin often reminded of a bad Rain Man impression and the genius semi-automatic personality was annoying. All in all, it seems that this movie is trying hard and, despite its subtle performance, is bouncing.
