I can't believe the blocker is wearing this movie. It was SO BAD. I was completely deceived by the art of the box. DO NOT RECEIVE! It's not worth your time. I don't know if the flick's positive ratings were a joke or what. I'm so disappointed. :( <br /> <br /> The description on the back of the box is not even right! These positive reviews were supposed to be a joke that they just had to be. the whole movie was in all two places, or the police didn't even have uniform uniforms, say that one who cares about the uniforms of the police !? and all its fans.
