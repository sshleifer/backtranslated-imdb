I went to a movie like Sneak Preview in Austria. So you had no idea what I saw. The story is very normal. The film is very long, I believe it could have cut 1/2 without any problem. This is the type of movie you see boring at night you want to get bored! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is OK. The film speaks of US Coast Guards, their training, their lifestyle and problems. Because the film doesn't have many effects. So if you want to watch it, there's no need for money and time to go to the cinema. It would be more efficient to look at it at home when it comes to DVDs.
