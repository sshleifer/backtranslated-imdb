I wanted to enjoy this movie so much. It moved very slowly and was just boring. If it had been on television, it might have lasted 15 to 20 minutes. What happened to the tide? The great pain and the photographer worked on the wrong foundation. If it is loosely based on the director's life, why didn't he get anyone to see that the writing was "open". Then he led it at the snail's pace, which could have been the source of some people who were casting off during the movie. Music rises, but it may not be the case for a different movie .... soap opera saga. At the time Armin Meuller Stahl spoke, the dialogue was not understandable. I was not alone because I heard some rumblings about who told whom. Why can't Hollywood film better? It had a great story, but it was just bad.
