There was something of a leader in leading a perfect life that she always wanted after the worst life, starting as a child prostitute and ending with Eric Roberts. But his background makes Dean Cain's confidence impossible and it will eventually destroy it. It sounds strange, but I like the place where Dean Cain was at the end and the choice she made. She can't hurt her because she loves her and she is the mother of her child (I think the schedule makes it clear that it's her child and not her brother) but she can't forgive her all she's has done, with his brother sleeping (which shows the love and commitment he felt was in one way) and was then part of his death. In the better hands, it would have been a better movie, but something I got on a late night cable is not bad.
