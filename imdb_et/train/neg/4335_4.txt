The film and the actors are not bad, and Jay Hernandez is doing a good job playing Calito Brigantet, but the movie forgets that it is a pre-clip of the hit movie. The creators of this prequel did not follow the original Carlito road or at least did not care about continuity. This film is a prequel, which means that the original film has already given us a history and this film should end with the original beginning or at least its beginning. Not one of Carlito's close old friends, who has done this from the beginning, does not even appear on the film, they are not even mentioned. Luis Guzman, in Pachanga's original, is in the movie, but he's playing a completely different character. The original takes place in 1975 and prequel takes place between 1969 and 1970. Considering that this film takes place less than 5 years earlier, do you think one of Carlito's long friends would look like? In the original, Carlito was released from prison after five years of imprisonment. It's just a few months to finish the prequel and start the original! *** Semi Spoiler *** We know the beginning of the original, Carlito has spent 5 years in prison, so if the prequel gives us this Hollywood lucky ending, it is an offense to the original fans. What happens to Gail? This is the lack of consistency that made this movie direct to release the video.
