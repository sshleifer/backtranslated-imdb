It's been some time ago that I've seen Sleutti (1972) with two big actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine is back, but now his wife and Jude Law are his wife's lover. The story is still the same and it's a fantastic game. <br /> <br /> During the movie, I always felt like playing. That's one of the reasons I don't like the classic remake. When I watch a movie that is adapted to the game, I still have to know the movie and not just the game. Director Kenneth Brannigan made some wonderful films in the past, but this time he missed it. Another reason was the appearance of the film. The design was modern, stylish, clean, uncomfortable and cold. I never felt that someone in this house ever lived. Photography was not bad, but the lighting was terrible. Sometimes there was a blue light, a dark, green light to round it to make it friendly. <br /> <br /> The show was very good. Michael Caine and Jude Law present their best. I really would like to see these two guys playing on the stage. But I have to admit that I've never been a Jude Law fan. The weakest part was the middle part. I remember that this part was still very mysterious and just wonderful in the original. I tried to look at it twice and always slept in the middle. The final point is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not terrible, but it seems to be more of a critic than an audience. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more fun than Sleuth (2007).
