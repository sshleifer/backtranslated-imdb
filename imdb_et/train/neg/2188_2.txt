After a car accident, a mad scientist (Jason Evers) keeps his groom (Virgina Leith) in the lead of his life. He then goes in the hopes of looking for the perfect body to do all over again. Pretty flat everywhere, nothing is redeemed. Leslie Daniels, Bonnie Sharie and Bruce Brighton are also cast. Someone should have helped it out of its misery. Let it die.
