This film has many related problems that make this film school a low-budget project. I have to give this credit to my camp. Many times throughout the film I found myself hysterically laughing. From time to time it was so bad that it was comic, which made it fun for the clock. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a low-quality movie with a twist of psychological horror and fun devastating ridicule then pop your popcorn, make friends and enjoy the fun. <br /> <br /> I agree with other comments that sound is very bad. The dialogue is almost impossible to follow most of the time and the soundtrack is just that.
