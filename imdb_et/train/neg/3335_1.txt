This Cannon Movie Tale is the worst of the lot and is a positive proof that the five minute fabel is not a full-length movie. Bad Sid Caesar, as an empty emperor, is made so stupid that it's hard to see. Robert Morse is not a unique charm. Likewise, his unfortunate nephew (Jason Carter) is not "songs" terrible and only slow, which is under the plot. The direction is practically non-existent, and there are very few supporting signs. Lysette Anthony is quite like the Emperor's daughter, but her voice is obviously duplicated for some reason, shared by many underage players. And the film climbs on the deeds. Hans Christian Andersen had to turn to his grave when it appeared. Frankly speaking, at least the story of this movie is not surprising that it went straight to the oblivion of the video.
