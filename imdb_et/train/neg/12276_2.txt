There was a lot of potential in the film, unfortunately it came out of a weak / unlikely story, confusion and lack of general content / content. One of the obvious mistakes was that Sean Connery, who played an Arabic man, didn't know how to pronounce his Arabic name! It may seem like a small mistake, but it indicates a seeming lack of effort in paying attention to the details. The quality of operation was consistently below average. <br /> <br /> The lonely sustained grace of the film was the twisting of this plot at the end; and French song (I don't remember the title). In general, it was a pretty bad movie, where Sean Connery was visibly unsuccessful.
