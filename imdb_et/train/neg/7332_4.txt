Despite the fact that it is a 2001 film, the trend is a style of 90's art that was considered old and old for some years. Cheesy cuts and effects were painful to look at. The script is decent enough and some scenes made me (like when the taxi driver takes him to the bridge at night). But the story of a detective who killed the sister and how she was suicidal was just terrible. The actor who plays the marriage of Selma Blair married me seriously. I sat through the whole thing that is rare for both the casual and the movie you were just looking for on TV and decide to watch.
