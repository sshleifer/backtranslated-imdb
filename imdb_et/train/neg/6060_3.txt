It is this girl and she works in the woods, but she reaches that woman's clinic and she wants abortion. His father is old and is all angry about it. The whole episode takes place inside and outside this abortion clinic. I'm not really an option, but I wanted to kill this episode. I laughed when I saw the baby coming out and in the corner. The part where they did the ultrasound was also funny. I felt very bad about this episode of the poor father. She just wanted to protect her daughter and I couldn't really blame her. I don't know what happened to him or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room. I just smiled too much and would recommend "Pick me up" instead of an episode. It wasn't the worst episode, but it wasn't that big.
