I had to review it for the website, and I looked at it optimistically that maybe it would be at least a cheesy but fun rip, and it wouldn't have done it well enough. <br /> <br /> "666: Child" is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers I've ever seen (even worse than "Godsend") with scenes hanging from "Apple" without shame. The end is even very similar to the way "Apple". Not to mention that acting, writing and story are just a hackney. When these films make money, I'm sad to see where the shelter is. It's embarrassing.
