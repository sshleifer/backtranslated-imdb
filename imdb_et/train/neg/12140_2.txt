When imitating this long title, the film finds how to come near the 90's mark. The beautiful sets here are all that made Hamer's output a brand, but in Paris the drowned fog is a sign of sloppy negligence. The story is obvious and can be summed up in ten words, so there is nothing unexpected and something that is no more than 5% of the value of your attention. <br /> <br /> Leadership is difficult as a direct transfer of performances, actors are mostly rigid than wax figures (ok it is a Hamer function, only this is sometimes better packed in the entire package). My conclusion: this movie is a trash, not a time to spend. Eternal life is a boring thing and I should have hoped that the guys responsible for programming Cinemath√®que would have become more aware.
