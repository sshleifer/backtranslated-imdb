I can sit this movie once, but I doubt I can do it the second time. Easy to entertain, mainly for Lindsay Lohan's physical presence. Matt Dillon's fun (think of something from Mary) and revitalizing the more serious behavior of Micheal Keaton. It's not a fun romp The Love Bug was, but it's traceable. One of the main drawbacks of my film was that Herbie had become mostly R2D2 antis. I was bored when the eyes of the headlamps affected about 30 times when they were used, and the bending front impeller caused me the same reaction. Watch it with your little ones, i.e. "one-digit bracket" with kids and don't expect much of this movie. <br /> <br /> _X
