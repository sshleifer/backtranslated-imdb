This series of anime starts great: an interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully rendered and executed. Not everyone is immediately identified, telling the viewer a proverb that attracts the viewer to look at each subsequent episode. But imagine the disappointment that the adventure of a sci-fi thriller / giant robot is just the backdrop for the use of psycho-babble and almost religious preaching. If you want to hear "You are OK. after getting into the negative slogans and the negative emotions of the characters it is for you. If you want a good sci-fi flick that's just fun to watch, forget about it. Both the original and the alternates were very disappointed with me. All this, and this movie was too preaching.
