This Italian film is basically a soap opera with skin. <br /> <br /> According to the VHS box, this rating was "R", but the box in the internal tape said it was "X". The latter is much more meaningful because at the end there is a short scene that was shocking. Even in the dark, you see the Dutch actress Marishcka Detmers, who does all this man - and yes, you saw her penis in her mouth. I read somewhere that this was the first time a "protagonist" had done something like that on the screen. <br /> <br /> Detmers is naked on many scenes, but his face was even better than his body. She looked beautiful. Unfortunately, the movie is ugly .... a real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite the appearance of Detmer.
