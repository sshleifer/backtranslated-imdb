The script is nice. While casting is absolutely non-traceable. No style. costumes don't look out of High Highbury society. Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow to Kate Beckinsale I can only say that Mrs Beckinsale speaks better of British English than pr. Paltrow, although Mrs Paltrow's essence is Emma Woodhouse. Mr. Northam is undoubtedly the best version of all versions, he is romantic and not at all sharp and unknown like Mr. Knightley TV version. The observer does not see Mr Elton-Ms at all. Smith's relationship has evolved as it was in the motion version, so no one understands where all of Emma's attempts to make the Elton-Smith game (beyond the portrait).
