... mainly because Ju-2 has an overwhelming FORTY-minute value of material literally from the first Ju-a - and if you think the sequel lasts only 76 minutes, you leave 36 original minutes in the movie worth. Ho-hum. I found it to be very irritating - just as viewers wouldn't remember the same thing! - Not to mention the numbness, looking at it again. <br /> <br /> OK, this complaint was set aside, for Ju-2 it had to explain many unanswered questions. The first film that, frankly, over 36 minutes, just doesn't go far enough to make the original very complex story in any sense. <br /> <br /> However, there are some really new horror sequences that show how good the film was if it had time to develop it; and some of the questions raised by the original - some but not all - have been answered. <br /> <br /> So - if you loved the first original movie and want to see the story, go for it - but remember to hold your remote control with your finger back and forth for 40 minutes.
