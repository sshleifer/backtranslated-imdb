After about half of this movie, I noticed something special ... I found myself constantly on television to see what else was - not a really good movie feature. <br /> <br /> This movie is listed in a number of genres and I have to say that all of them failed. 80% through the movie I went to watch old aging. The bottom line - the whole movie felt that those who did it did not know exactly what to do and that they came to a challenging taste.
