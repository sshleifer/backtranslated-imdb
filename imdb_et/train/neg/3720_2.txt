Is this a movie a joke? Is this a comedy? Certainly not a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is any intentional humor, but in quite a few cases, the poor acting, bad leadership and terrible script were laughing at the cinema. The plot is acceptable - a promising young employee who comes down from a mysterious dead. The killer sees the portfolio of young artists he carries, and decides to participate in his work exhibition. At the exhibition, the assassin meets the sister of the dead artists and they finally fall in love. It is all very predictable and at the end there is no one to guess because it is so badly written. The film takes place mainly in Vienna, Austria and its surroundings and shows what a beautiful city it is. Don't waste your time on this movie if you don't find out how to DO, search for a movie or script!
