"Sundown: Vampire in Retreat" is a garbage. Operation is terrible, the atmosphere is non-existent and characters are uninteresting. The only scary thing about this coal is that most IMDb users gave it to 10. It's really terrible. No gore, no skipping, no violence, nothing.Bruce Cambell ("The Evil Dead", "Intruder") is completely wasted, supportive cast is also terrible.Yes, some people may like this picture, especially mainstream society, but heavy horror fans or gore-hounds don't enjoy this piece. Personally, I hate horror comedies, I prefer serious horror movies like "Cannibal Holocaust" or "Last House on the Left". thinks that a real horror film should be scary, excessively bloody and disturbing, without the foolish humor that usually destroys the whole concept. It's not scary, not gory, not even funny as comedy, so don't waste your precious time.
