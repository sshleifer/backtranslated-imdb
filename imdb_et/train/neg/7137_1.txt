The cars in this movie are awesome. Acting in this movie is terrible. The plot and driving scenes don't make much sense and are equally bad. If you really bother with movies where someone swaps and suddenly goes ridiculously faster, save yourself trouble and money. Good movie for racing fans? Well, there's a part where they make a mistake, referring to the NASCAR driver as rally drivers. If you can't tell the difference, look at it, you have a blast. It really comes from the fact that in this movie really really nice cars, they are driven terribly and are completely unrealistic. Operation is terrible, mainly because of a very poor plot. If you want to see hot girls, turn on mtv or vh1. I'm disappointed that such nice cars would be represented in such a bad movie. If the car class should match the film class, they should compete with rusty bikes.
