Baldwin is very low for making such films. Script, music, almost everything in this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Sound FX doesn't sound really, they're out too much (technical gadgets, etc.) If they try to make a movie about such things, at least try to get it real and lower those extreme beeps because these gadgets do not really so loud. Natural sounds like footprints and such are non-existent, giving it an empty, similar atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Forwarding seems to be OK for such a low budget (I hope it was low budget), although it seems quite amateurish at times. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters seem blank and wrong, they just haven't thrown this movie very well. I think it would have been a better idea for Baldwin to speak some Spanish than to say that Spanish actresses speak English if we all know that their language is a livelier and more lively language, so that the results of the participants can suffer to a great extent when using odd language. I mean, finally, could anyone understand how stupid it sounds to international actors to speak English with bad pressure? It should have been a long time ago a movie movie. Has the production team ever heard of subtitles? The film once again portrays the European police as lazy and corrupt, as societies as vulnerable and helpless. I mean, if the plot goes back like "Interpol can't make a plug, we'll call an American to lower this international syndicate" or whatever. <br /> <br /> Sony Pictures goes in the same direction as Columbia before it just brings movies to this hell. I imagine that they also have some self-esteem. Should buyers buy every dirty headline just because Sony puts some good things out a few times a year?! Perhaps they would have had to use the same team as Di Que Si. It is spoken in Spanish and Paz Vega and Santi Millan is doing decent work, keeping the movie on. Looks and sounds much better! Come to Sony, wake up, produce less, sell more.
