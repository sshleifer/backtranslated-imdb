Spoilers think. <br /> <br /> After all, absolutely absurd logic destroys the whole movie. I just didn't get over it. And what's wrong with Mark Wahlberg's character? When I suddenly discovered I fell into a monkey-filled planet, I was all like "AAAAhhhhHHHH! Run for your life! The monkeys inherited the earth!" But he's all like "talking monkeys, okay. Next?" It's pretty jaded. He must regularly get into even foreign things. In addition, it is still Rick Baker's best work. This movie is a real proof of how far we have reached the field of monkey makeup. 3/10.
