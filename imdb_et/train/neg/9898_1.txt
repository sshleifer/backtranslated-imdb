The "Moby Dick" version offends the audience, claiming that it is based on the Melville novel, even so far as to show a false first chapter sentence rather than the famous "Call me Ishmael". Not only does John Barrymore have a scary act, it is probably the biggest example of how far Hollywood (especially early Hollywood) goes through to change and change the famous novel just to increase its chances at the ticket office. the beautiful, poetic language of the novel is absolutely destroyed, and Ahab has become a terrifying, miserable, obsessive madman, misunderstood hero who only wants to kill Moby Dick after his brother (!) retreat after his wooden vision. This is accompanied by the usual evil brother who wants the groom himself, and the other end!
