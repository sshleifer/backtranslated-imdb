I've read all the Love Come Softly books. Really knowing that movies can't use all aspects of the book, but in general they have at least the main point of the book. I was very disappointed in this movie. The only thing they have in this book is that Missy's father comes to visit, although both parents are in the book. That is all. The story was so twisted and far-fetched, and it was sad from the book that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book, it was too sad. I know Pioneer's life was tough, but the whole movie was down. The purpose of the rating is the family orientation of the same film that makes them big.
