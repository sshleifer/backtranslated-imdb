I was afraid I took my granddaughter to this movie because I didn't think it would be well done. The kids, aged 6 and 10, had to see it, so I hit. I have to admit that it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought, but it was still far from the book. The film seemed like a 10-year understanding and a sense of humor. I found that the 6-year-old realized what was going on and he provided solutions to the issues that had been resolved. Finally, I had to explain that sometimes movies don't show the best solutions to problems because it's more fun to see what happens when they make "fool" or "stupid" choices.
