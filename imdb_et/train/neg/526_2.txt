Almost as annoying as it was to read, the evening is a great breakthrough ... until Meryl Streep walks and quietly shows her other cast members how to do this kind of thing. Vanessa Redgrave is shocking in her role, as the deadly Ann and Claire Danes are poisonous. Perhaps, if Vanessa and Claire had changed roles, we could have seen a young Anni's vitality that gave her hope for a rare world and we could imagine that Elder Ann was actually dying. I was hoping that adding Michael Cunningham to the writing credits would be striking, but unfortunately. It gave me a headache.
