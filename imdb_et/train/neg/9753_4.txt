I am grateful for one thing and only one thing - that this woman is now thousands of miles from a completely different continent !!! Yay !!! This program perfectly combined exactly how obsessed Victoria Beckham has led himself and his family to the media for self promotion and "Brand f * cking Beckham". <br /> <br /> A few years ago, "Posh and Becks" really liked, I still wonder a lot about David's talents, but I don't respect him anymore. How can you honor someone who is biased on his back with his wife's hand as he is a doll. <br /> <br /> It was clear that Victoria's hand was the premature departure of Beckham from Manchester United, and now the same thing happened in Real Madrid. I hope that Beckham will be able to live with the fact that although he can earn a pound sterling - he sold his soul to the American Buck and finishes his day playing for a team fighting for promotion from England One (America is not guilty of America) - but baseball and basketball for what you usually do - football what you are not!) <br /> <br /> Anyway - I'll land. It has been years since I saw such a surprising, totally false presentation of "Posh" - it is only when he has turned a worthy red carpet performance after "Rebellion" by Rebecca Loose, rather than throwing it all He got away from David when he desperately struck his hand, trying to save a million pounds of money that his marriage had changed. <br /> <br /> This whole PR stunt was pathetic. Why can't she just go there quietly, support her husband through the biggest mistake in her career and keep her head? When did it become so obvious that it feels that this huge fan cost should reflect the move to America? <br /> <br /> By the way, last night I saw David Beckham's documentary. At least he has retained grace and humility. Two things a woman can do with her studies. Another thing about Victoria - you complain that the priests are constantly hounded. A Little Tip - Stop Their Location When You Are A Foolish Woman From Your Location. Good luck in America!
