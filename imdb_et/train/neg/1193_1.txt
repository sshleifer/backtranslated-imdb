You know how sometimes you can watch your friends with an embarrassing movie and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie? Well it was beyond that. I bought a DVD in Tower Records because it was like $ 3.00 and I heard it was a movie you could laugh at. It's really something pathetic. About 30 minutes into my movie, my friends started asking me to turn it off. About 45 minutes they asked me. After an hour, we threatened rapid progress, so we saw how the conflict was resolved (and since we were looking at Matt Walsh all the time). Seriously, don't look at this movie. It's painful.
