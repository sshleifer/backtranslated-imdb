... but it is definitely not worth it. Already a writer-director, Preston Sturges, is experimenting with unusual film effects when talking about his stories, creating broad, but peculiar signs and situations, and writing a clever and sometimes unexpectedly witty and compassionate dialogue. (No wonder the next movie from Coen's brothers gets tribute to Sturges.) <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that the plot is not all the way; it has no surprise, an unexpected turn to the plot and sudden changes in the fortune that keep the viewers away. The coffee slogan is a bad thing that hangs on the plot and the end is thoroughly predictable. Frank Capra makes this a lot better. <br /> <br /> If you're new to Preston Sturges, check out "The Lady Eve" or "Sullivan's Travels" or "Morgan's Creek Wonder". Once you have seen them, go ahead and look at it.
