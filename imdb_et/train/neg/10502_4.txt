The film has several stories that follow a number of different characters. The different story lines do not feel as a whole, which makes this comedy very inconsistent and occasionally even annoying. </p> With Steve and Terri Irwin, you can check out the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery Channel. It's more fun and even more fun than this movie is. I'm sure that both the cast and the team members made this movie fun, but the movie doesn't give us much pleasure. It's not just funny for comedy, and Steve and Terri Irwin aren't just good actors, even if they play! Their antics aren't just good enough to make the whole movie around and their scene feeling is long, distracting and unnecessary, and sometimes even annoying. that strange is both intriguing and fun to watch, so when I first heard that they were making a "crocodile forest", my first reaction was; brilliant! However, the film suffers from its weak story and inconsistent and inconvenient characters inconsistent story. The film has a certain entertaining value, at least so much that this film can be viewed at least once, but I should not recommend this film. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie seemed a while. However, this film can only be seen once when it hits the TV, rainy afternoon. It has some good moments, but the story lines really completely destroy the film and its potential. <br /> <br /> 4/10
