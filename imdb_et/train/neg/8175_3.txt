The mood of this movie is pretty good and it takes 80's to feel good performances. <br /> <br /> But ..... <br /> <br /> The script is running a grinder, except for some comedic moments and coming out as weird, where I think it was meant to be nervous. The characters are far more dramatic and unbelievable and full of right clich√©s, which the scriptwriter apparently saw on the national front of a panoramic documentary. The biggest problem is the film that has no real story. It drills all the right boxes, but nothing really happens and you will eventually think about what the point was. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing
