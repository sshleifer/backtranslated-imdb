Director Eric Stanze 'ISOYC, IPOYG', has three men tortured by a woman that they have been sexually abused. The first victim is forced to eat his death before moving to death. The next block comes by foot when someone refuses to have anal sex with the first man's body. But this is the third person who gets the worst: he has to look at the heavily tattooed "star" Emily Haack's naked and masturbate with a handcuff (oh, she's got a handle that's also her butt!). <Br /> <br /> And unfortunately we do so (we see him masturbate, it can't bones handle!). <br /> <br /> Yes, 'ISOYC, IPOYG' is one harsh viewing experience, not because of its relentless violence, but because of Haack, who is obviously mistaken in the idea that he has a goddess's body (unlike Metallica's journey), gets naked for the camera. It's not quite prominent. <br /> <br /> In addition to the persistent nudity of Haack, viewers also see Stanze as a terrible trend (who thinks endless tombstones and trees). is an entertaining stuff), some very bad actresses and a greasy boy penis. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, I give 'ISOYC, IPOYG' a rating of 3/10, which is actually slightly higher than its current 2.9 average. This is one point for dirty ax attacks (which is gore-hound, I really enjoyed); one point for a place where a greasy man can push his face into a chocolate mousse that disguises as stools (fun); and one point that shows that this film can somehow be Meir Zarch's top class, which I push into my grave.
