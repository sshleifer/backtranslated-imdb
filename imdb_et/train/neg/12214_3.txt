Well, what I can say about this movie is that it's so good to see so many Asian faces. I didn't like the movie because it was full of stereotypes about what typical racial characters do in their role. Asian girl without trust, who has to play someone to get ahead, a white man who was helped by Asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind the yellow land and "keeping it real" for the black cab driver. Plus all the coke, shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too clear. The story of the plot itself was fun, but pretty much how I thought the story opened. Then, when you look at romantic comedies, you can't wait a lot, but then I would have liked to be surprised at least once. Parents are the best part of flick.
