Having seen the Universal Soldier franchise's low budget sheriffs, I hoped and prayed that Van Damme repressed his role in Luc Devoreaux in another Unisol movie. Well, it seemed that this prayer was answered, but not as I hoped. The Universal Soldier 2 is just as intense as reading your local library poetry. No, even that would be more interesting. The fighting sequences are top-notch, the quality of Bruce Lee, which is the only redemption factor in this all-terrible apology. It and having a former WCW hard guy legend "Goldberg" who plays the scraper. But placing Goldberg as Lieutenant of Sethi sidekick would have been better. <br /> <br /> We made the most of the film when we set up the movie itself. It's like some film school students together. The plot holes are larger than the Kanye West's ego, which this movie actually did. For example: Lucy's daughter Hillary looks like she is at least 11-13 years old and the first movie was filmed just seven years ago. How is it possible? Tell me that! The part where Luci's partner died and became Unisol is just modest! You want to tell me that in the basement of the research complex, Unis exhibited at the beginning of the film was naked. C'mon. The director could have spent more time with this film than the first one and sewed all the holes in the plot. But oooh nooo! <br /> <br /> Talking about a plot, it sucks! Compared to the first film, the universal soldier wrote 2 plots and worthless. Where are the excitement, where Unis again gets his last memory in the supermarket tournament, thinking about his Desert Storm or something? It was the millennium threshold if you had attracted more audiences than it would have been in the future of dystopia / oracle. Corny is the right sad, sad, sad, sequential descriptive adjective. <br /> <br /> What I saw: Double Impact, Under Siege 2, Robocop 3, and Hell, even the cheap-ass / no class Terminator knock-off "Class 1999" is more interesting!
