After seeing only one name credit that I know and that was the preacher of this movie (Russ Conway), I didn't expect much of this movie and I wasn't disappointed. The man is going to kill his new wife, convince other people that he is crazy and takes his own life. It is not known to a man that the plastic skull he is using is a woman's appearance that his first dead wife is revenge and uses a real skull. A simple plot with irony at the end. If you are tired one night and you need to sleep, it helps to sleep.
