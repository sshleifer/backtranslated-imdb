I wasn't impressed with this movie especially because I went to the cinema with my family in good faith to see a movie that was in the UK here 12A. In my opinion, this movie was full of embarrassing sexual jokes. (What is not a problem for me as an adult, but not good for viewing with children). Sometimes this movie was sometimes somewhat raw, hit the flank, and so on. And most of the movie wasn't very funny. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for this film is that Calvin Sims, a 2-inch dwarf, gets out of jail and steals a giant-sized diamond, but is forced to put it on a women's handbag. So the rest of the movie sees her as an abandoned child who gets to that woman's home to get her back. <br /> <br /> So far, I've enjoyed most of the Wayans Brothers - but this movie is definitely a cookie. <br /> <br /> Bit good advice - wait until it is on TV or cable
