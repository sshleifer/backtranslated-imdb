Going to the movie in a minute. First, someone wanted to "prove" Clinton's comments on Georgetown, where he claimed the US "precious" 9-11 attack. Well, here Clinton said: <br /> <br /> "In the first Crusade, when Christian soldiers took Jerusalem, they first burned the synagogue with 300 Jews and killed all the women and children who were Muslims. I can tell you that this story is still still in the Middle East, and we are still paying for it. ‚Äù<br /> <br /> We still pay for it? Whaddya means" we ", paleface? The Navy did not break Temple Mount. has never really stated and said we deserve "9-11." Like all statements made during his presidency, IMPLIED, we deserve 9-11. Note "Fact" A, B, C and Suddenly D and let the listener conclude that they have to add X to the conclusion. If in fact most of Clinton's "facts" are added to guacamole. <br /> <br /> It is next to the point. If Oliver "Captain Conspiracy" stone makes a movie, you will not be your twisted politician It was only a matter of time before he focused on his paranoia and bitterness to Reagan's time, and what the better time it was for Stone's dreams to come, when Reagan almost bought a farm. In the Hinckley murder attempt he found no unpleasant parcels or schemes, then he discovers one with Al Haig. From the simple misunderstanding of the constitutional chain, Haig has become a servant who would indeed have considered his habitual megalomaniac as a remedial civic education. You almost expect Haig to start his hands like Montgomery Burns and tell Cap Weinberger to "Unleash the dogs". Stone even recruits a Hollywood smiley man to play our former Secretary of State Richard Dreyfuss. The man you love to see in hate. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is OK. Average, lower than average. Don't worry about renting or buying. Try to catch it with a cable. 4 out of 10.
