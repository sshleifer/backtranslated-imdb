There is no reason to see this movie. The idea of ​​a good plot is treated very badly. Everything changes in the middle of the movie and there's no point in it. The cause of the slaughter is not clear. Action is terrible. Nick Stahl apparently needs a better director. She was great in the bedroom, but here she is terrible. Amber Benson of Buffy must ever change his character. Even those who enjoy free sex and violence are disappointed. Although the movie was 80 minutes, which is too short for a good movie (but too long for it), there are no scenes deleted on the DVD, which means that they never bothered to fill in the missing parts. /> <br /> Don't waste time on it.
