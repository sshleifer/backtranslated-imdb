After Disney's funny life on George, I had a great hope for this flick. The main disappointment. Theme bare plot, bad exemplary, bad visual effect. This film was based on flat one-liners, idiotic (and meaningless) product placement and the most damaging annoying side game in this gadget's car case. I watched two young children and they missed their mind. The only smile that came out of this movie was a bad standby when a guy who laughed at it needs to laugh!
