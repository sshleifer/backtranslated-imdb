This sequel is thoroughly uneven, inconsistent and rushing in the "plot" (if it really exists) and trying to be too damn modern (ridiculous, periodically and characteristically 21st century songs) and cute (fun: too much produced, funny jokes with animals .) The participants in his film are next to a plot of minors. Even Glenn Close (and he is usually very good) wipes out this movie, parodying himself as the original leader of De Ville and Sunset Boulevard! It's a movie that's not even good to watch. This is a very good example of a bad and pointless succession. Even the basic instinct 2 had a plot, characterization, and acceptable action. This is not. This is bad.
