Very funny "watching the Beretta Island" as a natural trash film.It is like the answer to Jess Franko's b-movie. The artists hit back (! Face to face!) Pushers. : incredibly bad-looking shooting (shooting) scenes looks even better than hand-to-hand fighting.Chasing scenes ridiculous.Saving beauty scenes incredibly stupid.Erotic scenes are very unerotic.The main luck movie is pretty landscapes and festival scenes. t miss: Arnold Schwarzenegger at the beginning of the movie and the list of a relative of Franco Columbu. Special attraction: naked bosom.Almoust forgot - Franco can sing!
