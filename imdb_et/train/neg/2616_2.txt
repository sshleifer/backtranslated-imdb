I remember the name Kevin Lime - and please, never let <br /> <br /> drive him again. Timing, tempo, editing: all hopelessly wrong. <br /> <br /> Three or four decent professionals (next time guys who don't let <br /> <br /> set) can't do anything to record this movie with amateurs like Alice <br /> <br /> Evans and the production standards you expect from <br /> <br /> teen children's shows on British TV. <br /> <br /> The greatest mystery: music. So inaccurate, inappropriate, and <br /> <br /> a score that doesn't match the film's tone seriously, is it sabotage. Add acoustically to the bumps and director of one of the mike clearly, who only <br /> <br /> remembers the addition of intermittent sound to the screen, and we <br /> <br /> have the greatest money ratio in recent years <br /> <br />
