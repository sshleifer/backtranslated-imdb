I was interested to see that this thought might be a diamond that is tough, but the only thing I found was bad writing, terrible leadership (shots don't flow), although the director can say that this is what he is It looks like it is very insecure and immature, but it could have been done by anyone with 2 video tapes and a low budget video. I'd say it wasn't as simple as a mini digital video. <br /> <br /> There are some simple ways to correct a movie, as the director has, such as editing, etc. But it is obvious that he just doesn't care. This film has made so much effort as a ham sandwich. It could be better, but it would mean more work.
