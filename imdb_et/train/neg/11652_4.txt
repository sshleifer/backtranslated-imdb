Scary for "Scary Movie 2" just wasn't ready to go. This is a problem that is obviously obvious to both actors and audiences. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans and many actors are funny people; and so the film is not completely humorous. The film has many funny moments for its credit. As a whole, "Scary Movie 2" is not even close to both smart and amusing. <br /> <br /> The first "Scary Movie" was a ridiculous movie. This made comic gold the smallest nuances of the movie genre. "Scary Movie 2" humor is as hard as it is original. They even leave obvious parody options. Two movie stars are former "Beverly Hills 90210" cast members and it was an exhibition that asked to show! Ultimately, "Scary Movie 2" is like a fine wine bottle that was opened too early. The script needs much more time to get older. 2 stars out of 5.
