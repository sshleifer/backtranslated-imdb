I had the feeling that after "drowning" it wouldn't be better ... I was right. He has to look for champagne money and not take care of the final product ... his voice goes through a stranger who doesn't sound like he does; editing is - just - higher than amateur. This is nothing more than a Class B or C movie with enough money to hire a couple of talented operators and "OK" sound designers. <br /> <br /> As the previous poster said, the problem seems to be post-production (... casting votes, etc.) Too bad, the plot really causes SG-aliasing. <br /> <br /> I will never try another SG leg unless he sends me an email asking for forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Too bad - I miss Kelly LeBrock ... <br /> <br /> --jimbo
