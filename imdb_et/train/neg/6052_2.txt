Despite my shortcomings, I enjoyed "Cigarette Burns," John Carpenter's "One Episode" Horror Champions Season. Yes, this story seemed a cheap cross between MADNESS MUTH and 8MM, but it was still pretty good for budget and time constraints. However, with Pro-Life, low budget and time limits are definitely more than anything else. Carpenter is always on the lookout for quality, but there is a quality for writing and producing everything that feels like it is done at full speed. The script is not always clear, the message is blurred and the story is full of holes in the plot when you look back at them. Maybe Carpenter had rewritten the script, it could have been a useful episode. Instead, it's a confusion that only hardcore Carpenter fans will find the slightest enjoyment. Certainly the worst Carpenter ever made. 2/10
