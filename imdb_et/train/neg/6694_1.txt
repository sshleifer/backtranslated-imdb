I really had hope for this film because I have seen Kari in some other way and I think he has some talent. Unfortunately, this is a case study that is not a scenario. Fully-undefined characters that do not contain any grace. Is it a tea / friend / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? The filmmakers have no idea and we will not.
