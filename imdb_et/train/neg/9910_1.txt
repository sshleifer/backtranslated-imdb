One of the worst movies. Not funny, bad TV-style cinematography, bad acting. Sad to see so many famous old actors who hardly can walk, let alone do. Lead Nancy Young can't act. Terrible direction. Sub-par with bad TV movies. From time to time, weak jokes fall. Even the main premise of a movie doesn't make sense. Somehow they should end the wedding, but there is no logic behind their activities. The slow pace made my wife look, but I suffered it. Old men should behave like they are young and horny, but it's funny instead of pathetic. How did they get the money for that?
