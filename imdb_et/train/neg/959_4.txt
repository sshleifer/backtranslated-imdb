I would have given this movie to 10 if it wasn't ms. Claudine Barretto's performance. and I'll take that time to forget that Kris Aquino is here. and ... the end. <br /> <br /> I really don't look at Pinoy's horror films because the stories are not original and I really think (some) writers don't give enough attention to the characters (and their progress) their stories (redundant?). it would have "pushed" the movie forward as a storyteller. and my goodness, creative exhaustion led them to hang other films. why? why this movie got a good overview? I wouldn't give it so much. the film was very frightening, but the film seemed to deal with filipino folklore ... it goes to my "most likely" category. I just wanted them to spend more time improving the story and improving those flash sequences, never when the lighting sucks, it wouldn't matter if the content was out for you. SAYANG.
