I went to this movie, assuming it was really godly. And that was. I really felt sorry for the star studs - Kathy Bates was a wonderful actor ... before she made this movie - Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were disappointed, but Miranda Richardson couldn't put one of the fabulous performances I know and love her. Fred's father, who played Trevor's Peacock (among others the fame of Vicar of Dibley), had about one line. <br /> <br /> The plot was predictable and all over the place and humor was ... missing. (However, one part of the movie where Santa enters the Jewish family house ... which made me laugh just because their expressions were classic) Don't look at this movie if your only alternative is not the main collision with the train (in fact the train might be better ...)
