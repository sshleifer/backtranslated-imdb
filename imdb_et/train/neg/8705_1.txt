This movie is the worst film I've ever seen ... it's humorous, how bad it is ... all the time I watched it start playing half-expected music and the doctor starts dancing. right primer) When the raptor tried to gain access to the door, I think someone threw a plastic doll around the door about 2 meters away. But as I said it is so bad, you have to look at it so you can see how bad it is that I explain that you are not going to do anything when you look at it. I don't recommend renting it, but if it's on TV, watch it for about 30 minutes to see what I mean. I couldn't watch for more than 30 minutes, but if you can sit through the whole thing, you have good willpower
