I know, I know, the "9th Space Plan" is the worst film, or "Manos, Fate". But I can't work on these socks-monkeys. * Of course * they are bad. How could they be good? But when you talk about movies that have respectable product values ​​and banknotes, T. turk of turkeys must be "Yentl". All the misery printed by Barbra Streisand since 1964, all self-absorbing blood, reaches the culmination of this film. "Yentl" looks back at "The Star is Born" and "Mirror is Two Faces" from his lonely terrible summit. Something else you don't like. What an emotional undercurrent drew Streisand to make this film that I wouldn't speculate, and what kind of audience he played, I can't imagine, though I bet ten options are you not a member of it. /> <br /> Nobel laureate and Isaac Bashevis Singer, a Yiddish literary guardian, was so outraged by Streisand's story that he broke openly. It is a tribute to Streisand's pervasive vulgar, which he did not only commit suicide, but still made horrible movies.
