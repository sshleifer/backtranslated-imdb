I do not give much faith in theories of AIDS conspiracy, but its sociologically interesting phenomenon is dramatic. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the suffering of fear and death and paranoia often caused such dark fantasies. This is especially true for the politically radical and sexual extreme demo in San Francisco. The city, known for its beauty, is rarely seen in this movie. The feeling of darkness and decay passes through each scene. <br /> <br /> Although acting and plot cannot be said to be well done, movies record a unique cultural context and an oppressive dark mood, at least in part, without the loss of a movie. In fact, I found it most interesting to be Irit Levi as a harsh and cynical Jew, a lesbian (?) Police detective. He's interesting, though not necessarily convincing. <br /> <br /> Highlights: Using the film quietly in the tragic Turandot is an effective motive and by the iconic artist Ron Athey is a subtle silence.
