The Star Creatures invasion would certainly be "so bad for a good" category if the film wasn't quite as sexist or racist. It's just just bad. <br /> <br /> It has the same hard-core stereotypical sex that you saw in the Queen's Queen and racist stereotypes (in this case, Native american). that you usually find in thirties and forties b-westerns. What is not funny is to repeat the same walk through the cave in the same pretty short movie. Ray makes one good impression of Jimmy Cagney (but he can't do it impressively on two Cagney, and he doesn't try to try it on Peter Lorre). In fact, there are no product values ​​to talk about, because "Star Creatures" transforms Ro-Man Robot from Monster or Tor Johnson into the 9th cosmos from space light and magic creations. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely one of the foregrounds that you would have thought to be independent in the cinema ... not good enough for those artists and not good enough for everything that was driving all night. <Br /> <br />
