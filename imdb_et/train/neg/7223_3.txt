My first attempt to see it ended in 8 minutes, after a TV commercial scene that I couldn't. It was about this: <br /> <br /> Reporter 1: Oops, our sky is a pyramid. Reporter 2: I think it's an alien. * Uncomfortable silence * Reporter 1: In other news ... <br /> <br /> A few days later I watched it to the end and it was not as terrible as I imagined, but there are serious problems with it. About half of the plot can be easily thrown away. And the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something. <br /> <br /> What kind of detective, eugenics and monsters will Horus take for a moment? More fun was the monopoly scene. "We are all powerful" gods "who have lived for aeons, and all the games in the multiverse where we play the monopoly." Monopoly? Monopoly?! Even Erich von Dainiken sees the same in comparison. <br /> <br /> The other side is terribly incomplete. What did our protagonist do to get the cryophiles? Why wasn't it a big event at the end of her end? He had those irritating followers, remember? What happened to normal people? What is a masked guy? How did a blue hair girl appear? What is his vision? Etcetera, etc. <br /> <br /> Visually OK, more or less if you ignore the Egyptian gods who look like walking places with the heads of the Rotweiler.
