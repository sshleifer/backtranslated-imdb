I really wanted like a pillow book. An intriguing story, interesting traits, Ewan Macgregor totally glorious. Unfortunately, I hated every minute. Greenaway got the film in a unique show for both film and film. I can't even get into Vivian Wu's exhausting action. <br /> <br /> You can disturb the story with 4 billion beautiful windows and calligraphy that roll at the bottom of the screen, playing the words of the music you play. He seemed to have lost his vision of the actual story of demonstration and plot development and became confused with foo-foo decorations that had nothing to do with it. It's a bit like presenting a portrait of John Singer Sargeant in a silver Hallmark frame that says, "GRANDMA loves me!" with big sparkling letters. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be the driver's ego accident instead of what could have been - disruptive and terribly beautiful. Another director (Jeunet? Coppola?) Could have been a masterpiece. In Greenaway, it is best to place it in beautiful art classes that take you too seriously.
