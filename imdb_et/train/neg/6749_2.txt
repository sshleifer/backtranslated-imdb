This confusion is so bad that it doesn't even qualify as a horror. <br /> <br /> Debbie Rochon's talent has been completely wasted in this film. He's not even a villain. The rest of the participants look like wannabes and the plot is so flat that I don't even talk about it. <br /> <br /> Take advantage of your final credit to hear the upcoming performance of "Two Better Than Sex" by TwoMarlowe, a 80 year old Disco candy song. Nice tempo song about Gambleing & Sex. As fun as "Bleed". Put it as if someone is copying videos, but decides only to record the song at the end of the movie, you really have a "BAD" movie.
