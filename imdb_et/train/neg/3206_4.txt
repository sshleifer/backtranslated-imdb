I was glad to hear that Cesar Montano had decided to film in Cebuano. (Not a "break" because most Filipinos are wrong in referring to it. Like Cebuano and Tagalog, it is both incomprehensible and French and Spanish.) But I was very disappointed when I saw this movie. Being a Cebuano parent in Canada, I was optimistic about reviving the Visayan film industry when I heard about this movie. I was still pleased to hear that it was not another silly action movie or melodrama because the Filipinos love this type of film. But unfortunately I had changed in a short time. <br /> <br /> Panaghoy is an ego trip to Cesar Montana. Of course, Montano plays the hero of the movie. And when I say "hero", I mean the most stereotypical ways; his job is to win the girl's heart and take the Bol anons against the Japanese victory. His character has no depth or complexity. He just fits the hero's form. The remaining characters are one-dimensional; they all fit the roles of their cookie cutters. <br /> <br /> I am all slow moving / meditative movies, but this movie was just slow. It didn't actually meditate on anything. Just because the film is historically-themed, drama and slow motion do not make it a well-made film. <br /> <br /> American actress Philip Anthony is especially annoying. His production was embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If Montano wanted to revive the Visayan film industry, he would have had to think through it. He said he wanted to make Visayan films that could compete in Cannes and Toronto, etc., but really, this film would have leaned on such festivals and in the elevator. To get Visayan movies into mainstream consciousness, he would have had at least a movie that would have attracted the audience, even if it meant sacrificing quality. Obviously, he did not think or receive information about what films Cannes Awards would collect, so that the audience's attracted film would have been at least a foot behind the door. <br /> <br /> I am afraid that because of this movie, Visayan movies are not made for a long time. If I ever told the Filipinos I want to see more Visayan movies, of course, I get the answer, "Visayans doesn't make good movies. Didn't you see Panaghoy Sa Suba?" Of course, this is ridiculous because it is one example of a Visayan movie, and probably the only example that anyone is likely to see today. <br /> <br /> For example, meditative, not just slow movements. Tagalog movie Blackout or David Lynch straight story. I hate to promote the Tagalog language because it is being promoted and moved indefinitely under the throat of non-Tagalog Filipinos, but for the sake of calling the child, Blackout is a very good film. These films are heavily dependent on what Hitchcock called "pure cinema". Images are transmitted without words. But for the sake of these two films, I am somewhat bending, that these films use images without words to convey the mood of the film. and they do it very well. Panaghoy thinks that if they simply take the sweep of the landscape, they have created a mood. <br /> <br /> And what about so many Filipino movies with a dying mother or grandmother?
