This film is an idiotic experiment for some kind of action thriller. The bus that travels to Las Vegas is attacked by a group of white garbage hijackers who drive with dunes. They drive them into the desert and steal all their valuables. The plot is constantly changing. One minute they want to rob a rich herd of daughters, the next they are looking for a $ 90,000 stamp. The dialogue is terrible. <br /> <br /> Please don't watch this movie.
