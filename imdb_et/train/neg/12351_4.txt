A recent post here by a woman calling for a military background contained a comment on "Woman's life is not more valuable than a man". <br /> <br /> This politically correct mantra is not a history or an exhibition of biology. Societies have been able to recover from the heavy losses of their male population, sometimes at amazing speeds. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939, despite the war of 1914-1918, where more than two million men were killed. In the war of South America in the War of the Triple Alliance (1865), Paraguay took three neighboring countries until almost all of its male population was destroyed, but fought a deadlock against much more Bolivia in the 1944 Chaco war. <br /> <br /> No society has, or will ever be able to survive, the loss of its female population. Only when the lives of the people are at stake, women have been sent to fight. Israel was faced with this situation in 1948, but since then, despite the popular image, the Israeli girlfriend has not taken their defense forces together. <br /> <br /> "G.I. Jane" is Hollywood's fluff.
