Now I get it. The title refers to the immediate follow-up of each audience member after 68 minutes of mental torture. Trying too hard to be scary, lacking in good dialogue, Screaming Skull makes it rather scary bored. The black and white mansion and the real estate set a dark tone for the film, but that's it. The only scary thing about this flop is that people made money for it! Remember the coffin guarantees at first? This may be the funniest thing I've seen on the screen. The sad thing is that the viewers probably hoped to be director Alex Nichol forcibly in coffins, seized, and buried in his viable effort. Jenny once put in this unfortunate terrible situation a condolence that you would feel about a woman whose anxiety is accused of being haunted by a cranial tank. His wife, John, is also going to loose a smooth running speaker, but it doesn't work and he can prove how tough he is with helpless spying! Ah, Mickey? Days before you received a detention order against his similar property managers. This man is not very good or maybe too much airplane glue. Despite his strange man, Mickey is probably the only good thing that this movie gives for a little entertainment and I don't get a guy who says, "That was Mary!" in a greenhouse through pots.
