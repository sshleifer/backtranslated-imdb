The most embarrassing moment for this movie is when Brady Corbet says at the end of the movie "You're Flourished". I practically died. I'm still not quite sure why the screenwriters put this line. Was it supposed to create romance? Because it made me almost sick. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script was almost as bad. <br /> <br /> I've never liked the original Thunderbirds, but the Thunderbirds movie had the potential to do so much. This movie is not. Had it not been a big draw for the Thunderbirds brand, it would have been directly on TV or preserved in post production. Maybe even before. <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing about the movie is when the credit is drawn and they play the "Thunderbirds are go" song from Busted. I can't believe I wasted $ 7 by watching it for pay.
