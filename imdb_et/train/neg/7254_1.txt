Who ever wrote two or three glowing reviews of whether they participated in making this movie, the term was used loosely or the bank was running it, and if the latter were so, I would like my seven dollars back! Actors who are loosely used again are terrible, in fact almost none of them did anything again, which is relief. Landscapes and everything from this screaming, we had $ 7 to work together and do the day. Was it filmed in someone's backyard? All about this project says low budget. The best actors were on the D list. Don't waste your time if, of course, you don't want to take it back and try to rent it. The leading bad man looks like an exhibition of the 70s that ended with a married grandmother's dummee moore. My local video store lists this because the movie is mostly sent back with sad comments. Even with a 99-cent rent, this flick of dust accumulates. No one really has to owe it. It's super smelly and I give it 10 turds.
