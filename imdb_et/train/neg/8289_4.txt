I'm sorry, but it's a bad movie that's fun. Football hooligans who claimed the travel house? Fits? Shades?! Alan had no clear idea of ​​what he was saying when he did, it was far from the truth if you could. <br /> <br /> Casting was cruel ... Gary Oldman as a football hooligan? She doesn't see it as frightening, scary, or even come across as someone who wants football. And like Yeti? What the hell? Costumes, tones, and the travel agency are childishly robbing each other of "your time when you have diapers". Please and <br /> <br /> And the Yeti gang leans on the ICC underwear? <br /> <br /> I don't see how anyone can even take this movie seriously. <br /> <br /> 4/10 This may be the most inaccurate picture of the crisis of hooliganism in the late eighties.
