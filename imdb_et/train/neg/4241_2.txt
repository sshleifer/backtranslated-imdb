Yes, Madsen's character - although she talks to a woman on TV - is right: LAPD is a corrupt, violent and racist police. And this movie doesn't change anything. Okay, there are good policemen, moral policemen, even black, who, Christian, martyr. But this is a fairy tale, admit it. Reality is not so. And the most important act for fans: Shoot out is boring. It's just shooting and shooting. Nothing more. Play Counter Strike, you have at least something to do. The only moral of this movie is: LAPD is good now. No more bad cops. If you like police and military critical, euphemistic ads, check out this movie. It's the longest commercial I've ever seen. (2 points for camera and editing).
