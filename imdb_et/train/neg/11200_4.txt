The good words of Webster's dictionary define logophobia as fear of words. I can just be logophobic. Because no combination of words scares me more than the words "Produced, written, and directed by" at the beginning of the movie, followed by the name of the individual. Think about it. There are carpenters, electricians and plumbers, but so few jack-of-all-trades. Even the most experienced managers like Speilberg and Scorsese rarely take control of their films. But there I was all placed in my toolbox, in the hands of popcorn, and I was going to watch this order when he was like the quick ball of Nolan Ryan when they were "Brian Helgeland produced, written and directed". Where! <br /> <br /> Being a movie buff, I knew from Brian Helgeland. As a writer, she has been depicted as a graph over the past 10 years, as in 1998, the share price of a dotcom company. There were so many theatrical inconveniences (Assassins, Postman, Conspiracy theory) as there were critical and award-winning achievements (LA Confidential, Mystic River). They seemed intermittent? one good, one bad, so knowing that his last film, BloodWork, was one of the most wasteful efforts of Clint Eastwood's career, I took the breath and hoped for the best. Looking back, I shouldn't have breathed out. <br /> <br /> The letters of the order Heath Ledger (the story of Helgeland's knights), like Alex Bernier, a priest called Carolingians, called Rome, when a fellow mate is killed in a situation where the Archbishop Bishop is curious. Meeting with Father Thomas (also with the Order and the great game played by the Marks Addy), they tried to put together a riddle that fell behind the priest's premature death. <br /> <br /> Difficult questions are the sub-round that includes Mara Sinclair (played by Shannyn Sossamon) who has escaped from an institution that attempted to kill Alex during exorcism. Alex has feelings for Mara and for some reason does not know the audience, they travel together in Rome. <br /> <br /> The good night of Nary sleeps and Alex stands in front of William Eden (Benno FÃ¼rmann), who claims to be a century old Sin Eater. As they say, the sins are the ones who eat the sins of a dead person when the church does not do so, thus allowing them to enter heaven. William, like luck, is tired of healing life and expects Alex to take over his role and release him from his earthly responsibilities. Alex is reluctant, but after his new love for Mara's death, Alex is going to the ritual of his sins to save him and the transformation is over. Then Alex looks for his answers to many of his queries, while Father Thomas introduces his fellow researcher behind sending the authors of the Vatican plot. <br /> <br /> An instruction is not a terrible movie, but it's terribly boring. There were ridiculous special effects and no connection to any character. Even in the most dramatic scene - Alex's Dying on Mara - is light and blissful and leaves us in an emotional response to a few situations. Everyone seems to be talking so quietly and hostile that the flat lines and fragrant salts of the film could have been administered to keep me from trying to quickly catch up in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> So, Mr Helgeland, I ask you not to try it again. Share your vision with others and let those who are more experienced guide you in directions that are not so narrow and spontaneous. So far, there is nothing to indicate that you are able to do more than a failed grade. Two stars. <br /> <br />
