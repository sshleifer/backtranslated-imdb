Eleven "great" filmmakers, 11 pieces of garbage. Eleven-minute daily tedium, sophistry, condescension, self-indulgence. Treats people of all nations. Yussef Chahine from Egypt, which gives "hip hip hooray!" for terrorism in your amateur segment. On the green line, we have Israeli Amos Gitai, who uses his eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and concentrates on a jerky newspaper. Mexican Alejandro González Iñárritu focused on twin towers, but it seemed he forgot to turn on his camera. Sean Penn didn't know 9-11 in the shade of the mall. Shohei Imamura ignoring all of Japan. Claude Lelouch focuses on trivial and cliché love. Ken Loach from the UK, focusing on Chile. Etc, etc.
