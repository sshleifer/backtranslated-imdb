Strange people live in the city. There's a predator guy who licks everything, a trash diver who finds the body he lives to live with him, a crazy girl dressed like his boyfriend, a man who wants to clean girls out of his evil ways ... white film color better. A monochrome tends to be two steps up in the sense of home video. Like the Troma movie, this movie is fun and starts, but mostly it is weird and soon it will crash because one can see the equipment you can think of where it will take a lot of time, not always - but enough to make it fun. (Although I didn't see the cleaning coming). It is worth shooting if there is nothing else to look at and waiting for the next set of Golden Girls from Netflix.
