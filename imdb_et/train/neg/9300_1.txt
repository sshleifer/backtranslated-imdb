Spoiler Alert Well I think this movie is probably the worst movie. Apparently in Ed Wood style (without heart). The flash is terrible. The music is very bad (piano and orgue ... come!). Acting ... well not working! <br /> <br /> There's a guy who actually goes to the tree to look for his missing woman and take some time to have sex with strangers. <br /> <br /> The killer is a greasy, uneven clown that could not migrate out of the turtle. <br /> <br /> Each cast leader is stupid and the director put all slashes in the movies without any effort. <br /> <br /> The end is still the most foolish thing. Think about it: The boy (ken hebert), acting skilfully, is the same as his writing (he is the brain of this flop), inviting a coworker and two of his friends over the weekend and killing them. .. On Monday morning he goes back to the office as nothing happens. The tragedy is that Mr.Hebert is trying to believe that this is a family thing that continues to the generation (his uncle is a clown killer). <br /> <br /> So, of course, the police will not ask him after his coworker disappears ... <br /> <br /> WHATEVER. <br /> <br />
