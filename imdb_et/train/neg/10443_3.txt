I saw the screening of this movie early in New York and I, along with my friends and a lot of audiences, were very disappointed. The film was not so bad that it was good; it was as inanimate as the snake bite. Samual L. Jackson seemed surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake's effect was flat. It reminded me of one of these creepy Sci films, except the fun of this movie was not funny or even comby. It all seemed worn, flat and open. I'm shocked to say that I think Anaconda was more fun. It is easy to understand that SOAP understands that it is a s * this piece and plays with it, but what a movie does not have is a script that has no tension in fear. This is the worst flat film: it's a joy.
