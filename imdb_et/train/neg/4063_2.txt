Fate in Kine is one very good scene. The head character gets an argument with another woman, and after threatening Faat Kine sprays her face. The scene works because it is so unexpected, weird and pretty funny. In this case, the writer / director Ousmane Sembene will give the audience a character that is easy to root, an interesting film character that would be desirable to watch for two hours. In the scene, she presents a brave woman who is courageous in her actions. For the rest of the film, the only other thing he seems to present is contradictory tones. <br /> <br /> Tone is all over the place. It is true that not all films have to be within a particular genre, but I don't think Faat Kine fits into every genre. Allegedly, this is a drama, although such wide comedy moments (the aforementioned spraying face) cannot be taken seriously. On the other hand, the film is certainly not a comedy with a wealth of serious subjects. Comedy and drama can be successfully mixed. Unfortunately, Semebene does not find this balance. Instead, one scene after another just drifts each other without much rhyme or reason, leaving two different shades of hanging breeze. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fate Kine also has the problem of running a two-hour long and extremely drawn finale. The movie ends with a big party, where all sign conflicts are resolved, but they are not resolved quickly. The scene lasts longer than any other scene that probably takes twenty minutes. Since the rest of the scenes have been curved up to this point, the finals are especially difficult to replay, starting with the beginning of the scene, resulting in a frustrating spectacle experience. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too heavy for Faat Kine. I'm not the right audience for that. I didn't know anything about the characters and I had no connection with any part of the story. There are people who probably find something important in hope and see strong signs. But I couldn't do that and so I can't recommend it.
