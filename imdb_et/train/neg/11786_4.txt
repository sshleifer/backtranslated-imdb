There were big episodes in the show, not one of them. It's not a terrible episode, it's just hard to follow "Man Who Was Death.", "Everything Through The House" and "Dig That Cat, He's Really gone." <br /> <br /> This episode is from a couple who is just married to Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you will find out that Charles married only for money. Two go to their honeymoon and their car breaks down through dirt and they have to seek refuge in the old seal home. Charles will soon discover the secret of the Peggy family ... <br /> <br /> I think you should watch this episode, but just don't expect the same feeling as the rest of the season in the first season.
