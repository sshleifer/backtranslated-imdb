This film was made by a bunch of white boys who went to school together. Well, there's nothing wrong with it except it looks like it's made of white boys who went to school together. 90 percent cast in white males about the same age. It's almost like watching a bunch of boys in a boys camp who turned to the camera. There is no plot on the film. It repeats the same blood sample in the blood bath. There are funny scenes and comedy bits. But they do not redeem apartment monotony. <br /> <br /> Graphic scenes are used to cover things that were clearly outside your budget or resources, and not very well. Everything you can't do with white boys running on a blood-covered beach is done with cheap animations. <br /> <br /> I went to watch this movie after seeing the trailer, making it like a piece of Tarrentino. Well, trailer scenes are as good as ever. The rest of the time just repeats the same everyday, manly comedy. It works from time to time, but after one and the same thing comes over and over again, it's boring. It's more like a Satuday Night Live skit than a movie. It's an amazing comedy. I see where the story is interesting. But in this movie post apocalyptic America is much like Medevil England. In fact, Wheatlry says the story idea came from this era. He's going to do part 2. I think he thinks he's Tarrentino or maybe he's making a parody. <br /> <br /> When opened in LA, Wheatley mentioned that he was returning much of the same part of Part 2. He asked if he could consider a more diverse casting, which he replied to, yes, yes.
