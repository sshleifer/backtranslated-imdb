Underground Comedy Movie is probably the worst train wreck I've seen. Luckily, I didn't pay for this movie and my friend reluctantly agrees to look at it again to put it so terrible, but he had to prove to me how terrible it was. I love color comedy. I thought at least it would be and I would be entertained. No, instead of acting so terrible, "jokes" were extremely cheesy and no plot was found. Maybe it didn't have to be a plot, so I can't hold that movie. It's pretty sad if the funny thing about comedy is an old woman with a head-on bat ..... Batman ... A man dressed in baseball. Fun. Just a genius. I felt like watching the movie that its creators did and laughed hysterically with their friends. Maybe it was full of jokes that we just didn't understand. Or perhaps it is the worst trash ever made, and it should be stocked and stayed in the Arctic Ocean. <br /> <br /> P.S. Don't buy this movie!
