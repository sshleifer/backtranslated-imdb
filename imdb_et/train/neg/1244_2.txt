This is a little bit for me the first time I've ever been disappointed with Tim Burton's movie. POTA is not a bad movie (big sets, costumes, and strange performance), but it could have been made by any Hollywood director outside the shelf. Stimulation was very strange, the last third was spent just when the movie was finished, by me and myself. Tim Roth was great, probably the only joy in the movie. Come back to Tim.
