I'm not a big Star Trek fan, but I was expecting it. I was interested in the company's pre-hype descriptions, its narrow-submarine style, and rugged-blade technology compared to the Treks we're used to. <br /> <br /> I didn't see anything interesting about this pilot. I found the plot difficult and confusing. <br /> <br /> I admit that I liked the formation of a character - the portrayal of people "as a kind of adolescent who is ready to grow their tumors." <br /> <br /> And that Vulcan babe had one incredible shelf in hell. <br /> <br /> But I don't think I'm going to this series. <br /> 3/10
