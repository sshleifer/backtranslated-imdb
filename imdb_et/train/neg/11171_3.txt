Very many movies from time to time - extremely long sequences without dialogue, bad setbacks, and almost entirely male cast. The two women who appear appear to have less than 10 lines in total and exist only for men as romantic interests. <br /> <br /> O'Toole is riveting when he speaks; unfortunately, he spends a lot of time in his time getting busy. Alastair Sims is always happy to see, but he is also terribly underestimated. <br /> <br /> The film has another positive aspect as it represents many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathies (such as the occasional appearance of Mosley graffiti) that many people today do not know. Too many modern world wars concerning World War II paint the Allies as good and axes as all evil, when history says people are much more complicated about it! <br /> <br /> This would be a good movie if it is you recovering from the flu and comes with a couch and can't absorb anything too complicated. If you need time to stabilize the electrolyte, it's a film for you.
