Liongate has not yet proved itself. Every Lionsgate movie has been sad. I've tried and tried to offer them more opportunities and they just tried to go again and again. And Cabin Fever is definitely no exception. <br /> <br /> I could no longer pay attention to this film that was so depressing and bad. <br /> <br /> Here is a plot. Guy cuts the dead dog for some reason. Get infected with a random virus, pass it on to the kids in the camp, the kids get infected and die, the city finds out about it and doesn't help kill them. then the water is infected and everyone dies. Seriously, this is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> All the characters are fully slowed down, you don't care about them, and one child should have stuck in the boy meets the world. I and my friend found that we were talking about how fat and bitchy one of our classmates had to be much more enjoyable than attention to this film. We managed to finish it when screaming bulls $ @ t, because this movie does it for you. <br /> <br /> And I'm still confused by moving the random slow motion karate into one casual boy and probably all have lived in the country completely and slowly. And again, why did this dog attack a girl? why does the boy he was trying to kill sit in a chair waiting for them to kill him? what was part of these two plans? wow. the best plan. I can't believe that this movie has a theatrical release. I can barely smash a DVD into the stomach, let alone sit in a theater that doesn't move for an hour and a half. It was neither scary nor funny nor cool nor anything else. it's just 90 minutes of waste that you could use ... I don't know if I'm planting wood or anything. it is more productive than this garbage. Functional, special effects and script are a joke. Don't ever choose it. <br /> <br /> Fever gets in 10 out of 10
