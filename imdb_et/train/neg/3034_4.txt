This movie has big adult stars, but it doesn't interest you in an adult movie. Of all the stars, you didn't get any beats from any scene. The movie is allowed to dream like a middle age that is embarrassingly cheesy. Action is worse than Keanu Reeves, sex scenes are as exciting as listening to your neighbor from your child in college and dialogue is worse than I've seen in the movie. The plot was also worse ten times. I'm stuck with amateur tea. The voice comment was useless because it is a slip of the skin, but even then it was bad. If your Jenna Jameson fan is little here. 4/10
