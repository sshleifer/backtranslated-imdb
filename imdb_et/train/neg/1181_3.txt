this film was covered with a scandal so long that it became a very desirable element ... resentment, mystery, etc. that had everything that was a great cinematic art, but eventually fails in every sense. this is a terribly bad comedy, pathetic horror movie, flat erotic movie. more than a pretentious director. For those who have heard of it but have never seen it, the package looks fantastic until the movie actually looks. Disc 1 contains an edited movie that is poorly translated into English but with good visual quality. plate 2 contains the director's paragraph in a terrible broadcast in French. <br /> <br /> What can I say about the actual beast? The creased doll is a frog that would have been more effective and shocking.
