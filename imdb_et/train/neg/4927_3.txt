Lois Weber, a self-proclaimed missionary through the cinema, wrote, directed, and produced other films on controversial topics, but this may be the first to be widely watched by TCM. This film is his accusation of abortion, but confused in confusion creates eugenics and contraception, giving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion. Here's her talent in writing and other cinematic skills, but she can be forgiven if she had used them less didactically.

This is enjoyable even if you don't know propaganda.
