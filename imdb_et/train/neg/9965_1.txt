WARNING! SMALL SMALL DATA OVERVIEW! <br /> <br /> I find almost nothing positive about this movie. It is so badly written that every character is a caricature, but it seems that he takes himself seriously. It is badly cast, especially Ralph Macchio (all the baby-facing, 5-foot-nothing) street. The elements of the plot are all drawn in black and white, all the situations almost immediately becoming extreme peaks. <br /> <br /> The most amazing (PLOT-element to be viewed) is probably the most free and viable nude scene in the semi-critical film history. You can just imagine the filmmakers who say, "We need JoBeth to let his top ... hmmm ... I have it! ... the movie early, we give Nick a ridiculous dialogue to prevent himself in the corridor ... JoBeth will be able to use this line later and will actually be in the corridor ... yes, it's a ticket! "<br /> <br /> I give credit to manufacturers for a weighty issue in 1984, one that turned out to be overweight in the late 90s like Columbine. But filling is terrible. This film could have been in the dark comedy "Heathers", a matured political statement like "Network" or a serious exam like "Brubaker". Instead, it is trying to be all these things - and none of these things will come. "Teachers" receive F.
