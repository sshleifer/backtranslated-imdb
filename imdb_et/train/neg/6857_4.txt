This "screwed comedy" seems very forced. Indeed, actresses VERY hard to behave from the script. And as a result, it doesn't really go anywhere. The idea that a woman discovered she was pregnant after divorce is not just that funny. And when Cooper sleeps with the baby because he doesn't want it to be adopted, it looks terribly uncomfortable and it's really hard to turn it into a comedy. It is also a shame, because the actors were more capable of the script and I found myself just a bit of a mess. Given that Cooper did so many good comedies, I suggest you see them.
