First of all, I would like to tell you that I am a comic, anime, animation and such things. It is true that everyone has their own preferences, but you can trust this movie. I'm objective. Getting Started Story - It's OK. Follow the line of comic books as far as I'm familiar with them. But animation ... Well, it's not really terrible, but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be much better if they did not try to imitate anime style and stick to the original comic books. If we pretend that we do not see rare spill-over effects like fire and lightning, it could be said that the film was made about 10 years ago and even more. Looks a bit like the original Vampire Hunter in 1985 D. See, for example, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks much better! In addition, the voice talents do not make anything significant, music is nothing special. So at all - it has no atmosphere. I watched it, but I can't say I really enjoyed it. It just won't hit you. There's a lot of blood and violence, but it doesn't affect me at all. Perhaps it is shocking if no one has ever looked at more mature orientated animations and sees for the first time animated blood (is anyone?), But I don't think this is the audience of this movie. So they could add some nudity and spice to it. The chicks around Lucifer were pretty tasty and hell, we are Lady Death! There's a little sexy look, but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music, it seems to look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. All in all, the movie is not so bad, but if you want to do something better, maybe use the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, Ralph Bakshi Fire and Ice or Wizards. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
