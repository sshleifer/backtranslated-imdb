I saw it recently and I have to say that the story of the factual basis referred to me. But "Holly" as the film didn't work quite well. However, I look forward to watching the documentary that the organizers of this project did, because I think it would be a lot more expensive for the film. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> Class actors, but their action was relevant, and I must pay special attention to the young actor who played Holly. It was her first film role and she did a very nice job, considering she was the most difficult part. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingston was enough but sharp as Patrick, an American whose quest to save Holly, but Chris Penn was in his final role. Unfortunately, despite most of the favorable opinions of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier, both actors were very forgetful and did not do the best work in this film. <br /> <br /> I believe in the message and will of the movie, but I have to be honest, so I appreciate "Holly" 3 stars based on the shortcomings of the movie. But I think the subject is worthy of serious consideration and I am glad that the people behind this film have also made a documentary, which I hope will be a debut on the BBC and other television networks.
