2 stars and I'm generous. (small spoilers) Look, this is a low budget zombie film, located in the Oakland gangland. When the plot goes, the scientist wants to bring his dead brother to life after he was killed in a car ride. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie: what are zombies?! All "zombies" are crumbling (which doesn't sound even far from scary) and drips fake red blood from your mouth! There are no frightening eyes, no decaying flesh, but a number of people who are mercilessly sad and run like idiots. <br /> <br /> Kate is also misleading. There are only about 6 zombies in the whole movie, so it's not like the whole "hood" of zombies or something, it's just a few, and it doesn't include time. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's so bad that it's fun. No one can act at all in this film (except maybe one of the gang members) and it really looks like a bunch of friends who decided to put together their family and made one weekend movie. <br /> <br /> Final Note: Because Doctors Wear Sportswear?! Leave it, please!
