This movie is even a big step down from Bollywood's usual ticket price. The performances were terrible. Even Boman Iran, who always succeeds in shining, is completely OTT as a villain. Music is not memorable either. And despite a lot of trying, female leaders can't be "sexy". Vivek Oberoi is capable of much better projects, while Fardeen Khan is now at a similar price. But this monstrosity is even an actor under his limited ability. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are terribly written in clich√© roles. It's time for Indra Kumar to hang his driver hat. I hope he will not lead such a second eye. The future of Hindi films is now in better hands. All in all, stay away from celluloid waste.
