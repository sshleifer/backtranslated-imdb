This early Pia Zadora vehicle followed the familiar Harold Robbins formula: an ambitious headline slides in decadence, while at the same time following the path to a randomly selected but glamorous world, in this case the film industry. However, despite the fact that this film is completely predictable, this film is at the same time incredible. Zadora (calling him an inexperienced actor to be a charity) is never convinced as a screenwriter. It can be assumed that a film about making a film gives an overview of its industry and creative process. However, the script does not give it any qualities that change the characters that are interesting to writers: adherence, word skills, love-hate relationship with their creative abilities. His character is as big as a donut hole. And that's just the incompetence of taste here. Cinematography is so acute that sometimes it is difficult to see what is happening. And the scenes don't really talk together, so everything seems to be a sequential random moment in bad Hollywood parties. Avoid.
