I can't say much about this movie. I think it speaks for itself (as well as current ratings here). I rented it about two years ago and I completely regretted it. I even tried / liked it twice, but I just couldn't. I can say for sure that I have never wanted to ever see this waste of time. And I'm not one of the movie trash bin, but I believe it was terrible. It wasn't even the most funny. The only bit I enjoyed was the few scenes with Christopher Walken. I think this movie destroyed me for Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. All I think when I see one of their films is now-a-day, it's a terrible movie and it reminds me I don't waste my money. Amy Poehler is so very annoying too. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think you're thinking. The stars are otherwise for Walken.
