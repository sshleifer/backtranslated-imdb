Although it was a television production, there is no excuse for the bottom product of the final product. This movie DID is a budget and it was a casting department, so if you make a movie about a true biography and actually put the title "true story", some effort should not try to try and realize some realism? First, this film is absurdly cast. These actors belong to the daily television soaps or to those ridiculous live channel films, not to the real gangster / criminal case. All of them, from their point of view to their hopes, are just screaming from the 90's shopping-bottom-rock listening generation. What about the script? Two words describe it - stupid and offensive, and again it's 90-fold sounding. I don't think the actual Clyde Barrow would ever say, "I'm out here." It would be like "New Kids on the Block" fans joined together and decided to really make "kewl flick" for Bonnie and Clyde, which would be rad and rock. Well, this sticker is not even on the rad and rockin 'scale. Everything that may be wrong with any film is here in pain, casting, editing and music. Every thing is extremely wrong .... and it is a disgrace that those responsible for this cruel turkey were nervous to put the title "true story". This is certainly not a real story, but even worse, it is not even far from entertaining as a meaningless popcorn that has been adopted. As I pointed out in my section, it's just horizontal for words, at every possible level. Trust me on this or look at your own risk.
