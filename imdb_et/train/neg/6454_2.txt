Enemy Mine's monster somehow made a small mountain community where he had settled. He has hunted by a female doctor-turned vigilant who destroys her. This female assassin who looks like a refugee from Motley Crue's video rides around a motorcycle and tries to rescue a bunch of kids who have decided that Big Chill's right skull is in the middle of the fucking weekend. Decapitations and lots of blood are primarily in place to draw attention to the story that goes along the bad version of Dr. Moreau Island (and yes, it is worse than Val Kilmer).
