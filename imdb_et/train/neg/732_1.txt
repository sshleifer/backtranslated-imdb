Young boy sees his mother killing and dad hanging. Twenty years later, he gets a bunch of friends to make himself exorcist so he doesn't come out like his father. All stock characters are in place: nice pair; a funny man; harsh (but sensitive) hood; a smart girl (wearing glasses - that's how we know); nerd and two personless blondes. It all includes some stupid wooden shapes that live (don't ask) and kill people. I knew I was in trouble when we jumped 20 years later after a big opening - all the bad horror movies do it! <br /> <br /> Dialogue is cruel, acting bad (except Betsy Palmer - why Betsy?) and killings are stupid and / or unimaginable. My favorite scene is when two people are supposed to have sex and the shape strikes the boy out of bed to show that he is fully dressed! A real bad, stupid inconsistent horror movie. Avoid at all costs.
