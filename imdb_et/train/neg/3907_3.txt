I'm glad I rented this movie for one reason: its shortcomings made me read Allende's book and get the whole story. <br /> <br /> Pros: The film is beautiful, the period is well and consistently (according to my knowledge) and Meryl and Glenn are doing good jobs. <br /> <br /> Cons: This is the worst action ever seen by Jeremy Irons - I thought something was wrong with his mouth. (And I hate the English language terribly, as he says "Transito.") Winona Ryder does nothing plausible except young and idealistic. Most of the other performances are OK, but so few things hang on the character's curve and in the relationships I was disappointed and angry with before the end. <br /> <br /> I'm very curious as to whether this movie is typical of Bille August's work. Maybe you have to take a few pairs of bucks to rent Smilla's snow.
