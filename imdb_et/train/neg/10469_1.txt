Yes, I testify that I called during this movie. It was such an incredible disappointment that I couldn't help but cry. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) has done this again. First of all, Million Dollar Man (a former professional wrestler) in your program and now. <br /> <br /> The Omega code follows the flow of sketchy religious movies. It was a lot of fun, but at the same time it was annoying to find the Bible inaccurate. The film follows what is called the "Bible Code", not the actual Bible scripture. This movie is extremely bad; writing it until it is headed for its fun-filled action. It is frustrating that people really struggled with this film. It seemed to me more like a late night movie that anyone would watch on a US channel or directly from home video rather than a movie release movie. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie even if your life depended on it.
