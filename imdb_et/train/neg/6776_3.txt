I wanted to love this movie. How could I not love it? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; all the icons in their own way. However, the train wreck, which was Suzy Parker, destroyed all my experience. His behavior was so terrible that I was sitting where my jaw was open and didn't believe my eyes or ears. I can barely do it through one look, that is how ugly it is in it. <br /> <br /> Cary? Gorgeous and exquisite dramatic form. Jayne? Cute, loving and probably a ball. Supporting cast succeeds and the city of San Francisco is busy with all of its drug-like, retro elegance. just don't believe it. Who told this creature that he could be an ACT? Oy VEY, people.
