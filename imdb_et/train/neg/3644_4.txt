This movie is pretty bad. Operation is exhausting and completely forced. Besides, when a movie is taken as a docudrama, it may not be more plausible, you just can't get out of it. However, don't let my comments mislead you, because I would recommend watching this movie because it sheds light on the psychology behind those crimes or on non-existent psychology. But the climax of the movie is absolutely garbage! There is no other way to put it! It's clean and just doesn't take the atmosphere. What is happening does not change the feelings of despair, panic, fear or fear that would surely occur in such terrible situations. Instead, it leaves you with the jaws falling "Was it?!" they have fled out of your language and their boys' activities are not at all haunting. Rather, you feel embarrassed with yet another potential film, but it became the most important point on your face. Zero Day really .... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
