This movie is one of the most unintentionally bad movies. Dolph Friggin 'Lundren, a Japanese accent, is funny enough, but add to the mix, eccentric and top-the-inin, clicked on love for interest, and for the worst end of all time, a really horny friend-friend. you have very few suicide drugs for people who enjoy their lives and had never exploded until they saw "Showdown". <br /> <br /> I don't know if it's just me, but the whole homosexual subtext is not too subtle. Men's genital organs are also constantly referred to, not females. Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about each other's masculine parts and actually before they smoke, Brandon says to Dolphy: "If we don't, I'd like to tell you that you have the biggest d --- I've ever seen." <br /> < br /> Is this what a normal man would say to another man? No less in the ACTION movie? And would you like them to be your words? <br /> <br /> Later this is a pearl: <br /> <br /> Dolph (for a cable): "I'd like to cut some parts of his anatomy." <br /> <br /> As a man in RuthlessReviews.com said, "Unfortunately, Dolph doesn't respond," I have a fix? I have a fixation?! You are the one who decided that his last words should be from my private! I just started my ears and nose, man. "<br /> <br /> It's relentless foolish stuff and fun if you are someone who enjoys root channels of unlicensed dentists without a novocain. It's about a lot of fun for the whole family!
