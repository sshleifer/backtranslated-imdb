This exhibition is probably the biggest, toughest, most common steam phase I've seen in children's programming, which is actually a success. The driver, Johnny, although I realize he should represent a normal child, is neither pleasant nor acceptable. Jokes are flat, overdone (ie "Whoa! Didn't see that come" gag. Come on, it wasn't even funny for the first time. And finally ... it's just ugly to look at. Although kids aren't particularly critical of artistic talent, prefer they can still show candy. I can't show the show because in some ways the style of art is just ... big. Hidden, actually. Just skinny. <br /> <br /> I just can't stand that it takes so much time Although I understand that nostalgia may be a bit irrational and I should not get my hopes back to it, bring back the Dexter Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls ... something other than this. <br /> <br /> Simply put, I suggest that you don't waste your time with this show, and I believe that big kids can also enjoy really good cartoons.
