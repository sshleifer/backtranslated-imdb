This is one of the worst cases I've seen for a long time. It's so terrible that I'm not sure where to start, or even if it's worth it. The plot is a real problem and I am sorry for Sly because he puts his participation in a good result. But this plot ... Oh dear oh dear. I especially love the nearby road if he manages to reach the top of the hill while the helicopter is on the way. Climbing a day or two will take him all five minutes! I could go on, but it's not worth it. In addition to opening up to birth (which even five years old would be able to predict), the rest are a bit. Sorry people, but it's just as bad as making a movie.
