The brands die on the altar and their bodies disappear. No one knows why or who, but the investigative reporter (Luana Walters) notes that every bride wore strange orchids and she goes to interview with its creator, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now, Dr. Lorenz is a crazy scientist with some strange habits, including sleeping in the coffin and injecting his older wife (Elizabeth Russell) with the bride's fluid to keep her young. <br /> <br /> Corpse Vanishes has an interesting premise and a short enough time that she can't be bored. Unfortunately, it will start quite well, but it will start to drift before the half point and get bored with your clich√©s and predicted plot. <br /> <br /> There's something good about that - Bela Lugos is charming and evil and performs great; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, loose, remote and very scary county; and I am always a fan of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters is also convincing as a reporter here. <br /> <br /> He keeps a little gothic atmosphere and the kits are decent. <br /> <br /> But in general, it couldn't keep my interest through the whole picture, and that's why I have to evaluate it badly.
