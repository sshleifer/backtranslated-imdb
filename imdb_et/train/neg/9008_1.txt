There have been many unfamiliar movies or movies that have really been missed by a bad review. It wasn't one of them. <br /> <br /> It was superfluous and used a camera technique that made me feel like I was watching a soap opera. It was ridiculously predictable and took most of the movie to go, so I left you asking "is that?". If I decided not to take the movie too seriously and look at it from a purely horrible point of view, it became more enjoyable. This is one movie that would have finished with MST3000 if it were still there.
