An interesting addition to the nlash cycle that dominated the 1980s with the Horror genre. It was filmed as a Pranks, but released as a Dorm, which dropped blood, an obvious theft from the 1970's horror anthology House of Dripped Blood. The only recognizable face with Daphne Zun has been the first horror film (she has also appeared on the initiative and on flight II).
