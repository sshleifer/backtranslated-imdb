Very silly film, full of stupid one-liner and Jewish references. It was a serious movie, but it couldn't be taken seriously. Familiar movie ... Being in the wrong place at the wrong time. A scary sub-block that includes Kim Bassinger. Very robotic and too tough. I've noticed that the capabilities of Al Pacina seem to be downhill. Problem solving, but nothing else worries than Pacino's terrible Atlanta accent. Checking for damage must correct the damage to the film. OK my lining is bad but not as bad as this movie. This film can not only be boring but also nasty. Usually, the lime film is traced for lying reasons. This movie is invisible. I could sit through it. The plot, if it were written then a little better, maybe with a somewhat better effect and eliminating the terrible sub-block, and even dumber jokes, could have pulled this thriller out. What we have left is a boring, silly film that made it to be drilled in our heads that Eli Wurman was a Jew. Embarrassing to all good Jewish people everywhere.
