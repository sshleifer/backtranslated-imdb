It was nice to see that some of my 30-year-old favorite stars were John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked pretty wonderful. But it was so. They were not given any signs or good signs. I didn't understand or care about what the characters did. <br /> <br /> Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick sections. They showed some talent and are sad that they didn't stay in the movies anymore and better. Unfortunately, I did not think that Dorothy Stratten had the opportunity to act in this only important film role. <br /> <br /> The film probably has some fans and I was very open when I started watching it. I'm a big fan of Peter Bogdanovich and I enjoyed his latest film "Cat's Meow" and all his earlier films "Targets" to "Nickleodeon". So I was really surprised to keep it awake. <br /> <br /> It is ironic that this movie is linked to a detective office where detective and customer interact with each other in a romantic way. Five years later, in Bogdanovich's former girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a TV series "Moonlighting" that stole Bogdanovich's story. Of course, it was a big difference that the series was based on a ton of funny dialogue, while it was trying to make small lines and a few lines of screws. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This is not a "Paper Moon" and only a very pale version of "What Up, Doc".
