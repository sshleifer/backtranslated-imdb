The Inside Man talks about the inducing, snail-pounding disappointment of a detective (Denzel Washington) who is being investigated for his possible involvement in lost money. If the bank has been kidnapped and hostages (Clive Owen) and his team are holding hostages against the hostage, is the detective determined to force the thief to steal? his one proved that he was innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) who has her secrets and intentions sent to the bank's owner to return the deposit box that has been deposited in the bank, and you have a pretty triple dilemma. Unfortunately, everything you can set up in the movie doesn't end there. Denzel Washington is the most interesting in terms of inefficient and uneven performance. The only sustainable grace of the film is its competent co-stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who are much better than the film itself. In fact, Jodie Foster offers the most surprising and superior level of performance that plays against a type like a ruthless, fucking villain. Clive Owen is not given much to do with the animal and to pose, but the depth of his presence and the actuality he has achieved more than his underdeveloped role. It's strange that this film, which has little effect or interest, is wasting so much talent. You have to think about what Director Spike Lee was thinking about creating this movie. But the most amazing aspect of Inside Man is how much unjustified praise has been. For a movie that seemed to be summer blocking, it's terribly flat.
