I tried to watch this movie three times. At night, where I rented it. I went about 20 minutes hoping it would be better if I had a night rest. The next day, 15 were watching, almost vomiting, how stupid it was ... It wasn't even a funny fool, sometimes a fun movie to watch, but this movie was just capital S (if you know what I mean censored) the world we live in). And finally, on the third day, I looked over for an hour for stupidity and I didn't enjoy any moments! Not even one. How this script became green. Oh boy! <br /> <br /> G <br /> <br /> 1/10 - One is for cheerleaders ... they deserve at least something for their hard work.
