Lady in Cement - Plundering PI at Blue Eyes.Frank Sinatra is Miami's rare funny "comedy" houseboat. a little too funny to be on TV for TV movie status. The blocker is effective in Mike Mazurski / Ted De Corsia's big game and Raquel Welch should thank his personal trainer. The only thing that makes DVD value retention or sight worth is the collection of cheesy trailers with Welch flicks like Bandolero, Fantastic Voyage, Mom, Jugs and Speed ​​and Myra Breckinridge. Even if you get a DVD between the predictable movie and go to the trailer library for special features. In addition, tons of mysoginistic asides- Sinatra lisps @ local Go-Go bar homosexual owners. Relic to be put back in the time capsule. D
