When in Rome there is definite progress on entry. Getting there I found it too predictable, viable and slow, and I still find it to be the worst of the Olsen twins. But if Rome is not a terrible movie, it's not great either. If I had to write one word, I would say it is satisfactory. It's fun for young people, but I don't think adults can go much further. <br /> <br /> If you have good points in Rome. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are actually pretty decent actors, certainly very beautiful. I admit, when I was 10 years old, and I really liked them and generally I like them. And I've enjoyed some of their movies like Passport Paris and New York Minutes. Back to the target, both girls do not do the job badly, in fact they are very tempting. Plus their equipment is to die for and the Roman landscape is absolutely breathtaking. Music is also not half-bad. <br /> <br /> But when you shoot a movie, it's a schema and script. The script is mostly clich√©s and has clues to deja vu. The plot, like most of Mary Kate's and Ashley's films, is very predictable, and someone who knows some of the other Olsen twins finds some rather insignificant elements in it. Most characters are thin, and you don't know much about them, and sometimes the pace is uneven. Unfortunately, the amazing terrain has been spoiled rather slapdash camera work that seemed rushed constantly. <br /> <br /> To sum up, have your good points and be sure to follow. But for my taste it is harmless and predictable for teenage fluff. 4/10 Bethany Cox
