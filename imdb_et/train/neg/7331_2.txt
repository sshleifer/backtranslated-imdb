this movie was clearly bad and hurried. I understand that financing such a movie is difficult. However, if the plot had some sort of original substance, someone would have seen that it had the necessary funding, it was not, and such films are not necessary and have no purpose in the existing one. The plot of this movie has been made and done better, many times before. There is no reason to make a movie that has no chance of competing with other people. my computer informed me that I need at least ten lines to submit my comments so the following lines are empty to fill the space. I think there is nothing else to say about this movie. What I said is a lot and if you waste enough time reading this review than for God, don't waste more watching this movie. The only exception is if you are a person who likes watching crappy movies played on the watch entertainment network from 2.00.
