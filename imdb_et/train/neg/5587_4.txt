In addition to his "Tarzan" series, the fruitful Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote many other books, although only a few of them have been filmed in addition to the popular "Earth Core". The exception is the novel entitled "Ladi and Lion", which was screened as "Lion Man" (1936), an outrageous, static, old hat, slow moving and quite boring film, despite being filmed in real desert places. In fact, "film" is the wrong word. The narrative does not move, but continues at a snail's pace in steep nervous series. For example, at least five characters are given for exactly opening scenes and then simply disappear. For even more frustrating film fans, those characters are impressive (like a bitch who comforts Hall with stunned wine) but are set by players who are not credited! The credited thespians generally come worse than the unknown. An exception is the Australian actor Finis Barton, who gives a good overview of the abducted Harem girl who saves the young master. It is true that most of the cast is in dialogue with the devil king James, which must be heard to believe! But this way of playing garbage is a tongue-in-cheek, a betting that doesn't seem to have happened on a single movie list with no talented players. Perhaps the director was J.P. McCarthy's the idea. In any case, it is sad to see that Kathleen Burke is forced to deal with lines similar to Richard Carlyle (his father) and Jon Hall (his smoke). It is true that Mr Hall will convey his lines somewhat convincingly, like Mr Carly, but that is not a recommendation.
