Sam should never be allowed to touch the camera again. If he does, he should be arrested on the spot ... at least for the little ones. Anyone who pays even a dime for renting their garbage should file a claim and reimburse. It was innocently watching my "work" first ... and that's my last one. Ed Wood now looks awfully good to me. <br /> <br /> If I return this lace back to the video store, I personally ask you to take it off the shelf. An active supporter of Homo Cinema, I'm exhausted and angry that this twisted, extremely unattractive man-child promises to share and pack something like this, with a pretty boy on the cover (Jamie Brett Gabel, who luckily doesn't have other acting credits in IMDb) and interesting a summary on the back that is used as a feed, and then market it as a "movie" rent. Trust me, it's not somewhere on the shelf; it's not just a movie in some sense. Attacking, irresponsible junk, like this, can only damage the efforts made to promote and support gay cinema (hell, gay rights in general!). For those who suffer from this, you must be disappointed. Gabel is not that strange to look at the film when she is on the cover, and she appears once or twice without a shirt - that's it. Instead, Mroavich at home makes us nudge about his nasty, sorry-looking dough boy. <br /> <br /> The "thing" he "put together" is a vanity project reversed by Movovich. He and his friend Michael Habousch (who, I understand, put out similar slippery rubbish) are terrible in this regard. Moravian is a purposeful perfect talent (in all areas), desperate to grab the attention of any "loser" that he receives for himself. He must be bad.
