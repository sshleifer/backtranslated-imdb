I bought this movie from a DVD to get a Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode. Fortunately, Mike, Crow and Tom Servo are traceable because the film itself is not. Although there is a plot, a story that can be tracked, and some actors who can act are nothing else. The film was so boring, I have firmly confirmed that I will never follow it with Tom, Crow and Mike. As summarized above, it was better than the movie that was before the MST3K episode; Mitchell.
