Michael Jackson would have claimed a place for a top-notch character at GOLDEN CHILD and because he loves children. It didn't work (and why?), So we have Eddie Murphy to save the world from rescuing "Kid Midas". I strongly urge all future scriptwriters to thoroughly explore the actor's dialogue in this exotic fantasy - adventure comedy, which is a step closer to ISHTAR. Whatever Murphy says or can't do is best, but don't get me wrong with your fine comic talent; he doesn't belong to this movie and the same goes to DR. STOP! Violence and visual habits are the reason for defeating it as a cult chamber class, and it would not be sensible in any way, because Hollywood and film fanatics held it with the guy. Speaking of the visuals, they were struck off at an astonishingly good time during the presidential election of Ronald Reagan. Murphy is much better than getting to AMERIKA and 48 HRS, but this hidden film is not the touch of my golden honey for a sweet crispy taste.
