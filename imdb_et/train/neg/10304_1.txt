here, let me let your hands over the keyboard, I'll tell you what kind of salads he will order. time and again, works like a charm: he is such a genius, omg how he does it? my bull sensor freaks when I even get over this show, when I scan the channels, I have to be very careful (these days it is too often, so I don't need to break this idiotic mess like that ... careful with this remote!). should this be some fascist propaganda so that people would believe in some invisible ubermanic control and mastery? or what? why does it exist? <br /> <br /> This is the most ugly show, incredible and lively, and I don't understand why it's still in the air. so geeks can give a much better example of such a difficult time (Sarah Connor Chronicles, True Blood), but give it a pointless move. Shows as Firefly (if any) falls due to the season, but pointless things like what makes the logical idea zero will continue to march. nonsense.
