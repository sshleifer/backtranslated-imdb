Until then, Gentle Rain was the film I found in the worst of history. It has been replaced by "blocking" outside Asia. It's one "star" and it's John Rhys Davies. She comes out of the shape to be a bright, magical flying baddie she pours here. The rest of these people were unable to get out of high school. There were no clich√©s in the dialogue and special effects were called as often as possible. <br /> <br /> It is quite easy to see that someone in Asia had some bucks and needed to create a vehicle for some participants they wanted to throw money. Or maybe it was the director or writer who needed credit. My guess is that any career with this movie in his credentials <br /> <br /> Make a big difference and don't watch this movie. One hundred gratitude could not consume this turkey. <br /> <br /> One funny scene was involuntary. The King's brother appears on the scene. King? Beautiful, older, short Asian actress. (Bad actress.) Brother? Six feet of Europe. (Also a bad actor). They just waited for us not to notice that this poor man's Jet Li brother was a cheap dimestore "Injun" wannabe Pierce Brosnan from an old western film of the forties.
