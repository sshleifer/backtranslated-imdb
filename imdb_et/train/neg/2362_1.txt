The first series was great, easily one of the best Horror movies of all time. It's crappiest. When I sat watching it, I thought, how bad the fourth and fifth was that it would be good after the previous dread. The boy was wrong with me. Incredibly wrong. <br /> <br /> When I looked at it for the first ten minutes, I was actually tempted to turn it off, but I thought it wasn't, maybe it would improve. It wasn't just <br /> <br /> It's not just a movie, it doesn't need a second sequel, because the last two (fourth and fifth) were already terrible! You can also bring Freddy back several times!? It was TERRIBLE, the story was predictable and messy, and there were also some mistakes. The way they did Springwood was completely wrong. No respect for the first at all. To add this, the whole thing seemed really up. <br /> <br /> Some people say this movie was funny. This movie is not funny at all. When should Freddy Krueger be "funny"? I would call it awful. This movie should be a movie, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, would this information be similar to the first one? The end was just stupid and cheese, just like the rest. It completely destroys the first nature and uniqueness. Just showing yourself up. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Wes Craven at first did something so good, but it comes down to the trash bin. They shouldn't even have made that movie. No other order except the third. The third person is the only decent one of the descendants. <br /> <br /> If it was a DVD itself and not part of the Nightmare On Elm Street DVD set I got, I'd have done it when I got it. <br /> <br /> Summary: A pathetic and bad test sequel. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your first movie MOCKERY <br /> on this worthless spam.
