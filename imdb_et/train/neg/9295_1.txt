I was very surprised how bad this film was. Nice cinematography and beautiful landscapes can still take the film. I was hoping to repeat the hero, but it is much worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is the reason why kung fu films first got a bad reputation. There are no incredible signs (even in the comic world of kung fu films, these characters are ridiculous), virtually any plot of land and a ridiculous story twists. <br /> <br /> This movie is so boring and so depressing that it reminds you of trying to play against the child. Every time you think your foolish battle is somewhat meaningful, they invent another ridiculous twist that doesn't make sense ("Ah ha, you think you have my superpowers and 10,000 quick pistols, but I ate my plutonium sewn vitamins and teflon, so your rifles do not work and I am invulnerable to your superpowers .... touch touching when trade is supported by an infinite PLUS one. ") Children can continue this embarrassment because they don't care if anyone is listening because they have fun time. But for VIEWER, especially the adult viewer, this long film is worse than bad gas. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD Note for kung fu filmmakers (a) if you have your knife it hurts if you don't have PCP, in which case your kung fu is not strong, (b) if you repeatedly drop on the back with a knife, it is more damaging and more damaging if it is not a fake prop, (c) if you skinned in the heart with a knife, you die, especially in ancient China, where there is no Kaiser Permanente behind the corner, (d) kung fu fighting does not last for hours, while 3 feet fall and (e) is sometimes worth explaining to their characters and their motivation. <br /> <br /> In any case, go to somebody's hero, because at least in his own small world it is understandable.
