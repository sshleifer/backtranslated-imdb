The film is about two brothers who should be similar - but have not waited for them to be smart - one is a surgeon and others can write a computer code. Geniuses who want to name themselves, which sounds very exaggerated when compared to personal qualities, can perceive the title material. <br /> <br /> Honestly I didn't like the style of the movie. I believe that the anxiety, confusion and deep blues it brings are for this purpose, but what I can't do is why there is so much. The film is inexpensive on scenes and basically tells the story without any human aspect. It gives a comic book like experience. However, it is a visually numbered viewer, but it somehow brings a short dialogue, a monotonous scene, dynamic cutting, music and sudden noise inside. <br /> <br /> The movie's story is very simple, most of what's happening in the picture is dramatically long minutes, mostly confused in delirium, which simulates the effects of drug use and dynamic cuts. <br /> <br /> I publicly say that this movie didn't match my exhibits a little.
