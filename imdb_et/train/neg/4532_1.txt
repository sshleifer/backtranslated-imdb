My husband and we bought an old school DVD for Sesame Street for my daughter and I have to say I won't let her watch new episodes on television because I think all the characters are annoying. Baby Bear JA Telly? OMgosh, How can ANNOYING and useless blabber think about their "skits"? Elmo? Give her a vacation, not every child she likes, again tedious and doesn't teach my child anything. Mr. Noodle? what to reject. I think once I turned to him for a new show, and he and I were frightened as before. The exhibition has definitely taken the wrong course. I remember Yip Yips, Kermit's news, 1-2 2 Puppets, Mumford's magician, Bert and Ernia, Grover the Waiter, all SMALL SCHOOL SS Sesame Street's great educational sketches have suffered from boredom and stupidity by Jim Henson's passing in 1990. The exhibition no longer has educational, funny and interactive sketches. I find that the new versions are simply unbearably tedious and full of useless non-education. So does S.S. producers / writers that parents have one more cup to sit there for non-creative, unused children to get out of their hair. About Producers / Writers: I suggest old muppets and start getting similar content with the first Sesame Street. The Lord knows that I do not want my child to speak like a Baby Bear or Elmo.
