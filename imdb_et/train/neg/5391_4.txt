I hate the end of the world's movies the most. They show what imprisoned Hollywood people think of the rest of the world, and they clearly think we are a bunch of sadistic idiots (or at least that watching the sadistic idiots in response to things is somehow fun). I have repeatedly been to L.A, I have a family working at the exhibition, and I just want to say that these are the last * people we should look for to check the reality. Some catastrophic films paint at least a smart picture: Men's Children, 12 monkeys, but usually this message simply "people do something to survive, everything is dark and sad and determined, we should all be ashamed". <Br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, I like the story of an idea that explores the throwing of the social order system, and is trying to frighten people in front of horror, and I believe some people are acting like this film, but sadistic idiots I seriously doubt that society would simply separate from all people, it is just offensive.
