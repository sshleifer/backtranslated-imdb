The film was traceable while Nicolson was on the screen. However, I had to fight for boredom when the film depended on Meryl Streep to wear scenes without Jack; he was as happy as it would be. The relationship between the symbols was nothing special; these characters have been depicted earlier - and much better. In the absolute worst sense, it is a real-life scenario: 90% of everyday life is boring and not worth writing or viewing. Why Ephron felt that his life and relationship with Carl Bernstein was interesting enough to write about me fleeing. Perhaps he wrote it as a therapy - for many writers, the episode is cathartic about his life on paper. Well: but why did somebody in Hollywood feel like filming this story, it remains a mystery to me.
