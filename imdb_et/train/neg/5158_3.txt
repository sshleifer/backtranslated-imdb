Sometimes, something strange and modern may not work for everyone's advantage. Although I admit that the design and concept of the film was quite interesting, the realization of these ideas was not a smooth story. This film was so weakly slow and pointless that even Robin Williams couldn't save that garbage. It is obvious that Barry Levinson's dream fell on the face, but he should have warned the world about the rest of the world.
