My friend and I rented it because we thought it might be a good Halloween start. The killer who terrorizes the young, the white mask ... you get my drift. We were dead wrong! Not intended. We not only discovered one of the worst films, but also that it is a cult classic! It is filled with well holes and makes no sense. The actor who plays Madd is beautiful, but that's it. I give credit for making it with a very low budget - I always support such movies. Just not that specific. <br /> <br /> This movie may be good to see if you're drunk or high; otherwise you won't bother. If you don't want to lose your movie rights as I did!
