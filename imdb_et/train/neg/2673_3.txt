It is not long enough to be long in length and not short enough for this to be one reason to get a lesbian triple. There are worse causes. One sad thing is that it could have made a decent full-length movie. Misty fits her gear and is a very brilliant girl, and if people are as playful as Lara Croft that they make her naked adventures, you know that the flick with a soft core has exploded. Unfortunately, it is quite pathetic. Particularly painfully fake sex scene between Dariani and Misty, where you can see his hand, with his finger on the air. See if you just don't get enough of Misty or Ruby, who makes a nice blonde and ever has a zee verst jerman accent.
