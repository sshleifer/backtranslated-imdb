Until the end of the 90s, the golden age of the Disney cartoons died. This show, Quack Pack, should not even be considered a DuckTales spin-off because the show had nothing to do with DuckTales. It's about teenage Huey, Dewey, and Louie, because they're struggling for their uncle Donald and are talking about hip-hop and are completely dressed differently from DuckTales. I prefer DuckTales little adventurous nephew. There are people in Duckburg and the ducks are the only animals in Duckburg. There are no references to Scrooge McDuck. The stories are repetitive, the plot is boring, but the animation is good. If you want a lot of shock-absorbing humor, I recommend it to you. If you want a better Disney show "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales".
