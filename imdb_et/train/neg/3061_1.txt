This movie is terrible. Give me a dentist anytime! Do you think that one of the main TV channels here in Arabia was your Christmas card! I can only assume they are waiting for the crowd instead of Dudley Moore. Last time I looked into my hot water bottle, it had more action, a better plot, more drama and much more interest than this celluloid residue. Don't look even when you're drunk!
