Ursula Andres's bare body is one of the things that make you believe in God. The other two women (especially the one who plays the girl) also have big bodies. Then why is the higher class that I can give to a film of this quality and nudity, only three out of ten? In order to access the incredible body of Ursula, we have to sit through a film that is otherwise uncomfortable and boring (remember, I was looking at the entire 101-minute version, not an 78-minute American, which is likely to reduce a lot of foreign matter). A typical Italian-comedy tradition has most of the symbols of exaggerated cartoons (army freak, "Latin mistress", constant drunk, naive maid), which is not funny, just excessive. Final word: look at it, but hold your finger back and forth, you need it. (*)
