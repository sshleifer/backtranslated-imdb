I joined this site to see what comments people would make about the film's absolute disaster. I didn't even have seconds to pull in. The characters were all one-dimensional. They threw every topic they could think of, hoping to catch something. I would (and hope) that all those involved with teachers look back at embarrassment. Here are some great actors, but you never know. God thanked that he did not destroy Morgan Freeman or Judd Hirsh or Nick Nolte or Laura Dern's career. There was no vision, work of love, but a terrible effort. BTW I don't think the writer would ever have done anything in a real school.
