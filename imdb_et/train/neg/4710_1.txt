My brother is in love with this show, we get it right. I fully agree with people who said he was copying Dexter Lab and pretty odd parents. <br /> <br /> I've never liked pretty strange parents, I mean, some things make me laugh, but mostly it's totally annoying and not at all cute. It's almost like Johnny Test. Except, NO, make me laugh with this smile. Gags are so stupid and pointless to tell the truth, maybe it's just me, but the kids may not be like that! Yeah, I think Johnny's hair is fantastic, but C'Mon! <br /> <br /> And the Dexter lab, which was one of my favorite shows before, and I still don't have to watch it. What makes me ashamed and ashamed of Johnny Test by making an absolute JOKE of this great show! <br /> <br /> Another thing. The. Dog. Is. So. Annoying. He's more loud and reluctant than Johnny! And gay accent? What to eat! I hate the death of the dog and I hope he dies because it would be better for the children to see if they were listening and watching the unpleasant mess of this exhibition and accepting the gay accent. If you don't want your eyes to burn in admiring flames and your brain fried from this show, don't look at it!
