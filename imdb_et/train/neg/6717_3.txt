It was terrible for God. The story was all over the place and more often, if not, I was confused by terrible editing. I had no sympathy for anyone because their characters were not developed enough. They were extremely superficial, without a dimension. Cheesy, cheesy stereotypes with subpages that went anywhere. The funny chick was just annoying, even if she had a decent look. I don't know what it was trying to do, but when it was shocked when they showed it in the recycle bin at Sundance? I almost canceled my order. You think that such a channel would see more high quality movies. There are many, much better gay and lesbian themes. "Celluloid Closet" is a great documentary. I enjoyed "Wigstock: The Movie" thoroughly. I'm sure there are others who have slipped in my mind right now, but what I'm trying to say is that it just wasn't worth it. When you catch the TV, ok, but you won't bother. <br /> <br /> Maybe there were three or four shots that seemed really nice (sad I can count on one hand), otherwise the filmmaking was pretty dirty. There was a lot of lighting. I think some of the effects were used to try and add something that didn't really work. <br /> <br /> I can't deny that Johnny Rebel is pretty hot (of course, blonde hair too). Too bad that his act did nothing to me. Stick with real porn, friend. <br /> <br /> 3/10
