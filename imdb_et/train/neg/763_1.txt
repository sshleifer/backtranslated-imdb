I love Columbo and I've seen quite a lot of all the episodes, but that is undoubtedly the worst. An entertainingly annoying, pointless, confusing stake for an indefatigable generation that wastes both audience time and highly talented Peter Falki's talented talents. The "plot", as it seems, just seems to have been composed, because the film goes along with not even the smallest ingredient hint in the formula, which made the exhibition such a great success. One part of the procedure I found extremely puzzling (or perhaps annoying) was Peter Falk, who introduced the wedding to "Lt" Columbot. If manufacturers demand that the first name of Columbo be a secret, why couldn't they leave the line at all because it sounds ridiculous? As I said, it is mines, and all true Columbo fans would do it to avoid it like a plague.
