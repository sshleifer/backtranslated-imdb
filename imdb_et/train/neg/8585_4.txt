Well, I think I have to be the one who says, "The Emperor has no clothes." When I saw this example on PBS last night, I was both budding and fearful. I loved "Morse" (even so far to buy a complete DVD set) and felt that although I always liked Kevin Whately Sgt. Lewis character, show WAS John Thaw, period! After seeing the new "Inspector Lewis" (as presented here), I've never been convinced that I was right ... What's good (although she looks awful (both obsolete and too thick), but just isn't charismatic show as Thaw. <br /> <br /> And like his "sidekick" for Fox, maybe ... maybe UK-based reviewers understand what he's saying, but I usually couldn't. br /> <br /> As for Mrs. Innocent ... I can say I miss James Grout. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say they should have left "Morse" in peace.
