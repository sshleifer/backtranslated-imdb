A ruthlessly shining and painfully failed attempt to translate Sheriff Bar's character from Mel Brooks's relaxing saddles to his weekly sitcom, it's really as bad as some people say it's! <br /> <br /> Just remember to remind the viewer what all this supposed comedy is all about and how desperate the smile really is! <br /> <br /> However, it is somewhat interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. its best to embody Cleavon Little. His embarrassment shows through every scene. He was a lot funny in the HBO movie El Diablo when he was here in a cheesecake! <br /> <br /> Truly the best and most fun thing Black Bartis is the name of his horse!
