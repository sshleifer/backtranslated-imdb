Shiner, directed by Christian Calson, focuses on three couples and their relationships with obsession and violence. Pretty good start as far as I'm concerned. Interesting. Couples break down into a heterosexual couple, two heterosexual male friends, and a straight man, who is "safely" held by a gay man. <br /> <br /> The "het" pair does not really play a big role in the film. There are some scenes that show how they want to be aggressive when they have sex or play with each other, but apparently they have no real purpose, because they are so marginalized. My premise is that they represent a more everyday picture of how sex / violence is integrated into the lives of couples. The couple is not very aggressive and has not been photographed in any erotic way. As characters, they do not add much to the theme or plot. <br /> <br /> Two men make up the bulk of the plot. They are engaged in homosexual men who persuade homosexual men sexually with them. It deepens into violence. And violence changes them. It becomes a means of sexual satisfaction. And as the film progresses, their need for violence increases. The main problem I had is violence is not convincing. It never seems that any character is in any real danger. It just doesn't work. Considering that the whole subject of the film is related to the relationships between the characters with violence, it is a big problem. Unfortunately, make-up does not help. Sometimes it is okay, otherwise it is very bad. In one scene, I really wondered why one of these characters was dirty on his face. Confusing. <br /> <br /> A more interesting pair of characters is "Stalker Couple." Here it seemed that Calson had more to say and was able to develop a more coherent storyline. Perhaps it is because the characters seem more evolving and have a resolution. Shiner may be much better than it would have stuck to these two. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that Calson wanted to achieve a lot with this movie. It's admirable. Most low budget pictures do not want much. I don't think Calson got the desire he wanted. I couldn't find anything particularly controversial or calm. Shiner was not convincing. This does not mean, however, that the director cannot achieve anything with his next film. <br /> <br /> He seems to say something.
