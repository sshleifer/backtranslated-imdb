Okay, let me stop it for you ... It's bad! <br /> <br /> When Roger Kumble did such fancy work for the first cruel purposes, why did he do such a bad job. I'm sorry, but this movie is stupid, it is true that it may have improved if this series has ever been incited, but lets be realistic ... this movie is a trap! Lots of bad behavior * NOTE Shower scene * "Kissing cousins" ?????? What is it? "Slipery as Wet" ?????????? Can we say DUH-M! This movie was tense, I'll give you this, but it was too stupid! They even tried to make it funny, giving the house servants the stupid accents that really were ... WANN FUNNY! It was pathetic. Not to mention that they did everything in this picture absolutely NOT the original cast. It would be like they would have seen for their own purposes or something else! I like to watch it if I really want it not to happen. For those of you who liked it ... Okay, what did you mean? Could you pick this movie for another who had a great actor and fabulous Sarah Michelle Gellar? The film is gold if Sarah Michelle Gellar, DUH! But this movie is not, Amy Adams does not blame. Oh, yeah, because when Sebastain has a heart ????? UGH!
