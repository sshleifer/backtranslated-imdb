I read James Hawes's book. It was pretty clean, not big, but fun enough. Without reading the book, I would not have had the slightest idea of ​​what was going on, and that was still a stretch of knowledge. <br /> <br /> In the literal sense, every part of this movie is sad in the way I do not have the ability to describe. Half-decomposed fish could have made a better film with matches and daytime lipstick. <br /> <br /> Never before or since the movie made me so angry. The mattress letters were closest, but even they did not reach the depths where the cloud was, because of a completely nasty frightening fear. see any James Hawes book without being angry. This is the depth of hatred I have for this sh * t piece. No, it's unfair. Allow me to apologize for all the fools to compare you with the other world's evil, which is Rancid's aluminum. <br /> <br /> Simple and easy cancer cinema in the world.
