The European holiday (also known as the National Lampoon's European Vacation) is the weakest of holiday movies (first and third highest films). When Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return to Clark and Ellen Griswold (with new players from Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time they will have a very weak dialogue with a very bad dialogue. It causes impetus to suffer, jokes are not at all funny. Specifically, what really causes the suffering of this movie is that "jokes", as they are, are simply pasted into a scrambled script) instead of earning a central plot, like other 3 holiday movies. Well, they can't beat them all. 4 out of 10.
