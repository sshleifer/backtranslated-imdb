In Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s, I think every studio can do west, except Warner bros. The few times they try is always ridiculous (except perhaps for those who died with their boots - which is a cavalry). I've read that Humphrey Bogart, who sees James Cagney on this big cowboy hat, says he looks like a mushroom. True! Cagney and Bogart are too suburban, too in the XX century to be credible in the western film. The story here wasn't surprised and it didn't help. Every 10 minutes I see that I see Bogart and Cagney drop their small arms and put their hands in a machine gun to get out of the kit in the 1930s black car.
