Well, I would lie if I said it could easily rival Spiderman or Batman movies. However, my moral value was more interesting. I first bought a VHS when my son was about 2 years old and immediately became his favorite. My wife and I are the enthusiastic supporters of Robert Townsend, and we have been using credit cards to fund their first film "Hollywood Shuffle". True, he must make use of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more credible, but his films are still fun. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man offers a hero with Urban Contemporary. I always felt that if they were superheroes, they didn't offer the same scenarios as comics. Meteor Man is a realistic hero with real problems: the car breaks, a bad neighborhood, local drug gangs who use children for distribution, etc. His mission scope was quite a lot in the community. <br /> <br /> What I found to be really fun, outside of James Earl Jones' youth forever, was how the neighborhood responded to its newly discovered powers. It wasn't long before they had a complete agenda for him without his input. It was fun to hear that they offered to lend to other communities where their extended families lived. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot was weak, the movie was predictable, bad performance and continuity was rotten, but it's with my kids # 1. Robert Townsend works to bring movies home. I doubt he is ever truly recognized as a talented actor / director / director, but there are and always are those who love him for his efforts. <br /> <br /> One thing to think about in the movie, what do I find it fun: In the whole battle with Simon, did anyone doubt calling the police ???? Also, what do you know about Mom and Dad that they watch their son fight a window? My mother would have been there, bursting next to me, toe-toe-toe. Dad put his pistol. lol <br /> <br /> Rent it and check it out. It's worth seeing at least once and good for fans of Sinbad, Luther Vandros, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Kane and so on.
