The film is so bad that it should be taken out of all the shops in the world. This film is so boring, boring, unimaginable in nature and of a leading character with such a tedious attitude and a dry voice that gives every activity and feeling a constantly thoughtless voice. This movie captures the most complex film I've ever watched. Since I paid for my money for that, I felt this obligation and I regret it. My head damaged terribly dull characters and their meaningless, smaller lives. A lot of children who have something unknown, all cold and worst, are always a terrible dialogue, just as the main character tries to get a date with the girl. Bored, so much that my friend shook hate and I was red, embarrassed that I threw away a Â£ 6 DVD on the next day on eBays and I didn't make my money back. Avoid like plague.
