I have two good things about this film: the scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk is good (considering what he was supposed to do in dialogue and direction). However, I said I found this movie extremely tiring. Drying the paint would have been more fun. It seemed much longer than 97 minutes. From the opening order, where everyone talks about each other and Paul Reiser repeats what he said on the phone, the film is annoying. The film is full of clich√©s and shticki, not to mention Falki's audible flatulence. It also seems that the director has had trouble finding a laugh or tears. There are some sequences that concern, but they all play a laugh. If schmaltzy, sentimental and "cute" like you, love it. But if you hoped for more content, check out a different movie.
