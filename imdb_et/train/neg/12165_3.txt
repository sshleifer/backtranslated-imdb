So Angela has grown up and received treatment and surgery to make her a real daughter, not her born son, and now she has a job - wait - camp advisor! Where appropriate, right? I know I love it. Anyway, the first order of the Sleepaway Camp franchise follows all the horrors of the queue - more blood, more imaginative killings (not imaginative, but more than the original), more nudity, a more complex plot, and generally worse than the original. <br /> <br /> It's entertaining just as the original was, because characters and wardrobes are so funny and so authentic the 80's that you can't help laugh. At one point, he asks Angel and says, "I'll call you" and then walk quickly. The boy says to himself, "How's he calling me? I have no phone!" and then she sniffs her underarms, thinking what turned her off (this is hair, dude!). <br /> <br /> It is well known that in the 80s films were murdered by teenagers more often than not being killed by any killer, usually because he was too buggy. When, for the first time in the mid-1990s, for the first time, I started to get into fiction films and saw a 13th film on Friday, I didn't know. I learned this in a film class a year or two years later and was surprised that their way was madness. I was pretty impressive, not just that the movies were broadcasting some kind of message, though sick, but there was actually some idea. <br /> <br /> But not in this movie! At one point just before Angela kills one of her victims, she says, "Let it be a lesson for you. Real fine screen writing out there, guys. Again, dialogue is the most fun thing about film. Angela (who by the way went through all this treatment and those operations and all the trouble to clean her past and invent herself as a normal and well-developed person and then changed her name from Angela, umm, Angela), says at one point: "I don't like to be west evil witch, but I know what happens when things get out of control. " (People start killing ... by me! HA!) <br /> <br /> Then he insists that one of the advisors, Mare, apologize to the girl she says, "I'd rather die!" Sorry, Mare, but you really walked into it ... <br /> <br /> Two years ago I was a camp teacher in a dream camp similar to this movie (except for the camp I taught for 15 or 20 advisors with more than three children and had rules too not in the movie). It made me notice a lot of discrepancies in the film about what the camp lovers really like. <br /> <br /> Although it is okay, you can't barely make such a movie as many 9-year-olds run around, even though about 10 or 11 years old children were killed in this movie. I had never seen such a thing before. <br /> <br /> Definitely a bad taste, even for the 80s film.
