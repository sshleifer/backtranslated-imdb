A painfully bad Christmas movie with Vince Vaughni's equally painful power, who pays for his usual frat-boy himself, but this time for a children's film, but what's in his R-rated movies. Vaughn seems to be on the autopilot, though most of the movie, and he runs into the walls with his weak results. After 30 minutes of the movie, you would be up to date with your internal scourge and say, "Bahumbag" if this movie is uncomfortable and after 30 minutes you want to step out when the movie has got it. Of all the participants involved in this confusion, only a few lives in this perspective by Paul Giamatti and Rachel Weisz are a thin piece of paper, and it is masculine because they are both good for the participants in this film. Paul Giamatti brings with him the character of a deep and warm Saint Nick, but he is forced to level the behavior of the Vaughni minors when they make their sad brother. In Giamat, you see that he does not know his role and shows the film in certain parts. Rachel Weisz brings to her role fun and spirit, but she doesn't really have a lot of character and you see her face that she is aware of it, so she seems upset in some parts of the film. Luckily, he doesn't have much at all in the film and can save his face differently from Giamat, who looks to shoot his agent at the end of the movie. The direction also feels like a uninspirit, as there is no feeling or flow that should have been, and it should be a holiday movie, but it feels like you are just looking proudly on the screen of the scarecrow that has been cut off. > <br /> I don't know what went wrong here, but only two players (Giamatti and Weisz) tried their best to bring something to the table with an inconvenient script they had to work with, a spotty direction without feeling at hand (and that is a Christmas movie of all things) and an actor who just doesn't care about his performance (Vaughn), you have a very uneven film that is very painful to watch.
