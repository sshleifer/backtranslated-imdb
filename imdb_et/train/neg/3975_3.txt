1 review 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Steve Purcell): Typical Mary Kate and Ashley fares with a few more kisses. It seems to me that girls are quite tired of this stuff and it's interesting what happens to them if they ever decide to share their way. In this adventure episode, they are trainees in Rome for a "fashion" designer who puts them right in the mailroom to learn what works hard (I think). In addition to the typical flirtatious boys, there is nothing but the Rome scenario until about Â¾ of the film when it is finally revealed why they are fired, then hired again, then fired again and then re-employed. It is certainly done by people who do not understand the business world and what they show in their interpretation. Perhaps the real world is their next adventure (if it exists). Even my children didn't care about this boring "adventure" in belief. Let's see that they probably only have a few years to their legal adult. We see what happens.
