The first five minutes of this movie showed potential. After that, it went straight from some of the possible human dignity. The best part is that I couldn't stop thinking about Supertrooper thanks to Joey Kern. I would recommend watching this movie to learn how not to film. There are so many scenes in this movie that make one stop and wonder if the whole cast and the team stopped care at some point. The thing that amazes me the most about this film is that it rose to $ 22 million in the box and cost only $ 1.5 million. Congratulations to Lion's gate for being able to pull it out.
