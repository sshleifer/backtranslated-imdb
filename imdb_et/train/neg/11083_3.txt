This movie was late at night when I saw it. It was interesting at first, but it didn't convince me as a whole. I'm not a Tyson fan. Actually, I don't like boxing at all. It's a barbaric, obscene, and double face (by the society) that some get money to beat each other. <br /> <br /> However, I felt the movie's start was OK. Actors, especially George C. Scott (like Cus D'Amato). I don't know how reliable the flick is. I have not read books and books about Boxing or Tyson. I don't know anything about this man, but it was fun. <br /> <br /> As the movie went, I felt that it lost a little bit of charm and I lost interest. However, I managed to stay awake, but the last hour was not good enough.
