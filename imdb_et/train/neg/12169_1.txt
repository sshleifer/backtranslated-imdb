This is an immoral and reprehensible garbage, which undoubtedly wants to be Friday the 13th (1980) clone. On the poster of this film, it seems that there is a cross between Jason and Freddy that attracts the film's visitors. There's nothing good or entertaining about this movie about this movie. It just makes me sad, just thinking that some people stumble into the Sleepaway II camp: unhappy campers (1988) on a video or DVD and waste their time with this fucking, cynical, depressing movie. <br /> <br /> Angela Baker (Pamela Springsteen) is a Camp Rolling Hills camp adviser who hopes other campers will be as beautiful as she is and that they will be in trouble. At the same time, the other campers realize that people are disappearing one by one and Angela is sorry she had to send them home. Could Angela be a killer who was a man who had been undergoing a gender change operation for years? Who knows? Who cares? <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, there were many films that crossed Mad Slasher and Dead Teenager genres, where the mad killer goes crazy. Some have a plot, some do not, but they are all as bad as it is. Sleepaway II Camp: The unfortunate campers are 80-minute-old teenagers who are tortured, choked, tortured, cut, burned alive and violated. It's all this movie. It's just pointless and bloody violence. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I was reminded on Friday the 13th film, where the message to its viewers was that the main task of teenagers is to hack. Sleepaway Camp II filmmakers have the right to be ashamed. Imagine the ill message that this movie offers to teenage viewers: "The world is a totally evil place," this movie tells you, "and it kills you. No matter what your dreams or hopes are. boyfriend or new girlfriend.It doesn't matter what you think what you are doing or what your future plans are. "<br /> <br /> And the sick thing is - and not giving too much - movie just creates space sequel. Why not? They've probably and already taken the bucket into the baking chamber, making three or four of these films. I forgot about the original Sleepaway camp (1983) and after hoping for my first stage I will hopefully stay away from other descendants and the original. And for the parents, if you know the kids who really love this movie, don't let them have their children date.
