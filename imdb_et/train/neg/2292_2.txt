First I have to admit Batman: the animated series is the best batman series. We watched it on TV. I didn't know there was a fourth season. It wasn't. The BTAS ends with the 3rd season and it should have stopped there. <br /> <br /> Why they had to mix good things. Catwoman and Poison ivy are now terribly gray. Joker looks outrageous, it seems that every time they look at his appearance, he sees more and more horrible. He doesn't seem to have any more students, and now he doesn't even look far from a person (although he is). <br /> <br /> Bruce Wayne is playing Kevin Conroy, who makes the best batman. Although she looks like a superman. There is nothing to differentiate him, because both look the same, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes. <br /> <br /> Night Wing really needs a hairstyle, please! Alfred has just the eyes of the students, looks like an 80's character. <br /> <br /> I've been watching three of the 1 episodes of the disc and I've already found that this version is more violent and graphical (there's every episode). <br /> <br /> If you are a Batman fan: animated series, there is no 4th season. If they just released it as a new batman adventure, I don't think many people would have bought it. <br /> <br /> Save yourself from frustration and seasons 1-3.
