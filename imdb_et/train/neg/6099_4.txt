It was less than an exciting short film that I recently saw between Turner's classic film features. The film came out thanks to its very intense Technicolor, but the film was not so touching and sometimes the plot seemed pretty cheesy - as it was done in the classroom and WASN'T even paid attention to the wider audience. In particular, I hated how many times things were repeated in the movie - for example, when they talked to him, they usually replaced "Clara Barton" instead of "Mrs.", "Miss Barton" or "Clara". In addition, one sick confederate soldier said he was "Johnny Reb, A Confedate a Rebel, ..." - almost like he was a comic character from Mojo Jojo Powerpuff Girls. It was just a sloppy writing period. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later, Perry White's SUPERMAN TV show) as bearded President Garfield. Yes - it's under that beard.
