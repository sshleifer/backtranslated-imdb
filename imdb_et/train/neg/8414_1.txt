Yes, yes. Pretty sure I saw this movie years ago when it was about Supreme. <br /> <br /> Another recycled story pulled in the Hollywood style by borrowing scripts from better music industry movies. <br /> <br /> There is nothing original here. <br /> <br /> More make-up, glammier costumes and choreography = more money for the questionable "talented" Beyonce drawing. <br /> <br /> As a rebound style, you should appreciate the real groups that fought (without the digitized votes and the Hollywood Empire). <br /> <br /> Beyonce's involvement makes this hypocritical rubbish.
