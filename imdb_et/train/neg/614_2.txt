I am currently watching it on the Sci-Fi channel. It's so terrible that I can't watch it! I'm a videographer and this film makes me sad. I feel bad about the people involved in this film. Some camera work is good. Most of them are highly questionable. There are some decent players in Flick. Too bad, surrounded by what must be the director's relatives. This is the only way they could have been in the movie! The music was a little better than the actor. When you look at it, I hope it is because there was no other way! Sequence (yes sequel) is coming now .... I think I'll leave it! Jason
