I can't believe how someone can do comedy on an issue like homelessness. Of course Brooks has not made a comedy about _real_ homeless people. These streets do not mention drugs, prostitution or violence. The people we meet in this film are homeless in Fantasy, so the only difference between them and us is that they don't eat quite often. Brooks' films have become worse and worse over the years. It's just another nail coffin.
