Because of the American Guild of 1988, they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. This is pretty much a mess consisting of repeated cut + pasted clips in season 2 and described by this writer Maurice Hurley as "terrible, just terrible." <br /> <br /> Why manufacturers just couldn't wait to shoot something decent who knows. I think that the strike ended the production money and it could only release the kickback episode, or perhaps Roddenberry was too ill at that time to bet on this semi-bet. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) in the series.
