It was first a "cute" movie, then it went to the most delicate and mediocre songs. easy to interpret. Can you imagine that today's young people are trying to listen to this movie? Forget it. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has good features here and it's nice like "Hank Martin". Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") was in addition to good looks and beautiful red hair. <br /> <br /> This is a nice movie with a good ending and I can't knock it. Maybe it's worth renting, with historical interest, or if you're a big Crosby fan, but it's not that much in general.
