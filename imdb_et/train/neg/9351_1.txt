This is only the second time I finished the partial passage of the video / DVD. <br /> <br /> I was ready to give this film some doubts first, although it managed to be so low, clich√© and foolish. AND joy, bright and pretentious. <br /> <br /> It was like a school class, led by this strange class, nine kids who think nobody understands him ... horrible and sad, with the voice of saying that only the most frustrated youth would weigh poetry. and some songs, and ... no, really, poor kids suffering ... <br /> <br /> Enough, especially if it's a rebellious, clumsy and offensive Clockwork Orange ripoff. And did I mention singing? <br /> <br /> This is not the worst film I've ever seen, but I'm definitely the one I am least forced to sit on. I don't recommend it to anyone.
