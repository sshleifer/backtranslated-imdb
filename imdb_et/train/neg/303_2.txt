I cannot objectively consider this film. Not that I haven't tried you, but I sit and I am in VHS, and I look at the opening ... and suddenly I am five years old and follow my nursing media and watch the movie with open eyes and eagerly heart. <br /> <br /> I see objectively that this film is a combination of BIZARRE's delicate baby merchandising mascot and horrible predecessors who have evil abilities with a thin story and uninteresting animation. But my five-year-old goes, "Yay! Care Bears!" every time I think about it. So - I would only (cautiously, reluctantly) recommend this movie to those who saw it in their early years, and they can look at it (like me) to call awesome nostalgia power or those loved by cynical Gen-X / Y-ers who deliberately seek wonderfully bad / strange (the category where this movie ... definitely belongs). For those looking for an interesting movie or healthy family entertainment: you might want to look.
