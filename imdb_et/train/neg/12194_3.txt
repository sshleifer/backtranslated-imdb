The film begins with a voice that tells the audience where they are and who they are. And this is the moment I started to dislike the movie. With all the endless possibilities that every film director has, I have a very simple and inexpensive solution to express the situation with a voice that speaks everything. I believe that voice commands are a betrayal of the concept of filmmaking. I believe that the director must find a visual way to convey the feelings and thoughts to the viewers. <br /> <br /> But after a bad intro, a very amazing movie begins and takes quite a long time. The lives of the middle class family and all members are perfectly realistic. I think the director has the talent to capture real life situations. For example, a father who has to make his own bathroom calls can be abnormal at first, but life itself leads us to situations that may seem abnormal, but also very normal. I think the director is a very good observer in real life. After a while, the realism of the film begins to sacrifice hope. I really felt like I had a big headache because the stops on talking were stopped. Like the actors and actors, the topic was given and they were allowed to improvise the dialogues. It's really realistic, but the characters that always ask each other "really, are both" and so on. I also have a headache. <br /> <br /> I also think that feature films and book reading scenes are more than they should be. I understand that the game and the book in the movie are very closely related to the plot, but I think the director has forgotten the point where he should stop showing these scenes.
