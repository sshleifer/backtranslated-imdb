There are some movies you just know that they are bad in the frame. Even if you were completely absent from Ed Wood's work, check out this commentator "Plan 9 from Space" and you just know that you can't see the next cinematic masterpiece. Just as I saw the first picture of the Uwe Bolls masterpiece "The House of the Death", where this man sat in front of the house, starting with an introduction, trying desperately to call as he arrived from Blue. m for gentle driving. <br /> <br /> So the movie starts like this - first the wizard says everyone else is dying. You know to keep you wandering. Then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with rows like "Karma..thinks he is Foxy Brown" or "Alicia .. my thing .. we broke up recently .. I had to learn and he had to fence". No, I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this 20-fold bunch of people who couldn't get out of a wet paper bag goes to the "rave of the century," pounding with a tent, a port-a-potty and dirty stage in the middle of the Pacific on a small island. Our gang missed the ferry, but fortunately you will find a way to get there, the way a fishing boat ran Kirk (Cpt Kirk? Take it? The man who wrote this script is a genius) and his sidekick, who is Bastard Simpson's child Cpt McAllister and this hook killer who knows what you did last summer. <br /> <br /> To make a short story short, the river will reach the island, find someone except some bloody T-shirts and then decide to take the hell out of it. Don't wait, they don't, they really get all happy and like cos is free booze. <br /> <br /> With this scene, the movie hits the bottom and then downhill against all odds. Some boys in rubber costumes start to run around, some are screaming and shooting, our gang goes to some other to meet another force, they go out of the house, meet Cpt Kirk and some police women (some 500 pounds between them) and then decide to go back to the house. Somewhere along the line they become S.W.A.T. team, enter the matrix, rubber pants begin to multiply like bacteria and i start crying because i pay for it really. In order to add insult to injury, every few minutes, the video game is based on the cool and some characters are cute when they die. <br /> <br /> I seriously hate this movie. It doesn't even fit in this famous category, "That's so bad it is good". It's just bad. The script is bad, the zombies are terrible, there are no tensions, the lines are bad, the actors are bad .. the list goes on. <br /> <br /> You probably want to see this movie is terrible. Don't. There are bad movies that deserve to be viewed. It's not one of them.
