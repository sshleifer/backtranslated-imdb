Well, it's hard to add comments after you've read it here, but I feel I have to say something. I didn't look exactly for the "splatterfest" if someone puts it or even "blood and guts". I have some respect for the victims' relatives, even though I knew the filmmaker DIDN'T. -They were named, face and pointless. Just ship Dahmers for sexual anger. Dahmer's story, which I know very little, is also marvelous. People here think the film doesn't have to cover Dahmer's story. I.E. his history, what happened when he got stuck, the result, etc, but that's important! You see, I assume that if you are an American, you know all this. We're not all living in America. The story of telling a man as he probably was, REQUESTS that at least some history and actual events are spoken / shown. It does not mean blood and courage, there are ways to show terrible things in the film by implant or smart filming without using gore. Without touching even what he did (I found out more about how he read the user comments on this site!), The film was feeling blank. Time for a little substance. I would like to know if there is a film about the REAL Dahmer because, due to the lack of this direction, there is a very slow pace, which is NOT an amazing portrayal of homosexuality and a very bad ANY attempt, this film is POOR. I would not recommend to anyone to waste time watching it. Sure 1 out of 10 (actress!)
