Remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest star in Hollywood because he made great movies? These days are like a remote memory. <br /> <br /> Although "Hollywood killing" is by no means terrible, it is a routine and surprisingly boring friend of the film. This is a comedy that is not particularly funny, and an action movie that's not very exciting. The subspace overflow cannot hide the central story of the weakest. <br /> <br /> At least, Ford seems to enjoy more than his latest projects and is able to wear the movie mostly. Hartnett is enough, but he and Ford are not exactly Newman and Redford in terms of chemistry. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Hollywood killing" is a reasonably fun deviation, but hardly. Take out Ford and it's not even that.
