I've always thought Cinderella II was the worst film I've ever seen (followed by Peter Pan 2 and some other queues like The Lion King 2 and Notre Dame 2 hunchback). All these films are made with the same idea; because the film has no plot, they try to make up for it with jokes. I'm not saying jokes are bad, but they make up the bulk of the movie. When I first saw the movie, I would have given it 1/10. But now I think about it, most kids don't care about how good the original movie was, they just make sure the movie is fun. I still think the movie was a bad sequel, but that doesn't mean it's terrible. Now I think it deserves 3/10.
