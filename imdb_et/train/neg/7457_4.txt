Chris Kattan is a great draft actor on Saturday night, but he should probably leave the film industry only if he gets some creative control. He plays an annoyingly peppery character, who basically leaves a slight slowdown and fast. Want to know only funny parts? The items they showed in the previews. Yes, his transfer to me is funny. There is nothing else. Especially when one can say that he is trying hard to be a physical comedian he shouldn't try because he is one. And yet, his "dismantling of the veterinary office" is getting a little bad. This movie made me twitch. Avoid it at all costs and follow the SNL.
