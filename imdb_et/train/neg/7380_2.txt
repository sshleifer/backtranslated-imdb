I think it's time for Seagal to go quietly at night. What I just saw makes all of his recent video releases similar to his hit hits from the 90s. <br /> <br /> The secret biolab makes a new type of medicine that opens the human adrenaline system until they become psychopathic killers or something. Somehow Seagal should stop the end of the infection or its world ... or something. Seagal also went through the hit teams like jellybeans, every time I look, he ordered a new face so it was so hard to follow the character development as well. he duplicates those people who don't know something like him? Typically, the sequences of movies and actions can be saved from wasting this time, but it was not even close. As I said, it was a horror film with lots of blood and stems, but not direct struggles. The problem was that it wasn't really scary and Seagal seemed completely unsuccessful because the infected people had to have a slight speed of movement, but the 40-year-old 280 lb Seagal killed them all unanimously? I think the single highlight of the film was the first 20 minutes when new recruits asked Seagal to come with them to the striptease club. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
