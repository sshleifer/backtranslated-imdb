The small minority that is being viewed here is praised by GET SERIOUS. I know that this is a personal opinion at the end of the people, but anyone with more than a few brain cells can definitely see that it is all rubbish. It is not so bad to be part of this franchise. I can only assume that those who say how big it is are friends who are tied to the film and are trying to push their careers. Poor in every sense, don't forget otherwise. The story is a weak rehash of previous records, the script is also. Attempts to hide the lack of originality of a girl (WOW!) Do not hide the lack of ideas of filmmakers and unfortunately there are no fears. Absolutely no salvation property, say perfect turd. I've just given one pair of shock to this pair of shockers just because I had someone to fund that wallet. They need to do more to do this than they did when making a movie. Shame.
