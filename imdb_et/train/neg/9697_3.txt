I've seen the first dwarf movie and sometimes I had it a little. In the first part, there are many famous TV / Comedyactors who present in their fantasy costumes their typical little episodes of their Stand-Up program, and exactly the problem the other film has to fight. Everything was already there .... something new. You are familiar with most often boring and funny jokes and you always feel that their goal was to put all the Comedyloos of the last decade who want to come back on stage. There is nothing important about the story: a typical Rumpelstiltskin fairy tale, without any significance. I was expecting something like that, but I couldn't say anything. I actually complain about the lazy story of writers who had all the background information; their only business was to get a lot of jokes and parodies inside, but they didn't get it anyway. This mess is just Helge Schneider's big time and money waste (if you don't like it, remove 2 points) If you want to save your money and get bad jokes, check out this crap. widely cast on every Friday night SAT1 or RTL for free. I'm sure you know some of the "laugthers" I saw in the cinema last night.
