I just saw Dick Trac and I thought it was terrible. The paintings in the background of the cities looked awful. Mobile players also seemed too strange. Warren Beatty didn't do a terrible job like Dick Tracy, but it was certainly not one of his best performances. Madonna should just sing. Glenne did a good job in this film. I just gave this movie 2/10 just because Al Pacino was amazing. It was not a great sign of his career, but he still did a good job.
