With this pain and budget you expect more. <br /> <br /> John Cusack has made a number of films that limit the strange but still working. Neither he, his sister nor Sir Ben could do anything to save that little badly written garbage travert. <br /> <br /> Film is nothing more than a number of vision problems and poor people. The plot goes somewhere, writing is natural, meaningless, and the characters in the paper are thin. If you think the film is three-dimensional, if the story and the characters take the depth of the picture, then this stinker will go over both the flat and the steamer. <br /> <br /> The look of Dan Akroyd in this brings back the memories of another. a really terrible movie, 1991 Frankly, this film is a type of project that kills a career and gets the release of agents.
