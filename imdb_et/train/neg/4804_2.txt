I don't watch much TV and saw this example. Reality? I hope this is not real. If I were a man and I was so harsh and I was married to someone who was so ugly, it would be the basis for the divorce. I think he makes a bad example of how a person must love the person he loves. This is one thing that is wrong in our world right now, so many people in bad relationships, selfish and do not know what another really means. This is self-sacrifice and not something that should be on the merit. It does not give a very good feeling to see what should be in private counseling. If his personality is real at the exhibition, he deserves someone much better, showing him true love and care and appreciating him for who he is. Does it show reality or consist of ratings? I really would like to know. Sincerely, GB
