I don't know what's so great about this movie. Worse still, why should someone work hard? First, there is no story. It can be said that even without a story, it might be worth watching the film, because it refers to some kind of strong feeling (laughter, crying, fear, ...), but I do not think it does the film either. <br /> <br /> You only look at pictures +/- 2 hours. There are many useful things to do. <br /> <br /> I think you could say that the movie is an experiment, and it's bold because it doesn't have all of the above. But is it worth 2 hours for your valuable time and 7 euros for your money? For me, the answer is no.
