I have been hidden from these tables for many years because it is lacking in intelligence transmitted through periodic reviews of this film in the IMDb space. I saw this movie courtesy of the subway cinema in New York's Asian Film Festival (which was an excellent selection of films this year, look at the vital, Jewish snake, CHA NO AJI, style of survival) and regretted every day that the scene of this movie leaves me back and becomes a living memory. <br /> <br /> I am sure you can read a commendable summary of Subway Cinema's movie, which is probably why I made a mistake by dragging my friend's movie. The description has built up a horror film that I missed for some time but based on fear rather than cheap fear. P was actually different. It was based on a cheap laugh. <br /> <br /> An incredibly annoying listener described this movie as a "lesbian team to fight monsters." Completely wrong. This movie is built on a sub-block that looks like a girl-to-pookie relationship is actually going somewhere. More lies. This film seems to be short: "Are you afraid of darkness?" The story is ridiculous and only managed to laugh and confuse the audience after they finally ended up trying to watch this movie seriously and try to forget the $ 9 they were wasting on the door. I almost want to listen to the paul spurrier so I can laugh at him and ask why he's wasting five years in Taiz√© to do bad soft-porn-porn, which belongs to the spice chicken, which managed only to get the actor out of his family and a little mix at the Belgian film festival. The only mix that it caused was the lower intestine, because it could not crowd out. Anyway, I hope I can persuade someone to make a serious mistake in seeing this movie, it was really one of my three worst movie experiences, breaking my soul plan to number 2.
