I gave it to 2 instead of 1 because I think "Wild Wongo women" is worse. It's patience. It's like cleaning the teeth by a bad dentist. No plot. There is no logic. Certainly not working (though shark is a quality dialogue). We don't know anything. We don't know how people got where they got. It is always amazing to me how such things are even released. I agree with the previous writer that it is not even funny. I know. It's about 90 minutes long and it fills about the same amount of space in the DVD collection. It's like pulp. Or a bad painting that you bought from hunger artists for sale. It covers a cracking wall.
