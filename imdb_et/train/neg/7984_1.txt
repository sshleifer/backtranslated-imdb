Too many secondary plot lines without primary. Too many hot buttons are pushed without any reason, they managed to get this boring film that doesn't say anything, every drama element that is there: death, divorce, financial affairs, parenting problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse, adoption, rejected love, travel problems , gender, misunderstandings of generations, robbery, legal issues, weapons, medical ethics, "deep real love"? You think it would make an interesting movie, but hell doesn't? all these events are secondary to something that is not there. Bored. Not to mention that the "super-deep" (and super-long) lecture for children at the end of the film is a complete mess. Damage. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention: the participants, all, are pretty good. It kept me from turning it off. Their talents went to waste, the film has also shot: the light, movement, etc. of every episode. It's all in place. This is the meaning that is absent.
