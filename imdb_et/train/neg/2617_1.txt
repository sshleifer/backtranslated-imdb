This film was pure pain. Sitting in the theater after an minute of an minute, I wondered if the film would start. All settings were in place; a typical love story, characters must cross their short prizes, have a trench, but none of them ever started. By the time these things happened, I was already boring and the devices were totally ineffective. In scenes that required tremendous tension and accumulation, it seemed that the necessary shots were cut. Kid's stuff doesn't have to be that way. Children's films can be both rivals and adults. Excuse me, "hey, it's kids," is a pull. I'll take a "sword stone" every day. It was terrible. I feel Disney puts those days out. And like kids, the 10-year-old saw it ... clean the trash.
