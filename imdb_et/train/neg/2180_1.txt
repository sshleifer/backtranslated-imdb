Where to start, this movie is so wrong and terrible that I'm not sure where to start. Okay, those two strokes who wrote this dick. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton in the first place could not name their so-called. I think they shared the difference, so the main title is BRAIN, WHO IS NOT DIE, but the final screen says HEAD THAT WOULD'S DIE. Neither knows anything about medicine. After all, doctors must swear "no harm". The killing of a woman as a main transfer is considered "unfortunately". Plus, a little thing called blood and tissue matching. Rejection would put Jan in the pan over death. In addition to who keeps the patchwork. What Medical School Bill Stopped, FRANKENSEN UNIVERSITY? Old FU or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The monster had no name that hell out of me. Plus, brilliant surgeon doctor Bill Cortner doesn't know how to keep the patient calm down? The whole movie disaster, it's incredibly stupid and unobtrusive, except for MST3K. I'll give her ATTENTION TO TURKEY.
