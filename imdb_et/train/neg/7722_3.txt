An extremely bad feature film ever featuring Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee, who were trapped outside, which never seems like a gel. Action is at best average, a little nudity and yes Tia Carrera uses her body double! <br /> <br /> The setting is the usual renegade policeman, who is forced to break a great deal with a new partner, at least trying to give the formula a twist that makes Lundgren a policeman with Oriental values ​​and Lee the modern city slips, but near-zero development makes it almost comical , it must be seen that the equipment of the Lundgren Oriental Warriors is a great show. The sequences are numbered and Lee (who continues to make the excellent The Crow) never gives any chance to show any specific martial arts shine. But given his outstanding parent, he had put much pressure on hell and was much better off having to live with his father, taking a very different role in Crow, which showed what a unique actor he might be if not his tragic and early death. <br /> <br /> If your heavy-duty Lundgren fan or fan of bad 80's movies (think Cobra et al.), avoid. <br /> <br /> Poor 3/10
