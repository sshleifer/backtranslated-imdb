Big hair, big boobs, bad music, and a huge safety stick ....... are the words that best describe this terrible movie. I love cheesy horror movies and I've seen hundreds ... but it had to be the worst ever made. The plot is paper thin and ridiculous, the actress is abomination, the script is completely ridiculous (the best is the end of the showdown with the cop and how she worked out who the killer is - it's just so fucking written), the clothes are sick and funny in equal measures, the hair is big, big breasts, men wearing these cut-off shirts that show their stomach (sick that men actually wore them !!) and music is just a synthesizer that plays over and over again ... almost every scene has trashy music, boobs and paramedics who take off the body .... It's all a joke, it's a really bad film, the only charm of which is to look at the disaster of the 80s that has a good old laugh, how bad it was then.
