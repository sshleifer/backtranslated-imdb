Having been forced to look at their children at least ten times during the last two Christmas days, I feel qualified enough to judge this Dr. Seuss's classic story version and well ... it's not very good. First of all, after the classic acts, like Chuck Jones's animated television, it is difficult for someone, but this interpretation is so hard and padded that it would be a positive anesthetic. I admit that there are a handful of inspired gags, but generally the film has to be counted for cash while it is supposed to reach the Christmas market. Jim Carrey is usually up here, but it is totally against Grinch's character. Boris Karloff was characterized by his slow burning; methodical and clever. There's no method for Carrey's madness, and that's the most obvious mistake. Here are talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski. Why, Universal, why? I mean, I understand that Tony Hopkins takes almost every role offered (similar to his Estonian Michael Cain), but it has to be presented in "Movies that should never have been done." This does not mean well for Hat, even the thinnest tome that Universal has prepared for Christmas. I feel like I make the same recommendation as I am on it: leave it out and read the book or watch the TV special. It's 2 hours, which can never be recovered.
