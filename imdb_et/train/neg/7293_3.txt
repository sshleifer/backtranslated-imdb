Aaron Spelling gave it to a television town that has been terribly drawn for a seventy-three-minute movie. It plays like a likely failed pilot. <br /> <br /> Handsome Clint Walker is a US Marshal Dave Harmon who is driving in the territory of Yuma, Arizona in time to kill one of the great superpowers who are out on the road. <br /> <br /> Walker takes another brother to prison. Walker also meets a "cute" homeless Mexican child who is sleeping in prison. One night, Andres, as a villain and another man dressed as a military, takes the rest of his brother to the streets and kills him, pushing the murder of Walker. Not good for your first 24 hours. Walker visits the local army fort and places the commander chains. Big women hear about the deaths of their brothers and travel back in time to get their chains. The local local population, which the army changes to its beef in a short time, is also in the chain. When all these chains are ranked, Walker still has time to wake up to the local hotel owner. The murder-related military boy is dead, the local cattle buyer is tied, the Indians are making a lot of hesitant talk, and the climax brings the unlikely showdown because Walker has to prove to the city that the poor buyer of beef was a boss, someone we suspected of being too helpful all the time. <br /> <br /> There's a semi-sub-block that covers the death of the Walker family in the hands of army robbers, and I think it would have been a force behind it if it had been taken up. Instead, the movie ends sharply and I was waiting for scenes in the next week's exciting episode. Thanks to existing drops that do not exist on commercial occasions, it's all turned off and the story pops up. <br /> <br /> Walker is beautiful, rugged and has a deeper voice than well. The rest is full of television players you've probably seen in other television movies. Much of the activity is flat and violence is dull. The first brother killed the shotgun midtorso and falls without scratches. I did not expect "Reservoir Dogs", but this is the wrong film used to teach children about evil weapons! Speaking of a child, the Mexican child goes "cute" to "aneurysm, which causes annoyance" very quickly. <br /> <br /> If you don't like westerners, you don't like "Yuma". If you like westerners, you still don't like "Yuma". I can't recommend it. <br /> <br /> It's unrated, but it includes physical violence and gun violence. <br /> <br />
