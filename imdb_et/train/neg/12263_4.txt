Watching this movie, as I did for the first time on Turner Classic (which lists it as a "dangerous woman"), you can only increase your appreciation of the 1941 version of Bogart-Astor. Ricardo Cortez has to be paid for a smile. I hope he remembered his dentist and his Brylcreem seller at his will; they made him an actor. Women are all good, but not better. Una Merkel is a little better. More interesting is the "original" Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman, who are able to successfully complete many individual subjects, but hardly anything from changing atmospheres to their offspring in the roles of Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor surpassed in some way the resurrection of their symbols; here, Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) can't. <br /> <br /> This movie is not stinky; it's like a big ham ham. Its main value today is a reminder that big movies like '41 'Falcon' do not happen easily. On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate it to 4, mostly with camera work and supportive players.
