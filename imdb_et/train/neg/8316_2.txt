Cedric Kahn's films have been feature-based, not activity-based (I mean L'Ennui and Feux Rouges), so it's jarring to see this series of truly expert car rides that are confusing to give some Succo's character a few shocks. I don't find Stefano Casset an interesting actor; he reminds me of pro-athletes who have attracted films like Bret Favre. This empty foam looks like really annoyed deer caught in headlamps. A true actor would have forced us to reflect on Succo's personality rather than admire his skills in carjacking. <br /> <br /> Small action is mainly from Isild le Besco, because the poor schoolgirl Succo takes the storm. An interview with the police is a miracle that is wonderful and a little fear of the future. Le Besco does not recommend this movie.
