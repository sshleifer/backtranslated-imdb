I didn't know much about this movie until I watched it, but I heard it was related to quantum physics, so I was interested. I didn't know it was NOT a STORY, but a number of New-Age blasters who love their voice, telling them how little they know about quantum mechanics. I say it belongs to a more documentary category than comedy or drama. <br /> <br /> Marlee Matlin is in the movie to give * any order of events to this New Age Symposium *. The parts of his film are terribly stuck and are meant to show the speaker's thoughts that we are not going to die of boredom. Matlin has a real job as a photographer, unlike the New Age hippie that falls on his couch. We listen to the naming people who talk about what all quantum physics means to them. One of the bright spots of this movie was the Indian speaker (I assume), but I think he showed the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that Barbara Eden is really going and she is moving on to how quantum science has to do with her old New Age beliefs. It seems that the Quark from DS9 was low in cash, and he also appears briefly in the film. There are many CGIs that we should impress; The cells in the body are shown as a mold of Jello, because filmmakers have probably seen Flubber too many times. <br /> <br /> The people in the film say that the people of San Salvador Arawaki thought that the Columbus ship Pinta was invisible because the natives had never seen a sightseeing boat before, as if people could somehow know today. Of course, they all leave this information out and say, "Columbus ships were invisible to the American Indians." The film takes a lot of such lofty jumps. In 1805, Thomas Young made about a double slit and found that the light might sound like a particle and occasionally a wave. Of course you will never know this when watching a stupid movie, because the only reference is that "atoms can be particles and waves." And that means people can go through walls, walk in the water and never get old if they just want stars! Then I'm sure Marlee Matlin might be deaf if she just believed * hard enough. I'm sarcastic, but this movie is full of false hope and beliefs that people who support them aren't really busy. it confirms everything they believe in meditation, zero point energy, crystal healing, and so on. If these snake oil salespeople believed they were selling, they couldn't just * want * to have their pay controls in place of this movie? We listen to another unnamed man who has no credentials, talk on his couch in front of a fireplace (or on a TV screen) about how he creates his life. Every time he was on the screen, I wanted someone to hurry and throw a pie on his face. These people take themselves too seriously. Some other wedge-red boys say that no one has ever touched anything because there is a magnetic force that prevents it from being quantum. If only someone had walked up to the screen and had hit him on the stomach, "I don't touch you! I'm not touching you!" The moral relativist in the film argues that there really is "no such thing as good or bad." So it is probably OK that Hitler died of millions of Jews dying? Another person says "there is no such thing as love." It's just a chemical and we don't really love people, we're just dependent on the chemical speed we have around them. I suspect that this guy is making this movie as a community service to be so dependent on heroin for so many years. RoboCop. They appreciate whether women are cows, dogs or foxes, and the sexual position is bouncing. Marlee Matlin comes to the weddings she should take, and the next day she decides to love herself and the bath because she is a beautiful and unique snowflake. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie saying that people often find evidence of their previously planned concepts. Maybe I can only see in this overview what I want to see, but I really wanted to see these people see the pies on the face and it never happened. <br /> <br /> If you have never heard of the ideas in the movie, you may find them interesting, but here are all the ideas for better sources. If you want to watch a good movie about Heisenberg's insecurity, look at the man who wasn't there. If you would like to read a good book about Quantum Field Theory, read Hyperspace by Michio Kaku. If you want to see a film about imaginative visions of different philosophies, look at Waking Life (though it may seem boring, confident and terrible). All in all, you should look at Robert Anton Wilson's quantum psychology or Prometheus Rising instead of wasting this time in the film. <br /> <br /> Usually I find it difficult to make films 1-10. , but it was very simple for me: 1/10 stars. <br /> <br /> The movie's title is true. People in this movie don't know # $ *! Hands down, the worst movie I've ever seen.
