Well this movie has certainly been a fair amount of hype; From the Toronto Film Festival to the CBC radio commentary. Probably refreshing, crazy, fun indie movie. I would have been waiting for this for a month. <br /> <br /> How can I just say that? It sucks in a very big way. Practicing cinematic damage to cinema, which makes Adam Sandler like a comic genius. <br /> <br /> At best, it was easy to create a fun and worst coma. An American script that was badly targeted and disproved by ramshackle. And what about the music 500db louder than the rest of the soundtrack? It was about the only real strange thing. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a really funny, strange alien movie, try Repoman. No comparison!
