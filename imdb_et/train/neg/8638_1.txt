Actions, violence, sex and coarse language are the things characters do throughout the movie. And all they do is done without reason. Mark L. Lester is known for his violent (without reason) films (Commando, The Base). The story is strange but stupid. Actors play their stupid signs very well ... I don't say they are stupid, but I mean they are very bad actors. This is the second feature of the B series, which is unknown for the budget. If you saw something like Delta Force, Drive, The Patriot, Sanctuary or something like that misbegotten ... don't rent it ... and by the way, don't rent any of the movies I mentioned. I'll give him 1 and a half of 5.
