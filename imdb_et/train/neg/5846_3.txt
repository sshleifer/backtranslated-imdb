Yes, it's one of those movies, so terrible, so terrible, so thin that you can't stop laughing. I watched comedies, good comedies and laughed less than my wife and I laughed at this movie. Other comments give the idea well enough. The characters are so unpleasant that you rejoice in the rats, the effect is so bad that you don't know whose primary school class was responsible, the actors-- oh, the actors - talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing breaks. br /> But rat, yes, big rat. Why we didn't see the rat before I was finally surprised. Often, "big" is not displayed until the end, because the budget is limited and the good effects are so much money. However, I think that in such a case, a big rat was considered to be the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that they had the best boy who ran around, dressed like a borehole with a third world dentist. <br /> <br /> The ultimate part of the movie is the elevator scene. After explaining that the rats did not get a strong noise (migraine malfunction?), The main guy creates a fire alarm to send the rats to frustration. If you've ever wanted to see a few pairs of rolls, while blood spins your heads like a geyser, this movie is for you. Really, you have to rent it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> But not more than 99 Â¢, OK?
