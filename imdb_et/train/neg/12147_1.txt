This is probably the worst attempt on the Zombie movie I've ever seen. Terrible, terrible, terrible. All reviews on this site are probably the work of a filmmaker, a family of filmmakers or a filmmaker friend. How does this movie suck? Let's count the ways ... <br /> <br /> Plot? Controversial. Dialogue? Dreadful. I'm not hitting effects / gore because I understand it's a small budget. But was there even one zombie that wasn't obese? C'mon! And if the Rhode Island movie is sporty, why is this truck on the Massachusetts plate? Continuity, find one. <br /> <br /> Girl dances when soldier "Keeps attention". Please don't put your former girlfriend or friend's sister naked in her movie. It was a ugly film, full of stupid people, and he had no work on the Romero cover. Next time you decide to make a movie, don't do it.
