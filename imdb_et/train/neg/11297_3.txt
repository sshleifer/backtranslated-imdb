Jenny Neumann (American HELL NIGHT and others) is Helen Selleck, an American actress who takes the lead in Australian production. She is a virgin because when a little girl saw her mother having sex and accidentally caused a car accident that killed her. Meanwhile, the theater is surrounded by a black-clad killer, who breaks glass with people. <br /> <br /> *** BASIC SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> The killer is obviously Helen (she speaks with her dead mother's voice, launderes blood after murders and sees a killer bottle as a little girl!) , but it has free POV camera work and lies with the identity murderer until the end as it should be a big surprise. <br /> <br /> Whole cast seems to be obsessed with talking, talking about sex, or catching up, and in one case even blackmailing your way. There is quite a bit of nudity and blood, but there is no sense of consistency, photography is dark and editing (Colin Eggleston, who is also written and produced) is terrible. The setting for the Slate Movie Theater is before Soavi's name for the same movie and Argento OPERA (both better than this) for five years, but Neumann is pretty hot.
