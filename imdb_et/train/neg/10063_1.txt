Now I have never seen a bad movie in all my years, but what about the songs accompanying the film, what is its physiological meaning. WOW some demented Pokémon appear and they multiply, get hold of it. Animie is pointless, its makers are meaningless according to their big marketing plan, which is just a song cut and they get a good estimate that this movie would have been good if they put a message on what you need to see in all Pokémon episodes to understand what's going on and not not a movie. It's just an animation that should be on video. <br /> <br /> Ps: I'll give it to 1 because I just got 5 bucks that I couldn't give in half because there are no parties.
