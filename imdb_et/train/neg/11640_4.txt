Pier Paolo Pasolini or Pee-pee-pee, as I prefer to call him (because of his love for genitalia), is perhaps the most over-priced European Marxist leader - and they are thick on the spot. How somebody sees "art" in this unpleasant, cheap sex-romp feed is outside of me. Some "stories" could have come straight from the soft core of porn movies, and I haven't even referred to nudity much, but to simplified and banal, often meaningless stories. Anyone who enjoyed this relatively vigilant but foolish strange inconvenience should really sink his "Der Schulmaedchenreport" teeth into the 70's series of soft porn movies, because that is what Decameron looks like. <br /> <br /> The movie is sloppy on almost all levels, from start to finish: <br /> <br /> 1. Editing. Example: 1 hour: 15 minutes: 45 seconds is a wanted scene that is pretty clearly placed in the wrong place. It was supposed to be placed in about a minute, but I think Pasolini needs to have hired editors with little time to get the "fine detail" of the movies. The pee-pee-pee fans would probably be against it saying it was deliberately put there - which I doubt very much. Moreover, even if it were true, it would be even worse because this story doesn't get something that is harder to follow. (It's not exactly "Eraserhead" or one of Tarantino's broken form movies ...) <br /> <br /> 2. Acting. Vey sloppy. Triple Pee fans (all 8) proudly demonstrate how 3P-O uses "real people instead of actors". (Are there no participants? Or are they Mars? Of course, many participants have lower IQs, but does that mean we should despise them ...?) Other leaders have used amateurs and succeeded (eg Alan Parker or De Niro) , why PPP amateurs in their movies so sharply? The answer is awful again. Pasolini is sloppy in everything and it involves an effort to get as many of your teeth as you can. She's a lazy director if you want. Anti-Kubrick, I think ... The main purpose of Pee-pee-pee when casting has to be to find so many old teeth without teeth (and the young men who like him). In Pasolini's world there is a simple formula: lack of teeth + strange face = realism. It is all well and good to have them teeth, but at least try out at least half-decent performances of at least the inexperienced neo-thesplasts, otherwise you will be the amateur-amateur director at Pasol. Whether or not 3P-0 was able to do this function or just didn't care, nothing changes. (Who knows ... maybe he didn't even notice the horrible action?) <br /> <br /> 3. Sound. Synchronization. If 3P-0 felt that the microphones were too cumbersome in filming the film, he would have had to make a concerted effort at least in the production process, ie get all these generations to show their rows in the studio so that we wouldn't have to move around with the viewers when the hard-to-keep dialogue floats elsewhere in the film . <br /> <br /> 4. Lack of Definition. We have nearly a dozen stories that are in no way connected in substance. Some of them are anti-church (more of this later), while some of them are only sex yarns, i.e. cheap male (sometimes gay) fantasies designed for titillation and nothing else. Stories and characters are not at the fun (if any) intelligent level, but at the highest level. 10-year-old kids can laugh here ... And there's nothing wrong with that, but don't call it an exalted, intellectual art! <br /> <br /> 5. As a result of paragraph 4, there is a lack of logic in the order of the songs. It goes without saying. Pee-pee-pee might have had an order to organize in another way and we would have had the same movie. It also means that you are free to start from the middle, then go back to the beginning, etc. "Decameron" is like a spaghetti bowl: when you start eating it, you can start with any desired yarn, it makes no difference. <br /> <br /> 6. The meaning of song resolutions. Most stories end with cheap gags / jokes, i.e., some funny stupid users who are out of comic books, while some stories do not even come to the conclusion: they just end. Finito. At best, the stories are traceable half-doodles, hardly a deeper meaning - unless you find "deep" meanings in the porn system. Of course, there is nothing easier than searching and finding "meaning" if it is not. So even any hardcore porn movies can endlessly infuse. It's easy and fun. Try it, past 8 PPP fans! <br /> <br /> What about the Church? Some viewers are all excited about his attack on Catholicism. Basically, this is all well and good - I am an atheist myself, but what these people ignore is a simple but important fact that Pasolini was Marxist. It's like a pot that carries the kettle black. Marx, who criticizes the Church for hypocrisy and stupidity? Where does he get his nerve? Moreover, Pasolini was not an atheist, so his high and mighty attitude is not justified in itself. After all, Marxists are believers: they simply replaced the accepted god of utopia with the idea of ​​just another supernatural fantasy of desire. So I can't excite PPP anti-religious antiques. <br /> <br /> This sophomorphic humpdorama anthology ends with Pasolian words that he says quite deliberately: "I think ... Why produce a work of art, if it's just easy to dream it?" He didn't really refer to this stupid film as art, he ...? If he was - a poor deceived man, then I have to think about why he did not miss it and NOT do all these bad movies ... <br /> <br /> Want to read my modified subtitle Bergman movies?
