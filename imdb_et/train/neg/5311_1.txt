This is almost the worst movie you will ever see! 2012 Doomsday is currently pulling the rug under it for me. The props are a great example of what Frank Zappa called "cheepnis". Space scenes seem to have been made in a power plant in the 1950s just before the demolition. Music really sucks. Action is wood and ham. The characters they represent are low and convincing. The plot is predictable. It is immediately and coarsely obvious when copying techniques and ideas from other films. The quality of divination comes to faith. <br /> <br /> But you have to see it, only to experience what must be one of the smallest waste of a small budget. This is an invaluable example of a stupid movie!
