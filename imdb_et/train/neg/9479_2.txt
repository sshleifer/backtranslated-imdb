This movie seemed to be better than it was. Cinematography is good, the actor seemed confident, the dialogue was not too rigid ... but then about twenty minutes of the long scene there with the doctor you know is actually a patient in the shelter who decides to be a doctor - and it goes south. <br /> <br /> In addition, the demon is about the coolest hellspawn that comes from the look of Godzilla, cursed in the devil's spirit. There are also some strange worshipers of demons who wear masks that look like exploding teens from the start of Logan's journey. <br /> <br /> Finally, cinematography could not record this movie. Despite the rather strong performance of the participants, the story just goes nowhere. I think "Hellbored" would be a better title for it.
