Loved the original story, had great expectations of the film (especially since Barker had spoken about it in the interviews), finally saw it and what can I say? It was all MESS! Leadership is all over the place, the actor was scary, flashy visuals and choreography were just flat, empty and completely unnecessary (which, along with general music video techniques, such as fast slow and slow moonshine? It was stylish yes, but this film doesn't need it and it has finished some stupid music video from MTV Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo). Although some killing is pretty cool and brutal, some of them are ridiculously ridiculous (the first Japanese girl killing was fun and the death of Ted Raim was just foolishly funny). It fluctuates all over the place with zero voltage and voltage, completely away from the original story, and then back to the finals, which at this point just seems to face even more. No explanation was given, I thought I knew what would happen only when I read the story, but to people who were not yet confused because at times they didn't even know where it went and what it was trying to do - it went crazy all the time tangent. <br /> <br /> God, I really wanted this movie like a big fan of Barker's work and loved this story because he has a huge potential for a cracking movie, even enjoying some of Kitamura's movies in fun rhymes, but this movie was just a mess of amateurs and stupidity From the beginning to the end - I didn't care about anyone or anything, the whole thing was in a hurry and severely cut off the actual source, making it completely different. Vinnie Jones gave an excellent badass, but everything else was all over the place, more than a disappointment. Gutted
