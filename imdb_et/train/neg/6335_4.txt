It is a real shame that almost anyone under the age of 30 is not familiar with the "top" writing of Michael O'Donoghugh magazine articles and SNL sketches, which were genius ... and so is a real shame that someone who can take the opportunity to explore their own undoubtedly easily work out and watch videos - bringing them to MIKES MONDO VIDEO. <br /> <br /> This movie contains smart elements that are never completely connected to funny bone. The viewer experiences things such as cat diving / swimming with a man who thinks he has found cat luck by grabbing these kittens in a pool that the camera follows slowly and by mounting. Then we were taken to an island where all past fades have been retired (hula hops, pet stones, rainbow wig parks, etc.). D "rate bar performer Rootboy Slim presents" boogie till you puke "in your lazy dirt and eclectic gap. Now it's the real beauty in the back of the music. In many different styles, with many different instruments, TELSTAR sounds and repeats - for those who don't know Telstar, the first American satellite to be opened into space and the theme was created by the male genius and triumph. MR MIKES seems to be a ridiculous waste of social disintegration. Now there is one thing the theater offered to release the video was not a live performance of Sid Vicious (former sex gun) , not a wrestler, who sang MY JOINT. His version is very different from the Sato, but you can honestly feel it is very worth listening to ... it's good! It's a sad part of the release of VHS Paul Anka refuses his about the rights of the song and the viewer is forced to experience 3 1/2 minutes of silence with the explanation that moves over the picture of the singing dead sex pistol. <br /> <br /> I'd give the theater 5 or 6 videos closer to 4 and now, if there are so many, I can see where many people would give it 3 or 2.5. If you want to see a good O'Donoghugh script that is SCROOGED ... it's a better respect for men's knowledge and talents.
