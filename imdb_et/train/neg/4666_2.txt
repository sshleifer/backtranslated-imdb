This film talks about a Japanese woman who has an obsession with skin calligraphy. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely odd. I don't see any "sensual" or "erotic" undertones. The plot transforms the form of ancient art into fetish pornography. In addition, the scenes shot in Hong Kong are definitely bad parts of Hong Kong, such as a city-center airport, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the film, I think the "Pillar Book" offends Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment. <br /> <br /> "Pillow Book" is a perverted but boring film. Seriously away.
