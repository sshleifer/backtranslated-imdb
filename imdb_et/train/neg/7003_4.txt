(aka TRINITY ON STILL MY NAME) This sequel seems to have been made to take advantage of the outstanding success of European post offices. Also in America. It is too bad that they didn't come very far, because Hill / Spencer's pictures have been only marginal in the US, and this largely boring, shrunken film doesn't help it in any way. <br /> <br /> Trinity and Bambino swear to their dying father (Harry Carey Jr.) to become a successful law and take care of each other. Later, they participate in arms dealers who smuggle weapons with weapons and who mistakenly think they are a couple of federal agents. It all comes to the surface, despite a couple of funny scenes, especially where Trinity and Bambino are in a fancy French restaurant and don't know how to wear themselves. The shark scenes of the card were also somewhat humorous. pretty good. I'm not sure if I would like to buy the audio track for this CD, but some others might do it. <br /> <br /> The film could have been half an hour off and it wouldn't have dragged it for so long. There seems to be a lot of chew here. In fact, I lost about two-thirds of the way against it. The DVD is also terrible, the soundtrack has a constant amount and a bad print that looks like it should have been sent to this big ice well in the sky. <br /> <br /> A big step down from the previous movie. / 4 out of 10
