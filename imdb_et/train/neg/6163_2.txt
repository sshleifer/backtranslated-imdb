Hooper is not funny, not fast, not romantic and not informative. There is no real drama. You think a movie from the world's biggest stuntman would be a drama, it was an experiment, but it didn't seem real. No Character Study, no lesson, he didn't even see that the actors were really fun, they just tried to act like they were having fun. There is no reason to look if you don't want to look at Burt and want to get a glimpse of Sally from time to time. Prancer, the horse was beautiful and did what he had to do. In fact, Prancer was the best actor in this film. Smoky and the bandit were such a fun movie that I was ready for a fan like. This movie turned out to be a real disappointment and a waste of time
