We hope this is the ultimate nightmare. It is good things that are bad. Okay, it's still fun, but only in the most obvious sense. Rachel Talalay had been in the franchise for the duration of the franchise, had been in the production plant and produced it evenly. I don't know what he meant, but this attack is accompanied by a boyfriend and a visitor to the appearance of a human videogame. Tom and Roseanne Arnold! I wish I had a clue what he meant when he wrote / directed this disappointment. He even tried to discourage his audience from the fact that this film was nothing more than a film of glorious popcorn, rather than wearing any similarity to horror using the 3D end. Are they not glasses? And you have to keep them! It's the equivalent, you just spent $ 9.00, which made me rich. Here's 10 cents. Don't you feel special? Sorry, but for me it didn't make me special. <br /> <br /> And Freddy had another face lift. That was the worst in my opinion. All of the fine art that went into earlier films in his appearance has been replaced by apparently cheaper and less detailed prosthetics. She looks ... less than the burnt victim she should be, and as she is a skin disorder. Changing the lead like this to the series is at the same level as changing the leading actor. But wait! They've done it and done it. So I think it's not important. But that's important to me. Freddy is no longer SCARY. He's just ... another little rented monster like Leprechaun. <br /> <br /> It's more ... a dark comedy than the horror that this series promises; they are talking about what can only be hoped that the writers thought it was a clever one-liner and a smart repart√© (unfortunately it was incomplete for both accounts). So there is nothing more to say than grabbing a popcorn and laughing at it, because there was no scary and stopping moment in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's 3.2 / 10 since ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
