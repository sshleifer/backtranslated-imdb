Maya is a woman without interest. He just dreams of his life and suckers why he doesn't feel like filling. This may be an interesting topic. It would need a good story, a nice device and good dialogues. They don't have any of them. This movie is totally boring. There are only lengths and no peaks. The only climax is Shahrukh Khan. But even though I'm a big fan of it, I couldn't endure that movie. Even he can't leave that movie out. The film is not as bad as "King Uncle" and if you are an Art-house fan or as it is slow, you may like it. It's not funny, it's not interesting, it's not catching. My suggestion: Don't look at it.
