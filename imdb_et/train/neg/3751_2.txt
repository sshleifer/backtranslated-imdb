I'm a big fan of David Lynch. However, this film was a rather disappointing experience. Apart from surrounding background music ?? what really sets the mood for the movie? it has almost no attributes I have associated with Lynch's work. The visuals are insignificant and the dialogue is vague and monotonous to be interesting. <br /> <br /> It seems more inconvenient for film students than trying to make an artistic dogma film as an experienced director. I've seen many amateur movies with much better camera work, landscapes, sound, and script. This film has almost no artistic qualities. I feel like watching a video from one of David's homes produced with friends on the weekend.
