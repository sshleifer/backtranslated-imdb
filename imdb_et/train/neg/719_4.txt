This film, though seemingly comedy, is deadly serious. The subject is Imperialism (Capital I): how Britain, foolishly, humiliatingly, tries to convince itself that it is still a great force after the Second World War. At home, the empire is led by friendly bucks, good-willed theories so bred that they cannot distinguish their close relatives; government agencies consist of long unforgettable archives (Orwell's digging of Paranoia?), where stupid rats and ante-spaces live in a dull synthesis of the cabin, reading popular novels. <br /> <br /> Old Pomp; but out of context it looks coarse and stupid, especially when it is worshiping. Carlton-Browne is an unpleasant picture of the decline, with no lachrymose rotten that allegedly won an anti-imperialist jewel in crowns. <br /> <br /> The film also speaks during the Cold War, bravely admitting that it is a dangerous farce whose participants deserve mockery and contempt, not fear and respect. This is how colonialism, which is characterized by more negligence than tyranny, destroys the colonies that this desert is abducting, from comfort, power and, most importantly, self-esteem, leaving them vulnerable to the mechanisms of dangerous cowboys. /> This is of course a serious difficulty that kills it. This does not mean that compelling topics cannot be dealt with in comedy - Morgan's Creek, Dr Strangelove, and Brian Life have all proven this. Indeed, it can be assumed that serious issues should only be dealt with by comedy - this will allow a clearer look. <br /> <br /> The problem with Carlton-Browne is that every situation must have significance that is not limited to comic, so it becomes weighty and uncomfortable. In the three films mentioned above, much of the comedy comes to an extreme situation, not to an extreme situation. Here the script is too weak to preserve rich comic book descriptions, and some of the biggest comedy talents ever put together - Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, Raymond Huntley and John le Mesurier - have been wasted. <br /> <br /> Terry -Tooms, the supreme so often, show that he was unable to control the wires and that he had to play the sneering, noble borders, not the brains of toffe. Music has been made to carry a great deal of comedy, but its hard irony only draws attention to the lack of fun on the screen. (To be fair, unlike most of the British comedies of the time, which were stagnant and underestimated, Boultings often tries to score through films, editing and composition). Only Huntley can make a real laugh and this is the essence of the essay that she could play in her sleep. <br /> <br /> No Boultings career is quite good - they are never well thought out. Although Carlton-Browne rejoices in the fall of the empire, it seems to be democratic and militaristic. I am sure it was not meant to be, but these mistakes have certainly happened when you promise worthy intentions over comic intelligence and film form.
