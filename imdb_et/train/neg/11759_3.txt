That's not the case for those who are looking for fine South African miniseries in the 1980s. Nor is it a historical drama. Rather, it is a terrible little fantasy that has nothing to do with historical Shaka, but only uses its name to give the Sinclair idiotic story of a African superhero, a combination of Jesus, Lincoln, Superman and Nelson Mandela. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are some ridiculous moments, such as when Shaka interrupts the cross to which he is linked, and captures some serious slaves. You know how Jesus would have done if he hadn't been such a wimp. <br /> <br /> True, I only saw the 98-minute version, but I can't imagine that twice as much mess would have been better. <br /> <br /> And what is Mungo?!
