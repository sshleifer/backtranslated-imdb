As a graduate of film studies, I would like to think that I have seen various films, some good and some bad ones, but I have to say that "summer rain" is by far the worst film I've ever seen! I chose the movie in the hope that it was a great British classic, like "Secrets and Lies" or "Lockstock", but oh it wasn't so bad that my flat buddies and I laughed as a ridiculous actor and cheesy script (reminded me of a bad theater at school) . The main characters Michelle and Gary started to annoy us from the beginning. "Michelle", the main character who lives with her two friends, is the type of face you would never be tired of, and Gary was so wet (she cut off the tears every 5 minutes) that the movie was not really fucking filmed by either of them. All I thought was that I paid 3 pounds for this cat. I've never written a review before, but after watching this movie, it has encouraged people to warn of this catastrophic production. So please avoid at all costs. Thank you for reading.
