There are three types of bad movies - cheap, boring and tasteless. the only very bad movies are boring and tasteless. boring movies are right, boring - if you do not leave fast enough, you sleep. <br /> <br /> Delicious movies actually have their own protectors; however, it is true that they are masturbating aids for very sick people. <br /> <br /> Only the cheap bad movies are really funny because the filmmakers wanted to make their films so desperate when they crossed their movie. capabilities and available resources. <br /> <br /> Bo Derek is, of course, boring and tasteless; Fortunately, fate and lack of financial resources and skills redeem him, making him cheap. this movie is fun and it can be the last really funny-bad movie ever made. <br /> <br /> I saw it for the first time in the theater, God can forgive me; I laughed so hard that I had run off from my seat, and so with most of the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> it is clear that Derek and his wife's promoter have been thinking about this film, satire; unfortunately, the dereks had no clear means to pull it out; consequently, the "satirical" element comes out, because some schoolgirls are impressed by the impression that some young man's young man sees Batman as a mystery who tries to pretend he is a robin - it doesn't drive over our heads, he has no idea where any human head can be. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, in this movie, some of the allegedly serious moments - this should be an action movie - remember - what is so amazingly cheesy, one wondering if someone sprayed spoiled milk in the eye. <br /> <br /> When Derek's infamous tendency to reveal his breasts - I cannot imagine a less erotic photo of nudity, he is so weird, looking at these broad shoulders, t imagine what someone ever saw him. <br /> <br /> like the plot - as it is - is not; Derek pursues Africa and God alone knows why. then his father - Harris - pretends to be acting on a manic doll doll, and of course there is a hunk'o'Tarzan that seems to have wondered about the ad without knowing that the subject has changed - probably because he has not seen the script - probably someone no it is not. <br /> <br /> Blank camera work, dirty editing - if it wasn't a 3-way chimp, the movie would be unbearable - <br /> <br /> as it is, it's a real hoot.
