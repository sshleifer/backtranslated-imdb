This movie made it one of my 10 most terrible films. Terrible. <br /> <br /> There was no continuous minute where there was no fight with one monster or another. There was no way for any character to develop, they were too busy driving a sword fight to another. I had no emotional bond (except for a big bad machine that wanted to destroy them). <br /> <br /> Scenes were stolen from other films, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> Examples <br /> <br /> The Spirit scene ended with the last scene of the old Star Wars Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /> <br />> In the beginning, the spider was just like Frodo, whom the spider is attacking when the kings return. (Elijah Wood is a victim of both films) and wait ...... it hypnotizes (eats) her victim and wraps them up ..... uh hello ???? <br /> <br />> And the whole machine vs. people theme was Matrix .. or Terminator ..... <br /> <br /> There are more examples, but why waste time? And does anyone tell me what was with the Nazis?!?! Natside ???? <br /> <br /> There was a story about minors attacking minors' conclusion. The film was unable to decide whether it was a children's film or an adult film and whether it was big. <br /> <br /> Just terrible. At least, real disappointment. Save your money.
