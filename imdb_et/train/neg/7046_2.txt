I saw HBO's Comedy Channel had this boring waste of time, so I was quite innocent and probably assumed it was comedy. But here's nothing funny. Good pain is basically wasted on a script that I could have written with my left butt - after the 15th century inquisitors were so futile. The first half is particularly bad because it has a somewhat dull, pointless dialogue that I have met for a while, and a zero decimal point to talk about. The fact that such a small movie contains stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones, and this film has less than 1,000 votes on this film, should tell you everything. A few nice strokes that hit the cold British coast, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is made just because the people who wrote it are good connections (family ties, preferably) and / or plenty of money.
