The words "Sweden" and "Action Film" do not mix. It is becoming more and more evident for every experiment in the genre. This is another failed attempt. <br /> <br /> Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) works on a military air base with super secret computer systems. One day, foreign criminals are threatening to hurt his family if he does not do what he says to him. They want secret equipment and do it all to get it. <br /> <br /> This movie is up and down. Usually there are no "ups" in "Swedish" movies, but "downs". So I think there was something good about this movie. To begin with, with positive comments, I can mention that the film is well done. The images of flying planes and helicopters are well photographed and very beautiful. Operation is of very different quality. Shanti Roney performs well, while Maria Bonnevie is traditionally rigid and unnatural (I don't know how long the Swedish leaders will use her, although she has the skills of a wooden plaque?). Stefan Sauk is ridiculous as a "cool" special force that starts the base to explore. <br /> <br /> And what about scenes? Well, as I said, the scenes of planes and helicopters are beautiful. But there is not much to talk about. And this is a common problem with Swedish films. There is not enough action yet. Maybe it's a budget problem, maybe it's cinema. I don't know, but it has a negative impact on the experience. Because frankly, the story and the behavior are not good enough for this movie. <br /> <br /> I appreciate it 4/10.
