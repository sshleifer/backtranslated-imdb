This movie is abomination and its making should have been a capital crime. <br /> <br /> One of the greatest secrets of filmmaking is why no one has ever made this wonderful secret a faithful film. This is the story of a truly engaging mystery, nice old-fashioned romance and dry English humor. Why did the makers need to turn Richard Gordon's Scottish yard into a policeman's amateur detective, introduce his English servant's idiotic role and caricature, change the main story about the murder charge and the circumstances that save Gordon in the fight against the accused, etc. etc? Those manufacturers and managers who always think they can do better than a book should write their original script and not rape another person's product.
