This is a bad remake and a bad remake of Bimalda's classic Parineette. The story is based on Sarat Chandra's book of the same name and it is a distortion of the original. One can understand a certain creativity, but not count on creativity. Everything affects and the whole movie is shameful. Choosing the words of Shekar's father in the abuse of Lolita (Balan) sounds cheap and gets sick and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again, the scene in which Shekhar (Saif) lolitale slips, is rather uneven with the flow of film and characters, is rather dirty with respect to the senses and could easily be avoided. Similarly, the sex element between Saifi and Balan is cheap to attract film and audience, cheap. If the creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys the spirit, the work will be broken. The song "piyu bole" is pretty OK. Another silver lining in the dark cloud of this film is the scene where Saif stands up against rebels against himself and his father. It is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit. In these stories, this film deserves 3 stars. Rekha's song and dance smells artifice and it is put on. The song is loud, but I remember hearing it somewhere before and if Iam wasn't right, it seems the voice is plagiarized. <br /> <br /> Well, they agreed that times have now changed. But this film does not even reflect today's times. <br /> <br /> This happens when modern Bollywood filmmakers are increasingly obsessed with the impressive factors of NRIs and the lucrative NRI entertainment market. Such films do not belong to India or any other part of the world.
