I only lasted 15 minutes before being spontaneously pulled me out of a burst of stupor that this film effortlessly called and pulled me back to the armed video store. <br /> <br /> A bad saying of a movie would be a bad forgotten opportunity to use words mixed with the keyboard's top key characters (only to keep those comments clean). <br /> <br /> One must be avoided. <br /> <br />
