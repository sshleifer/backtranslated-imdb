I really don't have anything new to add, but I felt I had to comment on this bag. So here goes: <br /> <br /> Atrocious. I run through my MST3K DVD collection and looked at Hobgoblins for about a tenth time. It's really, really painful, but it was on the list ... You see that there is a small kernel from the actual movie buried in all the "Hobgoblins" crap, but it just didn't get out. All this film is the fourth rate. Story, actors, consequences, women, "action scenes" ... ahhhh forget it. I can look one after another like "Dr Z" blood flow (also called "Zaat") over and over, with little interference (I like it factually, it's in TCM later this month) October 2009), but "Hobgoblins" is a whole "sign". <br /> <br /> The worst part of this may be that it is about 12 hours after the end of the movie, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and dry toast, my drugs and more ersatz "New Wave" dance music that Amy , Red Shorts and Laraine Newman collided in the living room, BIRTHS ARE BY YOUR OUTDOOR. This torment lasts for days. Good luck, isn't it?
