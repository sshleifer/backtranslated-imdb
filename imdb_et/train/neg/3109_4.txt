This movie was not terrible, but it wasn't very good. I'm a big fan of Toni Collette. I think he is a very beautiful and talented actor. The film begins with Robin Williams, a writer and a book about a 14-year-old child. The book is great and he doesn't believe the child wrote it. Toni Collette plays a child's guardian you don't know if this boy really does or does it all. I'm not destroying the movie, but I say this movie is not scary. <br /> <br /> The actors are pretty good and Toni Collette's production was fantastic as Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the film was a big disappointment to wait until it arrived on the DVD.
