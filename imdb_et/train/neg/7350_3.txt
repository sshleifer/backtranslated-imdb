Despite the really bad reviews I had to give this movie? After all, the star of the HK super-baby Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental love team, which are all kinds of cat-burglars. Are you sure to watch it? Well, as babe-fests go, Martial Angels is hard to beat. Eye candy is top quality. Shu Qi looks as fantastic as ever, and the rest of the girls, especially Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang, were with my eye-catching eyes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, if we want to evaluate this movie at some other opportunity, it's an absolute shaker! The story is weak, the action is bad and the special effects are totally pathetic. Director Clarence Fok and producer Wong Jing have given us photogenic and small others. <br /> <br /> If Shu Qi is the only reason you look at it, it would be better to watch Sex and Zen again!
