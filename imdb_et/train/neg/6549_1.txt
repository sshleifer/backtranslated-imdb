Not that I want to be meaningful, but this film surprised me a lot. Throughout the movie I was like ... erm ... what is this movie? I can't get animations at all. This film is probably only suitable for those who belong to the 1980s. A number of people have stepped out during the movie. After the movie, many people said, "Is that?" Frankly, I can't believe that this movie got the best children's film award. If you are thinking of watching this movie, I suggest you do not. You regret it. I'm not kidding. You'll find that you just waste both your time and the money you go and watch.
