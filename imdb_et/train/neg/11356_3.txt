It's not a good movie. Too preachy parts and story lines were sub par. 3D was OK, but not great. I was almost asleep at this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about 3 young flies who want adventure and follow-up. There are no characters, I really don't care about these characters and I don't feel like adults. Pixar is not. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to see more special 3D effects. I would also like to see more birds joking than mother constantly saying: "Lord of Flies" Pretty sexist, showing women as women in the house and fainting.
