When I borrowed this movie from a friend (luckily I didn't buy it), it was printed on the packaging (which really seemed bad and ugly) was printed in the "Final Vampire Horror". After watching, I thought the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the film itself. The "story" begins when a vampire / zombie creature captures a teenager (surprise!). <br /> <br /> Lighting, sound, and everything reminded me of the first attempt to make a vacation shot for ten years old VHS, if not worse. I gave the movie from 2 out of 10 and just because the promo-T-shirts seemed cool. I don't want to exclude film students or splatter films in general, but I've seen Braindead and I've seen a $ 20 budget movie from students that was ten times better than that.
