It was a silly movie with a predictable story and terrible action !! Willy Nelson was as strong as his ribbons. The film seemed like a very long ad for Jessica Simpson's bright red lipstick, especially as she had so many close-ups on her face. The prerequisite was not amusing and as I said - soooooooo predictable. Whatever the money spent on making this film was shameful waste. Any hints on other old Marilyn Monroe films did not enhance the look of Blonde Ambition at all. It was so incredible - Jessica Simpson was able to take the executive secretary on the hat - it was ridiculous !!!
