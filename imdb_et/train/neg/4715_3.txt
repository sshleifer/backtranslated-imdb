I recently looked at Johnny Test to find humor in it. I failed, terribly. The Cartoon Network usually has a tendency to show its audience to all audiences, but Johnny Test is "entertainment" in its lowest form. Writing is incredibly predictable, and running gags are not at all gags. Children love it and it's about it. <br /> <br /> It doesn't mean it's all bad. The original opening theme was actually quite memorable, but for some reason they took this skeleton and broke it with a figurative aluminum bat. It is a disgrace because it was really one of the best things he did for it. <br /> <br /> Some characters may be very interesting in theory. With little work, characters can work well together, but they are too one-dimensional. Then it's easy for kids to follow. <br /> <br /> The pace is also too fast. Episodes are too busy, leaving little time for smart writing. This is a real shame because there are so many interesting concepts that the show brings. On the upside, however, fast paced children prevent losing interest, and this is indeed the target group. manage to be funny or interesting. This is a show I want, but I can't do it. There is so much potential that is not realized. Kids enjoy it, but that's it.
