A movie that makes you throw a sword. I've seen Schlock in my time, but after watching the terrible confusion, I don't think I can watch another movie again. God can repent of the souls who did it. <br /> <br /> The Quiet Point of the House-ex-Army, the underwear model type (well-functioning) is looking for a girl who sent her a map of military personnel. . Land with a living-granola-type family in their cabin, who are right-hand loggers. The family takes her and it takes 2 hours for our chick to see that she has a better harvest than her liberal appearance, French wine drinking, porsche driving, loud mobile phone talking, lazy, city slipping, Jewish looking. > <br /> Bad-1d characters, 1d themes. Beating the Pro-Military theme. Ed Asner. <br /> <br /> Good-trade breaks were long. Peter Jason. It ended.
