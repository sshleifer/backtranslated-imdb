Please, someone stops Ben Stiller from acting in NO FILE. Write studios, hell, even write local congressmen. I'm more laughing at the funeral, but I'm still looking at Stiller. Jack Black tries to do something about the disappearance of the comedian, and Christopher Walken, perhaps the greatest actor of his generation, just sees embarrassment to be there. Stiller is his uncomfortable, but now, even if someone rescues him, he proves that he is too comic. No wonder why this movie was very badly displayed and was only available in a few weeks in dollar cinema. I warn you, and you have to warn your friends, don't look at this flick, it's just terrible, worst than Gothika (personally I never thought I'd say it), the worst plan 9, the worst Ishtar, the worst then the Golden child. Please, Hollywood, give up Ben Stiller's admission in his films, he's not funny, he's a godly actor and he brings others with him. The next film was in 1st place because negative results are not allowed, so if the board says one, I'll give him zero.
