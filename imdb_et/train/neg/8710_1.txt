I haven't seen the first two - just what is called Primal in England. I don't think I'm bothering to look at them. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible movie. Terrible action, bad dialogue, cheap rubber monsters. All this is so nasty. The most sympathetic characters really die fast and leave you annoying, especially one named Polchak, who is an incredible jerk. No one lives in the military for 5 minutes. She was aged, but I was happy when she finally chewed my head - I had nightmares that she was going to survive. The Colonel also had garbage - all moods storms and helpless shouts. And the lovely doctor looked and acted like he was porn. I waited for her to take off her glasses, shake her hair and become a vamp, but she didn't. I'm sorry that because it would have indefinitely revived the film. <br /> <br /> Roger Corman never used a decent movie once?
