The only movie I've ever been out of. Amazing because I paid for myself and my date and I'm really cheap. But my brain could no longer shut up because I could have written more funny materials when they were stuck and gagged. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, this movie is offended. Worse, it's not funny. Then it wasn't funny and it is definitely not funny. Worse still, this movie is really the beginning of the end of a smart, sophisticated comedy. It is a minor, really sophomore script and the idea began with the era (which continues to this day), where cheap laughing and sexual innovation dominate the culture of film culture. <br /> <br /> Sexual Olympics? What's a high school kid not thinking about? The beginning of the end.
