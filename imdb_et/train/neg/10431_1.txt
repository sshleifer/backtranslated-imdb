I loved the first season. The quality went down slightly in the second season, but still had a high average (Pegasus!). The third season was quite new and original and was OK. The fourth season started to go down quickly because they never started to give us any explanations when we now really needed them. What the hell was Cylon's plan? Why were there two Cylon factions? What was the point of the wrecked Earth-1 led by Angel-Kara? What was the past of the last Cylons and how did they live or were they reincarnations? Questions everywhere, answers somewhere. <br /> <br /> And the end will come. Earth-2 (our Earth) in the past. Well, okay. But destroying the fleet?! Technology abandonment and abandonment of any city life and a few thousand people on paper thinly spread! Not only is it anti-science, it is anti-cause and anti-life. The philosophy of the exhibition therefore seems to be that mankind is trapped forever in the cycle of natural romance to a decadent capitalist society that invents destructive A. it destroys everything. It is without vision, without the hope of a greater future for mankind, and it is contrary to proper science fiction. And don't even get me angels! Making the worst religious attacks! Final disappointment! <br /> <br /> The whole thing "all this has happened before and again" should be associated with the previous incarnation of the series, not just the Earth, as we know it. Changing the new exhibition to the old situation would have been the final move in the genius. Fraky shame. 1/10.
