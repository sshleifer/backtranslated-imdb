I didn't like this Bill Murray vehicle when it first appeared in the 80s, so I tried to look at it again to see if my film has a delightful impression in my 80s or whether "Stripes" is just a bad film. Well, the verdict is and "Stripes" is a bad film. or who are Bill Murray fans, but it's still a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Why is it bad? Mostly because "Stripes" should be comedy, but it's not that funny. Some laugh, but they are little and far away. Most of the film consumes a dramatic plot that is incredibly complicated and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is particularly noticeable when you are accustomed to more modern comedies such as "Anchorman" who try to laugh at every part of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" is further suffering from Bill Murray and Harold's lack of Rami's ability to act. Bill Murray is a great comedian, but at the time of his career he was not a very convincing dramatic actor and Harold Rami plays Harold Ramis. These two aren't just as good as the actors who carry the dramatic arc of the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, most of the comedy that is in "Stripes", Bill Murray revolves around the nature of the human child around the smart alec, so if you don't find the character funny (as I do it) did not do), you will not find most of what small comedy "Stripes" is funny. "Stripes" is a film of its era, it is not well aged and is not worth watching. If you want to see the "friend" comedy of the early 80s, I would recommend "Stir Crazy". Like "Stripes", "Stir Crazy" humor is not as fast as modern comedies, but unlike "Stripes", it is much more obsolete and as a result it is still traceable.
