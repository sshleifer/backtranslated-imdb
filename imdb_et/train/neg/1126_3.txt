I rented that thinking that might be interesting, and it could have been an interesting story, except what was said in such an uninteresting way. Difficult to follow, strange editing, divergent story, characters mumbling, all the terribly faded waste of time. I just didn't get it in and don't care what happened to the cases - even Ian Holm couldn't save that movie. If you don't need to treat insomnia, I missed it. 3/10 and it's generous.
