I probably won't give this film a fair shake because I couldn't see it all. Maybe if I could see it in the theater, I would have appreciated it in the original presentation, but it's too slow for me. <br /> <br /> I read the book about 25 years ago and the details of the plot have disappeared from memory. It didn't help the movie because it's less live and clear when it comes to presenting events. <br /> <br /> It's really four linked movies or a four-part movie and I thought it was going to be over four nights in a theater presentation. I found Part I quite enjoyable, but it was all I could do to sit through Part II, which pulls endlessly. Reading Tolstoy's philosophy is one thing. If you have a good translation or you can read it in the original, its brilliant writing will weigh all the problems that may be the speed of the story. However, it is difficult to reproduce the film without being embarrassed. <br /> <br /> I have other problems with the parts of the movie I saw. It is a very splashy, with a lot of camera work that brings attention, rather than passing on the story. <br /> <br /> It is clear that I am missing something, but I just couldn't call the enthusiasm for parts III and IV.
