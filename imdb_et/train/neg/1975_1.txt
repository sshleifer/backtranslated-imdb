To be absolutely honest, I haven't seen many Western movies, but I've seen enough to find out what's good. It is by far the worst western planet today. Come on! Who ever thought it might have been a cool wall movie that everyone would love would be a little slow, not a complete slowdown! Secondly, women on this day and age, especially black women, had no tendency to wear and / or use weapons. Asian chick talking about perfect English? If the device is west, Asia is not in your hands. Finally, the evil gay chick was too much from the beginning of the movie. Now I'm not wrong that I'm not racist or white, so you can't read it after that, but this movie is the film's worst presentation of black people I've ever seen!
