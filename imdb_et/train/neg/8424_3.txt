This movie can be appreciated from three perspectives: as history as the Amin profile as a fancy thriller. <br /> <br /> It fails as history, mentioning the overtaking that kicked out the Obote, expelling the Asians, and has the Entebbe hi-jack as the backdrop, but not chronologically consistently. Amin's profile may be interesting because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good, and if it were a better film, he would have been an Oscar. (She got it - which proves that the Oscar voters do not watch the films they vote for.) It ignores the important historical episodes of the novel that observed the history of Amin and Uganda from a medical point of view. Instead, it speaks of the fictional story of a Scottish doctor and his impossible love life from an American perspective. But this story is one case Amin was probably innocent. There is no plot in the fancy thriller to keep it together. The beginning is tense - it takes cinematic freedoms with the novel, but creates a story. The character of the doctor is well defined but loses the resulting film in the other half. Why does your doctor decide to stay in Kampala? Why he's no stranger to his friend. The novel's essence is lost, because Scotsman has a black doctor instead of a thing that is a ridiculous obstacle that doesn't seem to be weakly believable, but allows the film writers to show Amin wildly close. A person called a horse is at the end. Finally, in 1971, Uganda left, not right, with three stars and two or three numbers - and where are the equator's cones? In a nutshell - if you've never heard of Amin, you could spend two hours watching this movie to understand Forest Whitaker's behavior, but the last hour you were confused. If you know Uganda or you have read a book - you can't see a movie - it just puts you down. And if you want to know why your doctor was so stupid - he wasn't.
