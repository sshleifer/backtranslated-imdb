I read all of these comments here, how it's a good movie. Jeez, this movie was predictable and quite boring. Operation was lower than most of the time, especially by McKenna. I have not seen a more pathetic attempt to make a "badass" movie with anyone. Oh man, this movie was stupid. I also read somewhere that it could be a cult classic. I know there are followers of the director, but this movie was just an average movie. <br /> <br /> The script was flat, mostly flat, this movie was flat. <Br>> <br /> Oh and pray for the one who was in Cheers before. She looks really bad. <br /> <br /> The best actor in this movie was probably in the office room and he was only in this movie for about 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
