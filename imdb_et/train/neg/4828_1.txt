I took TRAN SCAN from the library and brought it home. We have considered the trip and thought it would give us what it was. The movie was a waste of time when I went to buy it, I would call it TRAN SCAM when I saw it cost $ 49. <br /> <br /> The DVD ran for 8 minutes and showed a skater across Canada where I feel bad, when they went up and down, and around the curve, when the film was at high speed. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of video material they probably did about it and you think they could have made a better product. If I wanted to do this project, I would have given more material to stopping traffic signs so that people would know where they were and see the terrain. It should take 60 to 90 minutes to make such a movie. Oh yes, the incident said it was a stereo, the whole movie was a ringing sound of an accelerated autoclave, but at least it could have been put on music. <br /> <br /> If you want a good cross-border movie in Canada see The Railrodder / Canadian Film Buster keaton (the last movie he made) in this comic book Buster Keaton goes to Nova Scotia and goes to British Columbia
