I've seen all four movies in this series. Everyone goes beyond and beyond books. That's the worst. My problem is that it doesn't follow a book whose title is in some way! Directors and producers should have called it other than "the lasting joy of love." The only thing in this movie that is similar to the book is the names of some characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). Children's names / ages / gender are wrong. The whole story is not in this book. <br /> <br /> I find that Janette Oke, her books and fans, have a great service to produce a movie under her headline that is in no way correct. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they have no emotions. <br /> <br /> If you want a good family movie, it may be. It's clean. Don't look at this when you look for an abridged version of the book. I hope this is the last movie in this series, but I doubt it. If more movies have been made, I would like Michael Landon, Jr and others to get closer to the original plot and storyline. The books are great and if they are carefully monitored, make great movies!
