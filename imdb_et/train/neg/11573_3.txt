I came here for an overview of last night before deciding which TV movie to live in, and the ones I found saw it invisible. How misleading I feel! <br /> <br /> First of all, it should be pointed out that this is a very housewife day in the movie. The performances are wood, every sentence is an attempt to "torture" so that the housewife's daily films and bad soap operas are always based on this predictable and disgraceful assumption that men (especially soldiers) are essentially violent and disproportionate. The whole film speaks of a "drama" that occurs at moments when male characters are threatening to develop another dimension. <br /> <br /> If it sounds tolerant (or even enjoyable), you should be warned. Linda Hamilton's German accent, though pretty good, is painfully disturbing - just like her face, for some reason. Other performances are undoubtedly a source of persistent embarrassment for their criminals, as painfully thin and obvious testimonials are on the agenda. There are few surprises, but look at Monty Pythonesque's endless foods and drinks that are wonderfully appearing in the bags of hungry soldiers! <br /> <br /> I didn't expect action, but I was hoping for a beautiful or textured or emotionally charged. I had a particularly bad Christmas feeling with an intelligent audience that tends to hesitate. <br /> <br /> Look at it under the following circumstances: 1: There is nothing else. 2: You are a predictable "housewife fan who takes men and wins TV movies. 3: The only way you can appreciate a real story is when Hollywood turns it into a feature film. 4: You're so impressed that your emotions are easy mixed with sophisticated storytelling.
