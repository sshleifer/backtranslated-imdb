Someone has to send this Uli Lommel man to MOVIE SCHOOL. Who ever said he knew how to make a movie? Is it POSSIBLE to USE FILMS these days? There is always a need for TALENT before anyone can make a movie. After watching this lamb BTK movie and the other things he has done, it is obvious that a poor man has so many business making movies as I do. In fact, I think I could even make better movies than Uli LAME-ALL. This film has nothing to do with BTK Killer, except for the names of the victims and the killer. That's it. Where did the man get the big idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other naughty crap that is in the movie? This is a classic example of someone trying to tempt people to look at the concept of their movie "BTK" because it has become famous. Absolutely pathetic. The only series of killer films I would consider in WORSE is that we have a flat "DAHMER" movie. This boy smoked so many cigarettes that made me frustrated. Anyone who did this must be let.
