usually I am not afraid of horror movies, but this movie is an exception. some about how this movie got in my mind! this is a very simple film, but at the same time extremely effective, it is a great atmosphere and it brings some shocking moments, the girl's father who comes down from the mountain is a real challenge. Another saw a family photo I didn't expect and I jumped from my place !!! I would recommend seeing all of this movie when you come out for a long time !!!!!
