I have never seen a 1973 senior highly rated version. I'm a fan of Nicholas Cage (by the way, fine works as usual). This movie probably took all five minutes to pull out the whole plot (I see that it is done with a cocktail nap at dinner party) if you can't figure out the end of this drum within the first 30 minutes you'll probably find this movie fun. It's, late, a terrible rut that Hollywood seems to have dug for himself with a horror / mystery / thriller genre who can't give the audience enough credit and write a fresh, intelligent, and upbeat scenario. and throw in a few things to make a small jump and then send the final printout to your local theater. At least, this camera was not accompanied by camera syndrome.
