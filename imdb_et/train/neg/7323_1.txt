Well ....... unlike other comments written earlier, I have to say that the only good thing about this movie is that one guy in it seemed a bit like Jason Donavon, which reminded me of his youth. I have no idea how this award was won, and while I'm sure a great deal of effort went into doing it, it was all fruitless because the end result is what screams from foreign soap operas from the early 90s. The plot did not exist, cinematography was hopeless and the action was at a level that was level. Unfortunately, this was a long and sub-line unbelievably unrealistic .... for example .... if your best friend was up for his 6-year-old ex-boyfriend in just two weeks so you wouldn't be all the best friends. It was all fantasy. That is all! Oh yes, and the weird 90's / soft core indie was anesthetic of the mind!
