With a story and a scenario that seems to have been written by a high educator, "Art of Seduction" is unable to provide a romantic, sophisticated experience he is trying to bill himself. Two main characters can be interesting - both male and female leaders are "swinging singles (or the female driver involved)", but "The Art of Seduction" may not even try. The abandonment of the honest character of these two character personalities: "The Art of Seduction" casts on the essence of a thin, lean stereotype. <br /> <br /> The art of seduction is offensive - insulting his characters, offending men and women, and insulting his viewers' expectations. It takes terrible beautiful people we all know and play their painful communication, waiting for us to idolize them. Ji-wan is an immature, spoiled, manipulative female. The viewer has to wait and give her mistakes because she is beautiful. Min-jun, well, he's exactly the same. Nor are nice people. The humor of this film revolves around the extreme experiments of Ji-wani and Min-juni to overcome each other in the art of loyal lie and manipulation. There is no sign, and we will never know why Ji-wan and Min-jun are such. We are expected to take them as they are and not ask questions - they are cute! Great references to the prominence of the main players in the reviews of the Azin Cinema Scenario can suggest you the "Art of Seduction Low." <br /> <br /> If you are still in high school, you liked Grease or you are a victim of yellow fever, you like this movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a very good date movie.
