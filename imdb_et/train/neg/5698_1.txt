I almost drowned in CHEESE watching this movie. In fact, I couldn't even finish it. I want my money back. Another Hollywood weak attempt to come up with a new idea. The good thing that I keep the lemon season in the refrigerator. Just in case. They should give Nic Cage a hat and bull. Swashbucklin '. Cage Presentation When Arizona is lifted or leaving Las Vegas, it will win a "lemon". People who are fully and completely marketed (and most of them are) should love this movie. If this film had been animated, I would have taken it seriously. I'd rather pay to see a totally stupid movie that didn't try to hide it. In my opinion, it was an incredibly stupid movie and it made an even more amazing attempt to hide this FACT. <br /> <br /> All SHEEP seems to love it.
