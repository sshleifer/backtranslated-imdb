I really tried to like this movie, but in the end it just didn't work for me. I've seen most of Kitamura's production and found it to be very variable. In life, as in all his films, there is an interesting plot, some great sequences and fair creativity. But these features are painfully deficient in Alive. The plot is cool, if not all original and could have made a real ace movie. Unfortunately, this pace is painfully slow and the film takes time to get before you reach quite predictable places. The action is almost satisfactory, with the final battle being pretty cool and the previous one OK. There is also an accelerated camera work that reduces coherence. Some pure visual effects and interesting ideas circulate in the dialogue, but the film still draws badly. The characters are neither well-established nor well-functioning, and the setting and overall color scheme are drab and boring. The film is not totally terrible and has some points of interest, perhaps the wise use of the pickup button can fix it. About twenty minutes of running time can be a pretty decent sci-fi thriller. But the full length movie is boring. Recommended only for very patient and determined Kitumura fans.
