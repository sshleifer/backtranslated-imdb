The film's action is really honest, but the film is so slow and so boring as soon as it's interested, everything slows down until it stops. I'm glad to see that Sam Rockwell is in it, he did a great job, just like the other actors I mentioned, but the man ... this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Now, perhaps in a short film, this film may be good, but not. This film has so much filler that makes Twinkie cake jealous. <br /> <br /> I've never been to movies ever, but watching it at home with my family, I went out. Yes, it was boring. Probably my comment does not have enough lines to post, so here is another filler. I think I was inspired by the film I was watching.
