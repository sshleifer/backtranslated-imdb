.... this mini does not improve with age. I saw it and it is a sequel when it was originally sent, and as many others were blown away. In early 2002, I borrowed novels for both WOW and W and R, and it was even more impressive. Then I decided I had to see both again and invested in $ 200 plus DVDs. I looked at both minis again in painful details and realized that I had done things back - I should have bought the novels and borrowed a DVD. <br /> <br /> Don't you think it's insecure? Read the novels and see for yourself. Don't think it's dated? You can see it for someone who is not old enough to see that it originally delivered and looks at the reaction you receive (warning - the reactions of such people range from fear to laughter). <br /> <br /> This mini - Dan Curtis himself chose Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum. Yikes !! Production Quality, Music Assessment, Dialogue - A great story turned into an over-ambitious producer / director for the 70's operation, which was over his head. This was the date when it was ready. <br /> <br /> These two minis were great when the original ether and those who saw them dragged a nostalgic string that reminds us of the younger days. IMO - This miniature does not match almost its reputation and does not get lost seriously.
