I'll start by saying that I didn't get it completely. I chose this on a rainy day from WalMart like the rest of the site's reviewers. I thought I had no chance of regretting my purchase. Did I be wrong or what? Seriously now, who approved this project? They must be forced to watch this movie forever. This is the only appropriate punishment I think is something bad. Shooting reminds me of the films I made for classic projects on the big old VHS camera. A working isnt not much better. I think the only difference is that there are some cool fires. Yes, who cares ... Shecky Moskowitz is uncomfortable and the ship's comedian is even more loser. It's about as much as I understood. <br /> <br /> In general, this is the worst film I've ever seen. I own it on a DVD and I've given it to many co-workers. Everyone comes back and laughs and says, "Wow I doesn't think I'll ever say I'm closing Adam Sandler's movie for 15 minutes ...." <br /> <br /> My answer is always "Well now you can" < br /> <br />
