The film is bad. Just terrible. Bollywood's bad movie string doesn't end! They have to run out of such terrible films (or not) for excuses. <br /> <br /> The problem seems to be mainly with the directors. This movie has 2 good actors who have proven in the past that they have the ability to deliver great performance ... but they were so badly targeted. Bad script did not help. <br /> <br /> This movie is a lot of ridiculous moments and very bad editing in the first half. For example: <br /> <br /> After the first major concert, Ajay Devgan will meet Om Puri (from whom he ran away about 30 years ago and spoke again) and all Om Puri finds his caution with his friend Salman !!! What is the burden of nonsense. Seriously. Not to mention the beaver's soundtrack. What happened to Shankar Ehsaan Loy? Ajay Devgun is a complete failure of rock star depiction. <br /> <br /> Only sustainable grace is good results on the other side. Ajay looks as if his character shows his blind side. So is Salman as a drug addict. <br /> <br /> Look at it only in the last half hour.
