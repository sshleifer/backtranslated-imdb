I felt that Rancid Aluminum was a total waste of two hours; The work of the camera was somewhat experimental in places, and although it was seen by the director trying to convey it, it made the viewing even more difficult. Rancid One of the most annoying aspects of aluminum is the general use of narration throughout the film, just as the entire plot is dictated to the audience. The best performances had nothing to do with acting. In fact, the most convincing result for all people was Dani Behr, although he is a stereotypical office secretary. NEVER go and see this movie unless you need to get lost in sleep, it is definitely a better way to spend your hard earned money.
