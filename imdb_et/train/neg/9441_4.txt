this movie was forbidden in England? why? tom savini, george romero, dario argento, lucio fulci and others had done much worse and continued earlier because ... ... this film has all the decent elements of the 70s or 80s horror film. good looking girls (who by the way don't get to save their lives), a terrible lightning storm that is a hidden well, a rainbow, a crazy brother who travels around a family heritage, and actually a pretty damn good twisting at the end. but banned? seriously. When the English Parliament banned this film, the Italians probably smiled their collective donkeys when the British were upside down and proudly. <br /> <br /> There was maybe two minutes of total screen time devoted to violence and gore (which was largely lost). there was nudity, but there was no sex, although obviously there were clues to sex. but nothing is forbidden. <br /> <br /> I would like to see what could have been done if filmmakers had a decent budget. as it is, the movie is entertaining, but the lack of image and sound quality will make the end result. <br /> <br /> disabled ... what a joke ...
