This movie is ridiculous. Anyone who says he's acting is great and the casting is great has never seen a mediocre cinema. Action is probably terrible with the first five characters. Lame. I feel that all other "rising" comments must be made by people involved in filmmakers. I wasn't very impressed with the fairy tale, but I wanted to see some beautiful Oregon countryside and there was some decent cinematography - but it was something but inspired. I think this film also gives a glimpse of the generally noble proposition that something that is deep in Amerindian culture has been ignored and perhaps lost and that its revival is useful and possible. It makes jokes in the wrong and too obvious places and makes me think that it has been written by a state agency or something. Back to the drawing board. To even assume that this film deserves a place in the same classical place as Harold and Maude, it is completely slowing down and the same begging and pretext of "joking" as rampant in this film.
