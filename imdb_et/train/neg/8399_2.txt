I'm a big fan of Stooges, but one and only redeeming quality is that Curley is in it. Prepared long before he started to drink, he is a classic himself (and Larry is not bad). The character of Moe is a straight part (mostly), and this film would be better named "Curley and Larry Movie". Not that none of the Stooges films would be very good (in my opinion), but as one of the commentators here said, sad is that this movie was real. The casting was good, it was well-managed, filmed and edited, but the story tried to be something serious because some Stooges antics and musical numbers (which I would have been good at then) were thrown away. Do it yourself during the movie itself, if you really believe it needs to be better than lawn mowing and trash removal (which is under discussion) is to wait for Curley / Larry scenes and sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat the rest of it at that time.
