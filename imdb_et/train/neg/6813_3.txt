Jean Rollin's artistic mess about vampires, aliens and immortal aspirations. <br /> <br /> Women are beautiful and stunning in photography. Dialogue is nasty. It's a ridiculous mess. Great to look at, but for any horror or thriller purity that is just terrible. I'm trying to figure out if we think we're afraid or not. At the same time, is it put on or not? It is a strange mixture of artwork and horror that is never quite eye-catching, and although it is nice to look, there never seems to be any meaning, and it is by no means intimidating even when a random image or a sequence creates a moment of freshness. pretense. Something that would leave a living wall paper for those who love naked women.
