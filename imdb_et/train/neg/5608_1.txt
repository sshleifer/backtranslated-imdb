I was curious to watch this movie. Many people seem to be excited. I also have my beliefs. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I am open to all kinds of views or opinions. It does not matter to me whether Jesus would exist in the way written in the Bible. If Mary was a virgin or not, or all other similar pagan coincidences. For me, the idea of ​​redemption, the idea of ​​love, is the only way to find peace in this world. <br /> <br /> What made me angry when somebody takes a sentence, presents it as a fact, but presents it as a fact, but without showing the context. For example, in this film they showed a great sentence: "Those of my enemies who didn't want me to be their king would bring them here and kill them before me" Jesus (Luke 19:27) What did they do? t say it is a context. Jesus told the story of the evil king. There is no passage in the Bible where Jesus supports the killing. He is love! After they have misrepresented the Bible, they bring us peoples (pseudo-Christians) filled with hatred. Most viewers do not check the information provided to start thinking about Jesus = hate = not good for me or anyone else. This is pure manipulation. Please use your brain. Don't take everything they say in this movie. We are destroying our foundation, our civilization, when we begin the demolition of Jesus in this way and the message he brought to us. You saw the branch you're sitting on.
