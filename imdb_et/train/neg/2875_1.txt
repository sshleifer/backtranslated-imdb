This is the biggest piece ever. They seemed to spend more time, effort and money on the DVD cover than they did for the actual movie. I really thought the DVD was off with someone's homemade porn until I admitted one participant's cover. This movie looks like someone did it with a hundred bucks and a camcorder and they spent half of that in rats. The image is really clear, but with very unfortunate lighting, cinematography, if you can name it, production, acting, if it's actually what they do, and the script, if they have one, makes this film look worse than old porn. At least old porn is the point. It just looks like some PETA members got together and decided to make a really distracting, pointless PSA about animal rights and feelings. It is not so worth the money or time. It has nothing in common with the actual BTK serum killer, except for the name of the killer and some victims. The people who made this movie should be happy that he is still not free, or he could have come after this bad screwing.
