This is the first time I've seen a movie with Jamie Foxx and I bet it's my last one. I couldn't see why he was funny, although the audience's people thought it was very funny when he made a face on the camera, or saying, "I'm going to shower." <br /> <br /> The plot is completely predictable. A bad boy comes after a good man. A good boy is a woman, so a bad guy uses him. Sometimes the officials move together. The latest scenes are absolutely incredible. You spend two years and millions of dollars to make a boy, but you don't do your homework to solve a trivial riddle? <br /> <br /> There is no big deal, no lot or story and shooting is done in MTV style. Don't waste your money on it. <br /> <br />
