I wanted to see a satirical action comedy (because this movie was talked about), but it couldn't help me. For me, tracking the plot was a bit confusing and I lost interest quickly. I feel sorry for John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tome and Hillary Duff for getting this movie. I'm a fan of all of them, but only this time can heal over it. One thing I can say about the film positively is that Hillary played the character of Yonica so well that I didn't even recognize Hillary; it took me some scenes to understand that it was her. Fortunately, I rented it for $ 1 through Red Box; I had paid to see it on the big screen, I would be really smoky!
