This film was unable to study the humanity of animals that left me with an empty feeling. [Spoiler in front] I wasn't convinced that Dr. D was a truly weighty reason to give up a big buyout deal to help his furry friends. When Babe (the original) created trends for big budget hits, focusing on the human virtues of animals compared to their peers, not all of the animals in this film were comic cartoons that would be happy with the meat mill (even more so if one could understand their meaninglessness) . Without Eddie Murphy's reviving behavior, this film would be a flop.
