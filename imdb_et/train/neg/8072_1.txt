(Possible spoiler or two) <br /> <br /> "Soul Survivors" is probably the worst theater release. Nothing makes sense at all, there is a girl with strange visions of people who may be dead or not. The whole movie is just a bunch of random techniques that don't match at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Action is non-existent, camera work is nervous and the script is so confusing that it makes the movie even harder. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for something more to tie the movie, but nothing came. Definitely the worst film of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
