I decided to see this movie because it got a good result in IMDb. But many people really have a bad taste or someone has confirmed it. In both cases, it was a real disappointment. The film is just as stupid and far removed as the title suggested. There really is no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here it goes: it seemed that somebody would have thought, "Wouldn't it be cool to make a movie with stomachs on the plane? And then the snakes for some reason will go crazy and bite and things?!?" And that's it! The plot is thin and unoriginal. Snakes are bad CGIs (but it makes sense to cut corners to the movie that no one in your right mind wants!). Action is bad and all people are incredible stereotypes. <br /> <br /> In summary: this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen - away!
