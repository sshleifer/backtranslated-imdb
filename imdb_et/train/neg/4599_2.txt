The proverb "Never Fear a Book with this Cover" was a warning to those who don't see the surface. <br /> <br /> Since I looked at "King of Ants", I immediately thought of HORROR! On the cover and on the back, the beautifully depicted cute image spoke of a blind vision, synopsis of the story of murder, betrayal and punishment. Instead of what I discovered under this surface, it was less interesting than what you find under your medium stone. <br /> <br /> "King of Ants" is Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, an average man ready to make a name in this world, even if it means murder. Except for Sean Crawley, someone you don't care for has never felt compassion or compassion for that character. In fact, he is quite unlikely, but not as much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews), who turns to an uninvited performance that has made everything worse because of the totally ridiculous dialogue he is forced to say. Throw Kari Wuhrer as a grieving widow with apparently unconditional confidence (especially among homeless people) and little at all with no wits, and George Wendt as a Duke who is basically pleased as gratifying, but MEAN! <br /> <br /> Now there are a couple of interesting "hallucination" sequences in this movie (source of cover images), but this movie never goes to this world. It prefers to bombard you with unimaginable characters, bad dialogue and unlikely event. Oh Horror!
