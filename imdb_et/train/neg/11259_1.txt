I gave this film 1. I don't understand how Ettore Scola, one of the biggest directors of Italian cinema, made such a movie so stupid and ridiculous! All the stories of the people involved in the film are irrelevant, boring and interesting. Too long, too boring. The only thing I record in this movie is Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann. I hope that Scola will radically change themes and style in her next film.
