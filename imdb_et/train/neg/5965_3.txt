In 1454, French witch Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) was pressed and her mistress Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) was tortured to death, accused of witchcraft, vampireism and lycanthropy. Before they die, those who go to their followers. Today (70s), Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends, Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriana), attend a session of the Alaric de Marnac spirit. They decide to travel to Hugo's family estate in Villas de Sade to look for a hidden treasure monastery. They find that Alaric's head and sly have them, bringing Mabille back to life and filling local people with sacrifices. After his father's death, Elvira (Emma Cohen) reminds him that he has a hidden well in the Thor's Hammer Amulet; with Maurice, they try to defeat the demonic Alaric de Marnac and Mabill. <br /> <br /> Last weekend, I bought five Horror genres with five Paul Naschy DVDs for $ 9.98; despite having no references, I decided to use it. The first DVD with an uncut and restored version of "Fear of rising from the grave" is B (or C), which immediately reminded me of Ed Wood. A ridiculous story has been revealed by a terrible scenario, direction, performances, cinematography, ornaments, special effects and publications, and by many naked women. The result is just fun and I can guarantee that Ed Wood's style is back. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not Available
