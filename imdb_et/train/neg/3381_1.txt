This can be the worst movie adaptation of Broadway music. Even music has been destroyed. Attenborough does not know anything about the theater - almost every stroke and the current series is wrong. However, I say it's almost funny to be funny. <br /> <br /> Hairstyles are dated significantly. I can't figure out what is meant (conceptually) by opening the movie to the exterior of the theater where "A Chorus Line" is played. Do we have to think that these people are listening to "A Chorus Line", which contains stories of people who listen? Oh no, the show is collapsing. <br /> <br /> I saw the original production and listened to it hundreds of times. Why, oh, why did they do that?
