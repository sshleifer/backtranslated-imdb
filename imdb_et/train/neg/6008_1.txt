If you've made a mistake about watching a movie before reading a movie, don't give up that series. I bought a copy of the first book in May this year and I've almost finished with the book 10. I dare say the movie is a trash that doesn't make a series even for sniffing justice. Although "Left Behind: the movie" only follows the "left behind" (book) story, the characters are not even accurate. <br /> <br /> Some examples: Rayford never acts his feelings about Hattie (he's already when he's been informed about legions); Buck Williams is a blonde hair, journalist, not a TV reporter; Chloe is at Stanford and lots of book details Rayford thinks he will "survive"; Buck and Chloe do not respond much later, at a meeting in New York founded by Hattie; Irene and Raymie are never "in the book," but simply in terms of Rayford's setbacks; the way is a jam full of wrecks after Rayford and Hattie return the helicopter in the suburbs ... etc, etc. <br /> <br /> And that's just the first movie; they release the third. Please, even if you did not like the movies, give the book series a chance.
