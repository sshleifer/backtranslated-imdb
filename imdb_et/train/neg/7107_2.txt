I'm sure there is an IMDB cult that likes movies that MST3K has fun with. After seeing this and the "werewolf" and reading dozens of comments about how they were submissive, I was convinced that there was some conspiracy here. Many people say that people who hate it are just fears, "don't know good horror" or such things. Well, I really don't care about gore, but I want SAMETEN in the movie! Most are just a woman sitting and looking around! Or walking around the house / garden! The film requires something to give the atmosphere, you just can't get it with a useless scene when someone walks and watches. Oh, and "Do you think"? Yes i was thinking "MOVE! YOU @ # $ 0 &% !!" One of the worst fear movies I've ever had! <br /> <br /> P.s. For record I am a big old fantasy fan, Dracula, Frankenstein, such things.
