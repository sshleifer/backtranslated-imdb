I'm never a member of any club with me, <br /> <br /> especially that. <br /> <br /> Starr Andreeff is one of the mother / stripper who attacks <br /> <br /> the female vampire and remained dead. He starts looking for blood, and meets John Savage, who looks at how he left Michael Cimino's phone number. Savage <br /> <br /> is also a vampire and wants to join Andreef with his little vampire <br /> <br />, which consists of a British vampire, a blonde vampire who <br /> <br /> attacked Starr and the green coat (I don't do it <br /> <br /> up). <br /> <br /> The family does not want Starrit, so they try to kill Savage and Starri boy and Starri boy. <br /> <br /> Nobody forgot to tell John Savage that this is a drama. He <br /> <br /> spends most of his screen time showing more faces than <br /> <br /> Hugh Grant Jolt on Cola Bender, and he reads all his rows as <br /> <br /> movie Farrelly Brothers. Andreeff tries to change <br /> <br /> most of the badly written roles, but the scriptwriter / director Ruben goes to <br /> <br /> clich√©s from all vampires like Starr, who eats his son's pet hamster <br /> /> and buy a lot of raw meat to fight blood. The child <br /> <br /> goes a long way, for those who think that watching is <br /> <br /> violence is really fun for children. <br /> <br /> The movie is extraordinary, but not wild, up like "Killer <br /> <br /> Tongue." Here is gore hard and never justified, it just happens. <br /> <br /> It's just in the budget. Most of the R-ratings go to Andreeff's <br /> <br /> co-workers who are put into the conversation scenes <br /> <br /> on embarrassing ribarutins. The budget does not include <br /> <br /> vampire rupees! All the vampires here have to eat their prey. <br /> <br /> A great idea if you haven't seen George Romer already <br /> <br /> Martin. <br /> <br /> Even after 77 minutes and when you are in Ruben's quest to throw <br /> <br /> arty (slanted frames, vague scenes), this one is <br /> <br /> tiring, boring and a dirty ride. Leave this club and take a shower, <br /> <br /> you need it. <br /> <br /> It is rated for strong physical violence, weapon violence, sexual <br /> <br /> violence, strong fears, strong contempt, female nudity, sexual <br /> <br /> references, drug abuse and the situation of adults. <br /> <br />
