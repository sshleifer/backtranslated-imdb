"Unhinged" is one strange little movie that has been forgotten about the golden age of the tagger genre. It's really difficult to write a satisfactory review of this movie simply because the film is so unique. Its plot is quite overrun - three young women attending a rock concert get into a car accident and get into an eccentric old wife and her spinster daughter mansion. Very soon, ladies understand something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noise in the attic. Moreover, it seems that the mother and the daughter have a very strange relationship because they are intensely quarreling with their household at dinner. The old mother even goes so far as to call her daughter whore and bitch and accuse her of having a night-time boy to sleep with them. Halfway through the movie, if one girl finally decides to look for help, killing begins. <br /> <br /> As far as it works, this movie is on the bottom of the barrel. None of the three troublesome girls can act, especially the "leading" girl. It is almost unbelievable to hear that they give their lines across the film the same, wood tone. Mother and daughter are better, but not much. The film is partly quite boring and really pulls. The killings are tough, but something we haven't seen before. However, as mentioned here, the movie really gets points that have a very annoying and gory end. It comes entirely from the left and has the same shock value as the end of the classic "Sleepaway Camp". Unfortunately, the rest of the film is drilled and suffers from a dreadful and boring, boring pace. Isolated, creepy mansions and blind predictive luminaries give the film a terrific realism, but it breaks fast when one of the signs tries to act. It may be worth it if you can stick to it, but I say you are better off than the last 10 minutes. 4 out of 10
