This is an interesting idea bad. The hidden meanings in the art that the serialist leaves as a hint, sounds intriguing, but performing in "Anamorph" is extremely slow and without much interest. There is no other way to describe the movie except boring. "Anamorph" is the only interesting part of death tips. Everything that connects them is annoying. Willem Dafoe gives a reliable result as a researcher, but has little to do with a script that reaches the limit. Several supportive character actors have been wasted, including Peter Stormare as art expert James Rebhorn as police chief, Paul Lazar as medical inspector, and especially Deborah Harry, who is on the back of the DVD, but there are only a few lines spoken through the cracked door. Not recommended. - MERK
