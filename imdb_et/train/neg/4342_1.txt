I have to say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. They had a pretty good story to go on, but if it shone so badly. First of all, everything is wrong, where is it peeble (crap actress btw) and puff-father came? It looks like Carlito has come from the hood and hanged with some real idiot. This film does not make "Carlitos Way" justice. I'm so happy that the first "Carlito Way" came out if I had seen the garbage first, I would never have got a pacino version. And still, pacino should read this story, I thought it was crap and made it a step. Carlito Tea: Rising to Power - One in 10. Carlito tea - 9 out of 10.
