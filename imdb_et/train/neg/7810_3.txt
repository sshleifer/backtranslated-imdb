The film is very badly made against all hopes, sometimes it hurts. This is Michael Madsen's first film and it shows that he's not that good. Some people find the story ridiculous; the alcoholic realizes that his life and family are breaking down so that he calls the preacher as a last resort. After telling the story to the preacher, he accepts Jesus Christ in his heart. <br /> <br /> I found many religious scenes, like when Cecil Moe (Madsen) goes to church but walks pretty realistically. I also liked how Cecil knows that her life is breaking and trying to get help, but she understands that only God can help her. Finally, with the help of God, he understands that he can re-live without drinking. <br /> <br /> This movie is not well done at all. Operation is bad, the script can use some work and looks worse than my home videos, but that's a good message. Now, just because you become a Christian, it does not mean that you can automatically prevent addiction or heal your broken family, and Cecil understands it and works hard to stay. In general, if your Christian appreciates how this film represents Christianity, and if you do not, you can find yourself to learn more about religion.
