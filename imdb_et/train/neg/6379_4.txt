What about "Gayniggers from Space Space", how could you go? Just throw in some of the star-related stereotypes, use villagers as the main suppliers of soundtracks and throw away a ton of gay gags. The plot is not important. Too bad, this movie does not contain any of it and every joke remains. The characters all look like a German gaynigger, one or two jokes, the rest fails. My expectation was probably high.
