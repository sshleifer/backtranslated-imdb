A very strange, but occasionally elegant, exploited film that doesn't have a real story, but that benefits from its stunningly charming leading actor and a handful of pleasant, harsh make-up effects. Daniella is a beautiful twenty something girl with rape trauma at age 13. Nightmares and hallucinations lead him to believe that he is a reincarnation of a female ancestor who was claimed to be a werewolf. She kills her brother during the meeting and arrives at the hospital. He escapes again and randomly controls more men for police detectives, doctors and relatives. It's all pretty nice to watch and listen (really great sound), but the lack of plot and continuity becomes quite fast irritating. Luckily, the leading lady Annik Borel rarely carries clothes and fills the boring moments dancing around the naked fire. The film is too long, too weird and too forgotten. Ultimately, the biggest surprise comes when suddenly, and out of the blue, director Rino Di Silvestro tries to believe that his film is based on real facts. Share, of course ...
