To overcome the death of her husband, the old man does what someone naturally does in his job (at least in Peter Greenaway's movie): he and his son are eight and a half (one not leg) of their home and sexual odyssey. This is a Greenaway movie with a lot of pretentious and uninteresting blabbering, and of course it's an unnecessary man. In fact, the father and son share the naked sleep. Gross. Besides, who wants to see the full front of an old boy? For those who do not belong to the homo-erotic scene, one of the women wants to make horses hateful. There is no story - just a random set of boring scenes.
