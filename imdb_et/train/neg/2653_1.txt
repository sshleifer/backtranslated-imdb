I couldn't believe how terrible this movie was; I rarely look at commercial channels, but I thought, "Well, Diane Keaton is always worth it." I'm standing up. Anyone involved should shame their heads. <br /> <br /> I understand that women of certain ages do not have a lot of great roles, but its script is so intuitive, clich√© and amazing that I am surprised that she ever got into development or that Mrs Keaton thought she was can remove the silk from the ear of this sow. No character had disbelief and they were so incredibly unlikely. Acting looked like exercises in the BEGINNING class - I looked at most of this wonderful fear, thinking, "What were they?" Very sad that it has come here. Don't waste your time.
