The sword - and - the sorceress story of a terribly cruel and brilliant "hero" who destroys the evil king is worthless in almost every detail. Action is terrible since the supporting roles. The filthy, despicable joy with which the director shows the hero's blood is totally disgusting; nor is it redeemed for righteousness, for he is as bad as the people he fights. Z-film editing is abundant, including a scene where the sword "dies" from a sword-thrust, which is obviously completely unanswered! <br /> <br /> The film is clearly banking for female managers, Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson, who are mostly naked throughout the film. As a 20-man man, there is no way that female meat on the screen will not attract me. But the treatment of these characters is so humiliating and sexual scenes so casual and joyful that I couldn't even enjoy this aspect of the movie. <br /> <br /> Most of this era's cheesy movies are at least somewhat redeemed frivolous, tongue-in-cheek feeling (sequel is better at this point), but DEATHSTALKER seems to be completely serious about heroic fantasy. Not possible! Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 out of ****.
