Recently I watched it again and there is another version that is shorter in 1999. I feel they are the same movie, but I would like to know that it is different. <br /> <br /> One is a Japanese language and no Pikachu short is all I can come up with. Otherwise, why vote twice for the same movie? Prof Ivy was quite bored. He sounded as if he was almost asleep, no expression of the few lines he had. <br /> <br /> It was quite enjoyable, but it wasn't at all. <br /> <br /> The collector (who after Lugia is not going to destroy the world) and the usual characters who try to stop him because they try to hit Lugia is a lot of destruction. <br /> <br The following pokemon movies are a bit better, deoxys (7) are big, no. 8 almost here.
