The assumption sucks me in, but for about 30 seconds it was clear that it was either David Lynch or something serious terrible. It is interesting to look only through the fundamentalist baseball. I can be a disturbing spiritual piece (Romero comes to mind), but it was not spiritual. The message seems to be that we all have to pretend we have 80 (or just get lobotomy - Jennifer, what happened to ya) and blindly follow the Bible without any self-analysis or launch. This is the attitude that makes people fly into the jumbo rivers at 110 galleries (I work around the corner of the former WTC of Estonia). I like to think that God is a little bigger than that.
