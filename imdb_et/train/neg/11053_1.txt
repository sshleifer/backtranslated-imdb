This is one of those "so bad is good" movies that you always hear, but never see! Unlike Troma movies that are deliberately bad and campy (and I'm not amused), it's 100% pure serious. <br /> <br /> However, features such as supposedly super-deadly killer robots, which prefer about one Solid Gold Dancers on an acidic journey, and a magical first mate who calls the flash and transforms into a good sorcerer of the East that he takes himself seriously a bad edge that makes this whole circle entertaining. <br /> <br /> That's why you are attentive enough.
