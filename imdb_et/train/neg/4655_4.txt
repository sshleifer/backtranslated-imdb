I wanted to give the drawing blood initial suspicion. The moments that open up the naked woman, and the painter Diana, who painted her and then sucks her blood out so she can use it for her art, gives the impression that it may be a shocker - a vampire teases. It turns out that this initial impression turns out to be wrong. Oh, Troma, a sign of a lack of quality: sometimes they offer something that is trash but funny and at least with some competence in junk food (or sometimes not). This is a case where it is not even a lot of fun to watch because of his humor (ie, the main character's father is an old vaudevillian, who makes Jimmy Durante's impressions?) At best weak and Sergio Lapel's all the unwanted laughs. <br /> <br /> And it's not without him, Lord Lord. He tries a lot, which is a big part of the problem. He and his producers had the money for the lights, but the way they were used in the film made me, a former student filmmaker and an ambitious director, to break into my seat: when I saw it in the theater, I have to keep my eyes blind in many cases and do not know if indeed, his DP understood the basic 3-point lighting device. Although this, along with very weak sound design (or just a lot of random sounds like art gallery scene), should not be something that should be * basic * during Troma release, which the filmmaker can solve even if the script is not very funny or scary (and it is not) or if Lapel makes strange mixes of songs after strange moments. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie for any stretching, and maybe if you are a vampire that is hard (or only a vampire period), it may have some complaint as an alternative to low rent buildings or a slight improvement compared to such as the Blood Freak of 1972. You have better chances of wasting your time.
