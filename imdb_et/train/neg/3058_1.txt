When I was in my childhood in the 1970s, every Saturday and Sunday afternoon there was a child's matine in the local theater (does anyone remember them?). They showed this thing one year at Christmas. I and some friends went to see it. I was waiting for a cool Santa Claus movie. What I got was terribly duplicated (you might say) and a really horrible movie. Satan (some fun in silly fucking costume with horns!). The pictures were up in my seat. I always found that Santa started horribly, so it didn't help. The devil boy did not help. But what really frightened me was the wooden deer that pulled Santa. When they did these wounds and the horrible sound they did and the movements, I remember having nightmares for these things! All these years later I still remember that walking out of this theater I walked more than a little disturbed about what I saw. My friends were so scared. I just saw this ad on TV and all those nightmares came back. It's a creepy, annoying little Christmas movie that apparently frightens the pants who see it. Avoid it - if you really don't want to punish your children. It gets 1.
