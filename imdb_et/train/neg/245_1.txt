In the shadow of doubt, Mysterious Planet is one of the worst films ever made, but keeps its heart affection, because its special effects of poverty and the amazingly terrible soundtrack within the first 15 minutes (and let's face it all) need to connect to create something that is fun laterally. <br /> <br /> The open scene in "space" is almost as unthinkable as cinematography can get, because the bottles of washing liquid irritate your eyes. dialogue. Before you have the time to work out, whether it is you who has gone crazy, the role of credit and the action of fighting for life. <br /> <br /> And besides the two-speed plasticine giant snail that terrorizes our heroes, you also get a double bonus with both original voices and dubbed voices at the same time. A pure genius. For fans of such a fool, it is sad that I have ever seen a single copy, so the likelihood of seeing it myself is very unlikely. Maybe I'm the only existing copy. <br /> <br />
