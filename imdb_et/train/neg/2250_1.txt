Rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) turns the singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) into an overnight song. The star of Ester rises as John falls, thanks to drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John himself is doing the destructive-red-converting-160-MPH-crack-up-on-a-desert-road thing. The best thing about this movie is music, especially the song "Evergreen". Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can't take her seriously as a rising star when she is already a * star. The first time she appeared, she sings back in a bar, she looks like a well-established singer star who is slumming for the night, not like the unknown, who is trying to start her career in the career. He's too sure, too professional. His apartment looks like a page outside the "Apartment Living", not any apartment in the wall where a real rider lives. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <p> </p> </p> <p> </p> <p> Check the rock-star role as ... well as a singer trying to be an actress but she there is not much acting talent. The direction is dull, the story is slow and boring. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is not an actor or a flat or slow story. It's hair! After the terrible 70-year-old hair of Kristofferson and Streisand after 2 hours, the eyes looked hurt.
