I'm going to give this movie to ONE because it's a really terrible movie. The DVD audio track is so bad that it really hurts my ear. But the vision, no matter how isolated, shows something really gorgeous in Italian society. I'm not going to detail what really was so shocking, but the different incidents are completely abnormal. So kink value, I give this one. Otherwise, video, photography, acting as adult actors / actors is just a poor quality, practical jock for people who love foreign movies. Roberto, the main character, is full of emotions but exaggerated to be incredible. But the children in the movie are mostly 3/4 years old and they are genuine and look at Italian life.
