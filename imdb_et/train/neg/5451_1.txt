Filmfour has to do much better than this little film cover when they get a good reputation for themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie is in Glasgow (although only some other characters have something that approaches Scottish accents). Assuming that people who live do not go anywhere who all meet in the same cafe at the beginning of the morning, when they have night jobs, can make a really funny, incomprehensible, peculiar, cultivating film. Instead, we have a group of self-affixed stalls and a plot that has been made so that I am surprised that it is not forbidden. X and Y are friends. X sleeps with Z. Y also sleeps with Z. Oh, you see it. <br /> <br /> A complete waste of time. Painful Dialogue - It sounded like something a 16-year-old would have written for a GCSE drama project. The female character was completely superfluous - just a written symbolic female in the hope that women could see it. <br /> <br /> If you are such a thick boy who laughs on beer ads and can usually find traveling circles traveling in packages on Saturday night in non-binding city centers, you will love this movie and find this "good laff". Everyone else, run, don't walk away from this regret. <br /> <br /> And one question when the group left the "boring" seaside town (Saltcoats accidentally, even though they changed the name of the movie) to return to Glasgow, WHY did they do it through Forton motorways in LANCASTER, based in England?
