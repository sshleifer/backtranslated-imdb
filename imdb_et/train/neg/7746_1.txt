In the literal sense, all aspects of the low-budget flick of this science fiction have been categorized by its predecessors, modern and followers. Bad special effects, weak storyline, ridiculous blood and gore, annoying and pointless characters, all you can expect. The "Sabretooth Attack" is about a new holiday center owned by the Smilodon cats genetically modified. Cats flee and start killing people, the exhibition operator wants to save them and not warn those unsuspecting visitors and there are rebels and plans for killing cats and visitors. <br /> Film is especially effective with a medium budget. Sabretooth is portrayed through poor CGI. However, it is amazing that cats look more realistically than a closer, more detailed picture, rather than longer, more distant images where CGI is better concealed. Their attacks are bloodless and terrible. Just as you thought, they are attacking, some hands and feet are abducting and leaving very little. This is part of the reason why the film falls into a poor script. <br /> <br /> The plot and characters are just as terrible. We have some college kids coming to the island and planning a trap. And take it very, very seriously. Even so much that private property is being violated, security systems are being violated and stolen. Why are they taking the simple game so seriously? Did I miss something? Was there money? Or were they sent to do it? I don't know, I hardly watched the movie. But it seemed to me that they just did it for fun. Nevertheless, they went too far for normal. <br /> <br /> "Sabretooth attack" is a very bad film. Even with a low budget sci-fi flick, this is a very poor and inexpensive example. It carried most viewers to tears, may be attractive to some and makes you laugh and laugh. And remember that this is not comedy, it is a cheap horror blow so it shouldn't be comic.
