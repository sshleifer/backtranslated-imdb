Only an antichrist could have been behind such a disaster. Only hope that this irony was the motivating force of the "movie"! This movie was so bad, it forced me to sign up for IMDb so I could throw it away. What makes this movie even more tragic is that it had such a great source of material! I've never seen a movie where all the elements would be so sharply mediocre to make the result less than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> It may seem irrelevant, but I would like to get started. As a proud owner of a music degree, I have to register my resentment! I was laughing and dry when I heard what John Scheffer did with Goldsmith's excellent score; it was much tougher than any burlesque death scene and almost the same involuntary comedy. It was by far the most inappropriate point I've heard because I can't really think worse. Maybe JAWS 4? <br /> <br /> The plot ... Sorry. New Age Mysticism? What happened to the realism of the original trilogy? In these films (mostly in the first two as well as in the third, but still!), Beet was mostly a supernatural part, and it was this nuance that made the films so credible. Here are the crystals that are black (call all Skeksis and mystics!) And inverted cross-strokes, although on certain scenes, the cross-section would be perfectly normal, but for the camera angle. Gone are the refined psychological manipulation of the peculiar evil of our collective psyche: instead of being a nervous "face" of recycled clich√© and transparent incompetence. Add to it the leading "actor" so incredibly that you thank the director from the heart for the scenes he lacks. I've never seen a little girl who has been so upset because little Stephanie destroyed ALL PEREL. </p> to make this train-wrecked wasted celluloid irrelevant or most of a study of how not to shoot. Viewer warns! If you're happy, it can cause vomiting.
