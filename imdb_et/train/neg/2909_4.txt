Watching Tom Hanks for the Irish mob is a bit like when Jimmy Stewart is seen as a series tour that he just doesn't work on. It was really hard for me to agree. Not that I don't think Tom can act because I have been following my career from Mazes and Monsters, but for some reason it fell to me for a while. Perhaps because I am a fan of the graphic novel, and the risk that it sounds like a fanboy (the only way of life that is lower than the fanboy is cockroach). Attachments to Jude Law and departures that otherwise left me cold and more than a little disappointed. I had been waiting for a big crime movie in Bonnie vein and Clyde Mendes took the whole heart out and left us with bare bones. The flick likes things, but the cinematic art is amazing, filling the screen with beautiful pictures.
