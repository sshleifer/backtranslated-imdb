A very weak film, mainly because of a bad story, but also bad action by Robert Downey Jr. and the irrational behavior of several characters. If you are someone who wants to turn off your mind and just look at the criteria for creativity or action, then this movie may be a pleasure. Personally, I can't do it with drama and I found it too far. <br /> <br /> I am particularly annoyed when the main character who should be an intelligent person constantly acts as a complete imbec. There is no movie in this film if the main character would behave as a person usually behaves in such situations. <br /> <br /> The first very unlikely act is the main character, the successful lawyer Magruder. what Kenneth Branagh played, leaves the party and happens to the girl, Mallory Doss, played by Embeth Davidtz, who screams that his car has been stolen. They stand in tropical rain when he rides him home. <br /> <br /> She tells her about her strange father, who belongs to some strange sect and makes crazy things. When they reach the poorer part of their poorer city, they note that his car is on the road. The lights of the house are also on and some objects in the house are broken. <br /> <br /> Things are very strange, he's weird (looking like a tramp, he's undresses in front of him until he's totally naked? Oh yeah!). My father's strange house is a wreck - everyone should have told Magruder: "Hey, it's too weird, I'm out here!" But not Magruder, he sleeps with him and then takes his story and sex to motivate his father's commitment. It's all screaming! <br /> <br /> Then, being the top - the accused attorney that he is, he arrives late in the office with the same shirt he had at night (the fact that all the women announced the post) Is it likely that the success The lawyer acts as a 16-year-old Magruder in some cases bothered by the police, so when he goes to the police claiming that his father has terrorized them, the police ignore him. at all - not likely! <br /> <br /> It's just unlikely.
