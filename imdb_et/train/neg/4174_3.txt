Whoo-boy, this was definitely one of the worst pains I've seen all summer. Granted, it was Sci Fi, and I don't look much at Sci Fi, but the man, we're talking about razor thin plot and two-dimensional characters up to max. <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotypical and superfluous, the plot and the setting were incredible, the vampires were less intimidating, the funniest viewing, the drill was unnecessary, the special effects were terrible and the end? Well, the only thing the end was unpredictable was how suddenly the tomb chamber becomes a lesbian and starts doing it with a female vampire, which by the way is not so hot considering it for about three seconds, where are you closer to "What the hell?" then "man, it's hot." If it ever appears in a roar, God cannot do it.
