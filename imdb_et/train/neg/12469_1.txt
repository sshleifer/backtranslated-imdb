I look forward to giving up the movie without looking at the whole show. This is especially true when I rent it from a DVD. Syria was where I gave up. Halfway I turned it into a boring disgust. <br /> <br /> This movie is inseparable, boring, confusing and weak. Operation was dry and without reliable images. The general plot was good, but it evolved with the kind and the boredom that I couldn't get my attention or interest. Many sub-lines were often unable to get in touch with each other and seemed like random stories rather than a real unified line. Such a serious topic is too bad and such big players could create such a flop. I can't imagine this film getting much less prizes.
