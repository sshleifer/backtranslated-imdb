Terrible, terrible, terrible doesn't waste your money on renting this movie. This is a small budget made for Canadian Canadian film. Absolutely the worst film I've ever seen, and there are many others. This movie is not worth the time it takes for a DVD player or VCR. : ~ (Can you write ten lines? The operation was terrible. It had no flow. I saw the work done by the BTK killer for the TV movie and it was much better (compared to it). but if it was meant to educate us or the story of the BTK murderer, which they missed a few miles, it seemed to be commercial for animal rights.
