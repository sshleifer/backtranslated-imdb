This is a typical Steele production, where two people who have gone through some sort of tragedy can come together despite the odds. I wouldn't call it a spoiler because anyone who has read the Steele novel knows how they all end. If you don't want to know much about the plot, don't read it. Gilbert has to stop making films where he needs to emphasize, because he, otherwise, a good actor, cannot draw the real emphasis. Brad Johnson, also a great actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a rather disgusting divorce. He is gentle, convincing and convincing in this role. <br /> <br /> Two meet on the beach with their daughter Pipi and initially accuse Ophelia of being a child molester because she talked to art with her child. They all become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love. <br /> <br /> The chemistry of two drivers is not great, although the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. They did the best they could do with a predictable plot and scenario that was limited to a stereotype. Two people meet, the tragedy, the greater tragedy, the public secret, the second tragedy and then they get together. I wish it was more than that, but it is brief. <br /> <br /> I wanted meaningless entertainment and got it. This is not memorable in the genre of romantic films. "Secret affair" is much better with Janine Turner (not the book by Steele), as well as some of Steele's earlier books that became a film.
