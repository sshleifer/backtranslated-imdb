I saw it not too long and I have to say: this movie is terrible. I'm watching fun movies. Scarecreow is not fun. The scarecrow is stupid. You have an incredibly fucking villain who enjoys terrible punches because he kills his victims (actually worse than what is contained in this sentence). He has a story of happiness he uses to justify his killings. "Everyone chooses me. The only girl who thinks I'm not a trailer trash, likes a man who chooses me. I want everyone to kill. Wah." OK, I'm an exaggeration. But the prerequisite for this film's isolation is to put it at the bottom of the crappy list of movies. <br /> <br /> Adding to what I just said is the mother of the child is puzzled, he walks to his mother and his current boyfriend, his mother's boyfriend said he was leaving, the child refuses, demanding that he leave his house. The boy rides the boy out of the corn. He kills the boy directly in front of his mother, his mother screams, the boy is like, "OMG! I didn't!" Then she tells her she doesn't say anything to the police. However, Kid was killed under peacemaking. So, like every boy killed under peacemakers, he comes back as a killer in a scarecrow with revenge. His victims are "not so before ..." (Scarecrow's official tagline). <br /> <br /> Even worse, this movie was filmed for eight days. That's right, 8 days. I gave this a a 2 because it has one or two redemption times. (They are spoilers, so I won't spoil it for you if you really want to see that mess.) I could have somewhat forgiven for bad behavior, terrible special effects, sad script and poor camera work. but I just do not respect the lack of effort at this level. <br /> <br /> This movie is not nearly as good as I do. If you want to see how not to make a movie or if you watch bad movies like me, check it out at your own risk. All others should always stay safe from this film.
