At Steve Irwin's show he is mountainous. She's not even trying to be funny and she's just, but her film wasn't even what I would call a movie — I mean, when that guy in her car tries to kill her, she just says, “Oh, that's one nasty break! and looking directly at the camera. He put too much on his face in the camera! And if the boy falls off, shouldn't you wait for him? And Terri was the worst thing I ever saw! As if the crocodile almost eat Steve, he just says "Steve". He wasn't scared or anything, it was just "Steve." I mean, I hate to think about it, but it wasn't worth seeing. I love Steve Irwin, but his movie was just too stupid.
