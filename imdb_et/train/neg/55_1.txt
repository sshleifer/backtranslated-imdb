There are only two movies that I would give 1/10, this stinker and "The Man Who Earth." I remember seeing the protocol in the early 1980s when I was in high school. The script is offensive to intelligence for all (including high school students). It completely lost me with a "strange" gag that someone got off. Goldie Hawn should be charming, but is inappropriate as coats of arms and moronic. Then the Arabs are being attacked by stereotypes, followed by Goldie, who fights against everyone, trying to populist drifting. The action was terrible, including Goldie Hawn. I couldn't see he'd see another movie until he was until the IMO redeemed himself all saying I love you. This is the movie you do if you don't want any effort to write a scenario. Worst.
