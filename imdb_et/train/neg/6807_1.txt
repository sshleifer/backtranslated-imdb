Spoilers? Maybe some details, but nothing is involved. I don't like this movie. <br /> <br /> Air Rage obviously displaces the premise of air penetration in the middle of an executive decision. Ice-T manages a team of four "elite" teams wearing pink black shirts, which we can only imagine to hide the invisible body warning as their idiotic tactics (similar to 3rd-class players playing at Star Wars Playground). Attack Fire. <br /> <br /> What was most entertaining from this entertainment was the use of look-like actors. You will immediately know Cyril O'Reily as someone who ever acted in a movie that you really liked, even though it was so long ago that you wouldn't be able to put it (it was Porky). Here Cyril plays Bill Paxton's character properly. The most fun is head Ger Gilard, who is so greasy that you never know him as Buck Rogers. Instead of just waking up to a heroic motif, Gerard gives us a fatty karmic personality that was clearly portrayed to John Goodman. Finally, Alex Cord gives us a pleasant hybrid look like Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas. In 10 years since New Jack City, Ice-T's performance has deteriorated significantly. It doesn't work so much that it has actually remembered it. <br /> <br /> One of the elements of this movie is the Classified Information CD-ROM. It is in hand and it is probably and unbelievably encrypted, despite the nature of Gerard NSA. What a joke. I seriously doubt that the information on the CD that is supposed to exist would even be in a portable format. Despite being in a closed aircraft without dampers, the fire is about as strong as the compressed air that causes a bundle of people who obviously do not fall, so obviously there is no foley budget. The selection of the selected weapons is pretty funny. Using a flight crew coffee pot is about the most realistic image of violence in the film. If he takes an intuitive mini-Uzi gun, which must be one of the worst pistol shapes, it's just too stupid. A real elite team would carry this type of MP-5 or maybe SOCOMM-i45, or even adjust H-Powers if they were really old school, or maybe something FN 5.7 as a new school ... Flat -o standard edition 92Fs is absolutely staggering, having lost most of its bay after a deadly weapon I. Bad guys, a supposedly experienced type of soldier soldier has a blend of mixed absurdity, such as the above-mentioned mini-Uzi gun and Tec-9 with the notorious non-functional barrel extender, which is not a silencer. <br /> <br /> There was one real reality I would like to be corrected by other reviewers. The air traffic controller and Ice-T reduced the craft to "breathing air" before they opened the door. And I also had the impression that the flight crew was unable to close the door, so that it essentially gave up on that point. The flaps were not mentioned for about 2 seconds before landing. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Only the danger-takers who lived on Roscoe P. Coltrane's "passport" could use this movie to use the footage. They probably chose the incredible (and retired) SR-71 because they didn't get F-117 stocks. In addition to being mothballed already in 2001, let us also forget for a moment that the SR-71 is not a hidden hidden aircraft within the meaning of B-2, and that the point is empty ... Well, I am not an expert, but I have doubts whether it would be invisible to Radar. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, it was a ridiculous reference to "F-15" when they showed F-16. The data for 747 were pretty stupid. No airline would put a small number of passengers at 747, not to mention anything else that was idiotic about it. Pay attention to the use of open electrical wiring. <br /> <br /> Wow. What a show. Catch this star or something. Don't pay this rent, but look at it laugh. Supposedly the worst movie, right there with No Holds Barred, which had at least some originality.
