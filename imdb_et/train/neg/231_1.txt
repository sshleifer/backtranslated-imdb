It starts badly, which, together with the three women who act like gin-relaxing young high schools, endless cigarettes and caramel chocolate, take care of who talks about the best "human" story, and then it gets worse - = - spoiler alarm = - = what Andie's character fell on a young organ player who was a student when she was 14 years old (she is an English school head, believe it or not), just to destroy her thanks to her mother - the "girlfriend" of hell. ..and then from there, it is basically a non-slip claptrap: he forgives his "friend" and is an organist love child and 3 women eventually when they started drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah. Andie's character throws caramel on the chocolate street, in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Wait for mercy.
