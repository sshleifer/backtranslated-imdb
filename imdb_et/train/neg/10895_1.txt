I've seen a lot of bad movies. Most of the time I enjoy a scary horror movie about what it is. But it really takes the new extremes bad. <br /> <br /> It's happier, the plot for what it never is, goes somewhere and takes over. There are no shocks, no horrors, no intercourse, just a load of guys who rub themselves for an hour and a half, and then a quick finish. <br /> <br /> An exciting genre of fear fear, avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
