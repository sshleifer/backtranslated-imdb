No one is a bigger fan of Geroge Macdonald Fraser's Flashman papers than I do. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that right now Richard Lester saw Royal Flash because I can see that he had made three / four musketeers with Fraser, which I showed quite well. <br /> <br /> Not so Royal Flash. <br /> <br /> I was 12 years old when the movie came out and I couldn't be more enthusiastic because I had read all the Flashman papers published by that time and was in a state of intoxication with Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel (I'm still, but he was never given an opportunity). <br /> <br /> What a disappointment (I saw it again when I was on TV for about 20 years and it seemed even worse). <br /> <br /> No sharp books in the book are displayed. Flashman's character comedy seemed to me to be badly treated in the same way as one could imagine a group of high school students trying to make a parody. Dueling and guards were terrible and unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Looking back at the more mature eyes, the film could not be finished to take advantage of the direct satire of Zenda Prison's earlier film versions. <br /> <br /> When you read the book and didn't see the movie, I can only say that the movie ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg becoming a quick friend and playing a game that Rudi just invented: Russian Roulette. <br /> <br /> Pathetic betrayal of all books. <br /> <br /> My comments would be more direct if I had seen the movie lately, but I am glad you haven't done it. <br /> <br /> When Fraser ever reads it, I can only say that he is a genius - perhaps the greatest comic writer of his generation, but in my opinion, it is so hard to believe that he wrote the script of this film, because he made all these terrible Roger Moore James Bond films.
