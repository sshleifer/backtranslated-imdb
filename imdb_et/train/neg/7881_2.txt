This film is a portrait of a semi-pastoral teenage boy, Benjamin, who has to attend school because his sorrow is in math. He didn't make the best of life and had serious self-esteem issues. After starting his new school he starts making friends, falls in love with the girl and makes some American pies for teenagers. <br /> <br /> Along with some comedy elements, the film speaks very seriously, focusing on Benjamin and his problems. <br /> <br /> If you don't like this story, save time and see something else. If you do, remember the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Benjamin is a loser. Whatever he does, he does it terribly wrong, and then all the time he goes to self-control. For me, he was not a "charming loser" with whom you feel compassion and laugh. Instead, he and his behavior bothered me and I hardly looked at my teenage years, which were not so far behind. <br /> <br /> 2) The film does not try to be realistic and the story seems to be just me to experience that the characters just aren't (except Janosch). And yes, I know that this film is based on 17-year-old car literature - but has some experience with German schools and German youth itself, I don't believe him. ) For a movie about this topic, showing sexual awakening is really important. But I doubt that teenage boys make a "Ejaculate cookie", where everyone has to catch their sperm with a cookie in the woods during mass-masturbation and the loser must eat a sperm-wet cookie after that. Although it amused me in a despicable manner, it is not funny and has not stressed the serious attempts of this film. <br /> <br /> 4) Benjamin's family and his father who betray his wife - don't know why it is there and where to put it. It just missed me. <br /> <br /> Well, I hated this movie personally because of the nature of Benjamin, without message, concept, schemes, whatever, and it couldn't be dramatic and serious. However, I can imagine that some people find it reasonable and touching. If you liked "The Second Sister", you probably like it. I hated both. <br /> 2 out of 10.
