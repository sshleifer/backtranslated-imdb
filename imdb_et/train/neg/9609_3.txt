I started watching this movie, waiting for barely tolerable Hammer horror movie wannabe ... and I wasn't far away. There's a fair amount of glimpse, and they threw a lot of nudity, but the other side of the movie is a couple of ironic twists. The holy cow, they made the story somewhat think and did not reach the fully predictable stuff that was expected at first. And I dare say that part of the "free" nudity wasn't so free because it matched the story and the settings. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, it's still a common bad movie, but for bad movies, this shadow is more intelligent than a really terrible trick like Mesa of Lost Women and Robot Monster.
