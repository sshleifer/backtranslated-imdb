If you are dealing with derivatives and predictable thrillers of rape-revenge, you are a rare treat ... They don't really remind me, so I couldn't find any thing to redeem this peculiar story. It seems to be directly from the 1980s, a different age if it went straight to the video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer work well with a weak script and a tedious scenario. But what does Gillian Anderson do in such a way after his performance as a Lady Deadlock BBC TV adapted Bleak House last year? The director has allegedly been influenced by the work of the rape witness and his documentary film, but even this is not an excuse for the strange scene where rural claimants offered Dyer. I don't think I was the only person laughing at the cinema. I do not understand the involvement of this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have participated in some major British films in recent years. Verve shared Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road - straight ends don't deserve the same breath. FilmFour and Verve take note: is it really the best thing you can do? What are independent British filmmakers doing your artistic decision? This is a great plate for both of you. Listen carefully: Do you hear thousands of fans of independent British films who cry in despair?
