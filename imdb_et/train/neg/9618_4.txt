I have to say that while this movie was always stolen from movies, as on Friday the 13th / I know what you did last summer, this movie wasn't that bad. In fact, it wasn't as bad as most Horror movies Hollywood has recently released. The killings, though sometimes somewhat imaginative, were mostly such, original. The pain was mediocre, expected from low-budget features, but much better than what this much larger studio Artisan / Lions Gate has offered. My only real complaint, which was not due to the film's budget, which was to be small, was the end of the "twisted". I'm sorry, but that's what put this movie in my bad category. The end was just stupid and stuck. Before that I was a little bored, but I really enjoyed it. 4/10
