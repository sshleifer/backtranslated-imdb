Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! Functional, dialog, script, sound, lighting, plot line. I can't say anything positive about this, even though I enjoy Swedish movies. Fighting scenes are so ridiculous that it is impossible to take seriously. And if the leader figure just gets rid of his shirt, while throwing strips on the strip, I'm not sure if it should be a joke, or if someone really thinks these are good movies! Regina Lund is the only actor of the origin of the parties, but she disappears from ridiculous pronunciation and incredible reactions. It makes you frightening that someone actually spent time and money on something like that ...
