With this line, one foolish, boring British sci fi movie begins. Devil Doll's big Vorell builds a teleportation machine just to stop Blanchard, a bearded man with a big eyelid belt and men, from funding. If his attempt fails, a good doctor learns that Lembach, a man who controls all the benefits of the world, is staying in London for a few days. She's trying to design her with the help of Sheila's laboratory worker Sheila. Needless to say, something goes wrong and it comes out like a rat. The rest of the film is dedicated to good orange hair doctors walking in London, shocking people with their mutated hands and wearing a mantle on the face. There are still some killings, some modest paperwork, and finally the doctor to which the rat faces doctors will disappear. Fortunately, nobody decided to leave the sequel.
