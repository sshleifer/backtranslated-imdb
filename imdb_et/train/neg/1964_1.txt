When I saw this movie, I thought it was made for the video. The second thing that came to mind was how similar it saw the other fearsome movie "Darkness Falls", the story of this stupid witch who killed people in the dark. Unfortunately, Darkness Falls was quite a masterpiece compared to this trash and it shouldn't have been done. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a little spin on the witch or rather, the pointless introduction of both small children who go, in the hope of the fairy of the tooth, to give them a new shiny bicycle. The film is badly filmed and, like the rest of the movie, it is certainly not scary. At the moment, the movie is Peter (Lochlyn Munroe). Peter rented his house and his former friend Darcy (Chandra West) and his daughter Cole came here. Cole meets a neighborhood child and they talk about the tooth fairy and how you should not lose your teeth or come from you. Unfortunately, it seems that the tooth fairy steals his bike and hitting his tooth (as ironic). Will Cole survive the Tooth Fairy anger and whether his mother and Peter can save him and revive his romance ... this is a bad film, maybe you think it will. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with this idiotic film is how the tooth fairy is undefined. They say he will kill you if you lose your tooth but fast. He is a row killer who kills randomly, and if you lose your tooth, you will surely go. He steals a bicycle, so he's probably a thief. I said earlier that the idea of ​​this movie was based on Darkness Falls, but where did they get the inspiration for the Tooth Fairy? Let's see. She looks like a burnt-offering, and she's gone past her neighbors. Hmmm ... it's almost the same as Freddy Krueger's exact hanging on "Nightmare on Elm Street". And this is not the worst part of this terrible confusion, it is the climax. This movie may be the most ridiculous climax (not literally ridiculous because I found it more sick than funny). Don't look at it. <br /> <br /> Just a little trivia. Lochlyn Munroe was in Scary Movie and Jianna Ballard was in Scary Movie 3 and both were so obviously Scary Movie stars forced to end their career with bad scary movies. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 80 minutes. R for violence.
