I just saw "Where ??" I remember the 1968 movie ads, so I was interested in seeing it finally. It might be an American perspective who never went to British public schools and left some social references, but I thought the film was terrible. One thing, as others have pointed out, will take almost the whole movie to break out the ballyhooed-at-the-time rebellion. Secondly, whether the last scene is a real or an idea of ​​what is happening, not a rebellion, but a shooting poison. It is quite different. <br /> <br /> I know that evaluating a movie about later events may be bad, but you can't do it here. One person wrote the message on board, asking us not to compare the end of the film with the Columbine High School and Virginia Tech. But if there are any differences between Klebold, Harris and Choi, on the other hand, Travise (Malcom McDowell), I just can't see it. All four of them were deceived by the fact that their fire purifies a world they are not surprisingly taking. <br /> <br /> What brings me: why hell is Travis and his boys even at school, which they despise? They are adult or near it. They're not in a military prison, like "The Hill" prisoners, a much better British movie at about the same time. No one forces them to go to college and beat whips except maybe ambitious parents who need their sons after waking up. The College had the opportunity to join the frat, unless I could give the stupid, bold orders to the criminals who claim to be my future "brothers". I took consequences if not "in" with the law that the frats offer, and I can't say I regret it. <br /> <br /> When Travis comes with another Lenin (whose secret picture hangs), he is prominent in his room), he can freely go and arrange an installer union or work with Michael Foot in the next election. If he wants to be Jack Kerouac, make the path and write. What's the benefit of giving joy to the world with a motorcycle and drunk in your room? <br /> <br /> Sometimes reviewers must be the ones who responded to "The Last Tango in Paris", where Brando mops about having to go to a day when a cow manure is his shoes. In the real world, the person said, the listener would say, "Why didn't you start it? Change your shoes?" - Don't let the fictional characters put you on a self-healing journey because you dare not show them a sensible alternative way of doing things. So it's here.
