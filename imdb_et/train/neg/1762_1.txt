This film seems to be the hanging of many films that have previously dealt with the same topic. Let the upcoming viewer warn that "Art Heist" doesn't add anything to the genre. Director Bryan Goeres has no idea what to do with the film. <br /> <br /> William Baldwin continues to revive his films and, frankly, wonders whether he has a great agent, or whether directors and producers love their unusual funny look blessed by the strange hairstyle he sports in most of his films. The only good movie she has appeared on is "Squid and Whale", in which she speaks only two or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, her leading woman, is not much better; There is no chemistry between Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin. <br /> <br /> The film is viewed at the risk of the viewer.
