If this guy can make a movie, then I'm sure hell can be done. <br /> <br /> In fact, when you wage me to make a movie, I promise to do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) I'll add more naked women. There was nothing in this film. I think cheesy class B horror movies are only rented thanks to the traditional exploitation of the woman's body. I wouldn't want to let my viewers down. <br /> <br /> 2) Avoid making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out it's just a dream. I think HorrorVision had about 4 of these scenes. And watching the movie, it was only an hour long, and the dream-length ratio was quite high. And when I decide to make a dream sequence, make sure the person wakes up without clothes. I mean, who sleeps in leather pants ?? <br /> <br /> 3) I don't kidnap movies like Star Wars or Matrix because I know my budget is small and I don't want to disguise the frustration of high-budget Hollywood movies by adding satirical references. 4) Finally, I don't share modern technology with Undead. I mean, the palm pilot can only be so scary ... at least they made this bad rally-polly monster before the screen bounced up or something. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production, read me: wanna-b-movie director extraordinaire.
