The Lord. How can they make such a beauty movie, but it's so terrible bad. I even think that even Uwe Boll doesn't do that. There is not even a hint of decent story, multilayered characters, or attractiveness. It's just a casual yet meaningless talk connected to make a "movie." I think only children up to 3 years old can enjoy it because the world is so pointless and the story is so inconsistent that any parent would have disturbed it. But then again, it is too scary for anyone under the age of 6 that there is probably no one who should watch this movie at all. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and stay far from this movie. Your little daughter can do a better story, and although she probably can't draw this beautiful picture, she's listening to her songs much more valuable. Don't ask the children you believe to expose this **** piece. I'm going to give it to 2 out of 10 and it's exclusively for graphics, because story and character development are so terrible that they deserve a negative rating. <br /> <br /> And if you decide to look at it anyway ... remember that I warned you.
