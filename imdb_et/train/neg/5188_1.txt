TV pilots, don't you love them? Quinn Martin tried it after he had been successful in many other TV detective films, but it doesn't go anywhere except in MST where it belongs. Roy Thinnes is Diamond Head, who receives aunt Mary's aunt orders to find a superspy Lovejoy, I mean in the Tree. Zulul and Tso-Zinc have an ethnic comic relief and much more. The tree sucks as a bad man, despite all his shadows, which makes him look exactly the same as usual. There are more unnatural clothing fibers than you can ever imagine (what is required in the 1970s) and the display itself is so anti-climate. Why didn't it go to the series? You see it, it's pretty blatant. Again, MST is fun, but not much more!
