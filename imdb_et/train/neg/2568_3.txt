Dear Sir ... Peter Sellers was one of the strangest talented actors. But the choice of his films, for example after 1964, was very unfortunate. He didn't understand how to use his talents. It would have been better for him to work more with the world on the trunk than the people he did. Of my later films, I've only seen those who are nine elementary optimizers and are there. <br /> <br /> That means Boultings and Sellers had made several movies before that barely sounding - I haven't seen "Carlton Browne" and "Heavens Above!" - at least in the sense that the sellers are somewhat well used. But "My Girl is a Girl" is really a bad movie and a wrong choice for sellers by nature. In your films 1955-64, you can usually expect at least some very ingenious twists and always mysterious beliefs in your roles. Here is Peter Sellers, who is trying to play a typical romantic lead. It's almost Sellers who play Niven's frame without being unique. He certainly does not convince, try as he can, or create an interesting character. He should have left such parts like Cary Grant and focus on the intriguing dramatic and comic roles he belonged to. <br /> <br /> Hawn and Sellers really don't create any real chemistry; Improved by William Powell and Myrna Loy is not a simple, brilliant romance. This is a very artificial vision, all the time - I know it's part of Danver's character, that he's a dry sucker of women, but he doesn't really change it in a way that convinces me. Sellers have a very grid way to play "magic", as well ... this character doesn't really have the depth and really doesn't get the viewer's compassion or interest. The sellers go through the movements as if one could not think of remembering the magnitude of their magnificence, the iconic performance of "Lolita". <br /> <br /> There is nothing to say about landscape, direction, or characters. as honestly they leave little or no impression. It's really one of the most anemic, self-satisfied, wrong, and slightly dull movies I've ever seen. Seller's indisputable talent "vehicle" inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> Rating: - * 1/2 / *****
