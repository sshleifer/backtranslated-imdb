My dear, what movie! Let's talk first about "special effects". Don't be wrong with me here, I'm not one of these fanatics, but I really thought it was a long past, mostly in the 60s. So for a while I thought they could record this movie a long time ago and they cut it forever and released it. But as far as I know they didn't have cell phones in the 60s ... <br /> <br /> What I'm looking for in movies is mostly a good story with a really good message. Action is secondary, the effect is secondary, I do not even understand some contradictions. But in such bad actions, incredible, and so on. In the movies, even worse film is getting worse - it happened to me with Celestine Prophecy. <br /> <br /> My wife said the book was really good, and although I am not in all spiritual things, I can see that it can be transferred in a credible way - the film has failed. <br /> <br /> There may be one reason to watch this one but. If you really love cheesy movies, that's right for you. If the IMDb letters were joyful instead of quality, then they had to evaluate this movie with ten stars. <br /> <br /> By the way, the three stars mark the fact that there are worse films, such as "critical mass" (see the comments for fun). Celestine Prophecy is at least to some extent entertaining.
