Drew Barrymore is an actor who has gone through bad times, not only during his career, but also in his personal life. After childhood childhood, he went into an insecure medium-low quality film. Although he has recovered from this dark past, this film remains a reminder of Drew Barrymore's worst days. with a lot of personality disorder that sets the horror / thriller story. Barrymore stands as Holly Gooding, a young woman who tries to make a new life after her traumatic past in California, where her second personality probably killed her mother. haunt him as his evil personality is back in his life who is ready to destroy his new found peace and his new beloved love. In the midst of chaos, his new boyfriend Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) tries to help Holly confront his past demon. it is mostly a mediocre film that not only fulfills its purpose, but also reaches the worst end of film history. Although Barrymore is definitely not her best, she can keep her dignity above average. The rest of the majority ranges from average and painful bad performances, though Leslie Hope is the best among them. <br /> <br /> The script is full of clich√©s and the effect of De Palma is quite obvious. Although the film is trying to be original, making literary references in almost every line, dialogues are boring and wood-based factors certainly do nothing good. It has a fair share of nudity and strange reasons and excessive use of special effects. <br /> <br /> Make-up effects are made by the distinguished KNB and is really one of the few good films. However, somewhat over-use of the contextual impact somewhat reduces the impact of KNB's work and makes cheesy, which is amazing in a different film. <br /> <br /> The fact that it's B -Movie is not an excuse for its low quality because a better and more coherent script could have been an interesting movie. Unfortunately, we all have a mediocre movie that worsens every second. Worthy of Barrymore's beauty. 3/10
