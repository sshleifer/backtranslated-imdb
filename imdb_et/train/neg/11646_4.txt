The chapel meets the mafia. Telly Savales is one of the past who seems to be quite unforgettable. I've never thought his show was so big. This is his one-dimensional character for the superior of the crime, with very predictable results. If you take out a passenger car and general rambling, there is not much plot development or activity. I find the mafia movies boring because I have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions. Hollywood and, in this case, Italian cinema, treat these guys as heroes. I saw the movie and after a few days I don't remember much. Many shootings, innocent bystanders die, betrayal and ill loyalty. The film is pretty well photographed and the actor is decent. But dubbing is so bad (thanks to the voices that simply did not come from these bodies) that I almost started looking for Godzilla, who is approaching the bay.
