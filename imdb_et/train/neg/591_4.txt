I was really disappointed with this movie. it really started well and created a great atmosphere and a break, but when she finally "monster" revealed ... it turned out it was just a few psychologists who had skin problems ...... again. Keep it. Another nutjob movie ... as we don't have enough. <br /> <br /> To be fair, "slip" is really annoying to watch and how it moves and the strange sounds it does are pretty creepy, but I'm sick of renting such a movie just to find out that the monster is a person, though twisted, demented, freaks. When I saw all of the early rats early, I was hoping that some striking rat-monster hybrid thing ... it was so climbed when climbing. <br /> <br /> On top of this, some things in this movie don't make sense. (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Why the devil kills security guards? What's the point, besides being detained for the big registration of fear, that says "HI I am psychology and I live here!" It's stupid, and it seems like Franka Potente's character doesn't let me get help. <br /> <br /> What the hell did he eat there? I had the impression that he was actually entered, and only an unexpected opening to this part of the tunnel let him get rid of ... so he's always robbed the rats and if so, why are they so much hanging around? Why is he so hard to kill? He is thin, malnourished and not exactly at peak power ... but it seems to continue despite injuries equivalent to film with non-psychological characters. <br /> <br /> The DVD commentary says it is terrifying to Creep, but I just find it nasty. This is a movie that is powerful enough, but it wastes so many opportunities that it makes me sick.
