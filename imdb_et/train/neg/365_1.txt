Bad plot, bad dialogue, bad behavior, idiotic control, annoying porn track soundtrack that ran over the superfluous script, and the dirty copy of VHS can't redeem with alcohol consumption. Trust me because I blocked this turkey to the end. It was so miserably bad that I had to realize that it was Hitler's fourth price level in the spring. The girl playing Janis Joplin was the only weak interest and it was only because she could sing better than the original. <br /> <br /> If you want to look something similar but a thousand times better, look over the doll in the valley.
