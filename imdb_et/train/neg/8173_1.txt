One of the most boring slashers. If you even call it. I do not look at it if it was even a porn movie he totally remembers. The fact that you look at a small group of middle-aged people in the forest is really unbearable. They made such films for teenagers, so who had really tried to make this dream festival? My favorite part of this movie is cover art, and that's the only reason I decided to look for this movie, part of the "Exciting Classes 50 Movie Package". I understand it's not anywhere else. So if you are in a decent forest, I recommend just before dawn and end terror.
