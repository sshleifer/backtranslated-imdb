It's funny that I'm forced to watch this movie, but here I am. <br /> <br /> I look at it because recently I have had the opportunity to recognize R.C. Sheriff's "Journey's End" in New York, Belasco Theater, starring Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others, as well as masterly by David Grindley. <br /> <br /> I left the theater shattered. I'm not exaggerated, I was buggy. After almost two and a half hours of a re-created and very claustrophobic image of the soldier's life, Somme (I was speculated) in the trenches, alive alive during World War I, I came out of the theater. <br /> <br /> Think of you, I'm not too shocked and I'm not too sensitive. I'm the director and the director myself, so I know that the buttons are pushed emotionally and psychologically to achieve a certain effect. <br /> <br /> But what I just saw was so much to life that I had some impressions on my back as I left. None of these emotions came to life, looking at this game and even the screen "Aces High". RC with Sheriff himself, just before he died. <br /> <br /> Screen customization in the sky across France. So, the claustrophobic atmosphere has started. <br /> <br /> The only plus film is aerial battle scenes, which have a special impact on today's standards, but there are still very valid driving patterns on the screen. <br /> <br /> Erich Maria Remarque, in the trenches and not in the sky, has made a few pairs of "Western-front silent" adjustments. but it was the "German" vision of things to choose for such things, "Journey's End" is just the other side of the medal and would have made this great movie if they had left it alone and intact. <br /> <br /> DVD delivery is poor, although the quality of the movie itself is on the widescreen and 16: 9 TV screens. cinema. Something more, not less. It sports a variety of errors, such as minor scratches and dots, although the copy is clean for the rest. <br /> <br /> If you want another WWI movie from your collection, especially for those who love and enjoy seeing the air battles between old timers, this is the picture for you. But I'd rather recommend "Von Richthofen and Brown" as an alternative, even though it's a movie full of inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> For the rest of you who love acting and drama, I'd leave this one. Buy a game. Go look at this game if you have the chance to get a good revival close to it, but keep this potential adaptation away. <br /> <br /> This is an anti-war movie that has been given, but the weakest I've ever seen in my lifetime. <br /> <br /> The presence of actors such as Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson, and John Gielgud is just a bluff, because we see them in very weak and very short movie McDowell, very talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth, all the very weak results, not the lack of skills, but the true and solid direction. <br /> <br /> There are too many loopholes in this and, as mentioned earlier, it will be pulling into a suspicious end. It is unfortunate because in the original game there are no men we know and understand in life. They are all killed by a deadly and meaningless mission. In the film, they all die, except for Malcolm McDowell, who can somehow survive for another day, being the chief of the unlucky cluster wings, just to get another three pilots to fly and die for another lost cause. <br /> <br /> The end of the game leaves bare steps in complete darkness. You just hear the cannon roar, machine guns and the effects of the grenade across the theater. Then suddenly complete peace and silence. There is a curtain. Light. And here they are all. Line, straight and rigid. Heard bodies ... <br /> <br /> More interesting and much more shocking than the "Aces High" finale, which is also dragged by hair. <br /> <br /> It's up to you to decide. <br /> <br /> If I had money and contacts, I'd take this game and develop it as it was intended. Adding here and from there some operational condition to visualize the "external" horror and killing that takes place with the "broad fields of France" around the men, but then focusing only on what's going on, this tiny "entertainment" on entertainment and the world ... < br /> <br /> Want a movie like this? <br /> <br /> Then ask for it. <br /> <br /> It's not.
