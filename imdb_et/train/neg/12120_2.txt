What else could the mill have been running, a mediocre film of infidelity (a subtle "free-love" period), the creators of this film in a ridiculous scenario after a ridiculous scenario, and top it all out on a tricky little cherry, happily ever after finishing. Never did I ever feel sympathy with Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in their disturbing middle-class care-free life and I did not feel sympathy for Liev Shrieber. The story slowly draws along its predictable, pathetic conclusion and the only thing interesting and observable about this film is the stunning Diane Lane topless. Here's a hint, it's about a 30 minute movie. Move on to this part and skip the rest.
