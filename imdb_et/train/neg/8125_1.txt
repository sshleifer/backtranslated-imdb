"The Bat People" is really a bad film that deserved MST3K treatment just as well as this second film "The Creeping Terror." <br /> <br /> Here we have a mountainous landscape full of bats. We see a lot of things like bats flying and attacking and things, station wagons, distress in trouble and more! All this, plus the cheesy environment of the 1970s (hey, guess "Mitchell" here!), "The Bat People" actually one of the last episodes of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" made in the series! Moviewise, it's terrible. This should be avoided like a plague unless Tom Servo and Crow are watching you. <br /> <br /> "Bat Bat People" - More Like "Bad People !!!!!" LOL <br /> <br /> 1/10 of course !!!!!
