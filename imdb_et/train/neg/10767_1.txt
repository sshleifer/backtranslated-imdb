It was not only the most expensive Canadian film ever arrived in BC but easily the worst, never seen daylight. The director is not even Canada, but the British and the boy shows it. We are all set out to be a bunch of general dope fiends and morons. What it means to be a Canadian does not exist and this should be the reason why we finance this bedroom. Of course, the British character is normal. The rest is the catch of a sitcom stereotype - can you say "Norm !!" Cinematography extends from postcard images to silhouettes of dusky indoor spaces. Actors always seem buggy. Are they bored by the viewer or is the idea of ​​cinema leaders? Avoid this confusion and watch some Bruce Mcdonalds movies. A real Canadian boy with something original to say kinematically. After 10 minutes you will not be forced to step out of HIS movies.
