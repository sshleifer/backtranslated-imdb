I like it pretty much, but the story is pretty slow. Danny Glover does a good job so you don't know if he's a bad guy. At the same time, other characters are just a story. Dennis Quaid didn't have the story as much as he would have had. I thought the first scene was a little over the top event compared to how the story opened. I'll look at it again. I rated it for 5 (I wish I could rate it 5.5)
