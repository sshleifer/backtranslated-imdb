Are there laws on the weekend? Then it is the film that accelerates their departure if it does not allow the catatonic state to bring a welcome relief from the constant nagging. <br /> <br /> The film is apparently placed on a luxurious cruise ship, which is more of a car transporter; there are more holes in the plot than the middle plate and the dredge from the famous D list. An interesting piece of fun is playing "Spot the Villain" when passengers join the ship. You are not wrong !!!! With a scenario that is sinking faster than brick, clichÃ© sets, and plenty of raspberry jam doubling with blood, this movie will try to include thriller genres, feature films and gore festivals, and at the same time will not fill any of them. > <br /> Must watch a movie if only laugh, how bad it is.
