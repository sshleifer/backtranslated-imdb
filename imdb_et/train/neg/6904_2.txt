It seems to me that, as a graduate of a recent film school, it seems that in those times of New Zealand film that reached new heights, the public seems to think every New Zealand film is great. The wedding of Zion proves that it is dead wrong. <br /> <br /> It's completely overpriced and not funny and far from the fun movie other IMDb users have commented on. The only really funny thing I found about this movie was Derek, the black man, but besides being jokes was a recycled mess we all heard before. <br /> <br /> wanted to see how the film started working with the Polynesian representation. It was a complete ball - I know this is a supposed comedy, but I didn't feel like the characters had said anything about polynesian identity, even if it was linguistic. I was the most disappointed about ending the film and solving the characteristic relationships - Mikaele was a player who confused only white women, reaching their paths easily when the city of 'Dusky Maiden' arrived. maybe he should start looking for a stable relationship, then at the last moment he rejects it and takes his position in polynesia playboyna for women. I didn't understand why they did it. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was very disappointing. My whole family went to see that he was waiting for a good laugh, but really ended up paying bitter to see it in the cinema. The jokes at best are flat, Sefa's girlfriend action, APPALLING, and frankly I would have been happy to have received one of these filmed pirates to save myself $ 15 from the fare. /> <br /> I think the only good thing about the movie is that it's the second step (of course, back # 2, it's a much better film) at the birth of the Polynesian cinema. I hope that in the future, Pacific filmmakers will be able to learn from Sion's wedding, not to reflect on Polynesia and to have something more meaningful and meaningful to say. Even if it is done comedically.
