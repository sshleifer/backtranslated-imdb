Five years after the original Creepshow, George A. Romero and Stephen King: the second worse horror queue: Creepshow 2. This time, there are only three stories instead of five. None of these three stories are really original or distinguished. The first story is a spooky staple, a formal story of a wooden Indian figure that is seeking revenge against the killers of its owners. The effect of this story is really clean, but it's just too familiar to be weighty. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play with the owners of the older stores. The second story "The Raft" is the story of Stephen King. It is about four teenagers who spend the day involuntarily on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon the children will scream for their lives, because each of them is not obviously anhydrous. But instead of skipping children, children get into bad dialogue and revenge, which really prevents us from following. There is also unwanted humor in this segment. The third and final story is "The Hitch-Hiker", which is actually adapted for Creepshow 2. Lucille Fletcher's original story was filmed in 1953 as a film company film. Then it was adapted to the famous Twilight Zone episode with Inger Stevens. The "Hitch Hiker" works best of these three offers, but it is not without its problem. Lois Chiles plays a deceptive spouse who gets over or thinks of a traveler. But we do not know whether to confess or condemn him. Like many of these types of middle stories, the characters are only for reading the tracks on their tracks. Bullying the surrounding story seems a bit away. Tom Savin appears in this postpay "slipped". The good thing is that there is no sequel. * 1/2 of the four stars.
