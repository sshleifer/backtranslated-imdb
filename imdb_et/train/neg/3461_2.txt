Slasher's films are often considered to be derivative, repetitive and honestly unofficial. I have a fan of horror movies, but this movie was just so poor, the words failed. The absence of a script is serious, the plot is ridiculous, it works amazingly bad. Just a whole rounded stinker that I wasted during my life. It had all the entertaining value in the 15th order for the movie that was terrible. <br /> <br /> Who is illuminating this mess? <br /> <br /> I only liked two things in this movie. The first was the killer mask - what was nice. The second was the affinity of Austrail with humorous contempt. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and avoid this ugly confusion.
