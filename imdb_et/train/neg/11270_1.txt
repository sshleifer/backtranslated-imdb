I've seen bad movies, but it took p ***. It makes no sense, and not all characters swear every few seconds, oh and I think one is a small sperm count. This is good. Welshman plays swearing coke. Posh english bloke plays dirty unpleasant cheaters, and some smaller lights play dirty cakes. Oh yes no one has a gun and maybe talks about garbage while having a high drug charge. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like a plague.
