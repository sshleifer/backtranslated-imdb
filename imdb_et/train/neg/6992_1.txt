The plot is about a female sister named Anna, caught in the chaos of the whole world when the meat-eating zombies start to rise and take over the world and attack the living. She escapes into the streets and rescues the black policeman. So far, all right! I usually enjoy horror films, but this film does not deserve to be called horror. It's not even exciting, just ridiculous. Even "Flintstones" or "Kukla, Fran and Ollie" give you more excitement. It's like looking at a bunch of bleeding drunkers who can't get more fluid in the mall. Also, the better heroes who are locked inside the mall are not prevented from eating snacks. Although they do not seem drunk, they give the impression of people with mental disabilities. Save your money instead of spending it!
