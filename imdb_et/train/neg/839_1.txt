The only redeeming part of this movie was the price I paid. At least everything I lost was $ 3.00 and the time it took for that bomb. The crew member who was responsible for the continuity missed the boat. When the female leader and the FBI man went to the alleged killer location, Mr. FBI gave the woman a revolver. When the alleged killer came out of the door, the revolver has become magically automatic. One is left wondering if an FBP agent gives a weapon to a civilian? I don't think so. Xavier seems to be a very attractive woman. It is too bad that the R-rating did not allow much to see him. The film editor seems to have cut out what might have been the best parts of the movie.
