Amen to Magsel. There was a lot of confusion. First, how do you know which movie you are buying? Henry Cele celebrates them all. I bought this movie, thought it was a mini series ... WHAT IS LETDOWN !! It would have been a comedy, but the fact that the young girl is raped. David Hasselhoff (spelling?) Is OK for popcorn TV, but he was not credible in this movie (where was his English accent?) And WHAT'S ANIMALS? The movie was supposed to be about getting a young man to the army - not the slave captain who started looking for his father with an English girl ... <br /> <br /> If I had paid more than $ 7 for that, I need to call the police because it would be a crime !
