After seeing a censored version of the movie a year ago, I was a curious version. I was surprised that it was more plausible and worked well than I remembered, but one thing really looked like. I think other reviewers have mentioned this, namely, what is the nature and motivation of Chris Sarandon's character? Has he raped before the other victims? Is he completely psychotic or "average" sociop? How did he wait for his attack on his younger sister? Is this character believable at all, or is it just a need for more background? He seems almost uncomfortable at the same time and too crazy to be able to actually keep up with the teaching that puts him up with young, vulnerable girls. This seems to be the biggest complaint of the viewers in general. It has nothing to do with its performance, which is terribly convincing. The film has an uncomfortable position between exploitation alone and the serious treatment of the subject, without being in either mode. Not the worst movie ever made, but not all that good.
