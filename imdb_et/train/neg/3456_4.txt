In this movie, everyone talks to Raffy Carruthers, how talented he is, what a great director he will get one day, and so on. I think they're just nice. Even Kimble Rendall, who led this film, shows more talent than he does. "Next Jane Campion," they call her; and even though they are both overestimated, they both have so much in common. They both are looking for movies. They are both women. They are both from Australia. (Well, give it or take it.) <br /> <br /> Jep: This is one of those films whose character is considered brilliant and we just have to swallow and receive it. But I say this to Carruthers: he's cute. - And exciting. Not really. Here are some thoughts about his lack of talent: <br /> <br /> (1) Some of the director's talents are dealing with people. Why is Carruthers so evident that his team even notices him? To make it easier for everyone to gather and kill, I hope. <br /> <br /> (2) Why is this one of the most incredible images I've ever seen? After all, it must be filmed in a REAL movie. How did they get it wrong? It was a miracle that he had finished the film when half of the staff had less than a low level staff. <br /> <br /> (3) Carruthers - a fictional director - has set itself the task of creating brand new horrors of the 1980s. Fat opportunity. I doubt it can be done these days. I suspect that Rendall - the real and the talented, the director - set himself on the same task, realized that it could not be done, and instead began to feel the parody. Of course, parody is not a parody as a parody. As soon as the film and the team separate the isolated manor house, the film spends badly most of the time what the 1980s horror movies did ... well, less badly. <br /> <br /> (4) And yet, and more ... the film opens up not with a parody, but with the 80s honesty and goodness that is starring (it's too good to be true) Molly Ringwald. This paste is much better than what happens next. (This is a bad sign if you find that you would not be watching a movie while watching a movie.) It was also filmed in the late 1990s. Perhaps it is still possible to do the horror of the 1980s. You just have to drop the known parody stuff and MEAN it. (5) I would never have thought what a teenage horror of the 1980s would be if all the characters were with Australian accents, but now I know. And, strangely, I'm glad to know. The need I never knew was met.
