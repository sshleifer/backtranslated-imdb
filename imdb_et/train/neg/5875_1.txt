This film deals with two former football players, Fred Williamson (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey (Lenny), who work as private clients and meet women and men of all kinds of bad backgrounds. Mack Derringer is approached by his former wife, Vanity (Jennifer Derringer), who works by telephone for sexual conversation. Jennifer is threatened by one caller who wants to do terrible things to her, and she asks for help with several other women. Mack & Lenny have more time and often go to Miami, Fl. golf courses or relax in the sports bar, where all the things of the city continue. There are a lot of strikes, killings and many double words that bring this movie to a very big zero. Don't waste your time, this movie only cost me 50 cents and it was too much.
