Boogyman's return is a terrible movie that doesn't play like a movie, it plays like a TV sitcom episode when they get back to older episodes. Boogyman's return is just showing clips. <br /> <br /> The movie's elbow is a constant and tedious setback from the first movie. Again and again the same frames. How it is boring. <br /> <br /> Film is really a psychological woman who has a vision of the first film. <br /> <br /> I've seen the first movie I don't want to see the same scenes over and over and I don't know who it is. The whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a few bucks and that is.
