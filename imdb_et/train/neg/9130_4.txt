It is true that some of the fans of Peter Sellers may be disappointed with this latest venture. But definitely the fans of the sellers will enjoy all of his films, just because of the man's huge talent. and fuishishi Mrs. Dr Fu Manchu is definitely no exception. Unfortunately, it would be the seller's last movie (it was even released after his death), but it's still nice to see how the man had managed to keep his indispensable talent until his premature death. And not only do we get one salesman, but we get, because sellers play not only the role of the title, but also his noble, equally odd Nayland Smith, who detected the crazy 168-year-old Fu yacht. The story is equally extreme when we follow Fu's outrageous antics to make his age-limiting elixir and also Nayland and his companions group try to prevent him. As with any vendor's bigger movie, the film is also backed up by its impeccable performance as well as many of its familiar faces - David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren. few. It is also nice to see that Pink Panther is Burt Kwouk (Cato), who enjoys a portable game with the Seller, although playing the same role, but still nice. The story is really ridiculous, as are many of the characters involved, who classify this movie heavily under the influence of Goon. And although it never reaches the heights of Goon comedy, there are many funny jokes that seem to be in the right direction. The film didn't do business when it was first released due to the grief of the whole world after the deaths of the sellers (the film appeared less than 3 weeks later) and it is always a sad idea that lies behind your mind when you look at it being the last movie of the seller. It's not a big movie - it's often slow, too ridiculous, and sometimes jokes just aren't there - but it's still enjoyable - just the excellence of another seller from Peter Sellers.
