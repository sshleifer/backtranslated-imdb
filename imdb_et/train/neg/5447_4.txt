Only the most frightening DORIS DAY fan could even watch it. When you think of the abundance of material available for New York's most famous power outage, a film that could have dealt with many real tides of what people had to deal with, grabs the story because of the absence of the barrel because of lack of originality. <br /> <br /> Doris is outraged again because he suspects he was infected at night when he had returned to his Connecticut accommodation, took a sleeping bag and woke up in the morning with a man who had done the same, mistakenly got into the house. <br /> <br /> No one can save this mess - not Doris, not ROBERT MORSE, TERRY-THOMAS, PATRICK O'NEAL or LOLA ALBRIGHT. As led by Hy Averback, this is the weakest day of the vehicle dedicated to making the film because the husband's mechanisms cannot get out of it. Damage.
