Humm, the Italian film, marked by David hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I didn't expect very, honestly, and actually I took even less than I expected. This does not mean that this film is the worst I've seen since I looked at things worse than that, but the plot was mostly confusing and uninteresting, and some good gore scenes are the only thing that saves it. Apart from the fact that you love some special effects, they are really cheesy and bad. Now I just want to see this troll "Troll 3", sure it's not worse.
