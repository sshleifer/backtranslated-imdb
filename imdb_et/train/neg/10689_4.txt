Cuba Gooding Jr. is a secret service provider who accuses himself of the murder of a US president, I am referring to the fact that this is not the role that this very talented actor has noticed, and this film shows us why. He's a team with a permanent news reporter (Angie Harmon) to discover the conspiracy surrounding the president's death and so on, blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Even though James Woods, Gooding Jr. of Cuba is cast by Anne Archer and Angie Harmon's 'Final Game' is unable to grab your attention easily and easily; some of the activities are good, doing everything is not bad and the story, though the clich√© and the past, could have brought an entertaining and enjoyable movie - WELL IT DO'NT! Writing and directing a script will make it completely secure, and will not let it in at some point and make any sense to some. <br /> <br /> 4/10 It's boring, predictable and boring.
