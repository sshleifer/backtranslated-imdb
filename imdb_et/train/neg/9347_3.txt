This film slides from a self-evident moment to a self-conscious moment, promising to develop something that deserves to be respected. But it is not. It's flat, self-conscious, unimaginable and annoying. <br /> <br /> Series pictures and backgrounds don't make a movie, they make a calendar. Such a pathetic socialist pseudo-drama documentary ("It Has Really Happened") is not only entertaining but does not convince, so it does not even work in social history. Clich√©s that mix with bad actions make this movie very complicated, the fun factor gets off quite quickly. The characters are one-dimensional, never evolving to the extent that one of them would feel. The director's ego is the biggest character in this film.
