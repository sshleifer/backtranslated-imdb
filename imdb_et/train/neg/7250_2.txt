After reading other reviews of this movie, I think that high markers are likely to be paid for the studio's shortcomings because I saw a movie that was absolutely dreadful, wood-based, lacking scripting, and predictable targeting, one of the few plus points to be admired in admirable landscapes because this movie contains a pleasant stunning background with large-scale views and dramatic sky and wide open prairies, unfortunately, if the most memorable thing about the film is the part behind the participants, it must be a warning sign of quality in the film, all that the Western genre is thoroughly supplemented with even at a very reasonable price that can be obtained from a DVD.
