SHIPPING COST (1 outta 5 stars) This movie offers some pretty cool opening credits (a screen narrator that warns filmmakers to bury for free when they die of watching this movie, a terrifying skull that appears clumsily in the pool and widespread scary music), but unfortunately this movie is down. The widow's man takes his new bride into his separated mansion ... warning his staff and friends that the new lady is very fragile due to his past tragedy. Well, not at all, he'll see and hear mysterious things that no one else can do. Her husband asserts that all this is just her mind and ... well, you can see where it all goes. You've understood what's going on long before our unhappy hero ... because you've probably seen exactly the same plot in hundreds of other films and TV shows (and also made better results). In order to add a number of violations to the film, it seems that most of the cuts in this movie (many cheap DVD compilations) lack some important scenes. You see the heroine slowly toward the window ... she opens it ... you know she sees something frightening ... and then ... maybe the scene is cut off by her husband's hands. What did he see? I think we never know.
