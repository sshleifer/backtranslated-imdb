Amazing, terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> Preliminary remarks and some unpleasant autopsy are not a good movie. Again, I am surprised at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving film production and yet they are not proud to realize that what they have done is the ultimate bunch. <br /> <br /> I sat down and tried to think about the redemption function so that I could at least balance my criticism, but the only thing I thought was that Pink's opening was pretty good .... I don't know if he's it seen? <br /> <br /> Look at this danger, boredom can kill you.
