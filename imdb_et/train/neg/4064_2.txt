This movie is very boring, it talks about a female gas station owner and her life. Nothing exciting happens. The director has really "kept it real" and seems like a camera around a woman when she lives her life. I had to look at others in the classroom for this movie, others were not so boring. This movie was also watched for the task ... it's better worth a good grade of boredom !! In general, if not required, do not look at the movie. But don't rate other films from this director because they are not so bad ...
