No, this is not something of a fairy-tale pumpkin trainer, fairy tale, and glass slippers, but if I did, I'd have to spoil it for you, which I don't want. But don't let curiosity get you better because this movie is not fantastic. This is one of those films that start promising before they betray their audience with cheap tactics and inconsistent styles. And this is a real horror. <br /> <br /> Yoon-hee (To-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your ideal mother and daughter. One successful plastic surgeon, while another your conscientious, obedient and beautiful teenage daughter. Their relationship is like a hand in hand, so close that you mean more than an older child instead of siblings. But things are going wrong (not always) when the friends of Hyun-soo, to whom Yoon-hee has been working, start to bother. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is a warning to the audience and to those Korean women who do not strike the eyelid when knocked down, believing the news is. The only truly frightening moments are these plastic surgical scenes, although I thought that there was actually more gore in the time of Kim Ki-duk than to describe and describe what happens during surgery. <br /> <br /> This is a story with two sides, a fist attempt to hit the audience with the usual scare tactics that will reach me now and now. But the other half worsened the film into mumbo-jumbo melodramatics and was quite busy with forcing his ideas. Some things won't start thinking, and while attempts are always made to explain, you probably won't buy it, not that horror movies are logical. <br /> <br /> Leaders are all beautiful and there is a lack of men in addition to the minor role of the police. But hey, I don't complain, though the story could have been immensely improved. I suggest you only watch it if you are a mediocre Korean horror fan in VCD. Watch these faces that are off-ish moments!
