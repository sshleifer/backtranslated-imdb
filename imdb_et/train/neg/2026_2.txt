Bill Shatner had a game related to the game ... and especially immediately after Deal or No Deal and 1 vs 100. So everyone had to understand to see what all the noise was about showing the new game. What a disappointment! As Ben Stein says statically and nasally, "wooww". <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about this show was that you knew it would end. Full-time sitting was like going to the dentist ... you will find yourself looking at the clock you think at 10-minute intervals to find out that only a minute has passed (but seemed like an eternity) because you saw the clock last. So, why didn't I just change the channel? Well, probably for the same reason most other people ... were not just optimistic. I want to say that no one wants to * think that the show with Bill Shatner might actually be so good. <br /> <br /> Personally, I didn't think from the first 15 minutes that it would be a vehicle to show William Shatner's talents. My main complaint was that the kit was so dark. Looking at it, I got depressed. You continued to want some excitement, but there was nothing. There was not enough light in the kit to get the audience energy (who you didn't even see). <br /> <br /> Dear Network: People don't watch the game to treat their insomnia. .. they look at the game to be excited and have a good time. Please help us all and lose it in the vault.
