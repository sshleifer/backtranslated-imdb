It was the 30th anniversary of the Blazing DVD for saddles, which was great but not that. Nowhere did I see Mel Brook's name here, and I guess why, he has a lot of idea that he's not involved with this pilot. My gawd, who would be funny. Of course, there may be a competition question, but for me it wasn't funny, because it's not just funny. It's like the writers did not even try to be funny, but to tie the cash to the Blazing saddle. Did they think this exhibition would last several times when they did this pilot? Lame out, they don't care. It was a quick money cow who thanked God for not paying out. I think it's only useful for historical purposes or just to show how stupid and unimaginable Hollywood writers can be.
