Usually, after the first minute of the movie, when I hate it or adore it ... but now, I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> The start was great; "It is based on a real story" and blah blah blah thing was funny. After that, cartoons and boys' life description with pictures made me think I had made the right choice. <br /> <br /> When you saw Toronto's fun fake image, it was cool. It also seemed that the first state of the house confirms my first idea and its appearance. <br /> <br /> It was perhaps the first 10 minutes of a movie that later seemed like an eternity. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is not an understanding of English humor (it is possible that Canadians in English do not always understand the humor of Quebecois), but hey ... there were enough things for a short movie * something *. Maybe this could be the meaning of the title? Anyway, almost everything was filling up and very few things were, in my opinion, even funny. <br /> <br /> In fact, "making" was better than film. At least you understand the motivation behind it, which made everything bad. The potential of the idea was great; that is why I rented a movie, interested in "tedious disappearance of people". However, I did not know that the whole universe would disappear, and with it even a point in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are an English-speaking Canadian, you seem to appreciate the local humor, given the surprising number of people who gave this film 8. Otherwise, just think twice before you lose your valuable time ...
