Ye Lou's film Purple Butterfly captures secret organizations (Purple Butterfly) against Japanese troops in a war-torn Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and his former lover Hidehiko Itam (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on the opposite side of the conflict after a random meeting. <br /> <br /> I agree with the Paris Inspector. The film replaces the complex semi-historical conflict of the plot, giving the audience no reason to take care of the characters or their causes. Sudden interruption does not help, because it seems completely unreasonable and pointless. Usually I don't like dark movies, but the lack of light, the film with the bones of the camera, and the generally bad film making techniques make it tough to watch and interest the movie. I also agree with the viewer of Georgia that this film has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography, but I don't think it helps the film. The film's backdrop is one of the strongest events of the twentieth century, and I don't think you can do it in justice by changing it as if it were Michael Bay's movie. Too melodramatic moments do not support its traceability. <br /> <br /> Participants are all melancholic. Zhang Ziyi once again proves that he has an exceptionally limited range of activities because he spends the entire movie he seems to have done in all his films in the best way, exclaimed and generally upset. At least he adds diversity to this role when it comes to Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator's worst love-making. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a very disappointing movie, especially when you see how it comes from Suzhou's director. 2/10
