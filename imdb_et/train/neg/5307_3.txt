What happened? "Doubt" had such a great potential to be a brilliant film, but instead he collided with a dragging simplified plot with a line that made me look. The only thing the film had gone was the glitter of Meryl Streep, who was not a DOUBT-worthy Oscar nomination. Although it was not one of her best performances, she still gave us a solid and true character that flourished through the screen. <br /> <br /> But even the screen legend shine can't record this movie. down the hill. From an eternal beginning with no strength or stroke - less than a convincing end, the film was really disappointing - especially since it provided so many opportunities through its advertising and trailers. It was obvious that the director had problems with the simplicity of the plot, and he came to a boring film that pulled too long, spoke too much and had not worked enough. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the second Oscar candidates were less convincing. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent result, it was by no means worth the Oscar. (Especially since they completely excluded performances such as Will Smith, the seventh pound). Amy Adams did not deserve a candidate. Watching Amy Adams was like watching a cardboard box - as it was one-sided and plain. It would have been better to call him Razzie, because I'm sure he would have won. Viola Davis gave a short but true result, but the length of her performance put me in doubt as to whether the Academy should have applied to her. <br /> <br /> In general, I think the suspicion is one of the most disappointing films. The only bright light in the movie is Meryl Streep, who gives a stunning, solid result - not even enough to record a movie. *** / 10.
