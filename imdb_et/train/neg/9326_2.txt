I and a group of friends who are terribly laughing at them trust me that this has led to some money spent, but also some big laughs. S.I.C.K. is one of the best horror but funny movie we rent. The plot is too big, the whole takes its friends in the forest and never back is really old. The biggest part of the film looks like you are visiting a local butcher shop, except for a little twilight and blood playing dough on the meat. And if anyone has ever been afraid of this movie, they should stick to the Cartoon Network for the rest of their lives, it's pathetic. The good side of the movie is that the two girls in it are pretty hot, one better then the other and you both see them naked during the movie. Another good aspect is that this film is so bad from time to time that you laugh until you cry. I do not like watching horrible activities or renting these terrible videos, I don't find it fun, but I see how much effort these people put and still come out so bad is fun and worth renting out. laugh at someone's undercutting I would recommend. <br /> <br /> If your renting / laughing would laugh, I'd give it 8.5.
