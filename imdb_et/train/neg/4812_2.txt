I thought any horror movie with Orson Welles would be strange. Necromancy was sure, but it was a bit too weird because it was good. The film really has a horrible feeling as it is a small town with Satanists / concubines and a young woman's attempt to escape them. However, the director deliberately tries to confuse and dream the audience. There are too many unanswered questions to Finale. What's worse is that the story is so confusing that any characters are quite difficult to root. It seems strange that Welles agrees with the title of this movie, especially since he doesn't have much to do. Maybe they will put the tapes on this movie one day. Now, it would be really fun!
