This movie is not deserved in the next few minutes, which I criticize, but I know that many people, like me, rely on IMDb.com to decide on films. For this reason alone, I write it. <br /> <br /> "Live Feed" is like the Asian version of 1976 "The Incredible Torture Show" (aka "Blood Sucking Freaks") http://www.imdb .com / title / tt0077247 /. Torture, crushing, murder, cannibalism ... sure it's all here with a third-class script, pathetic behavior, and perverse failure for black comedy. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in China, but everyone speaks English. There are a lot of girls in the movie who are scaring the dogs on the market, but are thrilled to enter the porn lounge. One gal who's messy in the mood for shelter moments is still with his friends boyfriend (how he even got there, may be the only interesting thing about this movie.) The film is terribly terrible, even for a B movie. Even if you download it for free, it would be an insult to your hard drive.
