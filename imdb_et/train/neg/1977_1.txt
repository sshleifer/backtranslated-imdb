Wait, don't tell me ... they threw the movie out and held it out. You know, this movie could have been shot in New York. I think "Gangster Bangster". Gangster Rap, a designer gangster duster, including a casing that really moved from the neck to protect against dust storms on the head. I think it was a head-head protection for K-Mart's hats for filtering heat. "Budget rent-a-horsie" seemed to have provided horsies. One-bedroom scene where the girl spoke, and the boy drove his words .... I told him. You know, watching this movie just confirms that it is no longer acting ... its about appearance and it's about money. This movie couldn't have been too much. All in all, I think this movie will fall as the worst movie all the time. But one more thing where was Ice T? Did he finally go to Oprah?
