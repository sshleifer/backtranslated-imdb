Well, you have to give the director a credit for how he was. Gutsy would be the right term. Not only did he use a total of five people (no add-ons), but he decided to use the sub-par special effects with a confusing and boring plot, he, too, and I'm not kidding, made the start of the movie that you can DIE OF FRIGHT !!! However, they allow FREEEEEE COOOOFFFFFFFIIIINNNN. In order to be a horrible sliding gardener, it is always a good step. Yaaa-unique-aaawwwwnnn .... <br /> <br /> If you watch Mystery Science Theater 3000, you've seen it. They want to show terrible movies to let you know. <br /> <br /> A good gift for a hated person.
