I was so curious about this movie - I saw the full 4-hour version of the roadshow, that's how weird. The film about two very charismatic men - Castro and Che, who are engaged in a huge political struggle - is almost an emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (who is at best a second-rate actor with a bit of high-pitched voice) have no drama or depth and basically come to Castro to tell Che: go here, go there, do it and that - without Without an explanation of the effect or use of this action, Odder is still there where an actor is cast with the necessary power to play Castro-Joaquim de Almeida, but he is left in the small part of the other half. Without the tension or passion that you would expect these men and their followers to expect, the film becomes a giant epic film about hairy, bearded men running through various jungles, screaming and photographing for a certain purpose or end. Many of the reviews I read have praised the work of Director Steven Soderbergh, almost ignoring the actors. (One actually spent more time talking about Soderbergh's new digital film camera than a plot or actors, or the fact that it is entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.) This is a strange, strange thing to do because a) Soderbergh was just a hired gun on film and b) It is only a competent place to work without mentioning when you wear Oliver Stone's JFK in black-and-white cut camera work when Che visits New York. If you can imagine that Reds has directed Warren Beatty instead of Andrew McLaglen, you will understand the boring competence of this film.
