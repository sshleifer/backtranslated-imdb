In the first few minutes of the Dutch thriller, we find out that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps in sans underwear, fantasies about killing his roommate, stealing a magazine from the newsletter and lust after a smiling young man with whom he meets a train station. And he's the hero of this nonsense movie, all dressed up (except for Krabbe in at least one scene), but he's not going anywhere. The basic piece is very simple, but dragged for almost two hours before you reach a pointless conclusion. Verhoeven has a nice visual flair, but it is on natural hallucinations, obvious symbolism and free goree scenes when he runs out of ideas.
