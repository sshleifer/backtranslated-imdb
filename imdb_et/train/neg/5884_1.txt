I'm a big movie fan. I like all kinds of movies. This is undoubtedly the worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I get it to follow the book closely, which highlights the fact that not everyone should be made into a movie. Especially since the book's authenticity has been questioned more than once. <br /> <br /> These characters are not peculiar, they are mentally ill. Things that happen are not funny, they are disturbing; especially since they should be real. <br /> <br /> This movie was familiar with The Royal Tenenbaums, the second movie I hated, just running with scissors was even more annoying and less funny. <br /> <br /> I never get those lessons back. I wanted to wash my brain after watching.
