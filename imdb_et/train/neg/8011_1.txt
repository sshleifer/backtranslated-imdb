I really had to seize a different movie from the rest of the commentators on the site, because when the movie was screened at night, it was the audience that was so worried that (I wasn't even funny) walked. Just as the filmmaker thought he was approaching a terrifying age, approaching a new new territory, the film uses David Lynch's inspired vision of Fassbinder-inspired action. The performances of this movie are so boring and boring that I thought one of the actors would go if the script didn't see how they saw it. What's even worse is that it is painted like a vice president of Miami. I don't know who that director thinks he is; maybe he's surrealistic like Bunuel, Jordowsky, etc. However, the problem is that all the above drivers have a level of erudite sensitivity here. I realized the meaningfulness of this film about ten years ago, but when we have masterpieces like Bad Eduction, mysterious skin and an exhibition of love for me, why is this cinematic worrying? There is nothing new to see here.
