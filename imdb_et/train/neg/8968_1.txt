Writing on the screen is so stupid that I hurt my life for 2 hours. I will never be back (where I heard it before). Operation is so. Things change often enough to keep you looking and waiting for something terrible. However, there is no original thing in this movie. Although the first cube was a nerdy horror film that did not make much sense in the end, the cube has risen to zero and is trying to bring out exactly the same story, except this time when it makes an unpleasant test point to find out every detail the first movie doesn't answered. The comic is that the director circulates the exact scenes of the first movie, which were somewhat strange, and tries to explain them. But the scenes are just copied, there is no coherence. This script is so pointless. I can imagine that it was written by a couple of years old, a baseball cap and a beer pack for a classic project. The best part is at the end, they break the "good" wunderkind man and he gets the first movie as a slow companion and you see him when they found him ("this room is green ..") in Cube 1997. Goodie gooodie, clinging, twisting. First of all, if you have not seen the first one, you have no point in directing the director. Another great idea: instead of the x, y, z coordinate identification numbers (cube 1997), this time it is three stars, each giving one of 26 possible coordinate values. Duh. Except for now, permutations are no longer meaningful, so let their letters disappear before anyone can use them. I want money back. <br /> <br /> I think I had to write this, because there are so many bad, controversial or simply crazy ideas in this movie. Directors / writers should have some talent.
