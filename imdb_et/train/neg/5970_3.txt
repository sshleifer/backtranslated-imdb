Coyote Ugly could have been much more effective if the filmmakers had made this R-rated guilty of joy / exploitation film (plenty of nudity.) Since the PG-13 rating is what all studios want these days, stop this movie: PG-13 "The flick, which shouldn't go far as far as the movie should have gone. <br /> <br /> The script is generic so it's easy to guess which plot point will take 15 minutes before it actually happens. Operation is enough, but characters are so thin that they can't do anything. There were also a lot of points where I seemed to be watching a music video rather than a movie. <br /> <br /> The only asset of this movie is amazingly beautiful women. We can see them in some extremely narrow and very revealing outfits ..... but only so much could be shown because of the limitations of PG-13. There are lots of splitting and toning, rushing bodies that do some choreographic dance numbers, but that can't be said. Thirst Banks (still more aggravated by aging) also have very little time in the film. The sexy newcomer Piper Perabo is also very eye-catching (and has a killer smile) and shows some real action. not yet allowed to watch R-rated movies. This audience can get a lot from this titration aspect, but adult viewers feel distracted and cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: Movie-1 Women-10
