Jared Diamond made the first episode that other peoples of the world did not become animals, but Europeans did it and that is why we were able to make steel and invent intricate machines. <br /> <br /> But in the third episode, he says that when Europeans in South Africa came too far north, they came to Zulu people and other tribes who * grazed cattle and planted crops *. So, what explains their lack of technological, economic and artistic achievements when they have the key things the author needs to succeed? <br /> <br /> Diamond also claims that microbes in the form of smallpox (to bring black slaves to North America) were our biggest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans win 20,000 local soldiers and 400 non-military South Africans can win 10,000 in both cases, I think you have to conclude that microbes are not appropriate. With or without microbes we managed to succeed. <br /> <br /> He said Malaria stopped Europeans from colonizing the north, killing thousands of Europeans, but not Africans. (I'd like to know the real numbers, but he doesn't say.) Then he says that malaria kills thousands of Africans and that they can't catch up with us. What is it, Jared? Did malaria help Africans stop the EuroPean or hurt? And how has Europe been doing in its history despite enormous scourges? He also seems to be too eager to say that the reasons for the success of Europeans were stupid because of happiness. Sometimes, when the evidence threatens to intimidate his dirty theories, he does not want to admit that perhaps Europeans were successful because they worked for it. It's sad to look at this obvious reality of neo-Marxist contradiction to try to prove your point.
