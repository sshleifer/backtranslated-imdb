Overrated and only for those 20s who are wearing particularly thick, rosy tinted glasses that never saw it because they were young. Charming animation, dialogue and tired narrative. The real product of the 80s, the new trick of the puzzle game (this is right, the toy is not absurd, the pretentious and alienating "collector action figurine") that is sold behind bad comics and other items is only important for those who bought TOY when they were "84" to "87" period "real" children. It has become a cult because these same adults are immature to get rid of their memories. Avoid.
