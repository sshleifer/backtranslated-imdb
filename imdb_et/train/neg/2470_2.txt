I've seen a lot of fearful events over the years, such as the Nightstalker, which dealt with the Wendigo legend, so I was expecting an angry spirit that caused chaos to the Halloween season. The man was wrong. The whole movie creates events that start to happen, that is scary and horrible, but then gives a very simplified story of revenge and murder on the loss of some property. Ve-ery scary - not! This movie has a lot in common with Cold Creek Manor, another complete loser. <br /> <br /> It's harder and harder to believe that what Hollywood is about in scary movies because they rarely come up with anything original and horrible. . What idiots are paying for such a fake movie? Go back to the drawing board companions and do something useful with the millions of green backs you have to throw.
