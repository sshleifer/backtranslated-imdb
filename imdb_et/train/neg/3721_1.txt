Two movies are useful for scaring people for God, this and Event Horizon. One has an important and poignant message; the other is both one-dimensional and a religious film. Too bad Paul Anderson went to the hungry Resident Evil movie, he really had something. <br /> <br /> At night the thief is blocking many obvious independent movie attributes (acting, storytelling, dialogue and persuasion) and it is obvious what the intentions of the film are from the beginning. The Christian film industry has not learned from its failures, so we're stuck with Omega's code, left behind, and other Tribulation movies. They are based on the fact that they are so concerned about selling their message: "Get saved, people!" that everything else will change if the Bible beats the audience over the head. <br /> <br /> In general, I can't believe I'm even writing about a movie that's ineffective. Leave it completely and go back to Sam Neil, who casts out his eyeballs. 1/5.
