So it was HBO "Made for TV Movie" eh? Is it an excuse for such a pathetic plot and terrible behavior? Such a shame to see that Jim Belushi reduced his role so often (fired, lived, lying, beaten, lives, shot, lies and so infinitely. , depends on how much he was paid for I think?) a test of South Sheriff). As for this other British, then a bleached blonde, what is me! Recently, the trend for the glorification of these "English-speaking" (sic) superpowers, perhaps thanks to Mr Madonna's two films, succeeds in making fun and justifying the violent use of irony and humor, such as Pulp Fiction. But this film discredits and appreciates the genre. surely this is one.
