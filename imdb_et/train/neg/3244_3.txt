The effect of this story on a psychiatrist who is related to artists is so fashionable that I have to assume that it was the intention. Sets are artificial and I never felt like watching a movie. It seemed that the actors just read their lines, not answering each other. Although the film has elements of the early film noir (except that it is colorful), the approach is so exaggerated that we have to almost conclude that it is a genre parody. <br /> <br /> Given that I didn't like the presentation, I was expecting at least an interesting story. Usually I'm pretty slow when it comes to the twists of stories, but you saw what came here in the first fifteen minutes. "Gee, I forgot $ 80,000," for a moment, I thought this was really ridiculous. A psychiatrist with experience of gambling addictions behaves so foolishly, does not believe. If, at every stage, he behaved like a normal intelligent person, the whole story would have been divided. <br /> <br /> This wood production left me cold.
