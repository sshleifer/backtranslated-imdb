Drawing Limit 9. dir: Matthew Barney. <br /> <br /> How do you know when you're in the middle of an artistic movie? Are there only 8 lines of dialogue within 140 minutes? Is that when Bjork is wearing a pseudo-Asian ritual like a giant hairy pita? Maybe if mammoth turds and backbone are used whale blubber test. Or, if you're ready to make the composition a minimal and still annoying version of Philip Glass's score? In any case, the limitations of drawings are among the 9 most modern art films. After 135 minutes it adds its bias because it is boring to start. I would call the stunning and opening order of color interesting, but the rest of the film looked like it was filmed on the Discovery Channel documentary. It is as long as they seem to be trying to film the version of Christ in their P-s, but it will arrive later. <br /> <br /> In fact, documentaries were the best parts of it. The surface of the plot is about a whaling ship, and then there is a ritual about whale fat production. Then there are guests in the form of Bjork and Matthew Barney, who are welcomed on the ship with a surrender ritual that includes frat boy pranks, nicotine plates and a giant coat hat. Then there is reciprocal removal of internal organs, cannibalism, and not to forget the gigantic swell. <br /> <br /> Matthew Barney has written that it is a 'relationship between resistance and creativity'. It's almost like saying, "If you can't do that, you're not creative in your interpretation, so you because I'm an artist." Wait, wait, this is the POST-modern interpretation of this sentence and what the film should be if it were POST-modern. But it should be modern art. What is about art. <br /> <br /> So, let's start with this whole interpretation, do we? The following lines are only 3/4 serious and should not be taken as real attempts to interpret the film. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is about building a pearl and a giant ramp. Obviously, there is a ramp symbolizing the need for self-esteem for any standards you dear, and pearl divers are looking for pearls of wisdom. Then a whaling ship will be built in a box that looks like a whale in the form of a blank. Obviously the raw product of the workpiece is. <br /> <br /> On board, they make whale fat inside the whale shape and pick out the fins. They replace it with the spinal cord and later with the giant turtle. These should be movie states. If its fat, entertaining but bad. If this is the spine, the "important" parts of that film, or the spine, say so. Then there is a giant turd in the gut of the movie or when the movie is crap. <br /> <br /> Bjork and Matthew Barney, who arrive on separate ships, will be placed in strange humiliating equipment, which AREN is WAD MADE OR SYMMETRICAL, suspected of running out of money and Barney trying to stop smoking. SO, they put the patches on the head. They pass the ritual and study the ship's Japanese examination of a man who tells them that the ship is intimidated when another ship hits it; crash or intersection if you like. It inspires Bjork and Barney, who are different to start cutting each other's legs and eating, so they can become whales and be the same person. They intersect. Oh, did I forget to mention that it's made by Robbie Williams video? Then the pearl divers will come full of pearls of knowledge, which they will fall to make a stupid Venn chart. Barney did it through eighth grade geometry. Or maybe at least some social sciences. <br /> <br /> Oh, and did I forget the sliding I-want-to-kill-score of Bjork's ear? Sometimes it is hypnotic, but others want to kill him. <br /> <br /> An art film is one thing, but if you just throw away all kinds of symbols in the hope of reacting to people, it becomes a self-destructive joke. When will you cross the border between getting a piece of artwork and joking? Dali and Bunuel often made surreal thoughts, but were more consistent and / or more fun than this trash. Un Chien Andalou had the feeling of cramping as much as it could be for less than half an hour. <br /> <br /> So can I recommend it? Only if you like high-quality ART films with many symbols and flat shapes. <br /> <br /> D +
