"People I Know" is a clunker with whom no one can root and no one cares about it despite the efforts of talented cast games. <br /> <br /> Pacino offers its traditional market power, such as Eli Wurman, a moral corruption lifelong cavity-based disclosure agent. But unlike Michael Corleone, it is impossible to invest emotionally in this character, his dilemma, or his fate. <br /> <br /> The film follows Eli's preparations for a liberal political reason, while the customer's attention is disturbed (Ryan O'Neal, a good signed part), the latest "dirty lingerie" - in this case, a television actor associate with the wrong people . Tea Leoni brings his supportive role to his usual role, although the script does not give him much work. Like Eli's sister, Kim Basinger succeeds in generating sympathy despite improbable plot mechanics. <br /> <br /> This movie is strictly designed for those who want to watch Pacino strut and enjoy other principles. Unfortunately, there is a script and direction between "People I Know" strictly amateur. Thus, his limited theatrical release and a quick trip to the DVD are. Think of warning yourself.
