This film is an open set of incomprehensible analogues and poorly prepared parcel devices. <br /> <br /> Movie History: The director of this movie was a perverted man who drove casual women into the city movies. When her husband's film rolls were discovered, she was forced to quickly create a story. He claimed that he would make the movie "The Brain That Dies." Eventually, his wife demanded that she show her "movie". That night he quickly shot another scene with a friend and was born "Brain that didn't die". <br /> <br /> I hate this movie! Plot Summary: The main character's fianc√© is killed in a terrible car accident (caused by ignoring clearly posted road signs). He grabs his head from the wreck and updates it. After the head is restored, he goes up and picks up a bunch of whores. That's pretty much what's going on with the rest of the movie. Finally, he fights and kills a living monster in the closet. Little or no monster appears. But the monster saves the whore and I expect them to live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Side Notes: The final credit screen shows that the movie is called "The Door That Dies". <Br /> <br /> I hate this movie!
