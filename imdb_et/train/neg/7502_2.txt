I've always liked Spike Lee movies, but it was a total of 2 1/2 hours. I waited more for Sami Son and got a movie that seemed to be very little connected in 1977. The dog I was talking about was ridiculous (you know you're in trouble when all the movie patrons laugh laughing). The whole movie seemed very separate and not very interesting. Sex scenes were completely irrelevant to the plot. I don't like sex in the movie, but it should have some point (if it's not a XXX movie). All in all, we were very disappointed with this Spike Lee punch!
