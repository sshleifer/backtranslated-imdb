Cheap and manipulative. There is no heart in this film. <br /> <br /> It is also a terrible dialogue, persuasive characters and a potty or rather non-existent story. It just pulls some of the emotional keys out of the bad, cynical attempt at the most counterfeit and relaxing hysterion! <br /> <br /> And HEDGEHOG !!!! How many cheap pictures can a movie take? By the way, in the hedgehog, it gave a very convincing and observable result in ninety minutes. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, don't do it. I'm sorry, but I can't find any redemption feature for this movie. It gives me a big, fat zero. Strictly all-dogma knicker-wetters. Yawneroony! <br /> <br /> However, if you liked dancing in the dark ... <br /> <br />
