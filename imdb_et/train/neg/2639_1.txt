Allows you to start with this review by signing up for WRITING AND FINANCING ALERTS to save your money !! <br /> <br /> It was one of the worst trash I've seen since Hulk. The style was the most predictable garbage you could come up with. If you wait for 24 but on a big screen, push this wait out of the toilet right away with the money you would use for the ticket. The action was terrible, the plot was totally unrealistic (with the "twisting" at the end. I have to say that. Finally, I was surprised. I am not referring to the twist of the plot that surprised me, but that they put together what could be considered in the film as a mere decent activity as a scene, they rushed to the end so fast that I didn't even think it was over until I saw the credit running and at that point I thought the film was rolling if I could just figure out how to enter that room. <br /> <br /> Casting was terrible for some reason because Michael Douglas played a roll that CLEARLY Keifer Sutherland should have played. Although Douglas slipped around agents, tapping phone lines, hacking systems, and winning people pursuing him, Sutherland plays a less capable agent who is always ab advertising mood even when things don't go bad for him, he plays a very happy agent, something like his Jack Bauer type role for us 24 fans like it. <br /> <br /> I just promise you that this movie is disappointing in all areas. It can be best compared to "Fugitive" / "Fire Line" but written by mentally handicapped people
