I believe in keeping the faith out of the government and out of the movies. If I want to preach, I'm going to church, but I don't want anything in the movie. I don't mind some supernatural subjects (ultimately religion is about as supernatural as you can!), But this film had so much preaching that I was really annoyed. The country house reminded me of witches that they were seen in other films. The bad guy looked like he was horns. <br /> <br /> And what a foolish ending: the hero went to a meeting and yelled at all these old men and it broke the spell. If only life were so easy. I think if movies are such fools, they must be distributed with a warning: DANGER! ATTENTION!
