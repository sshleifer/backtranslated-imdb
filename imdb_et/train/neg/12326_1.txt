A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a 15-year-old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex ... but it's all about some fools or something. <br /> <br /> Just one of the most disturbing sex comedies. Does anyone understand that this film makes the light of a child torture? I think this is OK, because it's a teenage boy - if we had one man serving a teenage girl, this (rightly) annoyance would be. Sorry, but the boy does not excuse it. It's still sick. I understand that Brown was of age (he was actually 18 years old when it was done), but he is looking for 15. I find it annoying that some people find it OK. But it can't work, Brown is easily one of the worst kids I've ever seen) and constant nudity gets boring and not even remotely erotic. <br /> <br /> I saw it I was 19 years old and my 14-year-old cousin (who easily got over 18). He wanted to see it - I didn't do it, but I decide what the hell? We got in and actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were probably minors. My cousin thought it was boring and three other kids left halfway! Let me make it clear - three TEEN BOYS left a movie with lots of women nudity! It should give you an idea of ​​how bad it is. I'm surprised that it was ever released. 1 all the way.
