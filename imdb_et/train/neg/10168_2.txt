Superdome is one of those movies that makes you think about why it's done. The whole plot touches someone trying to sabotage the superbowl and all the attempts to stop them. How Tom Selleck and Donna Mills managed to survive, that's over me. But it was the most depressing thing that there was no football! Avoid this if possible.
