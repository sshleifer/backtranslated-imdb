Well. Where to start. Let's just say that; Avoid this movie at all <br /> <br />. It is based on a series of cartoons. The appearance of the film makes the film probably <br /> <br /> like Hamlet. Filled with horrible actors who seem to be embarrassed here, weak camera work, terrible music and enough product placement to never want Yahoo! again, this movie is really the bottom of the barrel. Quoting New Yorker, Matthew Broderick and <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett worship this image with homosexual abandonment <br /> <br /> men who have seen a rare wage type far away. "<br /> <br /> They should pay us the millions they earned for watching. <br /> <br /> Awful.
