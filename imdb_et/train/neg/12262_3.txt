Fans of creature films have to endure many terrible films lately. Blood Surf shamelessly joins a list of animals that want to turn the food chain upside down with stupid, superfluous cellulose-horror headlines. Crocodiles are particularly successful because we already have to fight our way through the crushing Crocodile (led by the poor Tobe Hooper) and Lake Placid. Blood Surf is in any case just as bad as those other movies and ??? Besides that ?? he wants to exaggerate enormously. The salt water crocodile is said to be 90 years old, over 30 feet in length! During the movie, he amused himself by hugging a number of completely stupid surfer dudes and dudettes who were looking for new excitement when they surfed the shark in a congested area. The only beautiful aspect of this film is the tropical location. Although it is a totally inappropriate place for such a film, lagoons and nature seem to admire. Every other aspect is simply catastrophic. There are quite a few gore, but it all seems fake and ridiculous. Dialogues are completely painful to listen to! You don't believe in some of the lines that these actors have to say! I know that surfers should be a mentally underdeveloped group, but I hope they are not so stupid! At the beginning of the film, one character refers to the jaws as a "mechanical toy", but here at least 10 times less real than Spielberg's big white shark. Visual effects in blood cells are amateur and mass murder does not impress. I'm not saying too much about action, because it is secondary in such flaps. The girls see the sexy in their wet shirts and their boobs joyfully collide when they are away from the beast. You thought that right: Blood Surf is a very bad movie. So bad it becomes fun again. But "funny" for any other reason than James Hickox.
