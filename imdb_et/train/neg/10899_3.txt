Cheap and pointlessly buggy story and act. Not a good line, not even good enough to be a good and memorable delivery. Even the roller coaster that came with the DVD showed how the actors were wrong and how few of them were fun. The esoteric and occult base was apathetically unreliable and the antagonists could not be horrible or plausible. "Homoerotic" stories were meaningless and dissatisfied and were limited to young boys hugging their boxes when they were loosened in their boxers. I'm not gay enough to evaluate it, but little action could have kept me and my girlfriend awake.
