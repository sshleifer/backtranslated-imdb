Since I am not a blood and gut fan, I have found completely unnecessary genetic scenes (it is written correctly) and I liked it too real if you are a person who gets your stones on the internet or snuff I tell you to go for it, it spurs faith , which person dreams of sick mess. <br /> <br /> Apart from being able to have a great movie, the music was also top-notch (through the movie) and ultimately the final credits). Although some parts were a bit unbelievable, as you have just found your girlfriend, torture and death are waiting, and all you do is tell her what happened and how you got there (why she didn't ask if she happened to have it towels or even air fresheners or pieces of rubber?), come now, most probably just scream "hurry and loose me, then let me get f *** out of here!" where were the flights, the breeds, etc., and if the girl accidentally arrived, the nerve of the rotten meat would have felt some alarm clock! I would recommend this movie only to friends and others of Dennis Niellson, I'm sure that such a video would make patients so happy that they would have a happy Christmas.
