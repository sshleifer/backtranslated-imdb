Is this a stupid movie? You wish!! I didn't find any moment in this movie that was horrible or scary. Foolish moments? Much. Stupid characters? You wish. Bad influence? Everywhere! Rick Baker may have gone and made bigger and better things, not one of them. Oh, people have to start somewhere. Ted Nelson is cheese. He's the little doctor I've ever seen. He has a melting man who works somewhere in Ventura County, he's not too happy that his wife is pregnant (probably he's 55 years old and weighs 90 pounds) and there's no cracker there. In addition, he is not at all too helpful in preventing astronaut Steve from finding. And the local sheriff wants to know what's going on, even though Mr Nelson can't tell him. There are also some random characters that are thrown to a size that comes in contact with a melting man. Finally, the end of the movie ends and the monster gets into the trash to become a compost. Finally, this is just what you need for a great MST episode.
