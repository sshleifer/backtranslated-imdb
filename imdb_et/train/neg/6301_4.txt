Despite the work of supporting actors and Alani Plater's intelligent script, this film suffers from a deadly error - lack of central character / actor charm. One character describes the character of Richard E Granti as a "whispering little turtle", and unfortunately he summed it up perfectly. There is nothing about him or his performance that makes it believable that his girlfriend and top class publisher / friend would spend so much time and emotional effort on him. He is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and thoroughly annoying. Some were invited to an actor who could love you even when he was a prize - for example Ewan McGregor. <br /> <br /> The whole class system wise satire is wasted thanks to this irritating and thoroughly unlikely performance. All I wanted to do was shake her and tell her to get over her.
