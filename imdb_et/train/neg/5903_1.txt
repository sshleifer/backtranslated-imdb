I live in Salt Lake City and I'm not Mormon, so why did I rent this movie? Well, because I live in Utah and thought it would be nice to see the movies I know. I really knew I was going to get no jokes inside, so I wasn't surprised when I was sitting with the deer in daylight. What I was surprised at was the Antimony Mormon activities in this film. <br /> <br /> I know this is a Mormon film intended for members of the LDS Church, but I found a typical stereotype of insulting people not in their faith. Any non-Mormon who wasn't much, drank, smoked, and had an amazing selfish attitude, why? <br /> <br /> That really pointed out to me about this movie, they made the Mormons so clean, but the rest of Utah, which I think, is full of punk-psychos just because they don't follow the scriptures of the LDS Church. <br /> <br /> I understand that plots rotate around all LDS members, but you think Salt Lake City was 100% Mormon, not even close to the truth. And as I said, the non-Mormon movie was drunk, please! <br /> <br /> I think I just can't get it because I don't belong to their faith and I think I will never.
