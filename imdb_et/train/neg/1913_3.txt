"Welcome to Collinwood" is such a disaster. Given the people involved, it should have been several times better. <br /> <br /> Looking at it if you are at least somewhat related to the belief that it will heal, you probably cry. This is one of those films that had the potential but was robbed of this potential due to the terrible script and some bad action, not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary nature of George Clooney and the man who reminds me of Richard Dreyfuss, but who I care so little about even want to know his name. <br /> <br /> The only rescue of the movie is the strange con vocabulary it introduces. I found myself for a while again when I looked more at the captains of crimes. This is the only reason why I gave the movie a 3rd. The plot is boring, the characters are neurotic, unnecessarily offensive and very unlikely. They are constantly embarrassing and they are so irritating that I celebrated their obstacles. They worship one another and swear harshly. The dialogue is at the lowest points with the best and most offensive fools. <br /> <br /> I find Steven "Traffic" Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney guilty of this. They should be blamed for war crimes if someone remembers this mess long enough to take care of.
