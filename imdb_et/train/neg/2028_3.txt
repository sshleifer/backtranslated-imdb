On the surface it would be "Show me money" at least ready for the whole season. You always had William Shatner entertained, surrounded by dozens of beautiful leggy models, collectively called The Million Dollar Dancers. You were aware of the contestants who had interesting stories to talk about their lives and who probably knew a lot of pop culture trivia. And you had big money! So, what went wrong? <br /> <br /> The format of this game was a malfunction. A good show of play requires at least two of three things: very simple rules, exciting tempo and the ability of the viewer to play at home. Best of all, the most durable of all three. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, SMTM did not have any. <br /> <br /> The rules of this game were the most challenging game shows in history. . Let me try to explain how the game worked in the shortest possible time. <br /> <br /> The competitor started with one word or a short phrase, followed by the letters A, B, C (fine plug of the net?). Each letter was connected to a separate question, all of which started with that word or phrase. If a competitor chose one letter, they can answer this question or forward and choose another letter. When they passed, they could look at the next question and have the same choice. But when they answered another question, they had to answer the third option. <br /> <br /> After receiving the answer and before they found out if their answer was correct, they then had to choose one of the 13 dancers on the stage, each with a different amount of money when browsing their side. They showed the amount of their dollar (between $ 20,000 and $ 250,000) and depending on whether the competitor responded correctly ... or answered incorrectly ... this amount will be added or removed from their bet. <br /> <br /> So far with me? In addition, there was one dancer with something known as the "Killer Card". If you chose a dancer with the Killer card and you had met your question correctly, you were safe and the game continued. But if you were wrong, you had one final question. If you got this last question wrong, you were out of the game. If you got it right, the game continued. <br /> <br /> There was no money if not earned until you answered correctly to the six questions or got the wrong six questions or you were still wrong with the hole you didn't get enough money to get back. I understood? Okay! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I saw was the lack of full voltage due to the lack of a game. The competitor could ask questions they knew and answer many of the questions they knew, making the pressure even less. Then they still found a low dollar, even after deliberately not knowing, which meant that there was no "drama" yet. And the fact that they were able to answer the wrong question and still have a chance to win was a big mistake. And the pace of the questions was deadly: often the questions were so obvious that they had been trying ridiculously, as if there were any doubts about the most common answers. <br /> <br /> The lack of real tension during the show and these very complicated rules prevented this program from working despite Shatner's terpsichorists.
