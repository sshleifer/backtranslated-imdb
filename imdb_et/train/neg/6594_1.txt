I've seen the most, if not all, Laurel & Hardy classic movies. I've always been there in a comic silly, even after watching it over and over again. This new film is trying to bring the classics back to the two new actors, who both recall Laurel & Hardy, and fail for a number of reasons. One of them is how their on-site laptops are (still in the early 20th century) depicted in the 90s. Some of the previous dialogue was brought back, but it is not unhappy with the classical series. This film can be the worst film I've ever seen, and it should be pulled out of the shelf and locked forever. The real Laurel & Hardy spawned so badly in their graves.
