Mistake ... this movie sucked. Much. <br /> <br /> I've read some other comments. There are probably many people who think something about Woody Allen is writing or the stars are automatically good ... <br /> <br /> I've been watching several of his films, in vain, hoping I was missing something. But no, they just suck. Poorly written trash. Characters are all very stereotypical (not to mention fools). The plot is ... I think it should be mysterious. Not sure about that. Mr. Allen's character is ... Woody Allen, any other movie you've seen. <br /> <br /> If you're a Woody Allen fan, check out this movie. If you are under 50, don't worry. (If you're a fan of Woody Allen and you're under 50 ... well, you're atypical. I don't know what to say.)
