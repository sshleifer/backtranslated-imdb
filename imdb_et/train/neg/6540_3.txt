I can't believe so many compare this movie to Argento. His work is much more imaginative and cruel - and much more fun. <br /> <br /> The director simply has no ability to build up the real tension. Murder images - and let's face it, it's the genre that all are - not interesting. It wasn't hard to guess who was the murderer, and I really didn't care if it came out. Cinematic art is not memorable and the 19th century gothic gothic atmosphere just didn't take me in. Many actors are pretty good (especially the manager and sadistic girl who drives it for younger students), but they do, there is very little work to do. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are subtleties of incest, sadomasochism, and lesbians, but amazingly they add very little spice or intercourse. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
