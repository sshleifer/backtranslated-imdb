Rex Reed once said about the movie ("Julia and Julia" to be specific) so that it looked like it was through pomegranate juice. I was reminded when I hit Purple Butterfly. It seemed like shooting through a gauze. <br /> <br /> The story was boring and it didn't help that in the case of large scenes, the faces of the participants were literally out of focus or only came after a long time. <br /> <br /> Also, everyone saw the same way, so it was difficult to distinguish between them. I call it the "dead poetry society" syndrome. <br /> <br /> No one was interested, no one was interested in dramatically, and the film didn't give historical light in a very interesting period of time and circumstances. <br /> <br /> All the disappointment.
