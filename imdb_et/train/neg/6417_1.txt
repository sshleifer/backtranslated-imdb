How to comment on comments such as what was the title of high school girls, even on this site, was the most stupid film I've ever seen, it was ridiculous, how indifference can sit there and say that just because the movie makes you jump this is a good movie that can be the most idiotic thing I've ever heard, i could jump behind you and go "boo" and it would make you jump, but that doesn't mean I'm qualified to write or run a movie, not to mention that "they created everything at the end" is not a good reason why the movie is well received. What movie would it be if they didn't tie everything together, I think it would change that movie, not the whole movie. So basically, this idiot girl congratulates them on finishing the film, I also love how today's young media and manufacturing companies get to such a high level. It's no wonder that the political system of this country can go away, whatever they want, we have idiots in our country, what would happen if this girl really came to lead something one day, that is a frightening thought. Get a life and go see a real movie sometime, try Shawshank's redemption or Waterfront or something, and don't comment that it was "boring" after you see it, just use what the little brain God gave you a little.
