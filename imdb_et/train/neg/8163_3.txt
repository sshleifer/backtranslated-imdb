I agree with everything people have said about it, but I have to add that the soundtrack is probably ACTIVITY I've ever heard of all my life! At a time when you should listen to the participants, there is a real vocal! And the vowel is like the wider version of Danzig's song: "Darkness of the Forest! Dark, Dark Darkness of the Forest!" or something that doesn't hold it. The singer is a terrible vibrato and has been recorded with high microphones over some of the synthesized string parts and the blast drum. It's terrible !! Yes, male leaders are terrible. So are the women. This is one bad thing about gender stereotypes - it's so bad! All they say is men or women, but they play stereotypes max. Makes me sick. Soooo boring !!! <br /> <br /> The kids were sounding their lines, you couldn't understand them. And why do women's ghost pants always wear hair, pretty blue dresses and long hair? And boys always wear clean cut small shiny blonde hair? Not scary - STUPID. <br /> <br /> Dad's face was free and clean to be the face of a man living in a cave. Nice beard and bang, pa. Did you cut those knives perfectly or did you go to town and go to the salon? <br /> <br /> Stupid movie.
