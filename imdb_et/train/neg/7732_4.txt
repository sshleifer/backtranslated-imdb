Before writing this review, I went back and read the reviews of others. This movie was especially disappointing for me because it contains two of my favorite dancers, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris, who often have amazing Michel LeGrand ("Wuthering Heights", "Ice Station Zebra", "The Thomas Crowne Affair"). ") The dance was stylish, unmotivated and unfair, the songs were forgotten, the story was joking, even the costume was not very attractive, only photography photographed the right mood and spirit, I am glad that other people enjoyed" Rochefort young girls ", though certainly not .
