There is no doubt who is the head of the cadre training in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays a new type of soldier from his cadets - the bombardier - who follows the military discipline. However, he is not so stiff to be unfair or friendly. In fact, he even changes his opinion about the value of women working in the military. She is hard when she has to be, but at other times she has a clear combination of coach and pastor, the roles she has improved in other films. His character is the basis of the activity around which everything revolves. O'Brien looks natural in his role and plays it in fine fashion. Two things will help in this film: O'Brien's performance and outstanding special effects.
