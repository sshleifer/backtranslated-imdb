I like high quality crapness, and that's where the best are. cg is out of this world, or at least before our world happened and the madness of a 6-foot child in dressing rats that tricks people is ridiculously bad. I enjoyed it somewhat, but the actor is so terribly terrible, and even a mandatory naked scene doesn't really have any cracks. just a complete waste of time when I saw it. I do not know who wastes more time, I look at it, or poor people who forced it to do so with a little hope that it will start its working career. I can assure you that this is a habit. But on a lighter note, I have succeeded in making this movie 6 degrees Kevin Bacon successfully, so I think it was worth a 91-minute view.
