This film on paper seemed to be good after watching, but I realized that this movie was absolutely terrible! The plot has no meaning, and I think I thought the best part of the 5,000 cut scenes, each of which made the film more annoying and boring. I was looking at this late-night black noise not just to add it to SCARINESS, but the truth is the only thing that scared me was the music they called tragic music, they play opera, be it serious! This movie summarizes everything that's not good for this movie. To be honest, say more, but look at your own responsibility, this movie is just a complete garbage, enjoy!
