The problem with "The Killer Elite" is that just looking for this movie and looking at it with investment time, you put more experience than many of its leaders, especially Director Sam Peckinpah. <br /> <br /> Already volatile Peckinpah headed for this film in the rough weather. According to at least one biographer, he got acquainted with cocaine. Add it to her drinking, and it's no wonder things have collapsed. <br /> <br /> This is a shame, because the concept behind the movie is good and the first ten minutes promise a lot. Mike Locken (James Caan) and George Hansen (Robert Duvall) are private contractors who do a lot of CIA work. They move fast, live well and seem like the best friends - something happens that crushes their brotherhood. <br /> <br /> The open scene shows that they are blowing up the building - why we're not talking exactly about the fucking motivation of this movie. But it is that these guys wound people and don't care - antiheroods resemble Peckin's not so long ago. The opening title tells us that they work with ComTeg, then adds a plain-language cheek "... thought the CIA could use such an organization for any purpose, of course it is redundant." This is a pretty smart way to find out for the audience that all bets are off. <br /> <br /> Add a traditionally strong Peckinpah backup, including Burt Young, Gig Young and Peckinpah regularly to Bo Hopkins. Crazy, who can't let $ 500 a day, and just want the scriptwriters, including the labeled Sterling Silliphant, tried to make the story more than make it a lazy platform-liners and bad crusts. The attempt to inject a dose of liberal social commentary has been awkwardly worshiped. "You're so busy when you do your dirty work, you can't tell who the bad guys are," someone says to Locken as if he or we need it. Even worse is the clumsy direction of Peckinpah and the slow pace. We are 40 minutes in the movie before we get our first battle scene, a totally chaotic random collection of images of those people we haven't met at San Francisco airport. the end of the movie. When the end of the film comes from the left-hand battle, the battle in the battlefields fleet is a battle that the ninjas are running out of, so that Caan offsets one of the liners that created all the clues in the real interlayer. "Put me on seven to five, I'll take a little boy," he says just before the climatic samurai duel between two ninja warriors - from China, which we all know, is Ninja land. (Fighting is taking place in San Francisco, but surprisingly, Mounties can't get to break things.) <br /> <br /> Caan is much better in smaller scenes, such as Locken, who is recovering from some nasty injuries, says one of his bosses played by smooth Arthur Hill that he is "humpty-dumped" by the organization. Caan refuses to fall down and reuse recovery scenes, even though the death of the movie, she is playing a good role, and Van's daughter Amy Heflin is a nurse. Caan was one of the best actors of the 1970s and his laconic co-play with Heflin, Duvall, Hopkins, and both Youngs gave "Killer Elite" real traceability. <br /> <br /> But you don't look at "Killer Elite" thinking about it. You look at it when I thought of a movie that has gone away.
