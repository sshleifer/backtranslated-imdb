Who did this film research? It is set in Baghdad in 2004, but all soldiers wear ACUs and have all the universal camouflage patterns. Nobody carried this stuff 04. <br /> <br /> I just saw this movie abroad and can I say that the audience's overwhelming feeling was WTF? This film didn't make any sense, the characters had come and went without explanation, and people do ridiculous things that never happen in real life. I understand this is a movie, but apparently it is trying to portray something realistic. It fails, but it is trying. <br /> <br /> It is like someone who came up with a lot of random ideas, chewed and swallowed, then vomited the film. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. I'm still not sure why I was going through the whole thing. GI Joe was the one who really thought about it. HOW TO REMEMBER!
