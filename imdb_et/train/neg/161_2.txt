If you can imagine Mickey Mouse as a pimple on New York Street or as a Communist spy for John Wayne, you might believe Pat Boone is a juvenile offender on his uncle's farm in Kentucky and you could enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is so stupid that it is not a sexless love story even in the mid-1950s. The problem is that Hollywood did so much that Pat Boone refused to kiss a woman who is not her husband before it was released, so the audience knows she would not be able to kiss Shirley Jones so you can't build any expectation of "screen perfection" for their love. It's kind of like the West, where cowboys don't have weapons. <br /> <br /> The story is meaningless. Even the title song is sung with painful enthusiasm. April Love Love belongs to the worst film package with Ishtar and Plan 9 from Outer Space.
