I give this movie 3 because it is worse than the cult movies that deserve the right 2. Isn't that good for you? Well, it doesn't have to. This is another vampire film with a stupid plot, no, let me rewrite, an incredibly idiotic plot where cowboys (with cowboy hats) fight space on enemy vampires. <br /> <br /> if it is? The only good thing about this film was Natassia Malthe, whose beautiful Norwegian beauty was. God, I wish the brothers Michael Ironside and DeLuise would stop receiving foolish movies in the dark films! I mean, at least SeaQuest was great! I know a lot of movies from Mr. Ironside, he has been working on this day on 164 movies !! It is true that he rarely played a very important role, but still!
