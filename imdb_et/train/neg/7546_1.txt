I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I didn't think he would work on such a movie. I couldn't believe other comments and I thought it shouldn't be at least once ... but trust me, that is. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen an old movie. But why would they want to make such a movie again. The great idea of ​​a good Horror movie is whether it should be an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. This movie doesn't belong to any of them and just stays fool. I just watched the film hoping it would be interesting at some point, but it never happens. <br /> <br /> So this movie is not great for horror movie fans or Cage fans. You can probably show it on television.
