It reminds me when I was born a re-believer who is going to be a minister. I never thought I would be a minister or even stop at high school because I was almost positive. It was before I discovered that Christianity was a bunch. I am now an atheist, and it just proves that the "ever saved always saved" doctor, which Christians say to us, is no longer real than the elves. If that were true, why did I, after years of descent, be born again as a believer? Yes, I was actually saved. I prayed with this heart of the prayer of these foolish sinners. <br /> <br /> If Christians should read their Bible, they will discover that their god thinks like rape, genocide, abortion, and many other cruelties are right for him. They may be surprised if they know that the word "rapture" is not mentioned.
