The film starts with 3 people who meet at the bar. OKAY. They talk about their imaginative lives that stand forever without reason. Still. They laugh from time to time. Interesting. The first 30 minutes you really enjoy! But then ... things get worse ... Nothing happens ... for a long time ... and when something happens, you only see the naked old "women" who touch each other! Not OK. Nasty! By the way, this part should be the top of the movie, but that's all that! The film makes no sense, it's boring and sick! Strangely enough, here (in Belgrade, Serbia) at FEST (Film Festival) this film was of course the most popular before people watched it! I was even thinking (before viewing): "Hay, it may be interesting, though it's a Russian movie!" But, God, no !!!!
