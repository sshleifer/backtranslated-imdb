At what point does a good film go bad? When does the movie go from "traceable" to "where is it & ^ @ _ + #! * OFF switch"? Thanks to good DVDs like what you can borrow from the library - free! I also appreciate the "advancement" of the DVD player. I'm sorry for those people who were wrong in the office. <br /> <br /> At one point (I have forgotten exactly when everything is now blurry), our "hero", Luke Wilson will run through traffic; I think he was looking for a cab. It was at the moment I gave up knowing that I didn't care if he found his ride or was left with a garbage truck. <br /> <br /> The last time the movie was interesting was when Luke Wilson climbs out of the trash, in the hair dryer and first meets Uma Thurman, the "heroine". This scene ended with purses that, by shooting, escaped from far away, far away from Liu and Um. It was the last time the movie was funny and when was this scene? Ten minutes flick? <br /> <br /> Every time the movie tried to "funny" it didn't. Every time the film was "thrilled", it went in the opposite direction. When the musical result could push the life of this dullard out, the soundtrack was empty and quiet. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes were not necessary and were lying; Damage to kits and props is unnecessary and childish. When Uma turns into a mad ex-girlfriend, I felt like I was watching "40-year-old Virgin Virgin Pulp Fiction"; then I realized that there was no return because I didn't want "40-year-old virgin" and "Pulp Fiction". <br /> <br /> Luke Wilson's Link, Rainn Wilson (also seen by The Last Mimzy) does nothing more than an insult to this horrible movie. Rainn Wilson, the King of Boredom of Television, should stay on the same terrible media. Hey, Rainn Wilson! Leave full-length movies alone! Every time Uma rival Anna Faris came on, I waited for Jason or Freddy or some scary monster to jump out of the landscape; When you see Anna's "Scary Movie", that's all you ever see, regardless of the movie, regardless of the medium. The character played by Wanda Sykes was just terrible and so inappropriate in such a flick.
