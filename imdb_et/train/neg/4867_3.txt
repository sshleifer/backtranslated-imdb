That's what we need! Another remake of vintage Hollywood cinema, where Eddie Murphy failed a second time after NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996)! Ladies and gentlemen! This shows why we have special ideas for running a quality movie! It has some hopes for this pleasant and pleasant image of animals that can act with and talk to people. Unfortunately, things can get worse. Bathroom jokes and sexual references instantly kill this "family" funfair. Even parents and children saw trailer advertising on the Family Channel, followed by cinema and disgusting cinema. It is sad to say that this is a more progressive time in the pre-millennium, but enjoy it when it lasts, because things can only deteriorate over time. More went wrong with the new DR. STOP. It's totally pointless, feeling too flat. I hate this Chris Rock's irritating voice !!! We need more talented voice transfers than overpriced celebrities who don't want to declare bankruptcy. I have to agree on my local newspaper, which will make it one of the five worst films of 1998. Again, the original version wasn't good either. Murphy's next project could be PATTON if he's not careful!
