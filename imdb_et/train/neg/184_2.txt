Mann takes pictures of Alberta Rocky Mountains perfectly, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem. <br /> <br /> But come to Hollywood - Mountie, who tells Dawson City to the people, Yukon, to choose the Marshal (yes Marshal!) and enforce the law by himself, then the arms defenders are fighting over the streets to control the city? <br /> <br /> Nothing is very similar to what happened on the Canadian border during the Klondike gold speed. Mr. Mann and the company seem to have been mistaken for Dawson's city, Deadwood, in the north of Canada, to the wild west of America. <br /> <br /> Canadian viewers are ready for the type of ridiculous taste that this ridiculous plot does, or shake the head with the head.
