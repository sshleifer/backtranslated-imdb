Both this and Matrix spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> I liked the original Matrix. It was not a deep film, despite Fishburne's endeavors to philosophy, but it was rather lively, fun, and I have a soft spot for Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> At first, Neo's secret life was a rather unhappy cube worker Anderson. Day, company drone and night, brave hacker. Finally, he is finally forced to choose between his actions and his life - whether he becomes a machine fighter, or he returns to a safe, forgotten world where he entered. Interestingly, he discovers that when one breaks the illusions, life sucks more. She has her girlfriend and her husband's companions, but she eats processed cookies, dresses up in sweat, and lives in a really sore machine. But the truth makes him free. <br /> <br /> At least part of the fun of this first movie lies in the issues raised by the viewer, if it were me. What if _I_ was impossible? What if I was one. It doesn't even mean that what you are is one example. This cool title is so. <br /> <br /> Next, Agent Smith did a great deal of badness because he emboldened all the fear of authority we carry with us. He was both unstoppable and graduate and merciless. <br /> <br /> At the end of the matrix, Neo must return to the Matrix to share his freedom news. <br /> <br /> The film is not able to fully implement the original film ideas and is so happy with writing such a poor scenario and poor editing that I can't believe these changes are designed for. If the dialogue is at the fifth-class level and has fallen accidentally with different long words, I find it hard to believe that they understand what they are talking about. <br /> <br /> My short list of testimonial disturbances: <br /> <br /> Oracle gets lightly helpful when fraud is completely obstructive, without any real reason. <br /> <br /> The main "personalities" of the matrix have been introduced without need - for example, the key person was a cute idea, but just not an interesting sign. <br /> <br /> Fishburne loses its "advisor" role and cannot replace anything. <br /> <br /> The Zion People are not very pleasant, nor do you really want __new_new_new_new_db_db_index_en.html <br /> <br /> Special Effect Problems: <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes are meaningless and compatible. In the matrix you felt that Neo could be lost and that he had to survive to survive. In Matrix Reloaded, he is only the point of view of the poorly drawn video games. <br /> <br /> The road race seemed quite fake, not interesting. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, the fighting scenes were infinite. <br /> <br /> Rave went too long - all the theaters in my row looked at my watch. Not because we think of good dances and good orgy, but because we didn't know the people in the picture and didn't care. It curved, used words that were not clearly understood by the screenwriter, and it was a waste of time and a tempter. The creator's speech could have been made at the tenth time and more at risk when "Zion is there to give rebels a place to go so they don't destroy the Matrix. There are too many people who don't believe the matrix is ​​threatening to crash and kill every person who tried it, and besides, the land cannot even support people in Zion, let alone others, you can choose one person from Zion to form a new Zion, while I sweep the memories of the people who are now in the Matrix. "<br /> < Instead, we got a long, drawn pile. If someone claims it is deep, ask for a copy and try to break the sentences. Each of them is too long with too long points and uses words using clearer and shorter synonyms. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I've seen the third, and despite what many reviewers have said, skip it. It won't save this turkey. <br /> <br /> Reviewers who feel that the second and third films were "deep" should watch really deep movies. Maybe you read a book or two rhetoric and debate and maybe a little philosophy. This movie is not just difficult to understand, but it is a heavy stomach. <br /> <br /> Scott
