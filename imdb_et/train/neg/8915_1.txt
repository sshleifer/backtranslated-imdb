My comments on this movie have been deleted twice, which I find to be offensive, because I try to evaluate this movie for other people. Please allow other people's opinion. Obviously, Nietzsches does not understand the writing of the spirits, so my comment has changed badly. <br /> <br /> I think this is a very bad movie for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> Theme: one should be very careful when making a film about a philosopher that the masses do not even understand and perverse discussions among peers. One thing philosophers agree is that Nietzsche was a great thinker. So making a movie about your life, which probably includes his "ideas", is something that should be extremely careful or preferably not at all. Wisdom begins with the knowledge you do not know. It may be thought that this is not a review of the film, but the film does not mean imaginative character, but the life of the person who actually lived and had / had great influence yesterday, today and tomorrow in the world. If someone talks about a tomato story, I can express my thoughts about myself, but also about the chosen theme, tomato. Producers are responsible for making the actual facts about the film. This responsibility was not specifically taken in this case. <br /> <br /> Scenario: One of the first things I noticed was ridiculous accents. Why? This draws attention to what should be; Nietzsche and the truths he found. It doesn't help things in the right geographical perspective or time! Come on, make it English or better; German! Even Mel Gibson got this part right ... let his characters talk about passionate Aramaic. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it has worked well. <br /> <br /> 3d, Assante is not a Nietzsche actor. Poor pouring. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the facts are completely out. <br /> <br /> And so on. Waste of this cellulose.
