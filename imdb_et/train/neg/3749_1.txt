Oh, I love and respect pretty much what David Lynch has done. But this film is similar to the attempt of the first filmmaker to make a pseudo-art video. <br /> <br /> A couple of examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch is usually a visual filmmaker but had little visual artistic content (empty walls, "snapshots" in the background). <br /> <br /> 2. David Lynch is usually very proud of the sound, but it can even hear a cam. In fact, it is very difficult to swallow the idea of ​​having something to do with this film. if ... <br /> <br /> ... it's fun, with David's involvement, to force fans to search for their website (in hours) to find this generation. I hope this is because at least this idea is funny.
