Do not worry. A small prosciutto could go a long way, but all we have is a clean ham, especially from Dunaway. Plot is one of those bumper episodes ... the vehicle jumps to another and everything changes direction until we just scratch our head, wondering if there is ever a plot. Gina Phillips is really good, but it's hard to play with the mystified Dunaway, who plays Lady Macbeth's Marx brother, Duck Soup. Ah, Raven ... now there is an actor. And there's a relative who just lies and in bed and looks haunted. Or Dr Dread, full of gloomy and working remedies. I'm one of those babies who just see the end of the movie. Quoth Raven, "Never again."
