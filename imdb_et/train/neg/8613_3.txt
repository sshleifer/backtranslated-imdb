When I watch this movie, I almost tears. Not a laugh, but a reminder of the great Rodney Dangerfield movie. Candyshack was his first and stole a movie. Easy money was his best, and Back to School is far from an 80-year-old classic masterpiece. Then there was Ladybugs and that was when she started showing. Poor Rodney got old (Meet Wally Sparks was an easy step from Ladybugs, but didn't say much). In my 5 women, Rodney plays Monte (the name she needs to love because it was her name in Easy Money) is not always a man who loves women and marries like her. Well, now he's suppressing the enormous land, and because the land was led by Amish, he inhibits 5 women. It sounds like a great idea for the Dangerfield movie. The problem is everything. The script is so bad that Rodney says he tells his one-liner to the camera, and there's nothing to do on each side. The film looks like it was in a video clip where some really bad stunt sequences are not Rodney. Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster who looks like he is dying to say F (what he should do after the movie is rated R but plays like it would be PG) and Jerry Stiller has a 2 minute nice. Don't make me wrong, sometimes I smiled at some Rodney jokes, but the poor man gets too old and too slow. We see his jokes that come in miles. And the film is changing too much on the computer, which, thanks to the terrible 1990s, 70s and 80s, Rodney is no longer working.
