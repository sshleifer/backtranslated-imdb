I rented End Game after hearing it, but I love political thrillers, so I thought I'd give it off. After some research on the film, I found that it was originally intended to release the theater, but instead it was little on the DVD. After I see it, I mean, "no wonder." The film is shocking in its joint ownership. The plot and characters are perfect. I thought it was a half-sign, but the end was a curved ball. I must say that I do not expect it to end as it did, but it is not in its favor. The more predictable end would have been better than what was so bad. Perhaps the filmmakers saw how the film was predictable and decided to throw the twist - even what made the film even worse. <br /> <br /> Stay away. I want $ 5.98 and my 107 minutes ago.
