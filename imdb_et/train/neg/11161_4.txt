"Nacho Libre" (2006) <br /> <br /> Director: Jared Hess <br /> Star: Jack Black, Ana de la Reguera, Héctor Jiménez & Darius Rose <br /> <br /> MPAA Rating: " PG-13 "(for some harsh actions and a crowd, including a dialogue) <br /> <br /> Say what you are doing (I know some people who endlessly despise it), but I've always thought" Napoleon Dynamite "was a funny film, not the wall's lightest brick, but a funny film. Jack Black is also a very funny person - it irritates at times, yes, and massively overpriced adolescents who are practically worshiping but funny. Jack Black's comedy has rarely been a dislike of me. So, I was very pleased to hear that Jared Hess and Jack Black, the writer and director of "Napoleon's Dynamite", informed the film about a Spanish kindergarten who becomes a slave to rescue a children's home. My only reservation was that the plot looked a bit too thin. Unfortunately, one of my reservations was that the whole movie was falling. This plot would have been flawless if it had been made with some exhibitions like "Saturday Night Live" or even "Mad TV". Unfortunately, the plot runs too thin for over one and a half hours, and this comedy of one joke gradually falls. <br /> <br /> Nacho was lifted into the Mexican monastery and became a devoted man of the Lord. The Nacho (black), who is now a monastery chef, decides to follow his dreams of being a professional wrestler for all the monastery's astonishment. As the monastery's finances were at a lower level than ever, Nacho decides to join the wrestling tournament to win prize money and provide good food for the convent's children's home. This plot sounds so cute and caring. It seems to be the perfect movie for Jack Black. See what he did for "Rock School". Well, because of my dissatisfaction, this plot is almost completely destroyed by the offensive and harsh humor that just takes away the movie in the heart. This is again Hollywood's way to show that they feel teenagers only understand funny jokes and stupid humor. Watching an obese woman like a mouse over the floor will definitely make people laugh, but don't wait to get a prize for putting on your movie. Seven years old can make the same joke. <br /> <br /> Presentations "Nacho Libre" is really good. Jack Black proves once again that he is completely fun and that he can make even the most idiotic, valuable features of the comic. Unfortunately, this movie wasn't enough for him. It didn't give her something to go, and the only reason her jokes worked was because of her. I've never seen or heard Ana de la Reguera before, but now I can say that she is not only talented but also one of the most beautiful women who has ever seen her eyesight. He just clicked on the role and it worked great. Héctor Jiménez, who is playing Nacho bumble bee partner Esquelet, kept me laughing. He did a very nice job and it was very effective when he dealt with Jack Black. Darius Rose, who plays the orphans, called Chancho, didn't have many features, but what I can say was just enjoying him. He was divine. The remaining majority did their job. It is unfortunate that they wasted such a sub-par movie. <br /> <br /> "Nacho Libre" just doesn't work. Stretching this plot is too thin. Its all heart is dirty moral humor and sick jokes that just don't work. I rarely smiled and when I did, it was because of Jack Black or another cast member. And this leads me to the bright side of "Nacho Libre": yes, cast. It was just fine, they were because of the lack of a better word. They all clicked, had excellent chemistry and pumped as much life into a flat script as possible. After I kept Jared Hess's "Napoleon Dynamite" for the whole movie, I was surprised that I was so bored with "Nacho Libre". There was something lost here and I haven't understood what it was. I only know that "Nacho Libre" is not a good movie and yet it is completely worthless because of its casting. There is little reason to look at Jack Black's work alone. But if you are not a Jack Black fan, beware of this movie like a plague. I like Black, but I've done it with the movie and its review. <br /> <br /> The Ultimate Idea: Yikes! This is the surprising disappointment of Jared Hess for his hysterical "Napoleon Dynamite". <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 4/10 (C +)
