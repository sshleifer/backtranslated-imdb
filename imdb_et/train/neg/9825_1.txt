This movie seems to be the wrong message. There can be no morality without Christ. I believe that the poetry of other religions will be heaven. I am a Catholic who goes to church every week, but I do not agree with such a Christian arrogance. This is the worst time for the movie I've ever seen, and I've seen Timeline.
