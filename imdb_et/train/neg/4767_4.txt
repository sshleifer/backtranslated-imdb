I watched this movie because I liked this plot, a group of strangers being held captive, trying to figure out how they're connected. <br /> <br /> The setting and assumption was probably influenced by the first (and best) Saw movie, and although there wasn't much action the story was moving at a relatively good pace. <br /> <br /> There was a comedy relief ion in two forms of "Alpha Men" and it was a welcome surprise (for me anyway) to see Melissa Joan Hart, who has not yet given up acting. <br /> <br /> Some things let me down personally; 1. The pedophile was generally characterized by changing everything between the child and the corpses. <br /> <br /> 2. The MJH line to his policeman "to get in here" when he was really the least worthy of the person who was there, he didn't know he had contributed to their capture events. <br /> <br /> 3. End ..... what movie ends in the middle of something going on? There was no resolution, no cliff, no obvious ending ... it just ends. <br /> <br /> And I just dropped two stars from my rating. The first 2 points I would shoot, but not the end!
