Personally, I would advise people to ignore this movie. In general, it is wise to watch and the fight is poorly choreographed. Slow and not very convincing. When you buy a Hong Kong Legends DVD for this movie, the only thing you should listen to is the Bey Logan audio commentary. <br /> <br /> But in any case, when ever it has been worth watching the Ninja movie. I can't think of one and honestly don't want to. <br /> <br /> In general, when it comes to movies, I have one golden rule: Avoid movies containing the word "Ninja".
