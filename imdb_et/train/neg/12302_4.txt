Italian / American co-producer Linda Blair and David 'Hoff' with Hasselhoff: How could any spooky horror fan resist such treatment? <br /> <br /> and after a totally useless first forty minutes I would have said "very easy"; Fortunately, however, things are finally getting more fun with the introduction of several inventive death scenes, and for those lucky ones who are unable to cut the copy, it is also nudging (unfortunately my copy is optically edited to remove such offensive material). <br /> <br /> Hoff stars like Gary, a photographer who accompanied her beautiful girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) on ​​a seemingly deserted island hotel to photograph her latest project, a book of witches; Although there, disappointed Gary hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving Leslie of her virginity. <br /> <br /> His plans for nookie are scupper, however, the unexpected arrival of real estate developers Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), their pregnant daughter Jane (Blair), son of Tommy (Michael Manchester), pretty nymphomanic architect Linda Sullivan ( Catherine Hickland) and real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who has come to check the hotel on the island. <br /> <br /> After their unexpected presence on the island, Gary and Leslie welcome new property owners, and when a violent storm suddenly rises, making it dangerous to return to the mainland, everyone agrees to spend the night in an old building. Unfortunately, the new guests of the hotel are unaware that this place is also the spirit of the evil witch (Hildegard Knef) who needs casualties to revive herself. One by one, the victims are pulled before they meet in a terrible destiny, reversed by red vortex (which is guaranteed to laugh unintentionally). <br /> <br /> No one makes much sense, and acting is cruel (Manchester) as Tommy is particularly bad, while Hasselhoff proves to be one of the best performers talking about other volumes, but those viewers who make this tougher first halfway, rewarded with pretty decent gore moments: Rose's lips are sewn together before they live in the fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burned alive; Linda is tortured by actions and murderous swordfish (!!); Freddie's veins are pulsating and break in the blood geysers; and Gary comes back behind. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Leslie has raped when a lipsless boy has got (again) Blair.
