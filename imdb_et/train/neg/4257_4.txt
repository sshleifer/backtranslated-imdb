"Dracula II: Resurrection" is the story of a group of medical professionals who come across the body of Dracula. If a mysterious stranger appears and offers students $ 30 million to clean the body and steal blood at auction, this potential offer is hardly refused. Soon the students will find the Vatican Vampire killer relentlessly! "Dracula II: Resurrection" is a little fun movie with lots of mistakes. The characters are one-dimensional and the actor is quite average. there are some good gore effects, like a really cool double damage scene, but there is not enough violence for me. The film quickly becomes boring and forgotten and there is no doubt. So if you like a modern vampire stick, look at it. From the 60s and 70s, secular vampire coolers, such as "Lips of Blood", "Dracula Brides" or "Lemora: The Child's Story of Supernatural", were named only a few out of ten.
