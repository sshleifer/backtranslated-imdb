The film is rather confusing and ridiculous. The plot is terrible ... but on the plus side, the actress is pretty good, some good shouts and hips. This time Sharon's stone is OK, not even half as good as the original mind. Murder is not as harsh as the first, which is a shame. It's not an unpredictable confusion that everyone says it is. Sex is occasionally quite graphic, while others are clear that it is fake (they are completely dressed). The script is weak in most of the times, but the scenes with torture and arguments between drGlas and Washburn have been highlighted. The plot spins a few times, but the end is terrible. Tensions are always constant with a large number of "Oh my God!" The chase sequences are superbly targeted, and shots and camera corners are impressive and bring a bit of class to a otherwise quick-felt movie. Sharon's stone is also a bit old. The bits where we see his breasts were the first pleasures. This time they are too scary to describe. The movies she is about are pretty average, but it's worth it. Mainly because the film does not deserve good buzz ... when the opening order is highlighted. Not to be critical, but if you liked the first one - leave it. Don't break the run. You're glad you left this stone around.
