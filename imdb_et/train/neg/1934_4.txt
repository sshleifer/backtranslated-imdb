Following the usual formula, a new recruiter - this time the first African-American (Cuba Gooding) after disarming President Truman - takes place through the US Navy Deep Sea Divers Training Program, led by a racist exercise (Robert DeNiro). If the program was not bad enough, it must be in Bayonne, New Jersey. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the performances. Robert De Niro activates his southern accent and exclaims effectively. Cuban Gooding, raised by a stern father as a poor black peasant in the south, is expected to be a paragon. Girls - those hardly called women - are Charleze Theron and Lonette McKee. They have small roles and they claim that their men should use common sense. Other decent speakers - Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook - have even more perfect tasks. <br /> <br /> That's it. Almost everything else could have been put together by a computer. The ship is called a boat. Robert De Niro welcomes indoors, uncovered. After a brutal attack on hospital staff, he has been removed from his equipment instead of breaking it. Someone screams at the beginning of the 1950s "I'm out here". (Maybe it was a common expression at that time. If so, "my bad.") People interact with each other - "Lieutenant", "Boatswain mate", "Commander" as they do in the army while they are simple "Mister" (as officer) or addressing their surname (if painted). I didn't want to check if there was a Senior Master Chief in 1950. <br /> <br /> Gooding has a hard line. It seems that everyone in the Navy hates negroid, except for one Wisconsin man. He shifts and his other classes are despised. It's like the "House of Animals" scene, where prayer for tony brotherhood is asked to wait for a Sikh, a black man and a blind son. <br /> <br /> Gooding is a painted man, a second-class small official. She succeeds in getting married to a beautiful woman who has just graduated from a medical school. In one of his arguments, he claims to him. He just wants to be a doctor and he should join him, leave the navy and lead a quiet life. "And just let life go through?" Yes, yes. Yes, just be a doctor's spouse and let go of life. Boca Raton Golf Course can be enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Such valves were widespread in World War II. "Bombardier," "Airial Gunner," such a thing. Cheap, as they were often, had some educational qualities. You learned something about getting a bombardier or gunner. Here, the technical details have been missed, perhaps because the writer knew nothing about them (except for Boyle's law we learned in high school chemistry). <br /> <br /> I couldn't keep track of what happened in some cases to emergencies without a movie. If I had the mechanical problems right, it was because I thought correctly. The direction is also not helpful. The film is very close, so much that they lose any dramatic effect. And the emergencies are confusing because they are badly focused. <br /> <br /> Why go? Do you want to see such a movie better? Almost everyone does - except for "G. I. Jane" where the abused hero is heroin. Try the training camp scenes with "Youth Lions". There's a victim of a Jew. Or try "From Here to Eternity", where no simple sympathy button is pushed and the victim is an adult man who refuses to bend and who is actively involved in bringing conflict, such as "Cool Hand Luke". Simple excuses are not offered because simple excuses are too simple. <br /> <br /> Thoroughly formal and not well done.
