I saw this movie right now, not when it was released and greeted in Israel as the best picture of the year. and sum up all this, just say, it's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> This is Dror Shaul's second feature film, and I have to admit that his first and television drama that he used to make this picture is much better. moreover, it's his first attempt to drive the drama. early works were comedies and were funny and effective. <br /> <br /> The first thing you need to know is whether you can see this movie ever: 21st century Israel hates the bittern and the values ​​it represents from the state of Israel. The actual situation of kibbutzim is very terrible and some of them disappear one by one. The Bean, a Hebrew collective, was only a village for members, where the values ​​of equality and socialism were the dogma of everyday life. With the changing of social values ​​over time, it now seems that kibbutz was the place where the human spirit was repressed, locked into dogma rules, without a ticket. capitalist values ​​and lifestyle entrance in the 90s and so far, kibbutzim was very difficult to survive. this movie's central metaphor is the crazy mother of the movie. <br /> <br /> But I think this film has nothing to do with nostalgia for the old good days of kibbutz. once, each young couple's dream of living in kibbutz and raising children in this rather and beautiful environment. but the movie shows the opposite. that the bean, along with its socialist dogma, was a place similar to the crazy of crazy people, with crazy ideas that undermine the freedom of every individual in the collective. it is the central philosophy of postmodern capitalism: your individuality is the most important thing. you have to put yourself in the middle and someone other than you is the thing. this is the philosophy the film stands for, and that is the very first sin. <br /> <br /> If you disagree with me on the political side, I am sure you agree that the actor, the film's tone, is the script, and its direction is the four following sins. the film has no real visual text and none of its shots have anything to remember. it is also a very "delicate" delicacy that is no longer merely an artistic attempt to provoke emotions that are not on the surface, not on film and not on the viewer. it brings something but boredom. <br /> <br /> Can anyone please explain why this film won so many prizes? maybe because it shows that Israel is in harmony with the rest of the world, hates socialist and human values? or perhaps it shows that Israel is a "delicate" place that does not give dogma and fanaticism? that we are basically very human and good people capable of emotion, especially if they are fake, like capitalism is waiting for us? or perhaps because it speaks of one of the greatest lies, the lies, of the Israeli cinema in recent years, which undermines the justification of a Jewish state? no matter what the answer is, it is not good. not for the values ​​of the world, not for the people, and not for the Jews.
