Dragon Fighter is the first Sci-Fi Channel (though I think it's now called Syfy?) The original movie I've ever seen. But I have seen one or two of you, and I can tell you that they were stupid, but it pulls the barrel to the bottom. The CGI is badly done, the behavior is bad, the script is ridiculous and what happens at the end is unexpected and inappropriate (if you've seen Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean; put the spoiler in my review). Plus, there was one musical ring that was used quite a lot for every dangerous sequence. It was really stupid; they just played it over and over again. And this is certainly not original; I know I've heard it somewhere before (I just don't remember where). This must be avoided.
