I grew up looking at the original television seventies and one thing I can tell you right away is no comparison. This film was completely ridiculous with the flying suit that was alive. Martian, who took different shapes. Special Effects That Looked Like Something A Little Child Creates. On the contrary, in the original, the characters were developed and viewers developed a sense for Tim and Uncle Martin. The only highlight in this movie, yes, was actually one, when Ray Walston finally appeared at the end. He wore dark glasses and made references to this planet for 30 years as a tribute to the TV series. But even the real uncle Martin could not save this turkey.
