I did not hear about the movie he played as part of Robert Mitchum's retrospective at the London National Film Theater. Almost 60 years on the election list seemed tasty, saying at least seven names - in addition to Mitchum - to the public; Charles McGraw, who wasn't long before The Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, long before Dallas and supposedly better known as the daughter of Norman's theater designer Walter Brennan, who doesn't need to be introduced, Frank Faylen, the sadistic sister of The Lost Weekend and the more beautiful little town mensch is this wonderful life, Robert Preston is still ten years away from Harold Hill The Music Man with Tom Tully and Phyllis Thaxter. Unfortunately, most of them lost time. I watched every "signature" scene because it was a whore for Robert Wise. By that time he had made about half a dozen films and he still had to find a style. The story is our old friend, whose war has been thought by Mitchum that it was barely cut over the Hopalong Cassidy oysters on which he cut his teeth. There are no new twists - if you don't believe in the incredible scene when Mitchum accuses Preston of sleeping with Thaxter to get information about her father's plans to move her herd. That's quite true, but how did Mitchum know? We haven't seen anything or heard how he discovered it. All in all, there is not much to say about it.
