Feh. This movie started in an interesting way, but ran quickly through confusion and boredom. The confusing parts were mostly at the beginning, where the cut scenes are so many that it's hard to say what's going on in the first twenty minutes. Bored will come later, there will be peaceful romance (both) between the two living nations. The spirit of the dead girl's revenge is actually the most lively person in the movie, which is sad. If the rest was his caliber, the film could have been better. <br /> <br /> Maybe. Because the story will be really interesting for a while, as it seems that the dead sixteen-year-old girl's crazy priest's mother is trying to lift her daughter out of the dead, with the extremely unfortunate side effect that all the other dead people will come back to, as well as the sure human form and probably all will kill. A sort of Japanese mystical living dead night thing. But it's not over. Although this hairless priest with a small basket attached to his head tells uninteresting youngsters that it can happen when the priest finishes his ritual, he does just that, and the only dead person who manifests himself is his daughter. There is no massive rise of dead people, dead bodies of corpses, nothing. The priest just puts the girl's spirit back into the land of the dead, taking her boyfriend off with her, as she shattered her backbone like a peanut-brittle (at this point I was tempted to worship loudly because this idiot went to kiss and pamper DEAD girl, ewwww !!!). To suck robotic, the endless best friend has a long introspective shot when he leaves the village for the last time, and that's it. There is no real horror, a real embarrassment that the Japanese tend to perform much better than American filmmakers who have emphasized the excessive cheese face make-up, without screaming. I was very disappointed.
