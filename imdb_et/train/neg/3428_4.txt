Well, if it wasn't Ethel Waters and 7-year-old Sammy Davis, Jr. (Here, without Jr.), Rufus Jones would be one of the worst objects of African-American stereotypes for the president, and should not have been seen for that. Mrs Waters is great in this song "Am I Blue?" and "Under the Harlem Moon", while Mr. Davis shows us how his childhood experience in showbiz made him an adult superstar. She's so good here that for a while I thought she was a small person with decades of experience. So if you are willing to ignore the negative meanings here, Rufus Jones should give the President a pleasant enjoyment. P.S. It marks the fourth time I saw and heard the song "I'm glad when you are dead to rob you", which happened in the movie, this time Davis. Must be a very popular song at this time.
