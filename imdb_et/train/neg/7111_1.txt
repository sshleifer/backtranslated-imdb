- A newborn couple is moving to the home of his ex-wife's deceased wife. It won't be long before a new woman gets to know that no one wants her in the house. He sees the skull all over the house. But when he explores, he can't find anything. Does anyone try to get him back to the shelter he recently released? Or is the ghost of a dead woman trying to get a new woman out of her house? <br /> <br /> - This is the first time I watched Screaming Sculp without the help of the MST3K team. And this is probably the last time I look at it this way. Do you say bored? I'm not talking about the usual numbness - I'm telling you that the grass is bored. There are big fields in the movie where nothing happens. The screen could have been empty and I would have enjoyed a lot of entertainment. The characters drone and with the most monotonous conversations. Screaming Sculp is likely to be marketed as a dream aid. <br /> <br /> - Participants don't help much. Most of them transmit lines where the conviction is usually reserved for the classroom game. I have not seen it, but I would be shocked that someone who has been involved with this film has never been cinematic. I'm not even going to a script where participants can work. Let's just say that characters are given some of the most idiotic lines ever spoken on the film. <br /> <br /> - You have been warned! Do this at all costs or at least look for the MST3K version.
