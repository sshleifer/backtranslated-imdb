There is no need to describe in detail what others have written - here's a summary: <br /> <br /> * A great deal of nested animation is absolutely proud - the colors are great - it would be nice to do it with a silky tie <br /> /> * The story and filling is a complete stabbing - from time to time it was quite difficult when awake. <br /> <br /> If you are a student of fine arts, medieval calligraphy, early religion and so on - that's it. It's a FILM for you. <br /> <br /> If you want an interesting, entertaining MOVIE - look elsewhere - it's a failure as something other than an artistic statement. <br /> <br /> The Vikings didn't do it t have other horns ...
