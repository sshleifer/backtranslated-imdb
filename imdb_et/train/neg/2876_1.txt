I doubt the motif of the creators of this fictional account in the BTK killer motifs. Are they trying to portray animal rights as activists sick monsters? Who is responsible for this? Don't they think the people in this monster are hurt enough? What is the blatant disrespect and exploitation of the victims! It was like an experiment of personality: what disturbs you more, the slaughterhouse or the murders of people? They used the real names of some victims ... this movie was ugly, disrespectful and offensive! The creators of this movie used this tragedy on their own agenda! People have to wake up and draw a line!
