**** SPOILER WARNING **** <br /> <br /> Absolutely undoubtedly one of the funniest comedies ever created. It is absolutely impossible to take it seriously. Including all comedies in the routines list will take a big novel. Carol Burnett and the company, who often started in the films, cut off their complicated imagination on their program awards. Carol played Jenny, who suddenly became ill only with mild cough and immediately got terrible music and everyone looked around to wonder where it came from. Harvey Korman played Oliver with flowing locks and almost looked like Ryan O'Neal. The only thing that is funny is the real movie. <br /> <br /> The death scene at the end. Jenny looks like she dies well ... dying for her make-up artist to come and give her a little color. And, of course, we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to go to bed during the last moments of a patient. The end of the scene where Ryan O'Neal sits on a snow-seated gun in view of his future in the film business is a quick classic. He had a lot to worry about. He never recovered from it.
