Just looking at the trailer Theodore Rex, you think it's a bad buddy comedy with Whoopi Goldberg and the dinosaur costume. This is true, but it is mostly a futuristic story that looks like Batman Forever with its directional style and strange character design. It was wrongly marketed and it should have been marketed as a futuristic story, rather than a flat police comedy. Whether this film is sold wrong is still a creepy film. <br /> <br /> In the future, dinosaurs have been revived with amazing technology, and they speak and walk like people. Teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously, but after being murdered by a dinosaur, he is given the opportunity to work, but he must be a partner with their most serious policeman Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg). This inappropriate duo can solve the murder and it is up to the audience to stay awake long enough to hit it. <br /> <br /> Teddy starts the picture as an ordinary actor, but in the end she is intolerable to listen. For some reason, with the detective, he is also a bad comedian and a bad impersonator. He imitates famous people and accents and has really terrible features. Whoopi accuses her of folding and she says, "It's not my butt trumpet!" Wow! What a cage, an immature line, even a film with that caliber of a child. Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone. I was hoping that Teddy would bite his head over the length of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie never knew what he wanted to be. When futuristic scenes and action take place, there is no comedy or humor. In any non-functional scenes, the characters try to be as funny as they can, which results in simply intermittent straight-line boredom. Action scenes do not work because they are too weird and not violent enough and, as stated earlier, comedy is just a pity of fun. Nothing works here. <br /> <br /> Dinosaur / Human Detective Duo seems to be a very original movie, if nothing else. No! This movie is the one who kidnaps Roger Rabbit. Just replace the dinosaurs with cartoons and set it in the future and that's exactly the same plot. Man killed, killed by dinosaur. Dinosaur and detective solving murder, murder solves tone and detective. Roger Rabbit's bad guys are Christopher Lloyd and weasels. The bad guys are the man who sounds like Christopher Lloyd and the guys who are just like farms. The club scene Roger Rabbit, where Jessica Rabbit walks on stage, is imitated by dinosaurs. It's a much better hanging movie! <br /> <br /> In general, it is a bad film that doesn't even deserve to be a VHS strength. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 90 minutes. PG with light violence, language and raw humor.
