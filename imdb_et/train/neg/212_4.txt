Closer to reality and deeper than "Breakdance", Stan Latan's "Beat Street" is still a rather boring show. Again, this picture is really just a "break" in madness, but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the lives of three young friends and younger brothers, all growing in Queens, New York. Each has its own unique talent. One is a hustler, one dj, another artist who creates "burners", while a small bro "Lee is a hot" hip hop "dancer. <br /> <br /> Lathan can't create any real audience of interest in this story it is and his young is also cast with his characters, so almost entirely funky music and "fresh" dancing to save the day. <br /> <br /> Choreography is again sharp for both the club and the street scene, but not alone enough to "Beat Street" to higher heights. Unfortunately, the film comes down very late after showing hope that it might just be interesting. <br /> <br /> August 25, 1996 - Video
