Having seen the first ten episodes, I have to say that this exhibition sucks. <br /> <br /> What worries me the most is that the show was shot in Canada. I know it is cheaper, but they should have fired it in California so we could have been in the desert in the desert. That would be more true of the film. The first scene where they are outside the other world is in the mountains, where there are many pinetrees where it is cold. It doesn't feel very Egyptian. What worked so well in the film was that it seemed you were in ancient Egypt. Here, they seem to be running around with fighting aliens in the Canadian forest. And it is so flat that the other planets will fall in the fall. You can see the pages on the ground that all look like the outside of Vancouver. This makes the exhibition even more incredible and stupid. And then Richard Dean Anderson. He's not Kurt Russel. Of course, he's doing a decent job and he's trying to copy some of Russell's work, but it's not as cool as Russel. And not nearly as good an actor as Russel. And Russells led O Neil to play, but he was more cynical. Andersons O They are too soft. I liked the Russell version just not giving it *** and it had no problems with detonating the bomb until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Shanks does a great job like Jackson but takes over James Spader. <br /> <br /> Teal'c is really annoying. He's Jaffa. Not Jaffa. Just Jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! Former pathetic bodyguard with only a pilot and another episode. Teal'c speaks and acts like a robot. Jean Claude Van Damme has seen better action. <br /> <br /> And the fact that the character of Teal'c and Ra and the people they recorded in the movie can suddenly speak English. stupid. What made foreigners in the film so scary that they spoke ancient language and were real monsters. <br /> <br /> For special effects, they are very good in the pilot. But the very rare consequences in the actual exhibition are badly made and cheap. Especially the planet they visit with crystals. It is so obvious that they walk around the sound art that has a badly done countryside in the background. It is an insult to our viewers that they see it so cheaply. Especially if they were able to put a bluescreen in front of the cgi. <br /> <br /> X files had better results when they first released their first episodes in 1993. It was 4 years before the start of SG-1. And they had no obvious $ 2 million budget episode that SG-1 allegedly had done. They have to spend all the money on catering. Because I can't see it on the screen. An incredibly boring and pointless show that could have been great if they had seen an exhibition in Hollywood with bigger budgets and better writers and better characters.
