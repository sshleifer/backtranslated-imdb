I think it's going to prove that Joe Don Baker does something for the box. The movie concept was not very good to start with. This movie has so many bad things I don't know where to start. Operation is terrible. Cinematography is the best. The soundtrack was pretty bad. The result is terrible. That's why this movie came to Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before writing and I can't believe that 9 people thought this movie was great. They had to like two go-go dancers. The ultimate justice would be if they locked that smell into a movie house outside of Wichita and never let anyone see it! One of the 10 ratings is much better than it deserves.
