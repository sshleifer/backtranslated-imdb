Was this movie stupid? Yep. Is it the depth of the movie? No. Character Development? No. Plot Torsions? No. It was just a movie about a very nice Springer show. It shows the lengths that some people go to get their mugs on TV. Molly Hagan did a great job as Jaime Pressly's mother. Jaime is .... well ... GOOD! This flick wasn't so much a breakthrough movie, but it was meant to be a dwelling in a trailer park (living in a trailer park and we don't have anything in this movie) where everyone sleeps with everyone else, all the girls get pregnant by different boys, and all boys rust out. 66 Ford pickups "(of course, an exaggeration, but this is the picture everyone sees when you mention" trailer park "). Some people analyze films (on a case-by-case basis: Star Trek fans). I watch movies for purely entertaining value; not to point out that the girl wears a different scene in a different shirt (read "Goofs" a bit on Connie's shirt. Would it have been better? Of course. But it was funny as hell.
