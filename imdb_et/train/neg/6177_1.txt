The real irony is: Joe Besser was a top-notch comedian, in other situations away from Stooges. He was sure he was very funny and smart. Moe and Larry and Shemp had known him or at least him for many years and liked his work. So, what's going on on Earth when he joined forces as a "third dog"? Of course there is nothing. In most of these "late Stooge" trousers, boys are more often against each other or against Joe against the other and this is not the exact Stooge label. "One for everyone, all for one, every man for himself," to quote Curly's "troubled knights". One thing about a good comedy team, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, Marx Brothers, no matter how much they all take advantage of each other or hit each other when the chips are actually left behind, they stay together and help each other. None of them will happen in this particular. It is almost like seeing a dog in a fight when one tries to deceive others or be average and disgusting, but not comedic. It can be assumed that there was something behind the scenes, art imitates life. Maybe there was Besser with Moe and Larry for a very long time. Just look at the history of other teams and tell me I'm wrong.
