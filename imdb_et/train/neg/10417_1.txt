It would have been a great * quiet movie. Action is really good, at least in Look Ma, I'm really doing a great deal! sort of. <br /> <br /> Everything is huge. Every row is PROFOUND! Every scene is REVIEWED WITH HUMAN RIGHTS! <br /> <br /> Mostly I felt like you were walking. However, like every train wreck, I could not tear my eyes. This dialogue may have worked on stage, although I doubt it. On the screen, it was full, random, hackneyed and pretty much all the other stereotypical negative adjectives that you can come up with to describe really bad dramatic work. , you could * enjoy the movie. Be prepared to wait, however. For all this melodrama, this is sure to move at its own pace. <br /> <br /> This script must be very different when read by the participants themselves. It just doesn't work when they can give it in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> IMDB sometimes makes us a great service when it uses a "weighted score" controlled by a computer.

Already for some time in a drunken and awakening field is * non * character formation. This is the contraction of the plot. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie. Or at least look silent. Maybe you can have fun with all the characters who do it. <br /> <br /> Oh and the Word Wise - to prove that this is a truly artistic film, you can see James Woods in all his fearsome man "look-at-me, I'm - imaginative and literally-bare-vulnerability- man's glory. <br /> <br /> Don't say you weren't warned.
