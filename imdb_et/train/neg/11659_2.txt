I loved * the original scary movie. I'm a big fan of parody, it's my favorite humor. Sometimes it is considered to be the smartest humor. The Wayans guys knew that the concept in the original film was completely grasped, then it was temporarily forgotten when making the stage. I think Wayans is a family of a comic genius. Unfortunately, even geniuses carry. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a promise. I liked the "Exorcist" parody, especially "come out, ma" gag. Now it's a Wayans-quality material. But besides, I can only think of two other times when I laughed: 1) when Tori's spell is in the middle of the middle of the spirit in the middle, then it becomes stapling and starts talking to him about marriage. In the meantime, he says, "It was just a catch!" It was funny. 2) The Parody "Save The Last Dance", where Cindy's symbol involuntarily hits a girl when she practices her new moves. But even short-term giggles are not suited to the laughter of the first scary movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is a clean trash filled with cheap gross masses. The first movie jokes that were fine or implicit have been enlarged and overrun. For example, in Scary Movie I, there have been a number of innovations suggesting that the Ray sign is gay. It was fun. But in Scary Movie II, the whole penis-stranged scene Ray was in bed was delightful and incredibly sleepless. This is the pattern of the whole movie. Shock humor * alone * doesn't take the movie very far. Unfortunately, this was a trend in 2000 and 2001. <br /> <br /> As much as it bothered me to appreciate Wayans's movie so low, I have to give it one out of 10.
