This is IMDb's most cumbersome entry that I have not yet met. All previous reviewers act like a movie. It's not a movie. Rather, it is just a featurette that is extra on DVD's The One. In reality, it is hardly more than 13 minutes for a cool Jet Li to do martial arts. and his thoughts on the film. So this IMDb entry is quite a bit fubar. Don't listen to any other review because they are all wrong. You can trust me because I don't eat you, dear readers, BS. <br /> <br /> And that's the truth. I think u can say I'm a "One" reviewer.
