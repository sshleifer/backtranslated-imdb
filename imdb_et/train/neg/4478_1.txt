I didn't expect much of this movie - a funny little deviation. Wuthering Heights can be transformed into a credible modern story - nice and soap, melodramatic and intriguing. But this film decided to throw away the abilities of those involved in the original material, so it's amazing they had the courage to call it Wuthering Heights. It ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are essentially unlikely, mostly insecure and often cruel to one another. It changes the nature of certain characters - for example, in the Isabelle novel there was no binding bone in their bodies - they have taken away their blind idealism and made him a shining whore. Heathcliff is a terrible person who psychologically tortures most people on his way, but in this version, Catherine comes under the care of her daughter. The dialogue is nice and one wonders how the actors were able to deliver any straight line. Instead of depth or actual emotions, we know that they mean something when they scream at someone's face. I've read criticism from the early 1990s, "Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights," which included Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, saying it became intensely dark, a Gothic story sudsy bodice ripper. Some right comments, but the MTV version goes a step further by using the basic story structure to provide patchwork patches that move to very bad music.
