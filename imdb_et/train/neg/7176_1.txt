I have nothing to say yet, but it was terrible. I can't imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this humiliating confusion. And if certain participants don't want people to question their sexuality, maybe they should refrain from making these films. At least one saw what was curious about me. Just my opinion. DESIRING to think about what is going on in the movie. DO NOT ponder what went through the thoughts of the filmmakers. Believe in thinking about the thinking process and the voyeurism that leaders have in mind. Like I did before my violent mess. He's not even funny. As Ebert said about Caligula with Malcolm McDowell, His film is not good, not a good story and not even good porn. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
