Madison County Bridges are a better version of this story. I felt that the end of this movie was not treated sensitively, as was the case in the original English film. This movie is very indianized if you are a very sensitive person who shouts in the movie when the hero dies finally love this movie, on the other hand, if you are a life fighter and you think crying is for the wimps do not like the end. is well handled in Indian conditions. The taboo was good as a caring woman and mother. Everything worked well.
