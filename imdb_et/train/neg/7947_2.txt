When I saw this movie on FearNet, I thought it would be a scary film. Apparently it wasn't. I have no idea how this movie was allowed on this site. FearNet is a site that shows scary horror films. <br /> <br /> The actors are excellent from all the actors. I hated this story. The story was stupid. The film begins with a man who has been signaled. He interrupts the seal and certain disasters happen. The water turns to blood, the oceans die, the moon turns red, and so on. <br /> <br /> The woman's character was also annoying. Many things he didn't do were reasonable. Like when he sees a paper with a date. Randomly, it is the date when she gives birth to her child, and she starts to think about it and begins to explore and ask religious people what it all means. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert * <br /> Two of the worst things in this movie are the execution of a person with intellectual disabilities who claimed that God told him that he would kill his parents and eventually Demi Moore die after childbirth and transfer of his soul. br /> <br /> Here happens. A person with intellectual disabilities gets down and kills and the apocalypse begins. Demi Moore gets to the hospital in the midst of a great earthquake and gives birth to his child. He touches his child's head, carrying his soul to the child and then dying. Then the apocalypse stops. <br /> <br /> Why has God suddenly changed his heart? He gets furious when the governor promises to execute a spiritually slowed man, so is he all about forgiveness when a single woman returns to her own soul? <br /> <br /> * Final Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty stupid. This is another religious end of the world propaganda part. Demi Moore and Michael Biehn actor and everyone else are great. That's all there is. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2 stars from the 10th. Good to act a lot of nonsense!
