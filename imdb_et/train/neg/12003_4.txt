Six different pairs. Six different love stories. Six different angles of love. Eighty audience in the cinema. Looking at eighty different parts of the silver screen. <br /> <br /> I sit somewhere between them, looking at the center of the screen to find out what's going on in the movie. All stories have nothing to do with each other, but somewhere on the Nikhil Advan line they are trying to show any connection between them. I tried to find a couple of lines I could write for review, but after 3 hours I couldn't find anything for 15 minutes. The movie is a bad copy of the Hollywood Missile Art LOVE ACTUALLY. <br /> <br /> My suggestion. Don't look at the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie.
