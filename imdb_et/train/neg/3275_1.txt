DON'T SEE this movie if you have loved classics such as TOM WOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER and BEN JONES! THIS MOVIE PLAY YOU! First, this movie starts with Bo and Luke, who runs for six days for Jesse. Bo and Luke never do it in the real series! This film depicts unimaginable signs that do things that would never have happened in the series. In the series, Uncle Jesse was honest and obedient. In this film, he is a criminal who makes hot and smoking with the Georgian governor. Plus, if it was an extension that adds Hazzard Reunion Duke! and the Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have one question: HOW TO ASK JESSE ON MONSHINE HOW TO BE DELETED BEFORE THE POINTS OF THE VIEW IN THE Hollywood Movie? AND HOW BOSS HOGG ALIVE HAPPENED BY THE REUNION MOVIE OF 1997! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN DANGER? SHOW YOUR MAGIC, HOW ARE THEIR EXAMPLES RETURN TO LIVING, IF YOU HAVE 11 AND 8 YEARS NEEDED? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, they would have been back with James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones and Catherine Bach as they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family-friendly movie with the original characters living. Show what it was and still this nasty, shameful movie! If you want to see good Dukes movies, either buy the original series or go to walmart.com and buy a DVD set 2 that includes RÃ©union and Holzk movies! They both mark the original pain and are family friendly! Don't waste your time in a movie that's not written on a CD!
