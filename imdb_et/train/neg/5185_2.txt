Full Time Loss Halla Bol is a waste of time. The script and dialogs are poorly written, the direction is weak and the boundaries of the teeth are working. This film was clearly directed at the Rang De Basant crowd, but it goes beyond the mark because it doesn't even have one element that RDB combines with its audience script, terrible action, good direction and powerful social messages that have never been announced but shown. <br /> <br /> Compared to this almost masterpiece, Halla Bol takes a step back using scenes like a hero who leaks a villain to a Persian carpet and hero mentor, listening to the truck no less! All this could have been acceptable in the 1980s, when the decline in film quality and bad films like DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante became a big hit, but making a movie has become ___new_nut finer and more thoughtful. Rajkumar Santoshi is a capable director and I appreciate that he wants to give a social message to every movie, but maybe he just doesn't know how to do it! He rests on sermonization without having to look after the audience's intelligence to understand what he's trying to say. Perhaps he should just focus on entertainment and leave social messages to Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khans. <br /> <br /> Even if you disagree with everything I say, you agree that during the whole screening you thought Rang De Basant was much better and Mr.Santoshi should have given up the industry Om Omanti. Industrial bashing? This is correct! Santoshi has depicted the industry as a sleeping, smile and casting couch, with the hero happily promising with a funny name, Sania. Some people think these parts show the real face of the industry. Don't believe everything you see! <br /> <br /> In conclusion, raise your voice from such movies and don't spend your hard earned money on this bomb. <br /> <br /> * Out of stock ****.
