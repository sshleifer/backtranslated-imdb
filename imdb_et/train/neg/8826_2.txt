This (extremely) low budget movie is compared to the excellent classic "Silent Night Deadly Night" because it is labeled as Slasher Flick. First, let me say that I think even "Silent Night Part 2" is better than that (that one was filled with the original setbacks by more than half of the movie). "Christmas evil" tries to get psychological by adding the main character of someone who goes crazy (strong word) slowly (very slowly). It is irritating to people who do not get the true meaning of Christmas and at work can't stand how made toys are made with such quality and lack of love. Santa finally dresses up with a deadly laugh. There is also a strong word because only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects. No effort, excitement, no gore, no cast. One exception is Jeffrey DeMunn. He is best known for playing with Tom Hanks in the classic "The Green Mile". He must still strike those days to always accept this role. He is really the only one who really works, his supporting role is better than the main leader. (who is not so bad, but if you hide a little supporting character, you are not too big.). And what's this strange ending? (you have to see it, believe it). "Christmas evil" is completely boring, nothing happens and the work is just misleading. It's not slasher. You want to see a real Christmas song, look at the biggest one all the time: "Silent night, deadly night".
