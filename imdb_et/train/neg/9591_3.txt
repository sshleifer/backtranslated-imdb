If you've read the novel of the original, as I did, you will hate this thing for sure. <br /> <br /> _Absolute Beginners_ movie version is a 1980s anniversary conglomerate trying to create "period pieces" in the late 1950s, and when it didn't bring back or even respect this period - US monstros _Dirty Dancing_ looks similar to 1963 except that the film was financially successful despite being an equally amateur screen. In addition to suffering the "look of the 1980s", characters have changed, rearranged and mirrored so that the only features they have with the novel are the smallest superficial manifestations and of course their names: Suze changes the narrator's butterfly ex-girlfriend and promising negrofile who is planning deliberately marry a closed old queen (on the first pages with her entrance) into an accident and naive "Eve" architecture that has become famous and glamorous, and somewhat scammed for her disgrace to her boss who surprisingly did not get Van Dyke and a sharp hairstyle . He and his narrator, called "Colin" (after the author of the book, Colin MacInnes), are also in a relationship. <br /> <br /> Big Jill's character, a lesbian seemingly butch still "" in his mid-20s, acting in the scene of lesbians in front of young people and bubbles, and one of the narrator's closest friends giving honest wisdom to the narrator is reduced to just a few called "extra" discarded line and tons of comic book stocks. <br /> <br /> Fabulous Hoplite, a gay man and another narrator of a narrator in a novel, is also reduced to the point of being useless, camped-up and all but ignored. <br /> <br /> The narrator's novel has a somewhat sad character, but it has been both optimistic and strange in the film, despite its ridiculous neighborhood. and the abandonment of his marriage with the narrator's mother seems to be ignored for practical purposes. <br /> <br /> In your favor, this music (what it is) is well drafted and you need to give the production and writing teams a credit to actually make a series of books ("... a few days, they write musicals around the 1950s." . ") when they are inspired to write musical, but in the world of bad camp musicals, it is among the worst. Unlike the _Shock Care_ or _Starstruck_ important plot elements, the following considerations are discussed. Unlike _ Apple is a flowing and uneven band between musical numbers and spoken dialogue. <br /> <br /> You can't really blame it for being "too late in the 1980s" that it was created in the 1980s. The version of _Annie_, which appeared in 1981, pays wonderfully well-respected respect to the look of New York in the 1930s and _Napolean Dynamite_ succeeds in capturing the beautiful appearance of the 1980s. low budget in 2003 (although it is not explicitly set in the 1980s, people who have lived for decades cannot deny that the film "feels very much 1980"). Obviously this was possible to do something good, especially considering the source status of the source in the United Kingdom, but this is obviously not the appearance and feel of the source material and its handling. Perhaps, if you have not read the novel and are not going to read, then you might enjoy this anachronism in the late 1980s, which gives a shameful parody in the late 1950s on the modernist jazz set of London. I can definitely see what the writing team was trying to do, but they would certainly have been able to do better. Boy George, as a household name and mixed name musician and band name in 1986 in the UK, they certainly didn't keep characters in the way they finally did. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the writers stopped what both the book and the film criticized - this, in turn, reached a large number of adults who launched a mess and treated their target teenagers as two-bit idiots to make a quick doll.
