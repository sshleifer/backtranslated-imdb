I usually don't move out of the movie, but I did halfway through it. This movie promised something else, but I thought I had never seen it before? Spoiler Alert! In year 1, the spacecraft crashes and lands on the ground, well, all those years later, when the super adult board wasn't less, this thing still managed to burn and crash! What, this advanced civilization does not seem to develop landing gear? For an industry that is so liberal, we can see another Woody Allen movie that isn't black! Superman runs around rescuing people, making sure he sticks to Europe and the US, don't go into dark areas. Maybe I can smell it about 30 years ago, but now now.
