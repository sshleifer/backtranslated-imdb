Well let me tell you that I've always been a Steven piggy fan and his films are usually big, but it just doesn't measure the rest. I find this very silly, which I did not like. The biggest reason I don't like it is that it is very flawed and it makes no sense for me. Action is very bad even when Steven's pig does not do good. I see the rest of the actors because they're just making direct videos. It does not follow a straight line, everything happens at the same time, so why not make sense. It is hardly any activity at all and in order to make a good movie good, you usually have to act on it. Special effects are very bad and you can say they are counterfeit. All this means that it is the worst movie of all, so if you want to see a movie with Steven, you don't try it, but pretend it doesn't exist. Just avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ** off ********** <br /> <br /> * *****
