Based on the horror writer's Stephen King's average short story about the Sleepwalkers' ancient and immortal cat-like creatures that suck virgins life to support them ", which means they become invisible and can fool people into foolishness. who has been taken off one by one until the two left are left. to find a virgin she does (madchen amick) and tries to get her alone so she can suck her. stay away from a woman when a teenage girl follows a teen boy, but her plans are stuck when The girl is fighting back, piercing the pen in her ear. The police are called and hunting! The son is sick of his injuries, and the mother goes to a kid who kills the policemen left and right, hunting a girl who hurt her son and hurt one painfully one unique liner. Finally, the girl kills the end of the movie's mother. This movie is garbage! The actor is changing, from the average Brian Krause to the excellent Alice Krigen. Special effects are medium and show some early computer effects that are slightly interesting as it shows how far such things have gone in such a short period of time. The direction is confusing and the film gets into places. The director seems uncertain whether we should be afraid or intimidating the scarers, and the film will undoubtedly make it hysterical. Stephen King makes a slightly amusing suitcase like a tedious gardener like Mark Hamill, like a puzzled cop. Alice Krige looks like a movie, her character is deep, and she is signaling what the film might have been for better scenarios and better direction.
