Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as strong as most of his movie tracks. Mother and son move to a secret little town of Indiana. They are Sleepwalkers, cat-type creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story is part of gore and special effects; plus tips for incest. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige is a mother of outstanding prominence. Others are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King came to the cemetery as a caretaker.
