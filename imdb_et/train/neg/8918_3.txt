Concept 1: That the British electorate could be pushed to the right of the middle to be overwhelmingly left. Concept 2: that all discussions in the media and in the public will be completed unanimously, and that the only prime critics of the prime minister are innocent civil servants, MI5, large companies and Americans (of course). Concept 3: That this radical socialist PM can solve all the Union, economic and social problems with perfect ease in a way that unites the people. Concept 4: It is a good thing that all ties with the US and NATO are good. Concept 5: The Soviet Union is not a brutal and oppressive regime and we should have been closer to them in the 1980s. Finally, Concept 6: US reactive forces are actively seeking to launch a coup against Britain. <br /> <br /> It is ridiculous and the show only gained the reputation it made in trying to make money on some of Thatcher's feelings in the country and singing left TV critics. When that was done, television was still a very popular and influential media with exhibitions with huge ratings, so the widely spoken drama with a controversial hint was a good opportunity for a large audience. Ray McInally's performance was high, one of the few plus points. History and time have shown the great weakness of the space and space of this exhibition.
