This is TMNT's biggest offense. In fact, Venus canon does not exist in TMNT. The women turtle can never be, it took away the tragic story of four men's unique mutants who never had their family when they ever went. The biggest mistake was to overcome Power Rangers with a terrible episode of TMNT; the turtle's voices were WRONG and they all worked out of character. They could have done better work, better design and animation, and NO VENUS. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about this person ... it's a worthy material. The lip valve was slow and unnatural. they are completely broken. main baddie, some dragonlord guy was horny. the turtles looked at things hanging from their bodies that are around the rape thighs? stupidly sculptured plastrons!? <br /> <br /> When they looked normal, they acted characteristically and came out of Venus, then the stupid sounds of the child's comics came out ... and better writing could have been good.
