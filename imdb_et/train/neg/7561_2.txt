Anyone who is not aware of the 1973 British lion's "The Wicker Man" would undoubtedly have left the impression of "Poor" and "Peur". <br /> <br /> The original devotee I had the impression of being quite poor. <br /> <br /> From the intimidated reality of intimidated inbreds that pulls the law and ordinance into a network of pagan barbaric rituals far from the Scottish island, called Summerisle (original), the Amazon colony near the Maine Coast of the United States, called Summersisle ' , the remake may hardly come true. <br /> <br /> This is, unfortunately, a case that “could” be a classic remake of the classic has changed to satisfy simple thinking. NO MINIMUM AND NOT LESS. Gentlemen (or movie recreated context) Ladies involved ... hang your head in shame.
