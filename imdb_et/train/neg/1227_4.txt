While many people here praise the film, I have to warn you. He has no logic. I think Basinger does a decent job, but you can't do the thrill when there is a big shortage of reality. <br /> <br /> This scene gives you a good picture of the movie: while Basinger tries to kill the murderers he decides to sit down and look at the picture he finds in his pocket. The picture is from her daughter and it reads "we love you mommy". Who does something like that? What ef? And believe me when I say it's not nearly as stupid as some other movie scenes. Someone said it was a "hidden pearl". Well, I have to strongly disagree, this movie is caused by hidden. And it's not a pearl. Oh, and please, I don't even want to start commenting on the red toolbox. It hurts my brain: D Usually, I am not disturbed by the lack of logic, if it is in small quantities, but this film is basically only possible due to lack of logic. But I give it another 4, because although it is embarrassing in logical terms, it is a certain mood that kept me from looking to the end. <br /> <br /> So if you decide to watch it, you know you have a warning.
