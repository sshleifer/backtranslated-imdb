The basic formula of the original series was; Take someone, make the audience enjoyable, then put them on a mortal threat. This formula worked in 1964-68. <br /> <br /> We are now moving on for 40 years to 2004. Introducing Alan Tracy, a somewhat more careful college child, with his friend Fermat, a young man. . They have been tied up by Lady Penelope in her pink Ford Thunderbird for the island paradise where Tracy's family lives. Almost immediately they remain in the care of Kyrano and his daughter Tin-Tin, while adults are going to rescue John 5 from Thunderbird, which has been damaged by a staged accident. It's part of The Hood's scheme to take over Tracy Island to steal Thunderbird's machines ... <br /> <br />? Bank robbery! <br /> <br /> Yes. The plot is so slippery as it is! <br /> <br /> Dialogue is banal, exemplary wood as (fiberglass) dolls, effects, anything but special, and Hans Zimmer's score ??? What little was Barry Gray's brilliant theme was out of Zimmer's weak orchestra. The rest of the score was surprisingly forgotten. In fact, part of the score was sent on the radio next week and didn't know it! I did not even bother Busted as a witness of mediocre efforts to be sure that Ron Cook was working correctly when Parker, he and Sophia Myles, as Penelope seemed wasted. With the right material they could have shown caps. The work of the CGI was what I would have called the leading edge - 5 years ago. <br /> <br /> The main ship dynamics was just wrong; The original series models moved at least as if they were getting mass. Tracy Freezer is produced by Ben & Jerry. <br /> <br /> My son (9) enjoyed the movie, but this cross between Spy Kids and "Clockstoppers", which was aimed specifically at his age group, didn't add anything to the Thunderbirds legend. When Star Trek hit The Motion Picture on a big screen in 1979, the franchise was branded with a brand new housing that then continued for 20 years. For this movie, Frakes has missed the golden opportunity to do the same with the Thunderbirds franchise. <br /> <br /> I predict that this movie, such as "The Avengers" and "Saint", will sink in 6 months, leaving the "classic" status of the original series.
