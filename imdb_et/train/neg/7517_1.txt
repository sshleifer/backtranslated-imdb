*** One out of ten stars *** <br /> <br /> Because if that was the case, he would get F. Holy Mother Mary was bad. I thought I gave him all the reasonable places, because it was a direct video, but it gave me every step of the way. Like many other B-films, the main features were decent and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources, but the execution was ridiculous. It is a shame that they affirmed the name of a good Halloween for this fiasco. <br /> <br /> The main premise is surrounded by some frat showers that hold the throne of their annual Halloween haunted house foundation, when the satanic spelling book comes out and throws the frat boys into a living hell. Well, this is the idea anyway, but most of the movie is dedicated to those frat-boys relationships that have a lot of terrifying lesbian. A very small real story is dedicated to Halloween or a mysterious spell to the book. It makes me crazy that filmmakers thought they could get rid of such drifting. <br /> <br /> The film is essentially about a boyfriend. It is NOT what the film has paid for. I am tempted to suppress manufacturers and at least threaten them with bodily injury. The actor is as bad as it gets, it's cruel! The script is accidentally funny. Cinema is just lazy. The whole movie is an amateur night. This movie turns the film productions of the SyFy channel into masterpieces. <br /> <br /> The last half-hour of the film seemed to make the filmmakers realize that they didn't produce a soap opera and had some sort of horror. Finally, the evil spell begins to play the book and turns all the characters in the ghost house. I think I'm crying when I write this review. Wow! I mean wow! This thing was an irreducible disaster.
