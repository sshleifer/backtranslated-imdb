The title "cult film" is often given to films that are still being reviewed or sold at home in film format, more than a generation after their first release. Superchick, first released in 1973, now belongs to this category. The status of this cult is largely due to the fact that women, who regard it as early and effective feminist films, are still interested in it. a very competent young lady working as an air hostess - a career opportunity that was considered one of the most glamorous of all girls in the 1970s, which also allows her to mimic a traditional matelot who has a woman in every port. Since she has black belt status in karate, she is able to make it quite clear that she is very satisfied with her bachelor's existence and in no way sees any of her extensive male admirers. This film is a comedy of the situation that directly avoids the shorter life of the farce in general. The feminist appeal is also raised by the climax where our heroine uses her karate abilities to avoid hijacking and rescue all other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate. To ensure that this film is appealing to both men and their partners, the director has wisely ensured that it is freely sprinkled with eye candy. <br /> <br /> Superclip can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and want a very light, easy-to-follow comedy that they will forget immediately after viewing. It is so forgetting that they will probably find it as pleasing as they look at it again in a year's time; despite this age, it may for some time maintain the status of a cult film. However, dialogue and action would make the rating of this film more difficult than 4/10.
