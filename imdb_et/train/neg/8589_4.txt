First of all, let me highlight this post by saying that I am a fan of the original Star Wars MOVIES ... I don't read books, play games, wear underwear or eat cereals (if any). I'm just a fan of movies. <br /> <br /> That being said, I have to see how people gave this film such praise. By taking this film by itself and not comparing it to its terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I do not understand how you can say it is an amazing film. For all the terrible shortcomings in the script - the cheesy dialogue, the scenes (ie, R2 suddenly being badass, and the long CGI intensive tracking scenes with little human control), HORRIBLE act and noted the plot holes ... how is that good? There was no real internal dilemma in Anakini; it just seemed that the switch was turned and it was suddenly bad. I didn't like the movie until the last 20 minutes (which, incidentally, had destroyed Franken's "NOOOOOO!" Scene). When the BOMBARD screen intensely amazing CGI effect and fill the gaps completely frightening one-liners than more could have and should have said it is not a big movie. With such a "dark" film, the ALL characters in the speech were too many hands. <br /> <br /> Stop with the question: was it really urgent and important about what really happened from the beginning to the end of the movie?
