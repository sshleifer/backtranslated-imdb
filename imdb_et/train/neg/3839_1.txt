Some movies are so bad that they are good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on the real story, this film was the same story as Pinocchio's ability to become a real boy. The action was terrible, the direction was bad and it was driving too fast. Just as the director just wanted to do it and go home. <br /> <br /> Melissa Joan Hart also never hit a talented actor, but then every film she made was a pretty low budget anyway. Like most of his films, he shoots his characters by moving them too much, talking too fast when his words accelerate. He really brings out the idea that he has a team in front of him and he talks to the camera when he should look at his character. It pretty much gives off the whole movie, and all the legs that he might have stood on are destroyed. <br /> <br /> Probably the only good movie at the end of the movie is when he cut at the end. But even that was not enough to bring down its badness for such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> See if your taste in the film is delicate as dry dry toast.
