Watching this stinker is a cruel and unjust punishment in Sandler. Really slow and painful death. <br /> <br /> I bought a DVD in the Wal Mart 5,88 dollar trash. But the thought that comes with my head is, "How can I get my money back?" <br /> <br /> The most unforgettable thing about the movie is that the boat is NOT HERE! Best constructive suggestion: Mystery Comedy Theater. You know it is on the SciF channel, where some boy and his hooded machines robbing the Mystery Science Theater. OFF, turn off the comedy program and play it on the flick. Without a good sense of humor on the trains of this train, I am afraid that viewers can follow Sandler's pursuit of ice cuttings and chainsaws. <br /> <br />
