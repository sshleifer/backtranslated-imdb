After Mr Brosnan is "Panama Speaker" (which I appreciate in all areas: staging, acting, script, story, editing, tempo, music, emotional impact, etc.), it is very entertaining. , I waited eagerly for this movie. I was very disappointed. This is a script that does not read a movie that is vulgar to be vulgar, bankrupt in every sense that "Panama maze" is rich and satisfactory. Blame it on the screen for writing and directing. I sat in the theater, waiting for a good part; it has never come. I didn't laugh or shout, though one line of dialogue made me smile. Worth $ 7? Hardly.
