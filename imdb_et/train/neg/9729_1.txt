Seriously, what is it? The hooper has made such classic films as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so did he do the godly movie that happened? Is he a little too much? This movie is about somewhat a guy named Sam, who has the ability to put things in things (Firestarter, someone?) The exhibition was godawful, the plot was garbage and special effects were extremely garbage, they looked like in the 70s. Van Damme should be pleased that Derailed is no longer the worst film and what was the end? he started to glow blue, turned into a glowing blue, pulled out his girlfriend's fire and the movie ended. WHAT WAS IT? AH? When the movie ended, I was hoping the DVD would have Spontaniously Combo to save me from my pain. <br /> <br /> AFTER THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> DON'T Think OBEY Thank You Later.
