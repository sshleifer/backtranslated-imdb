Please don't let this movie cover you. And if you are looking for a cheap horror film to laugh: this is not the case. I usually get stupid if it's funny, but that stupid was so stupid that it almost (or maybe) made me stupid. <br /> <br /> The quality of the movie is better than the handheld, but not much, and it is quite possible when the music was created by pressing the Samba 2 key on the Casio keyboard. These problems should never be discouraged to see the horror movie, but add it to the amazing (crying), and you have a real humdinger. <br /> <br /> The story is about a man who calls his friends at a family house in Texas this weekend. He also extends the invitation to a lady in his office. From there, they meet a woman who is in trouble and is called to other girls. <br /> <br /> Staying in the salon involves sex and nudity, and soon, everyone's panties are in the bunch when one girl disappears and strange items come home. <br /> <br /> From there (audience) and morons, actors, try to figure out what's going on and they will soon trust each other. In general, I think I've made it better than it is. The main struggle of this film is that the characters are very underdeveloped, the plot has evolved, bad behavior and motivation have failed. What's more, it can be forgiving because it was at least a little funny, but unfortunately it isn't. <br /> <br /> Turning is just a twist because nobody thinks it just because if you really thought about the movie, it wouldn't be wise anyway. Please do not let this review stop you from seeing this movie shift. (Woah, my nose just grew eight inches.)
