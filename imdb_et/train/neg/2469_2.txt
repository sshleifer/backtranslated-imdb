I think if you like an endless dialogue that does not convey the story and flashy camera effects such as the scene transitions in _Angel_, you will enjoy this movie. Me? All I wanted was a nice, narrow story and it wasn't there. Stimulation was practically upside down, plot points were buried in the sea of ​​unnecessary dialogue, and there was no fear or tension, nor anything. <br /> <br /> Is it red? Is this Wendigo? No, it's a cameraman. It's not scary. It will not create any tension or atmosphere unless MTV is afraid. As before my reviewers, I also noticed that the film eventually refers to the audience's hair. <br /> <br /> A terrible movie.
