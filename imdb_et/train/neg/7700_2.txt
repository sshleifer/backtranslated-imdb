I saw the movie home last night, but I thought it was too long. Secondly, what I saw in the movie was too much of a text that even what I thought was a comedy-type movie like the rest. There is nothing funny in the film: the bride who strikes her girlfriend kicks. The movie was too long - tell us that you want to sleep and ask when it will end when you wake up and still play! Some things in the meeting were too much to beat - like a lady song - I felt like I was looking at the almost spiritual show here! come to Perry, you can do it better!
