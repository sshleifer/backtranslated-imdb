The premise is amazing, and some actors, namely Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, are charming ... but this film is intact. Music sounds like it comes from a free, free website and words like they were written on a laptop that is open on the lap. Most songs are keyless. I think they could be filming with a singing chapel and putting it under the music ... The dialogue is really stupid and lunatic. The film works best when it actually talks about real estate, but unfortunately it is often a stupid class. I found myself checking my first twenty minutes and after 40 thinking "when it ends."
