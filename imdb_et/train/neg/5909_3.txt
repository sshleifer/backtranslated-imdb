Opening for five minutes gave me hope. Then Meyers proved that he had only one good idea for the rest of the film. Absolute lowest common denominator of humor. Painful viewing. Complete housing. Described undoubtedly in less than a week, like the first. Hook Meyers and lock him with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. And don't let him out until he has developed a proper script for something, nothing. He's got it. These Austin Powers things are just embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Allow Goldmember to keep track.
