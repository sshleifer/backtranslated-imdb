This is one of the worst films I've seen. The only positive thing I can say is that it was so bad that it seemed comical. First, there is no plot. It seems that the actors read the smart cards and do the hardest things. Such as dead people pursuing, but still want to go and look for their friends. The zombies were also terrible, almost as fun as any Romero job that could combine the movie. And all that was the slimmest part was that they kept blinking video game sequences. As we can not, the video game is played by zombies. Also all 20 something about how to use automatic weapons and hit the target without a weapon. And how people die is so stupid. It's like they end with ammo so stand around waiting to jump. And when they walked in the corner in front of the house, they run out instead of opening the door, so stupid. with another option. Surely the worst film I've seen for years. B-film on film is better.
