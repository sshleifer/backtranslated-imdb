Okay, I absolutely love Ben Stiller, even though I am lukewarm to Jennifer Aniston. I don't think this girl can work the least. Every movie or sitcom I have seen on it is very hard to miss my fake. It looks like he's just reading off the script. This film had only one good thing and it was that Ben Stiller was in it. This plot is used to make it ridiculous. How many movies have the same type of plot? Can we say "natural power?" The plot is not so old, but the result is so predictable, boring. I knew everything that happened before. It was clean, but watching Stiller is always a pleasure!
