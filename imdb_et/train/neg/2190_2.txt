** Possible Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Jason (a.k.a.a.b. Herb) Evers is a brilliant brain surgeon who, along with his wife, Leith, is involved in the most insecure car accident on the screen. Leith is decapitated and the doctor takes her cut nose back to her mansion and rejuvenates her head in her lab. The exterior of the manor was allegedly filmed at Tarrytown's Lyndhurst Manor; Lab-scenes were probably captured in someone's basement. The tied head is kept alive by "Labs", which is almost cheap for Ed Wood. Some of the library's music, the highest point of the film later, appeared in Andy Milligani's THE BODY BENEATH. Leith's heads have some heavy metaphysical discourses with another Ever's misfire, a closed mutant in the closet. In the meantime, the good docks are creating the joints, looking for a body that deserves its wife's brisk noodle. The end, printed prints, takes some time for their spraying and breaking when the zigzag monster comes out of the closet to bring the film to the near. It took three years and then gave the audience the bad reception he had earned. It should have been announced in the 9th Plan of the 9th Year of the Plan for Turkey and some others in 1959.
