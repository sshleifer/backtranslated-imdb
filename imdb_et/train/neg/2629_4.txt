The hollow point is the right price, the value of which is half the price, or if nothing else is good over time, without thinking. There are required explosions and hammy acting and pretty ladies. A pretty good song with Donald Sutherland, John Lithgow and lovely Tia Carrere. This molded plus light-hearted touch makes it not a great movie, but fun.
