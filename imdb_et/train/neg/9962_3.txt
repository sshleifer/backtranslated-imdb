Uta Hagen's "Acting Respect" is a standard textbook in many college theater courses. In the book, Hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to character development as an actor: a presentation and a representative approach. In the presentation, the actor focuses on realizing reality as honestly as possible, presenting emotional elements from the actor's own life. In a representative approach, the actor tries to influence the emotion under the high control of movement and sound. <br /> <br /> Representative approach to action was still partly fashionable when Hamlet was made. The British theater has a long history with this style and Olivier can be said to be the ultimate king of the representative school. <br /> <br /> It's not time for this school or for this movie. . Almost every employee today uses a presentation method. For the modern eye, Olivier is a highly perceived, stylized delivery stodgy, rigid and stylish. Instead of creating internally contradictory Hamlet, Olivier made a melancholy Dane, a self-advancing whore - a style that would have come to the back of large London theaters, but is too starchy. modern hamlet. <br /> <br /> And so the movie is filming peacefully today. Olivier's tendency to e-nun-ci-t makes some Hamlet lines inadvertently funny: "Instead, you have to fill and get a temple that can give him ... Smooth-ness!" Instead of shouting at his father's ghost (as any true actor could do), the bright fillings of Olivier's students give us that impression. <br /> <br /> Eileen Herlie is the only other actor in this Hamlet. good essay at the queen, despite the painful differences in age (she was 41; she was 26). Other participants in this film have no chance of doing anything else, considering Olivier's tendency to keep! Camera! to him! all over! times! <br /> <br /> Sixty years later, you feel the insecurity of the Shakespeare actress who did not have the confidence to portray a broken, broken hamlet, and chose instead to portray a sort of Elizabethan bull. Final analysis: "I would have a companion who would like to make Theragant, this is Herod-Herod: pray, avoid it."
