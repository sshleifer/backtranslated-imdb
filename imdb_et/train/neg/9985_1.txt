Have I ever seen the film more shockingly wrong? I mean a lot that is the same but none who can overcome it. All the horrible stereotypes with a certain dialogue are cast. I am ashamed of all the people involved in doing this. Everyone carries an expression of fear that is not created by the plot, but by realizing that this project can easily shift its career. Even many of Mrs Diaz's charms do not give enough reason to subjugate her. Avoid, this is obviously a movie style that Americans haven't really got. See the end result if you need to, and see what I'm talking about, but don't say I didn't warn you ...
