"The Screaming Skull" opens with warning and free burial services if you should watch it - Now it's hooked! The story itself is quite an interesting prerequisite for dragging the horror: the husband marries a wealthy woman who has had a mental disorder, and then tries to convince her that she is going crazy when they are in terrible noises, mysterious knocks and skulls that turn out early. Add a decent gardener to the formula who still loves the memory of the man's first wife whom he devoted. Perhaps, in the 1950s, there was no technology to pull some of the films needed to put down this film, the techniques used here seem to be lively and everyday. But then again, when I first saw "House on Haunted Hill" as a nine-year-old, he gave me the Hebrew jeebies the way I am sure this film was for young viewers of the same era. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, the movie is not terrible, it seems annoying from time to time. But there are huge atmospheric tensions in general, but unfurnished Whitlock's home, gardens and pool are a nice touch. For me, the best played scene is Eric Whitlock (John Hudson), who goes into the crucible manic, trying to rebuild the hidden skull, he just dresses up and dresses up in everything, with a pure contrast to the mental challenge to the gardener (director Alex Nicol in two roles). It makes you wonder who was the real dimwit. <br /> <br /> Own a good way, perhaps the most shocking idea of ​​a movie: how this clean roadster, Whitlock, first appears in a church ride in 1958! It at least made me jump out of my seat!
