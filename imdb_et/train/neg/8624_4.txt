The action was not great, the story was full of simplified turns and transparent signs. This concerns the consequences of the struggle between the right-wing Flemish constituents on the one hand and the Moroccan people living in Antwerp, Belgium, on the other. Is this a political analysis? Is it a Belgian West Side Story or a modern Romeo and Juliet? The film is not strong enough to answer both questions (assuming they were also director questions). However, some scenes may act like a certain kind of Ken Loach film that has been placed in Antwerp. After all, this city has been the starting point of the extreme party of the Flemish right-wing blocks and is struggling with many different problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It is very difficult to make a movie out of this situation and it is unfortunately not successful. However, this story speaks of a very real and complicated situation in today's Belgium. Few foreign viewers should try and enjoy it and realize that this is not an important film, but the social dividing lines behind it, haunting 10 million people in Belgium in the 2000s <br /> <br /> Dries Van Dongen
