One of Boris Karloff's real clinkers. Basically, Karloff (looking about 120 years older than he was) is a scientist who needs his experiments before he dies. Moving from Morocco, where his funding is taken over by someone else, he goes to southern France, where he works with a doctor, trying to break down enough money to prove his theories. For desperate money, he makes a young rich woman of deadly cotton. She finances her when she helps her to poison her so she can take her money and continue with a gigologist (who thinks she's married). If you think I got this movie wrong, I had to read what other people posted on the computer. Why? because this movie was lost to me in two minutes. I had no idea what was happening with the number of stars and the line of several upcoming plots. Little has been said and not much to say, until the end, when I really do not care. It's just a boring confusion about Karloff's activity, which is quite strange from time to time. Frankly, this is the only time I've ever seen him in the strange territory of Bela Lugos. He's not every scene but a few and makes me think how much they hung.
