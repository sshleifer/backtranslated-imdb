I stayed awake for the night at night, watching this thing. The only thing that could be said about this terrifying film is that film schools can use it to show how not to make a movie. There is no development of the right character, wait, I'm not even sure they were characters. The settings were hokey and ugly, and the overuse of shared screens was wasted because sometimes they couldn't even sync with alternative frames. If I could give it a zero or minus rating, I'd like to do it. Unfortunately, some laughter is not even worth the time. <br /> <br /> It is just a sad example of Hollywood's wasted money and is now wasting time even thinking about it.
