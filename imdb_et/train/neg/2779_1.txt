Obviously, if you offer the actor enough money, they will do something. I'm not sure how much John Rys-Daves got, but most of the money he made should go to his fans for even linking to such a ROTTEN movie. Special effects were worse than the effects of B-films of the 1950s, and the rest of casting was even worse. As for how bad the baby was, I thought the other best result. The English language was terribly stressed and I think nobody could even speak English, but just remember how words should memorize the script and try to make their character both "live" and real.
