Buford's Beach Bunnies is a bad name for Class B R&D films. As a fan of the genre, I was outraged that few attempts were made to exploit the talents of young actors. I refer specifically to the clear lack of nudity and simulated sexual scenes. What are the next-generation sad teenage boys who watch it on television at a late night?
