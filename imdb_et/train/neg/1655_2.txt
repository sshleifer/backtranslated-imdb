This movie really shows its age. The print I saw was terrible because of age, but it is possible that there is a better printout. But this wasn't the main problem with the movie. The problem was that although the film was made in 1933, it was essentially a silent film, where the film had only a few sentences in the most amateur style. Sometimes the characters were turned towards the back, or they spoke with their hands on their face - all pathetic attempts to hide their lips and "cleaverly" (?) Conceal the fact that the film was dubbed. Well, it is true that this Czech film should be dubbed in many languages, but it was really silly and obvious. It just seemed cheap. <br /> <br /> In general, the film seemed low budget and stupid. It's really a shame, because there was a good story - a young woman who marries a senior man who is gay and / or has no interest in women. But in the 21st century, few people would sit through this archaic mess. Nothing (and somewhat thick) with Hedy Lamarri's glimpse of the noise that came with the film. Even with the 1933 standards, this film was badly made. The only interesting thing about the film is to see how different Lamarr in 1933 looked at the glamorous Hollywood image that came to America - he looks like two completely different people. <br /> <br /> This is an incomplete looking and technically inferior movie, I don't see how he got such dirty comments. In the case of technical problems alone, the film cannot judge anything close to or close to 10.
