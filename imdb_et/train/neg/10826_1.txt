I can't say it's the worst movie all the time, but just because there are still movies I've never seen before! It must be the most terrible attempt to make a movie all the time! The director suffers from the same problems he had "On Will Blood" (although he was not so bad in the film. The whole film seems to be watching a man who is trying to impress his abilities). It's like he's sitting under his little director and thinks, "How big a filmmaker would run this scene?" He just can't tolerate him. I don't know if a big filmmaker would have saved this movie. Certainly there are some great knits that could have been polished but nothing matured. The scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in the history of cinema: one by one we see these symbols singing and I looked at me I said, "Please, please, just can't make this guy sing at death!" Of course, MASSIVE ANSWERS!
