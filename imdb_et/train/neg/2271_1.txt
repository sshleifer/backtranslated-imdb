One could probably make a big documentary about Jerry Springer Show, but this fictional version can only clear something authentic and interesting about the trash-TV phenomenon. There are dozens of good bad movies (such as "Manos: Hands of Fate") that show more creativity and spirit than this harsh and pointless waste of film. <br /> <br /> Seriously, why not documentary Jerry on the Springer Show that would come up with some real questions like: Who are these people? What happens to their lives after they are shown? How did the Mayor of Cincinnati find here? <br /> <br /> One Good Line: "Orientation" for Guests at a Session: "People, I Can't Emphasize It: NOT HIGH!"
