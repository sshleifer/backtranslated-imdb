You get a gift. It's packed finely. The box, that is, is handmade of the finest wood and shows the skill with the smallest detail. It is then packed in beautiful papers, hand-made and hand-painted by artists. The whole thing is packed with fine silk lace. This is a vision to see. <br /> <br /> Then you cut off the tape, hang the paper, open the box and find ... something. It's toys. You either enjoy the package or forget it. <br /> <br /> Film is not his idea and purpose: war is not good. Well, it's not the original! Morality is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing. And even this weak understanding is a shocking story where the elements of war, especially war toys, are clearly bad until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates the war of innocent toys. It is like someone who preaches the stern, forcing the sermon, but ends, saying, "Just kidding." <br /> <br /> But even in the case of an empty box, the film does not control closely. Yes, this is a prominent, striking image. Sets are imaginative and cinematic skillfully captures colorful scenes. But the pictures are cold and emotionally sterile. Like the scenario, the film's appearance is joyful and sometimes aesthetically rough and surreal. This is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things, but shows that they are the creations of an empty and cold world. The film tries to be funny, moral, but humor is forced and artificial. Robin Williams, a heir to the toy-producing empire, throws his ad-lib shtick, which appears to be a stranger, in a coldly structured world where he lives. Indeed, the current references and the tasteless sexual inspiration that is scattered are contradictory to the childish fable that the film has been ambiguously trying to do. To make this film work or make sense, it must be set in Oz, far from Oz. Every time the jokes pull us into reality, the toyland of the movie becomes a shame. <br /> <br /> It has been said that it was a film project by director Barry Levinson, which he had been trying to do for ten years. Unfortunately, it is obvious why he had problems without support. Like most pet projects that were finally completed (RADIOLAND MURDERS, RADIO FLYER & BATTLEFIELD: Earth are great examples), it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmaker's perspective. Maybe Levinson headed and headed TOYS so often with his head that he didn't see the fresh vision when he finally reached the stage. He had already improved it to death. <br /> <br /> Many of the toys on the film are clumsy, mechanical, resurrecting monsters. So is the film itself.
