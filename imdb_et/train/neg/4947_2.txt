Dieter Bohlen, Germany's infamous composer and a little gimmick producer like "You are my heart, you are my soul" felt the need to talk about your story - and he decided to hire a ghost writer. The result was a funny book about his life. Well, more or less fuzzy picture of it. He did not deny he was a selfish cunt, but the whole story was twisted to fit his own picture. It's not a word that he's probably beaten his former wife and he got to the hospital. But it was written in a funny style and a great success after his appearance in the "American Idol" German version of the jury - especially his unforgettable comments. <br /> <br /> This should be the end of the story. really. The hypothesis of "Idol" television program "Deutschland sucht den Superstar" (abbreviated DSDS) must come out of the terrible idea of ​​a movie. The result is "Dieter der Film" <br /> <br /> I have rarely seen a movie that is trying to be so desperate and unsuccessful. No gags really strike. Naddel's voice and style immediately spoke to my nerves, even though Verona's voice should have done more. The obvious, childish, predictable and long gags will destroy all the motivation to watch the movie in a matter of minutes. The content of the movie is a sloppy customization of the film, written by a sloppy writer of Ghost, based on Bohlen's sloppy ideal of memory. They could have used this freedom almost everything. It was supposed to be satire, but they failed. The story is totally uninteresting, and the fact that the background voice is Bohlen itself guarantees that the whole film has nothing satirical at all. <br /> <br /> It is no wonder that it was considered bad to release the cinema. The likelihood that this thing would be rotten in some archives was recently quite high when DSDS's current season was a modest success. With the "friendly" help from Germany's largest yellow newspaper "BILD" and the desperate situation of the television station RTL, there is something in the program, while the best show "Wetten dass ...? "works on channel 2, finally came to the TV - unfortunately. Watching this movie is a waste of time - there are definitely better cartoons that have a lot more fun and the story you really value. <br /> <br />
