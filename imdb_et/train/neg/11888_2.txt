There should be some facts and realism to make any movie from the supposed end of the world 1. We have never been told why these people believe it. 2.Location is New Year Eve Toronto Canada. HOW TO RECOMMEND WHAT IS EVERYTHING EVERYTHING AND WHAT (by Costumes) NOTED WITH RECOMMENDATION <br /> <br /> 3. The act was in the neo-au-style that needed a director who knew how to do it. <br /> <br /> 4. The individual pieces of the story were all harsh and without any purpose. I could go on, but I don't want to be bored with this movie. <br /> <br /> Rating * 1/2 (of 4) 2 IMDB scale <br /> <br /> Thank you for always being so <br /> <br /> JAY HARRIS (aka SIRBOSSMAN)
