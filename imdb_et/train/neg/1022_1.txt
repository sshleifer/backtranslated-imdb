From the movie (only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey) there was a whole movie fraud. One stereotype after another, this movie was something - or nothing new. After 10-15 minutes you realize you've just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J on your way through another police officer. <br /> <br /> In principle, the story of a corrupt system in the city, all that is backed by the backbone and the city, is under the watchful eye of some hot-shot politicians. The omnipotent and over-law organization is called the FRAT and I think what? They have a policeman who strikes and smashes, who strikes and kills his will - suspects, girlfriends. FRAT's police officers are corrupt and greedy, so they make mistakes discovered by a young and talented (!!!) journalist. One hour later, after a number of incredibly poorly made shooting scenes and more stereotypical lines, everything ends happily and we get hold of the final line: you can't win the system. Bah! Don't look at this film roll waste. Freeman and Spacey are barely 10 minutes away!
