Okay, I rented this movie because of the director ... he's done some interesting movies in the past (if you haven't seen Waxork, you have a fun ride). Anyway, I had doubts about this movie from the beginning, but I decided to suck and watch it. This is bad. Very bad. If you haven't seen the movie and don't remember that spoilers read on. First of all, here's the old saying, "You can't judge the book by its cover". This flick box seems to have shown that Jill is a stone burst with long hair and highlights. On the back of the box is Jill with cool red skin and some other shots. The description allows you to rent a movie because it is SOUNDS good. You're gonna look at it and maybe you'll know that the movie is (inexplicably) in 1977. The film is not as predictable as you think ... and it's not good. Characters do so many stupid things without motivation ... it's embarrassing to look. 10 minutes before the end of the movie, Delf and the other lady have no sex. Also, what was the idea of ​​Dolphi killing that other woman in the cold blood that helped her. Anthony Hickox, director, should have been reading the script. If it had been placed in the underworld of the new millennium and the characters were semi-intelligent, it would have been decent. Setting the 70s does not make sense and does not affect this story. Avoid it!
