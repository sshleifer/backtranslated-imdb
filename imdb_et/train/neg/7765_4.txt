Strange, almost all reviewers are very positive about this movie. Is it because it has been since 1975 and is there in Chamberlain and Curtis and therefore forgive from time to time for the very poor and childish ways of storytelling? Perhaps this is because some people get sentimental about this movie because they've read the book? (I haven't read the book, but I don't think it's a problem, filmmakers never think that viewers have read the book). Or is it because I am unconsciously irritated by the fact that English-speaking actors try to act as their French colleagues?
