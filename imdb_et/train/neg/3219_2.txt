Someone called Howard Koch a schlockmaster, but he wrote a "Casablanca" scenario, isn't it? Or not. Maybe more than one Koch is moving around in Hollywood, and I'm not so fond of "Casablanca". Wait a minute - yes, there is another Howard Koch who slips around Hollwyood. It's the one who wrote "Casablanca". Does not matter. I make this comment so much that "Howard W. Koch" put it in the product, which means just a little. <br /> <br /> Do you know what it sounds like? Someone read Cliff's notes from Shakespeare's "King Lear" and decided that there was no original thoughts on the incoming inspiration to update it and Hollywood to a happy ending. <br /> <br /> There are differences. Lear decides to divide her big mansions between the three sisters and ask them before they love her. Two sisters throw themselves at their feet and brown nose to get her money. The third one is a good girl and refuses to be in Lear. But in the game, Lear is lucky enough to decide to give her two strangers a stapler and leave an honest girl. She runs mad and nude in the mountains, letting flowers in her hair and hallucination. Kids can do it for you. (Take, for example, my boyfriend. After I bothered to raise him, does he show he wants to become a doctor or a lawyer? No.) Finally, everyone in the game dies. <br /> <br /> The film obviously has a good sister in fear and suicide, but when she tries to avoid herself, someone jumps and saves her so the end is more or less happy. This is the difference between Hollywood and a true tragedy if you do not define Hollywood as a tragedy that is enough for yourself.
