One of the worst films I've ever seen with Robert De Niro is the fan of the practice of practicing clich√© exercises. It tries to turn or twist the genre when the potty fan turned psychotic - the film fails. (spoiler) We believe that a knife handling an idiot has access to a baseball player and is murdered in a proud hotel without witnesses, security or cameras? The film is meaningless, trying to pull our heart through the baseball baseball that ends up in a complicated and tricky manner. Not sure what all the actors thought when they boarded the razzie. It is as big as they come. Stay far away if you want to think about your movies
