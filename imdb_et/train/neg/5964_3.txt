The version of the movie I saw was titled "The Grave of the Grave from the Tomb". This horror is a false medieval wizard played by the Spanish horror legend Paul Naschy, who looks like he plays Abanazer in the church hall. He rises from his grave as a stupid descendant (I think he is a descendant, as he has played Naschy), returns to his ancestral home and again connects the magician's head and body, separated by the witches who executed him, trying to lift him from the grave . <br /> <br /> Of course, when the head and body are together, all the hell will break and many people will die. Like all good wizards, there is also a cute assistant at Abanazer. It is played by another Spanish horror, a beautiful Helga line. Like practically all other women in the film line, she regularly gets her kit out. There's a lot of nudity in this movie and not just a female - we even see a Naschy pause body that's not quite prominent, I can tell you. Most of the sex of the movie is ridiculously free. There's one particularly funny scene where Naschy and Line are discussing their evil plans and then suddenly they both have a bow to the young young blondes they have. <br /> <br /> It's also in a pretty good place - especially at Herschell's Gordon Lewis-esquire moment when Line pulls his hands into the man's chest to remove his heart. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is pretty effective zombies who are turning to the end. But they are still afraid of the fire and don't bother. What is a shame. The scene where the zombies rise is the most ridiculous intuitive moment of the film. It's all going on for a long time, and we don't really know what's going on until we see some of the numbers that have been missed. Such large dumps are largely due to poor editing. When the workforce falls into the hypnotic incantation of Naschy's head, his face is very close, which seems to last forever and has no purpose. <br /> <br /> All in all, the big movie is not a big movie, but fun is enough. Of course, the version I saw was a duplicated American version that was probably cut. I know the original Spanish version could be a masterpiece ...
