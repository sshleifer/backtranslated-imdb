* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I was sure that when it came out in 1958, it was very suitable for your time. Then the films were at a slower pace to allow the audience to track and analyze the story. Here the man moves to his last wife who died mysteriously with his new husband. Gardener Mickey (played by Alex Nicol, who also directed the film) is really undervalued. He gets a skull to indirectly warn Jenni that he is in trouble because he knew that the first woman's death was a scam. He can't tell Jenna directly what happened, so he's trying to scare him for the skull. Jenni, we also learned, saw her parents die, causing a lifetime of mental torture that led to institutionalization. Like many of today's audiences, I found this pace too slow for my taste. But if you like slow pace without much gore, this movie is for you. <br /> <br />
