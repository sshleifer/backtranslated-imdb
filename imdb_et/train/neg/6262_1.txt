I agree with the reviews I read here, and I have no such definition of turkey, but, despite everything, I still find such films. Will you remove those happy days when the video was a prosperous business, and many movies were the only reason why the video store shelves were filled? this film comes from that time and I can imagine that it was the only reason it was produced and the same happened to many many other stinkers. Do you remember "Rambo" imitations? and so many Z class slasher ?, I still feel nostalgia during this time. On this movie I can say that I do not waste my time watching it because I pressed the fast back and forth button after the first fifteen minutes to find a very funny scene where the man pushed the ax against the head that exploded because, as you totally noticed, they were made of plastic. And finally, well, it was so badly filmed that I didn't understand what happened. This is the same, I had not followed any non-existing plot. But the boy, Video Age, was a big movie, despite such films.
