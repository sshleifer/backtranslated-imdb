Seriously, I'm all romantic comedies and I'm going to Miss Congeniality just as Goodfellas ... but this movie? There's no point !!!! And I'm not even talking about stopping the incredible readiness, which is not reasonable. Why does his family live in England? Or at least, why doesn't he have a British accent? He is confident with his father and he is surprisingly forgiving that he has not been in the last two years. (On this subject, no one will ever make a lot of agreement that he has been so long). And what was the funny bachelorette party at the party? I'm not even going to get into the fact that the payer he paid for falls in love with him - what could have been better than making a movie. I'm just saying that characters, settings, and plot are not thin enough to make even a somewhat uniform story. Oh, and the worst part in my opinion is the consistent use of the filmmaker at the most uncertain angles in Deborah's Messing Nose - I would have appealed to filmmakers if I were him! Frankly, I'm all that women are the ones they are, but why in the seven years of loyal Will and Grace viewing have I never noticed how incredibly strange his nose is? Oh! Because these manufacturers are kind to him! This film, like my second favorite movie, Armageddon, is the fault of filmmakers, not actors. In these roles I see both Messing and McDermotti with a better writer, director and producer. <br /> <br /> It easily gets my voice as one of the worst films I've ever wasted. I'm just glad my friend lent me my DVD so everything I was wasting was time. If it were possible to make this review ZERO stars, I'll do it.
