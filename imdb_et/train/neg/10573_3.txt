I had had this movie in my school in a classroom. As I thought, it was nothing fascinating or something new. Although he tries to be original, focusing on the problems the father passes instead of the mother instead of the teenage father. It had an interesting aspect, but it just doesn't live its originality, because there's nothing else in this movie. We have a main brother who has an older sister who likes every other movie he has against him, we have a mother at home who is waiting too much and when he gives more, he feels offended and leaves him in the dust, then we have a father who have always disappeared. Then there are parents on the girls' side who want everything and expect it to be perfect. This story, as I said, was interesting, but the whole cast of a lack of good and good writing or storytelling. All this fell into clichés where a little schoolboy at school starts studying with a girl, they get together, have sex, and then there is a little boy on the boom. Perhaps it would have been better if the writing had been better and the functioning was improved. I've earned more emotions from Leatherface and his chainsaw when I made this movie from any actor and it's pretty bad as Leatherface movies are crappy and terrible. So far, the only interesting teenage movie I saw was Juno. So far the comic side of this serious situation has been more fun, but it is the same message. As I said, the original idea of ​​most of these films was for a teenage mother, but it did not choose to focus on her father's drama, but again, originality does not save the film's mediocrity. I really hope someone decides to do this film again with a better casting and a better writer, or just to make another similar movie because it was a wasted potential.
