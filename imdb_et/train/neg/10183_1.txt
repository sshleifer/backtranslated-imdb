This is one very terrible production. The general consensus has always been that although Princess Margaret may be spoiled and pampered, and maybe she has excessive luxury at her disposal, she was a very beautiful young woman. Here was the weakest point of production, the actor couldn't get over it. It also appeared that the production budget could not stretch the hairdresser - from the beginning, Princess Margaret's characteristic hairs were a permanent bird that lived in an insecure appearance and looked like she had been towing. The actor who played the Duke of Edinburgh seemed ready to play his role by looking at Rory Bremner by imitating Prince Charles and being far away. <br /> <br /> Production was a bug that was a piano, looted, embarrassing garbage load. I think all Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas!
