I've seen my part of Woody Allen's movies, and although they're not always big, you can usually be sure you're entertaining. Probably the last really good bearings were over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95) - since then, the ones I've seen have been uneven but traceable. So when I was invited to watch the new Woody Allen movie, Melinda and Melinda, which I didn't even know, was still released, I went happily. I hadn't heard much about it, so I hoped I'd be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I definitely got the worst Woody Allen movie I saw. The premise is too explained, the cast is terrible, the script is slow and lifeless. Too many scenes did not say anything and still stretched, I assume I will fill a 15-minute short film. <br /> <br /> I don't mind the concept of this movie - two directors are discussing how a simple situation could be interpreted as a comedy or tragedy, and probably the film will continue to show us that when playing both scenarios. The problem is neither of these two movies is good at all. Comedy is not funny and the tragedy is not very tragic. It seems that Allen had a good idea, but then stuck in steam or time to actually finish the movie. <br /> <br /> The overall level of action is also bad - Will Ferrell is the only one to bring something on the table and this is basically the impression of Woody Allen. Earlier, good actors such as Chloe Sevigny were just annoying and worse than Radha Mitchell Melinda (which is shameful because her character is in almost every scene!). <br /> <br /> Fair for Participants, there are no scripts they work with, if they are not. Definitely a long way from Allen, which we know and love from the classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall.
