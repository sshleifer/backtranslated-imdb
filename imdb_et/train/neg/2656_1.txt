(Maybe very light spoilers.) <br /> <br /> I usually tried to watch Diane Keaton's fan today. I had to turn it off before the second hour because I found some compassion for my daughter or mother. Both came to absorb as well as others, but the daughter also added rude, disrespectful and reckless to the confusion. When the daughter died, the only thing I thought was, "At least we don't have to look at her anymore." Keaton did a good job of moving to his stunned country and stumbling block, but it was too far for me. I just didn't enjoy it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to take care of the main character, you have to care for me much earlier - if it's almost an hour and I don't care, it's too late. <br /> <br /> Cast was sincere and well played - I knew them *! * - and the best gay friend was wonderful but even combined, it wasn't enough to wear the movie for me.
