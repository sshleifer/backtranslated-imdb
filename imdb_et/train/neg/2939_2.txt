As others have said, "No, Luciano" is a title or answer more appropriate for the title of this movie. For entertainment, the great opera singer should stay ..... not that he is a terrible actor. It's just that the movie smells. The first 25 minutes were good - a nice family movie like it was - but after that it's not just a dull soap opera. <br /> <br /> When playing with a singer, Pavarotti loses a few times the voice of "Giorgio Fini" and the doctor, "Pamela Taylor" (Kathryn Harrold), can escape. The singer then falls to the doctor, the doctor slowly falls to the singer, the two say all the time and on and on and on. This is Harrold, who is breaking things and after he's been here, I'm not surprised he didn't become a star. <br /> <br /> The film has a pleasant landscape, good movies in San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the movie. I'm bored and don't remember much about the other half.
