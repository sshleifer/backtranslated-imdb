There is so much about this film that it is wrong, but in summary: a terrible act - so bad that it must have been a goal. bad script - they may have some good ideas, but it was not the best way to introduce the story. ridiculously bad end - in some cases, you can stop recording the movie, not in this case. If you manage to sit through the whole movie, you will end up defeating yourself because the end is not even worth it. This is the worst film I've seen for a long time. This movie was a complete torture, I would have appreciated someone who warns me in advance. So do yourself a favor. Watch this movie only if you have nothing better to do. Even then, you will regret putting yourself in indescribable torture.
