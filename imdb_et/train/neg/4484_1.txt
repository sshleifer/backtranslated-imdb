As soon as I started to see the poster and talk about this movie, I was excited. The matrix was incredible to see and I couldn't wait to see you, especially after I started to see it on other movies. However, when I saw it, I left the theater very disappointed, as did many other theater participants with me. Though the scenes in the movie were amazing as always, they were just too few. In the first film, there was a constant struggle that seemed to be, but the second took a lot (and much regret) of preaching. There wasn't much to wait for this plot. The machines dug Zion to destroy it (this is not a spoiler, everyone saw it in advertisements). The film's dialogue was absolutely terrible. If you aren't big psychology, you probably don't understand most of what the film says and that's why you don't care. It became a somewhat romantic film showing Neo and Trinity's life and relationships. Agent Smith, for as bad a ass as he was in the first movie, seemed to have received all the religious and preaching. Personally, I do not have to hear or pay money to listen to it. The film was a serious waste of my time and I don't think I can see the first one. The dialogue and the constant boring and dry monologue, essentially for every character, made me lose interest in the film, and a small number of good fighting mushrooms pushed me closer to the edge, and the film ended me immediately. What movie ends with "Stop"? How the original is that people. I don't know if the Wachowski brothers had to burn midnight oil to come to this. In conclusion, the film was bad and its end.
