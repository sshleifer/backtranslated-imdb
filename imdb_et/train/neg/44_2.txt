Not sure if I refer to those who stared this video nasty or to the director ... "Devil Hunter" is sure it's one of the strange "horror films". <br /> </p> Highlights such as Cannibal Ferox and Cut and Run. The chick gets into the "jungle" robbery "wild tribe". The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in Party City style costume garments for Halloween. And the savages go from white Asia to black and Spanish. I think Franco just grabbed everyone who even showed a bit of ethnicity for this romp. <br /> <br /> This film has extremely minimal gore, real fears and a lot of unnecessary penis. Not fun. I find something similar to almost any Italian or Euro trash can; it just dropped in WAY in a short time. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, kids.
