Diana Muldaur will appear in Star Trek for the second time, but this time with different character. No one seems to be on board - maybe it was hair. Regardless of the fact that this time he is not the recipient of God (see the previous episode), he is a very famous lady with magical powers that allow him to communicate and see Medusa without being crazy (standard man). Unfortunately, he is the most loving person with a few cards that are not full of deck, and he is trying to kill the Medusan ambassador (who strangely lives in small boxes - this is a bad way to travel). And, unfortunately, Muldayr is not so well wounded. What happens next is such a fool, and by the time the episode had seen it for the first time, I was quite relieved. Looking at all the men on board with ga Muluriuri was quite stupid and Spock's action, when he went crazy, was quite comb. Do yourself a favor - if you haven't seen this example before, choose another episode.
