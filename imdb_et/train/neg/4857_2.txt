I really liked ZB1. Really, I did. I have no problems with very low budget movies and I've had movies with worse product values ​​than ZB3 (if you can imagine such a thing. See "wiseguys vs zombies" if you're interested). Indeed, I prefer lower budget zombie films because I'm suspicious that Hollywood leaders don't understand what zombies are "." <br /> <br /> But ZB3 was just so bad. It was slowing down. I don't want to be dignified in my criticism. I want my 90 minutes back, etc. Except that it only took 80 minutes, because I partially passed it to 1.4X. <br /> <br /> Okay, here are some criticisms. <br /> 1. Stimulation was TERRIBLE. Everyone was talking about monologues. Even when somebody was just on one line, the work and editing of the camera and the bundles of the F-bombs in every sentence made the FEEL a monologue. At first I was excited about 90 minutes of work compared to ZB1 in 70 minutes, but there were actually fewer events in ZB3. It's all about. <br /> <br /> 2. Gore effects got the stupider. Just rub rubbing on the human stomach. <br /> <br /> 3. Despite the epic exposition, there was really no plot. And the exposure is really epic! I won't break it when you look at it. (Don't look at it.) But then it's just a set of flat characters that walk for about 80 minutes. or less if you want.
