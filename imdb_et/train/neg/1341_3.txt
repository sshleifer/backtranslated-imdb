Following the advent of (terrible) TV films from Gilligan Island, several TV films were made of classical exhibitions during the 1980s. Most of these films missed the boat as he rediscovered the humor that made the exhibitions so special. MUNSTERS'S RESULT is one of the most disappointing, because it goes from Laurel and Hardy-type comedy, which wasn't in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, the wonderful comedienne and series, is completely wasted - he has less time in this 90-minute movie when he made one 30-minute episode. And since the roles of "Eddie" and "Marilyn" in this film are nothing but cameos, what was the idea of ​​making and recasting their younger ones? With very little rewriting, they could have used Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although some of Munster's horrible relatives were seen as a nice touch, Sid Caesar, as a hammy mad scientist, didn't enjoy much because he had too many and not enough underperformers (ironically that this year, 1981, Caesar's old partner) was also cast in the comedy "Imogene Coca". wrongly big part of the television movie meeting. Another strange unexplainable bit at the beginning of the film is the Munster family represented as a wax figure in a local spooky museum. Why would they be where they should be "typical" (as weird) American family, not the famous monsters? It was the latest Munster project, which included an original role in their role, in the late 1980s a terrible revival of the series with a completely new cast and a 1990s TV film featuring DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest and Patrick's office roles. family dining room.
