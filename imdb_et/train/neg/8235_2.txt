As horror fans we all know that blind rentals are a nonsense shoot. Sometimes we find a real pearl, but many times we find that the film we just spent on our hard earned money is nothing more than a dirty steamer, which is worsened by completely unlikely rave reviews and film festival awards. This is the case with five-eye eyes (the title I am sure is a double participant who refers to both the budget of the films and the coercion that anyone follows to use all five fingers to pull their eyes out). <br /> <br /> The story, or at least what * ahem * writers are going through for one, focuses on a group of teenage girls who decide late at night after leaving the football game and leave for fun. a crazy woman who plays with them a cat and a mouse with a punishment for what she thinks girls found in their car after a fender-bender at a gas station parking lot. Some of the best horrors have a very simple story. That's the five eyes that this idea will fall. The film tries to be the work of the Blair witchcraft and its shaky camera and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which is the bare-bones approach to the material, but succeeds to be either. Instead, we get redundant chasing, torture, and release scenes instead; Torture is tortured, released, in this order, for 94 minutes, due to long spirits, weakening, and inconsistencies that work between the padding lines. <br /> <br /> The film's appearance is incredibly grainy and darker, which in a better film could have increased tension and realism. Here it is just annoying. The characters are undeveloped and the viewer is hard-pressed to find something they feel about them. One sign stops to get a first aid kit and tends to scrape off when the shootings in the background show his friends can kill. The other girl is funny to break stupid lines like "Don't go there, she'll get you when she kills you, and if she kills, you're dead". <br /> <br /> was a prize from the Fangoria magazine and Dreadcentral.com listed in the box that forced me to check it out. Talk about fake orgasm! Perhaps my expectations would have been met if it had been in the comedy section. I'm all in a low budget with Indie's horror, but it takes a toast.
