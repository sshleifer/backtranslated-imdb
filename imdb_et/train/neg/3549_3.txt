Do you like to stand? Then stay away from it ... <br /> <br /> During the early rounds, there are actually good comics, but if they don't get anything cute, they got snowballs. All controversial materials and you are OUT! ... and I think I injured as much as threw comedians when I see who the curious judges are renting. Half + finalists have given me 0 laughs. Many of them have raised their material elsewhere, something that judges do not have. <br /> <br /> It's more fun than much more on the TV, but it's incredibly hard to watch without thinking if it could have been. <br /> <br /> If manufacturers changed the name of the competition to "Last Clown Standing", all my criticism would be lost. Maybe the point?
