If you appreciate the renaissance of the Asian horror, don't worry about Gawi. The film is hardly worth mentioning with the A-list, such as the Ring, The Story of Two Sisters, Cure and Ju-On (or even such good material as the eye or the interior). These films are incredibly hidden, unexpected images, rich characters and decisively non-western scares. Gawi has been assembled with all the remnants and organs that have caused American horror in the last twenty-five years. <br /> <br /> The film is trying to mix Asian ghost story and Hollywood slip, but it's a bad fit. One aesthetic is otherwise heated; guess what? Being a story to talk to filmmakers about Ring's evil child's subplot, but the situation is hopeless. Clich√©s, jamajons, pointless drawing, boring ghost.
