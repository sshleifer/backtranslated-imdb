This is not a children's film !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is like a "bad acid trip" for children under 5 years old. For a month my 4-year-old asks me "Why was this rabbit bleeding out of mouth" or "Why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits?". (And it wasn't the worst). We stopped it in about 1/2 hour, but the damage was done. Intense ill, oppressive, violent. Fortunately, he finally forgot all the evil thing. Anyone who has decided to market this film to children needs to be raised for a fee. ... (Go to my mind, my conscience is clear.).
