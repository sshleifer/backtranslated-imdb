I'm not surprised that even cowgirls get blues when this movie is something. I was expecting something better from Uma Thurman, which was why I was the first to experience this experience. A terrible movie with music only as a redeeming quality. It's just a shame that we can't give out these reviews out of ten. This film deserves it.
