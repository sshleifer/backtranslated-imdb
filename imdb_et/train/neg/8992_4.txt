This is a decent quest, but the man who wrote the script seems to be a little dark, exactly what makes the zombie movie cool. No, it's not CGI bugs and software companies. Actually, I'm not sure if it was a software company - I saw it without any subtitles, so I had to think about what they were talking about. Anyway, it was my idea - instead of wasting my time with a bit of a fool, why not throw more zombies and more activities. 2/3 of 20 minutes consist of news messages, mistakes, some guys scream. And to make things worse (more boring), most deaths occur outside the screen. I understand that it is too common to have no budget movies, but then there were some very impressive effects (well, a-type) that left me wondering why the director (or scriptwriter, whatever) decided to focus on how The epidemic started - it's short, no one cares anyway.
