I've read every book so far in the left-hand series, and the film doesn't make them almost fair. Of course, I've seen inferior movies, but it was incredibly disappointing. This movie would have made a good MST3K episode. The script was a terrible adaptation of the book and it seemed that the actors read their lines instead of actually telling them. The characters were rigid and unlikely. The effects were cheesy and seemed terribly fake. The end was terrible. First it didn't even go through the first book. Secondly, it did not make sense. If you hadn't read the book, you have no idea what's going on. It was supposed to be the most cheesy end of film students I have ever seen in the movie. I'm upset that I actually paid for this movie. If any miracle gives this widespread release, they should completely upgrade and let Hollywood take over. These two wannabe filmmakers and the wannabe director should leave the film making to the professionals.
