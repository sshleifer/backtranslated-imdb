When the 2000s ended, the daughter of King Kong's daughter went on and announced a tearful announcement for her exhibition. <br /> <br /> Miss Winfrey's tearing, laughing and shouting like a wild Indian from the west. <br /> <br /> What does Oprah do? he takes the famous people and puts them on his show. what famous people? people who have suffered (like her, except those who have lost more than their innocence) have suffered a melted face (real story), no limbs (true story, see end of paragraph) and abusive spouse (too much that number). and somehow they come to the show and tell their story as if we had heard a ton and a ton (Bethany Hamilton, I've heard your story to lose hand sharks from the first day on October 31st, 2003. Don't tell me you But the biggest thing about Oprah was Michael Jackson's interview in 1993 when he was charged with a child molester. Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson has been gone since then. but that one particular exhibition spoke of Michael's personal life, something that many people didn't know at that time. <br /> <br /> Oprah's Real affects middle-aged women and football moms. They seem to think he is sometimes a personal Jesus. But everything I see in Oprah is a big ghetto lady who made it big and she just shows how rich she is. <br /> <br /> I'm glad his exhibitions will end soon. we need better television programs.
