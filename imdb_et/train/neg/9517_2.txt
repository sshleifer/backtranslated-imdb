Vincente Minelli's films are usually worth your while; About both St. Louis, Bad and Beautiful. Waiting for this movie with great interest. But what's disappointing. <br /> <br /> Some came to Running on the scene after somewhere in fatalism. Sinatra is a sad bag that has returned from war to find disappointing family relationships, a disappointing cozy hangover living in disappointing mines, as it convinces her to end her disappointing project. The film has a great dramatic finish, where a disappointing villain arrives with Sinatra and MacClane, and there is something disappointing. The order is for tightening, but Minelli is not Hitchcock; He is so confused with colors so that he doesn't notice that the scene is a whistling clich√© and the characters are so thin and poorly developed that we don't care particularly about shooting them. (especially MacClane) But it's the only real cinematic project. Otherwise, we will look at constipated characters who are standing around the bars and living rooms of each other's nerves within two hours. Hell is other people, probably. <br /> <br /> There's nothing in this movie. The dilemma of returning to wars and indifference after WW2's departure is dealt with in "The Best Years of Our Life". And one of the two Inge products, "Splendor in the Grass" and "Picnic", is desperate to catch a dead city with much more toxicity.
