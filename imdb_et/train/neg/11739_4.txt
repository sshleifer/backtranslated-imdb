Often, trusted Leonard Maltin says it is "a pleasant romance" and that Sanders is "excellent." Maltin has to mix this movie with something else. Sanders are slippery and sloppy and great as usual? You can imagine a line of adultery, "Sometimes marriage chains are so heavy that they have to be worn by three," but boring, wood, and dated describe this film more precisely. The story itself, with authors Sanders, who is a shining gemstone, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who becomes a police chief, but barely can resist fine jewelry, is fun, but it has the same hollow historical Hollywood treatment that damaged periods like Marie Antoinette * and definitely regrettable * Forever Amber * (which screams for a stylish remake). Although Sanders is trying to add his character to his defense, it's all empty. I am an unforgettable fan of Douglas Sirk, but it is 1946, and it is one of Sirk's earliest American efforts, lacking many signatures to define his delicate, breastfeeding potboilers. The circus gets wet feet here and made several unsatisfactory films over the next ten years until he captures the golden grandiose * and hit his step by bombing us with estrogen competitions like * Everything in the sky *, * Wrote the wind * and * Life imitation *. But * The scandal in Paris * is hardly his best job? a relatively small budget item with cheese tools and ineffective costume.
