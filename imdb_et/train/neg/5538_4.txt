This is not really a zombie movie when we define zombies as the dead walk. Here, the protagonist Armand Louque (playing incredibly young Dean Jagger) controls the method of creating zombies, although in fact his "method" is mentally designing his thoughts and guiding the thoughts of other living people into hypnotized slaves. This is an interesting film concept and was done much more effectively by Fritz Lang's dr. Mabus Movies, Including Dr. Mabuse Gambler '(1922) and "Dr. Mabuse Testament" (1933). Here, unfortunately, is subjected to his quest to restore his former fiancé love, Claire Duvall (played by Anne Heche looks like a bad hairstyle, Dorothy Stone), which is really the main subject. <br /> <br /> The movie's start is intriguing, as Louque is sent to the military archaeological expedition to Cambodia to stop the zombies from there. For certain types of compounds (where we get big 30s sets and clothes), he announces his involvement with Claire, and then barely five minutes later, he returns to his circle, proclaiming his love for his ball Clifford Greyson (Robert Noland). It is inadvertently funny as they talk to each other without getting into the eye. It would have been a great movie for the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" if they didn't have it yet. <br /> <br /> It has never shown how Louque actually learns about the "zombie" secret, but then uses it to kill her enemies, create a giant army that carries soldiers and bodyguards. We do not see the willpower until John Agar is "The Brain From Planet Arous" (1957). <br /> <br /> Finally, Claire agrees to marry when she lets Greyson live and return to America. Louque agrees, but in fact he makes one of his hypnotized slaves. In the evening, he understands that Claire will only love her if she gives up her powers. In order to gain his love, he does so by causing the title "rebellion" where all his slaves wake up and attack his compound and kill him. Greyson encompasses Claire and we see at the end of the parable: "To whom the gods are destroyed, they shall first be mad." <br /> <br /> So, in fact, it's not so bad for the film, even though IMDb's rating is currently low. Watching repeatedly (?) We see the artistry of a well-formed script! Dean Jagger didn't have a good actor yet and it's almost unknown in his youth - is it really his own hair? We remember him more for his bald, old men's roles in "White Christmas" (1954), "X The Unknown" (1956), and "King Creole" (1958). The story borrows much of his main topics from Halperin's brothers better, from his earlier film "White Zombie" (1932), where the unhappy Robert Frazier (like Charles Beaumont) uses "zombie" to win Madge Bellamy's (like Madeline Parker's) love <br /> > If you want real zombie films (of which there are hundreds!), I'd like to start "White Zombie" (1932), "King of Zombies" (1941), "I walked with Zombie" (1943), "Night of the Living Dead" (1968), "Last man on earth ”(1964) and its two repairs. In the modern era of modern films, Horror Express (1972), Serpent and the Rainbow (1988), 28 Days Later (2002) and its sequel, as well as many others, others. much to mention. <br /> <br /> This is not really a zombie movie. Judging by this film on its own terms, it is rather a semi-Gothic romance. As such, it is slightly below some of the 30's late and early 40's B horror movies. So I'll give him 5.
