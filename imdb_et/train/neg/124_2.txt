This film was probably inspired by Godardi Masculin, a feminine and I invite you to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has two strong elements and (1) are realistic (2) impressive, unwanted good, photo. Moreover, what strikes me the most is the endless stream of stupidity. Lena Nyman must be the world's worst actor. He's acting so stupid and all nudity in this movie ... it's not attractive. Compared to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced by stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that this is due to differences between French and Swedish society. <br /> <br /> The time and place of the movie. 2/10.
