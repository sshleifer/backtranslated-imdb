A different look at horror. The style differences between American and Russian films are interesting. But from my American point of view, this film was not so good. The main thing, Marie, played by Anastasia Hille was not a pleasant character and it was hard for me to find her. He was in most cases unpleasant and confused about how much time he had left. It took too much time to bring the movie to its main location. It took a long time before a real break occurred. When that happened, it seemed that the main effect was the volume that was more annoying than anything else. The concept was more original than most direct video films and they didn't use sex to make up for a thin plot. All in all, I recommend renting it, but not for theater visitors.
