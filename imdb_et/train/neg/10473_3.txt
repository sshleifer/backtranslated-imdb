I went to see the Omega code with other Christians with a total of about 15 people. We all waited for a good Christian movie. What we had was an agonizing, painful, drawn and quite boring experiment with the film. It has good-looking product values, but it also has a bad behavior, a weak script with an uncertain dialogue and no real direction. In the first 15 minutes we knew it would be a long night. We all hated it and some of our group's people put this movie more than Anaconda. No one of us could believe that the film lasted less than 2 hours. Twilight effects and crisp looking cinematography can't save this bad, bad movie. I'd give it to 3 out of 10 and the rating is just that high because I rented this movie the night before I saw this movie.
