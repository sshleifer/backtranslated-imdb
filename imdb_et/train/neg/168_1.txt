Despite a good first season, this series never came to realize its potential. The prequel of the original "Star Trek" series was appointed from the very beginning by the leading producer Rick Berman, who felt compelled to artificially limit and narrow the definition of "Star Trek". this futuristic indication is more and more anachronistic from a dramatic point of view). The actual show-runner, Brannon Braga, did not motivate his previous neglect of the Trek episode and the franchise's inner mythology (it was painfully obvious that he was just a jump in salary). I've never seen a series that so consistently served talented actors (except Jolene Blaylock) for so long. It is this entire series produced in a bubble that exists outside the modern television landscape, where the audience (even the audience of Trekker) is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic desires and desires. Unfortunately, it seems that Berman and Braga have succeeded in convincing Paramount's top companies that "Enterprise" suffered from "franchise fatigue" and that its main audience was not walking, but was driving away. Create a high-quality offer that meets the high ideals and standards of your predecessors and comes (audience). <br /> <br /> Simply put, the TeeVee universe where we are given is shown as "Battlestar: Galactica" and "The Shield", which must be, to give the audience a "Star Trek" that measures and is dramatically competitive. It's just that simple and simple.
