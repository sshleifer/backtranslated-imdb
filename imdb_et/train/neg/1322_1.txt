.... because when I was, I would have liked me to cross a wooden cross! I'm still trying to identify the plot of this movie - and I'm "generous" that there was even a plot in the beginning. As mentioned earlier, this is the DVD that Richard Dreyfuss really is. He was barely in the movie. And when he was really "frustrated" when the back cover showed he was, it is probably because he said YES that he would be in the catastrophe of this movie and didn't get out of it! The film really focused on Jared Martin, and what his role in the film, except for the extreme ones, was not that big a secret Gene Barry's role was - or was not. And when he spoke of "big" ... who had a clear idea of ​​matching Gene Barry in Humpty Dumpty's clothing, which showed his pants literally to his chin, heavy time should be punished by looking at the film's stones. I could go on and on how scary this film was from the dialogue that did not correspond to the "actors" mouth (think Clutch Cargo), to skipping the scene from scene to scene (again, being generous even when calling picture frames) ") when there are no plots ... If you are a bad genre of the early 70s and if you are a Michigan cottage with nothing but a movie and a box for kids and cats, we recommend a good bottle of wine before you start this movie, because you're grateful that you can't remember do it the next day!
