Did anyone stop to understand what kind of movie they're producing here? Now we get a former sailor in a cadet school for a group of children, so it should be a family comedy? Wrong. It's just a tough comedy for teenagers who have a lot of bad taste moments. Maybe it would be very quiet at the moment, but I found Damon Wayans' voice anxious. Does he talk like in real life? If he does, he will have my compassion, but he will not get his money for watching his films
