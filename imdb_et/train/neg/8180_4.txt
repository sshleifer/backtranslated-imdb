The reason why the DVD discs of this movie are black and white is that nobody can get the color printing of these public films, at best on a modest seagull. <br /> <br /> Distributed via Television Allied Artists, DVDs (or VHS), which are on the market for this title, come from the same 16MM television print. Films distributed to television before 1963 were often divided into b / w prints, as most viewers had no color sets anyway. It was also cheaper for b / w prints printed on television because often there were quite a few prints to cover all the stations that use the film on syndicates.
