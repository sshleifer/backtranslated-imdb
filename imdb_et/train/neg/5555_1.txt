Normally I am very bad as low-budget gonzo movies, but Darkman III is so amazingly relaxed that I know something but I despise it. <br /> <br /> It seems to be a TV show and especially a dirty one on it. The sets are small, the lighting is flat, the score and the effects are scattered and the camera work is film school 101. There is no plot to talk about, the characters are one-dimensional and the actors are sleepwalkers. Most look like they should do soft core porn. In fact, the only prize I got from this confusion was that he was attacked by a striking bow to Roxann Biggs-Dawson (B'Elanna Star Trek: Voyager) without his Klingon conical head makeup. His skin tone is about two shades lighter than Voyager; whether it is bleached for this role or black for Voyager. A very strange way.
