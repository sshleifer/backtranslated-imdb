Ah yes, the VS series, MVC2 is the tip. This has been said before, that's what you get when half of the team is sleeping at the workplace, unfortunately a semi-game. Don't get me wrong, it's fun, but you get tired of the machine buttons. As for the plot summary, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA ... There is no plot. Beat this guy at the end and win! Eh, who will play it anyway?
