This is definitely the worst film I've ever seen and perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The actors and actors were terrible and seemed to be trying too hard to play their roles, tough boys, jerks, know it all, and so on. And the bigfoot itself was terrible. From Atari & Intellivision's days, it seemed like a computer-generated image. At the end of the movie, when the sasquatchide army was sought after by the remaining survivors, one shot came, and when it was working, it seemed like a poor man's donkey version of the cone! And one gets hit the ball and the blood that comes out of it was just a terrible animation. Another thing that was annoying was music. Too much music (classic score or whatever you call it) throughout the movie. It was never finished. Oh yes, the film is also boring. Absolutely one of the worst films I've ever seen. I recommend taking your $ 3 or whatever they rent this movie and spend it in the gallon gas or value menu somewhere. TRANSLATE ONLY ATTENTION!
