...... this movie is quite terrible, the only thing that keeps me from giving this rating is that unfortunately I have seen it worse. <br /> <br /> Jungle music, jigsaw demons and fluorescent UV-style blood / teeth / eyes give this "terrible" look and the script is terrible ..... this movie is an attempt to see how long you you can opt out before. It is also predictable, but not good. Nothing in this movie is good. I looked at it 10 minutes ago and thought I'd like to be there a bit. (oh and the actress won't let the movie down, it's terrible)
