Well, I just ordered it for my home because I was bored and needed a laugh. I have to admit that I smiled a few times, but I don't even remember what parts they were. I don't understand why this movie is made. It claims to be a comedy, but seriously, I can't find a song in a penis or a naked 70-year-old woman very funny. This movie tried to fit into the "gross picture" comedies of recent years, such as American Pie and Road Trip, but it just failed. It was a way to get out, it was comedy. Also, why on earth did Cameron Diaz name his name on this film?!?! The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I thought it was sexy and enjoyable and well done. In addition, avoid this movie. 3/10
