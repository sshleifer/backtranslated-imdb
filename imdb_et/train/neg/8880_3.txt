This movie was in o.k. but it could have been much better. There are some terrible moments, but they are not enough to ever see this movie again. There are some scenes that you can move forward quickly and leave nothing left. The biggest mistake is that it is so predictable, and that's why I rated it so low. It is traceable but does not expect anything big.
