Mark every crazy scientist everywhere: if you are going to convert your son into a genetically modified monster, you must give him more than "Paul." I don't care if he's a scary hammer with deer-punctures and we can lurk in water and on dry land. Give a child a more worthy name like "Thor", "Rock" or "Tiburon". Because even if he eats me, I'll probably just laugh, "Ha! Get this load! Paul Monster hangs on me for breaking !!!!!" This is the worst part of this film, this shark thing is called "Paul" throughout Paul. That's what might have been a decent, scary horror movie just to seem silly. Not that "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy." Scientists spend the whole movie on this island and suddenly one girl starts to walk in the lush forest walking from the heart and just has to pour water on her feet to restore the itch, which of course allows "Paul" to come out of the water and kill. One thing SciFI Channel did in this film was that the hottie lived. But this is a small silver lining otherwise disappointing.
