It must be the most stupid movie I've ever seen! First, the plot is stupid. The little boy is strange and they move to the hotel because his father is the carer. We find that the child has a gift, "Shining." This gift has nothing to do with anything except that the child feels cool. Then the movie gets boring and boring until the man finally gets crazy. He's going to rampage to kill the boy and his wife because ... he knows it. Why else would he do that? Suddenly we see a naked woman in the bath. The man kisses him and understands that he is capable of a dead body that is completely disgusting. In some way, a black man who is an ax enters the hotel. Then the child and the woman take the black man's vehicle and leave the father who dies within a minute after the hypothermia. Most movies are not a complete waste of time, but it falls into this category. The music is trashy, the characters are dirty (except Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot is twisted and suited to the description of vomiting, the end is very predictable, the story is slow, annoying and boring. This movie is overpriced. ALL COSTS OF THIS MOVIE. I'm surprised that IMDb has such a high rating.
