Historical inaccuracies can be addressed, but this film was too much. Practically nothing was near the truth, and even for the era it was considered foolish. <br /> <br /> Ford's defense revealed that the old man said he was working on a story like Wyatt Earp knew who was probably old, senile and played his scene. Earp talked to the director about stagecoach and how he planned to happen at the time of the arrival of stagecoach, so, despite other historians, Wyat himself says it was cautious. <br /> <br /> This film depicts Earp's honest man and his brothers. History does not say exactly that they were or were not. Most people want to confuse their character with a little bit of fraud and lawlessness, but that is nothing new. The truth is probably closer to them than the legal GUNFIGHT types. Men who saw this career and believe me in the old western part of the world didn't have enough time to think too much. <br /> <br /> There are no signs available. the one who did not really do all this for a weaker film. It is further weakened by the mature, who really did not give convincing Doc. He may be the worst choice for Doc, but at the same time we must remember that older films were closer to the era and closer to knowing the truth. After all, Ford got information for the first time from Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> This is also weakened by all such predictable events involving a Mexican girl. These days, Hollywood was very Nazi and ready to kill the Brunette women to show their patronage to Hitler's idealism. It takes place in most films up to the eighties. This is not an excuse, but it is cheap with art. <br /> <br /> Earps play well and Brennan is always thrilled. In fact, Mature can be the only downside to this flick. However, it is the weakest of the older OK Corral films.
