Josh Hartnet's dead eyes, its thick writing and Harrison Ford's friend-comedy comedy! Here are three reasons to hate, prevent it, and use the 116-minute life better. <br /> <br /> Friends of the Night is fun. But their real golden age was back in the 1980s and 1990s. Making an attempt to mix action and comedy through the Hollywood police is sure to be a good idea, but its end result did not prove to be at least an attack on the sub-family, but a reason to ask God for mercy on all the same films, while the worst of them was greater by all means ( Hollywood killing). <br /> <br /> What really happened to this entertainment formula? Things were not the same for the whole decade. You would have another friend-stubborn flop. I rejoice in some of the headlines that are trying to catch the catastrophe well: (I Spy - 2002), (National Security - 2003), (Taxi - 2004), (Starsky & Hutch - 2004), and the worst of them all. (Miami Vice President - 2006)! I believe that one of the reasons is the natural saturation of many similar cinematic valves and TV shows for twenty years. Add it, especially here, to careless handling and dull humor. In fact, this thing is totally unbearable this time. Yes, we have two loyal police who have a second job, and a sinister city, but what else was new! It's not a cliché; it is about some innovations mixed clichés where both are badly done. <br /> <br /> The actors, especially from (Hartnetti), are terrible. This man is something other than a comedian (or actor!). So his character wanted revenge for his father's death! Revenge for Himself, He Died Obviously From His Behavior! Even the small roles got people who have nothing to do with comedy (or what they felt here anyway!). <br /> <br /> Leadership does not present anything comical or karma, some parts were very dull (arresting because of the absence of a black boy ??); It's a rare time to be bored of what should be action / comedy! They did not use Hollywood themselves, either as an ironic place with a ugly face behind a superficial charm, or even as a place full of bright or fallen stars (camels that would have given him some interesting moments). > <br /> This is a very simple movie that can only be viewed by its star glamor and is a Buddy-cop film, one of the worst cases when there are two non-chemicals on the screen. One of them is not the chemistry itself with the screen! Guess who ?!) and Buddy-Cop fighter more than a movie! God, don't do me or my kids to witness enough (Hollywood part 2)! Finally, look at Harrison Ford's performance, he wanted a good time, but at least we didn't.
