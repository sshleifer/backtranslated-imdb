Do you get this itch that just kill an hour or two and watch the movie so badly that it is justified? When I rent a movie, I see the art of this box on the weekend and I see T-Rex. Knowing that the package dinosaur was from Jurassic Park to T-Rex, I just had to rent it because I was in a bad movie mood. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed by the low scientists, the secret formulas, the company that is more concerned about their wealth and shareholders than life, and of course the big, poorly animated shock-doll T-Rex. Is it through us through the film, were there scenes that were clearly connected to other movies? Rox's hungry is never happy ... ever. How he's hungry is farther away from me because he doesn't really have a throat (really, when you look down at his mouth when he roars, it's solid ... like a toy or something). Now, from time to time, I like to watch incredibly bad B-movies because it reminds me of how much better the blocking game is. It was fun. I'm not even sure if it was to be a thriller or comedy because there are scenes that don't make a mistake, laugh. <br /> <br /> Do I blame the movie budget ... yes, but I didn't act either. Okay, Tony Todd was actually pretty good, as with some women's roles ... when you cry, shouldn't "tears" come out? Meh, I'm not going to be angry with this movie, I knew what I got and if you were looking for a bad movie with your friends, here's what I recommend: check out this movie, check out Jurassic Park and then the lost world. You are writing Mr Spielberg today the next day.
