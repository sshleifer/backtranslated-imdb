The end of the world is an uneven film that is strange because it should be about complete destruction of the earth. The main character is a scientist, I'm not sure what. He has two jobs in the government (?) Facility, guarded by four security guards. His first job is to track transfers into and out of space (although this seems to be a hobby as he works when he does not work in job 2). Work # 2 requires that she put on protective clothing and go into a dark room ... at least what I see best. Apparently, the "plant" is not exactly secret because the scientist brings his wife there. He hangs out (they are on their way to dinner) when he discovers a message from space: Major Earth Disruption, which is repeated over and over again. He says something about this is the first message from space he has ever been able to decipher; her husband tells her they will be late for dinner. So they leave and go to the party (!?!). A moment later, he finds that China has suffered a major earthquake. That's where the movie goes ... nowhere! Yes, Christopher Lee is in it, but it doesn't help much. Besides, Lee gives a weak presentation in his appearance in Howling II. This movie is boring, but it has enough stupid elements that you could suffer if you like Christopher Lee or Z-class science fiction. Plus, there is a lot of stock footage land destroyed.
