This movie is in the history of F.B.I when Knott's Berry Farm is an old west. The sham disinfected version of the federal investigation office fights crime. Hoover's heavy hand (did he have any other kind?) Shows a collection with a high-quality script reader, a cheese set, cheap sound effects and lighting 101. With Jimmy Stewart's 20% dramatic power, Vera Miles chews in the mid-fifties a c-listerit with nervous irony or humor, the "jungle jungle" to the "backyard grill", everything from phases of sound and back. Even the shocks are conserved and familiar. I think Mervyn Leroy drunk every night. With the exception of some (very few) interesting external images, there is nothing much farther here.
