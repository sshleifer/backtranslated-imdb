The movie starts with a nice song Looks like a thriller, where Arbaaz Khan is walking suspiciously, but then maybe we are forced to do comedy. With foolish idiots like GOLMA along with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal as grown-up children Their scenes are first and foremost funny and then they get bored. The murder of Tanushree's brother is boring. After all, the movie is trying seriously about the hero who kidnaps our heroes, but here it even becomes stupid. From HERA PHERI and wait, there is a long Paya behind the house <br /> <br /> The movie is so boring that it makes you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Priyan's direction is very bad music (Pritam) is routine, except for the first song <br /> <br /> Cinematography is bad, the film has a cheap look <br /> <br /> Rajpal Yadav is good in his first scene, where he pays his rent and I was glad that the actor is neither loud nor like other movies, but no, he becomes his usual self and irritates most of the times when Tusshar shouldn't talk in the film, his calling is terrible Sharman is a sustainable arm, He is the only actor who works very well in this film Kunal Khemmu in his first comic film as an adult, but does not impress Tanushree is bad, as always Arbaaz Khan remains less and is usual Payal is not actress Murli Sharma is terrible
