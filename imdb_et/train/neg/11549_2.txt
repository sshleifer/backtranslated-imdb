Although there were some interesting moments, I thought this film was pretty flat. The longer it ran, the worse. After being in the Monument Valley, I found myself more than remarkably stupid and convincing interactions with the notable drops. <br /> <br /> The daughter's character was particularly inconsistent. First he's engaged, then he discovers the truth and he strikes. Then he is back again, then dessert them again. Then he's back. His decisions are clearly not motivated. There were interesting signs, interesting scenes and many missed opportunities. I have to say that the pictures were much smaller than the sum of their parts. Apparently people like Repo liked people like that. Searchers 2.0 is not suitable for searches.
