If you're a story of the early Baroque painter Artemisia Gentilesch, you are disappointed, but once you have a bodice with a reasonable design that has an art theme, you've found you're a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is such an inaccurately inaccurate description of Artemisia Gentilesch's life that almost made me cry. (Enter Artemisia's inaccuracies on Google and look at some facts and fictional articles.) From a purely technical point of view, the film was fine: kits, costumes, and especially the lighting of the chiaroscuro, helped create the experience of the early 17th century; although the above-mentioned FACIAL FACIAL INACTIVITIES let down a little. <br /> <br /> I don't know how director / co-author Agn√®s Merlet defended his film at that time? Perhaps he refused to portray Artemisia as a victim, which would have been unfortunate because he would face him.
