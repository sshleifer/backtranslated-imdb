Like Orson Welles, thirty years earlier, Mike Sarne was given the "biggest train in the world" to play, but unfortunately he had no way of doing more than seeing his train set become a train cell, which is still spoken of and strange. In spite of postmodern interpretations that aim to somehow see it as homo or feminist, it is a major disaster in 1970, and today it is one. so the royal remains a mystery. Only Michael Cimino has ever reached the political and artistic Armageddon, which is the "gate of heaven". Both films seemed to be ego trips to their leaders, but at least Mr Cimino had made one of the great films of the 1970s before destroying the size of the studio, while Mr Sarne was just as bad "Joanna" in his dress. What's more, "Heaven's Gate" can show off some memorable and well-handled devices, where the tragically "Myra Breckinridge" cabinet was empty. Simply put, it is by far the worst example of biting the hand that feeds Hollywood history.
