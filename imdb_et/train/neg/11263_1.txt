Shame, shame that such a beautiful actor like Joseph Fiennes would allow himself to lie in this nausea knee. The film was not only bad but better terrifying and without redeeming quality. Plot (there was one?) It seemed that he didn't go where. The Russians played the stupid kill or killed the games and the rest of the cast must be declared void for their pathetic performances. I gave up about 3/4 of the way and turned it off. "1" terribly just because there is nothing lower. Don't waste your time on it, you won't miss anything.
