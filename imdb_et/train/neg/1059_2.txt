I watched this movie last night and I already try to remember a lot about it. The story speaks of a group of criminals fleeing from the cosmic colony of space. They drive towards the moon in a space-based trash carrier; when they are there, they terrorize the men of the trash bin at Moonbase. . Why I have no idea. But I can be sure that such films are always horrible. This is not really an exception. It starts quite well with a decent credit sequence and a half-time dance music soundtrack. It then degenerates into a boring sci-fi thriller. With so few consequences in the film, I literally struggle to write a useful review, so when you read it, I apologize for not being able to enlighten the nuances and nuances of the film. I remember that I remember the annoying number of bad, annoying heaps, some nuclear warheads and the naked woman's hologram. Besides, I'm in trouble. <br /> <br /> If you feel you might be interested in the actions of corpse men, I wouldn't recommend this movie. I also recommend it to those who want to sleep with their friends and steal their wallets.
