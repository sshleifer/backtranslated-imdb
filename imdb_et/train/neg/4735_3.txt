It cannot be denied that the first Azum movie was a commercial product; it was the adaptation of the popular manga and the casting of young, attractive actors, and certainly the absence of the budget department. But it is more than entertainment for what he was, and I cannot deny that I enjoyed it enormously. <br /> <br /> "Azumi 2" has almost nothing that made the original so wonderful. The first thing that should make the alarm clocks sound is the lack of excellent Ryuhei Kitamura in the wheel. He seemed to take not only his visual beauty and kinetics, but also the style, beauty and, most importantly, his heart. Though the first had a simple "plot" plot, it has a story of corkscrew and too many boring signs that destroy each other so many times as sympathy or the possibility of sin. The actual interaction between the wires is past; Azumi and his cohorts are often very dirty teenagers at the forest. Characterization does not exist; if someone really looks at who lives and who dies, then I'm shocked. The same goes for the villains. The final battle - in fact all battles - is completely without any tension. The fact that they are poorly choreographic and abyssically oriented - not to mention a few and farther - has left them aside because of their nonsense. The villains themselves are trying too hard to be campy, and even if they're all combined, they're not part of the country's mile Pete Burnsian antics Jo Odagiri's original. <br /> <br /> ## ## Major Spoiler at the End of the Section! ##### <br /> <br /> Aya Ueto tries her best, and she managed to keep her hair in good condition between the films. Azumi is now a full-fledged assassin, which means he can move his sword slowly; unfortunately, this character has been entered by a man with a style who does not have a style, and the appearance of the Ueto model becomes even more inappropriate. I know it should be a point, but with all the other ineffectiveness of the film, the plot's foolishness and the general failure of the film means that its character at this time is absolutely impossible to get. The less you talked about Chiaki: "Remember me from Kill Bill," the better; it is enough to say that his "turn" from good to evil is about as small as napalm. <br /> <br /> In general, it was just a colossal disappointment. All the advantages on the first film are ten times better. Lazy, dissatisfied - and generally boring - confusion.
