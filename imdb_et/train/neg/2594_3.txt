Although this is an R-rated film, I really doubt you really enjoy it if you are not a teenager. Why? Because there is no real plot of land, no character development, no funny jokes. <br /> <br /> The only thing this film has is nudity. Tones and tons of naked or almost nude chicks (pretty nice, which I could add) to feast your eyes. <br /> <br /> I really do not understand why this film has an American Pie title, because it is only bad in combination with the erotic film and comedy without having succeeded either. <br /> <br /> My recommendation is to watch this movie only if you want to see bare chicks, but you're too shy to rent / buy an erotic movie. <br /> <br /> Giving it 1/10 of the 2 smiles I had in the movie and 2/10 of the nice chicks
