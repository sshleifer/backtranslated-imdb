Robert Carmichael's big ecstasy is any bad movie. The script, the harsh pace, the lack of depth in any character, the senseless sub-lines, the terrible action, the unnecessary culmination all make it the worst movie I've ever seen. I didn't find anything pleasant, comfortable, or intellectually stimulating. <br /> <br /> I think filmmakers thought they were doing something smart and dark, in their moody light, long-lasting silence and vaguely classic soundtrack. If so, they failed. It missed me and I wish I never watched it. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
