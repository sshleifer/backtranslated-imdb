One more insult and hit face gay men everywhere. This flat test comedy has nothing to suggest. Again, we have an attractive "straight" hero who allegedly can't attract any women. Yeah, of course! And we have also been presented with a "sympathetic, attractive" gay friend who is actually greasy, bald, ugly old man to whom lead should be attractive. Even I didn't find him attractive and I'm greasy, ugly old gay (but luckily not bald)! Whatever the talent here is, the bad script and the really terrible direction. Mr. Sneedeker should be banned from film games, but then he does not differ from how many cages in Hollyweed.
