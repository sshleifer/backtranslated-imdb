This is the worst ripoff of Home Alone movies I've seen! See Parts 1 and 2, but don't let anyone say it's better than the first two! I mean, really, you don't make a movie, follow the next characters and actors, and then follow up with the following characters and actors! I think it would have been OK if it wasn't a "Home alone" movie, but they made it into a home movie. Culkin is now too old, so you think you will continue to come! Goodness, this movie makes me SICK! Buy Parts 1 and 2.
