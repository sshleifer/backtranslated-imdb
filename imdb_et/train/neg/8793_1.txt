For those who decide whether to watch this movie or not and read these comments, I will first say these four words: don't waste your time! The "Chungking Express" was filmed, quickly beaten and seems to be a wholly imaginable person standing for the king of the Hong Kong burger. I never remember that watching a movie with a choice of one-dimensional characters, trying this way through a daily script! This is an absurd effort with a philosophically ridiculous dialogue (a man travels into his flooded apartment and offers a revelatory revelation that tears can be dried with tissue, but water takes time.) The same character is seen by deep, meaningful rapping, towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, etc. Dirty, wandering, hand-held camera work was another annoying feature that I could have done without, and if it's not enough to dress you up in popcorn, we'll hear Mama and Papas' 60s old California Dreaming, blaring over Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through his Rolling Thunder Productions company, although I can't figure out why his talented man would bother him. was known to have said, "I'm happy to love the movie so much." Many of us, however, hope that he will focus on making his audience more peaceful with more valuable future discoveries.
