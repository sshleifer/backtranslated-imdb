The man discovers that his parents were part of the nuclear test in the 50s and that he now has the right ... to penetrate into the flames! <br /> <br /> I was really ready for this movie, led by a big Toby Hooper and staring wild card Brad Dourif. Unfortunately, it didn't rise above the average individual with violent power. Spontaneous combustion has an interesting premise behind it, unfortunately it never seems to fulfill its potential and extends its plot too much. The special effects are not bad and help to bring the film to the finals. <br /> <br /> Cast is not bad, Dourif steals the show. <br /> <br /> All around, classic, but it's not the worst. <br /> <br /> ** Off ****
