I had several problems with the film: <br /> <br /> (1) Scenario - more specifically, the voice of Kim Basinger: Movies are not books; they should show * activity, not voice over * tell us what's going on. Sometimes I find a movie that has a voice that works, but here it seemed more lazy to write the script. In fact, it seemed to me that he read the news from the novel practically with his voice. Carter was very bad. This is a significant failure for me to define Jessie and Thomas' characters - there is no connection between them, it seemed to me that he just wanted a plaque and that he was sexually free. If it were done properly, the relationship between them would be much more of a story. <br /> <br /> (3) With the book I realized the Jessie crisis of life. In the film, it seemed just like ordinary boredom. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I didn't think the movie was so bad that I turned off the TV. . . although that thought happened to me.
