I hate this movie. I hate the show. I hate it all. it's so annoying and stupid. Everyone says nat and alex wolff are heroes in the music world and they make it big. WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR NAMES? ?? !!!?!?!?!?! nat and alex will end in hobbies or eventually as Jane Hudson "What happened to Baby Jane?" I can only get through that time in just 20 minutes, barely 30 seconds, and I managed to survive about half an hour of the band's battle. How could anyone delight the public with their boys at the Kid's Choice Awards, I have no idea. days before the premiere of the film Nick showed most of Nick's (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) actresses of teenage girls who are commercially affected by dead brain, how fantastic nat and alex wolff are. First, they don't deceive me, and secondly, nat and alex are likely to have stunned them, or paid them a lot of money to say and convince them because I don't see how anyone could find this exhibition. movie fun. music is just terrible. singing nat sounds like a sick, dying moose. alex is the most annoying movie / TV show EVER. she's not funny, she's annoying, she's really weird and she thinks she's hot and knows everything about girls. this guy is happy if he can ever put on. you know this exhibition is fake if you discover that some characters (in real life) don't even exist! the character Jesse actually plays Nat and Alex's cousin Jesse Draper (they have had a budget problem). Their father is not one-time, he's married to Polly Draper, but he doesn't show up for the show, so it seems that Wolff is mother-less. Rosalina does not exist. His name is Allie DiMeco. I say that naked brothers are going to stay deep ** when their "fans" all the stuff is staged. 0/10
