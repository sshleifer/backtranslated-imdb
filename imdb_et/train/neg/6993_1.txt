What a terrible movie. I can't believe I wasted 90 minutes of life looking at it again. Please tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer celebrated this movie? Men Pfifer is a great E.R and Ving Rhames doesn't know what he's doing. I feel terrible for them. In the background of the music I have to say, the story with ALLLLL did not fit and it is amazing how to find the leaders who have absolutely no life well and a balanced film. I hope that in the future no one will be as terrible as it was, such a big classic film. This movie shouldn't have been presented. Advise anyone who has seen it to tell me I am right because I couldn't be the only viewer who didn't enjoy it. <br /> <br /> BOOOOOO !!!!!!!! 10 out of 10
