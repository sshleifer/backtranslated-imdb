Hilariously obvious "drama" about a bunch of high school (I think) kids who enjoy non-stop hip-hop, break dancing, graffiti and trying to get a dj at Roxy - or something. To be absolutely honest, I was so bored, forgot! Even people who love music agree to act horribly with this film and - if drama - failed. We should find these kids nice and nice. I found them happy and boring. What I really hated was Ramon. He makes graffiti on subway trains and it is considered so big. Excuse me? It protects public property that is not at its beginning. These "big" children also use the city electricity to get a big dance party in an abandoned building. Uh ah. So we should find love and fun that would be pleasant and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I can forgive everyone if the music was good, but I can't stand hip hop. The songs were - at best - mediocre and they were endless! They always play! This reached the point that I was quickly through many endless music numbers. (Cut out the music and get a 30-minute movie - maybe) There are few creative numbers - subway dancing, a really funny Santa number and Roxy. If you love hip-hop, it's your movie. But you are looking for a good drama that is mixed - forget it. How did this PG rating get? That's an amazing amount.
