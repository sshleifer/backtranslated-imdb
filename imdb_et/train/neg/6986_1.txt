I can't exclude Al Pacino. I look at him Godfather, Scarface, Carlito's Way, and I think I look at one of the biggest actors of the last 30 years. Then I see him in two cash, any Sunday and revolution, and I don't know what the man thinks. hours. Here's the news: do you want to tell the prisoners? Force them to watch it over and over again ... they admit something. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to play the plot again because there is no single plot, but it's going to be the American Revolution, and Pacino plays an uneducated peasant who doesn't want to participate, but finally does it. Although he has no money, education or dress like a cave man, he is very fond of Natasha Kinski, who has only two minutes of dialogue. <br /> <br /> Frankly, when Al Smith celebrated "Al Pacino" in this movie, he would have destroyed his career. The script was terrible, but Pacino's demotivated performance and obvious fake content made it even worse. Donald Sutherland's role was ridiculous. I really can't describe it. Natasha Kinski is the main character, but the film has 5 lines. In fact, nobody talks much in this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most ridiculous assumptions in the film is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this unpleasant skill to get on each other on the battlefield. It's like the whole Northeast is Starbucks. "Hey, funny to see you here again, on another battlefield 100 miles away ... we'll see you in a few months." here for a negative result.
