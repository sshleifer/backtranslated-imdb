What was the purpose of this movie? I suggest that it was a handful of participants and their manufacturers and directors who do not pay anything. Even my favorite actor, Bruce Dern, was not interested in my boring film. The Braindead ex-pugist comes to a strange woman and her relatives. He starts as a fixative man for a woman and strikes a man to beat and abduct a kidnapping scheme. It was so confusing that I couldn't even write proper criticism. If you see it, my sweet, make sure it's after dark so you can sleep.
