The title above is used to introduce "Gen" to your audience. Gen is about a young doctor (Doga Rutkay) with a sick mother. The film begins with her mother to start her new job. Although he is driving, we realize that he is not as close to home as the hospital is far away. As soon as he enters the hospital garden, he sees the body of the patient. This is the beginning of the nightmare of the next few days. <br /> <br /> Two police officers come to the hospital to investigate suicide. In fact, they have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather. All their relations with the outside world are also cut off. There is no way out! In those few days, more nasty murders occur. Now everyone is questioning each other. <br /> <br /> I think the idea is great. It could have been very scary. Of course, there are positive aspects of the film. I like the beginning of the movie. Especially when he goes to the hospital and his first moments to the hospital. The operations are fine. Some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary. I think the final shock should have gone through the film. I say it was a good twist, but instead of showing it as a parody, we should have realized that it was coming when we see what was going on. The director had to explain it at all, which I think is not working well. The film's most dangerous patient should also be at least 48 years old, but his body looks so young and suits someone who spends most of his life in this hospital. Finally, I would like to say a few things about the Director. I'm sure he's getting better. It's his first attempt. I recently found that she is only 21 years old. This made me feel more positive about myself and her future films. However, I do not intend to evaluate this film *****.
