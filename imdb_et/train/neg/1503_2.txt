it's incredible! Fijian (who was also a spiritist) was one of the world's cheapest directors. This movie stole Leone's "Duck you sucker!" but talk about the boring story of Pinkerton's representative against the killer "Testa di Ferro" (unlikely Gunton Mitchell, stuntman). All are poor and crazy in this pelicula, which is filmed in Lazio's expensive landscapes. The story is bad and crazy at the same time. Fidani was not able and ingenuos at the same time. The story happened with some sort of crazy illogical thing (like a discussion in the sheriff's house and Butch Cassidy!?!?!?!?!? Demental look? Yes, really Butch Cassidy, depicted as an idiot). Teravlesed nuit americaine, absurd compromises, illogical plot, bad behavior, and the appearance of fugace by one of the most rewarding anchors on the Italian television, Renzo Arbore's story. Ah, of course: Klaus Kinski. Yes, it's big and terrible, but I'm sure he was just for the money to play with the iron horses) 2 out of 10, but ... DON'T REMEMBER !!!!!
