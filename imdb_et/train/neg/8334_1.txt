It has the absolute worst result from Robert Duval, who sounds like William Buckley on the whole movie. His hammy melodramatic behavior takes away all the dramatic interests. I'm not sure if it was a deliberate stealing or involuntary scene, but that's the only thing I remember about a truly forgotten movie. This picture should be shown in every amateur class that shows what not to do. Thanks to God, Duvall went on to bigger and better things and finished the cultured accent of the event. He is an actor of a good character, but that's it. Klaus is so much better. His performance is silenced and remarkable.
