Here's a good movie, but that's not the case. The basic idea is good: to study the moral issues faced by the Apocalypse group of young survivors. But the logic is so confusing that it is impossible to involve. <br /> <br /> For example, our four heroes are (understandably) paranoid against the infiltration of this mysterious air that has virtually destroyed all humanity. Yet they sometimes wear surgical masks, not others. Sometimes they are fanatical by bleaching any area affected by an infected person. At other times, they seem completely worried. <br /> <br /> Even worse, after apparently alive in a few weeks or six in this new kill-or-kill world, these people are constantly behaving like new ones. They don't worry about getting the right equipment or food. They're out of eternal average fuel. They do not take elementary precautions at the meeting of strangers. And after passing through the rotten bodies of rabies, they are both cloudy and protected debuts. You have to constantly think about how they would have been able to survive for a long time ... and even if they did, why would anyone want to make a movie about them. <br /> <br /> So when these dweebid stops morally over their action, it is impossible to search their soul seriously. Their activities should first become minimal. <br /> <br /> In addition, we must fight Chris Pine's suspicious action. His depiction of a lofty young James T Kirk may have been taken for granted. But in Carrier, he is playing exactly the same remark: arrogant and tough. It is impossible not to suspect that it represents a whole dramatic scale. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the film looks great. It has a too sharp, saturated appearance that fits in the southwestern part of the United States. But it can't record a really weak message or a thin (and annoying) sign on paper. Even if you are a fan of the end of the world genre, you should try to bother with Carrier.
