I saw this movie yesterday at a cinema. I had some hopes for the movie because I like The Vanishing and the book based on it. The movie starts right because it seems like a nice thriller at first. Quickly, even though the film becomes confusing, the characters who are never perfect and the audience (like Marjoke) and terrible editing are not. The film has black bits that are just too long, a confusing chronology that jumps back and forth and lots of scenes that just don't add anything to the story and easily fall off. After suffering the story, you can treat one of the worst endings I've seen for a long time. It should also be mentioned that the film has many explicit sex scenes that you are probably used to watching a lot of Dutch movies. There are good things to mention about this movie. About a third of the audience had already dropped to the theater from the theater, and I didn't hear a word after the movie ended. Avoid this movie at all costs. it really destroyed any faith I had left in the Dutch film industry.
