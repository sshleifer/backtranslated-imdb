As a Swedish man who currently lives in Sweden, I have to admit that I often watch Scandinavian films. Most if they never understand. I think Scandinavian actors work best in Hollywood. Last week I watched a Polish friend and a film about the "Polish Wedding" and we both said it was the worst movie we ever watched. Unfortunately, I was wrong that the movie "Angels House" is even worse. No participant can act, absolutely not a woman's so-called. Helen Bergstrom. The plot is so stupid that no one can believe it. I think the whole thing is confusing from the start. lots of bad behaviors except Selldal and Wollter. Ahmed Sellam
