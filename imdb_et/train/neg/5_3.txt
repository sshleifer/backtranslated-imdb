I looked at the movie basically, but just enough to look at the plot about. To be honest, it was boring for me and some places didn't make sense. The only reason I watched this movie was CHACE CRAWFORD !!! She's so hot, but in this movie her hair was weird. But still hot. <br /> <br /> Despite how hot CHACE is, it didn't really want to make up for the movie. I think the plot is not so bad, but what really struck me was that they tend to like every sentence. Is it so hard to express your anger by saying F-word every time? Cussing was annoying and the whole flashy, camera shaking thing gave me a headache. <br /> <br /> All in all, although the plot was OK, I found the film to be clean and dramatic. That's why I only cut scenes with CHACE. LOL Anyways, does not deserve rental, as your specific cast member, as I was, a hard hard fan. Oh yes, it was hot. Girls were HOT !!! But CHACE is the best!
