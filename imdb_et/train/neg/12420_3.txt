Here just isn't enough. There are some funny places, but not quite enough. I was very disappointed because I love stupid movies. I was expecting it to be a hidden pearl. It wasn't. It was a hidden turd. <br /> <br /> All the time I watched it, I thought, "Geez, I could do it better and I'm moor." Do not believe some good comments. I was sucked by them. At some point I didn't laugh out loud. Maybe it was funny or top-notch in 1987, but the man fell today. This movie was a promise, it just didn't give it. Maybe if they rewrite it several times. I can't blame the actors. They weren't the best, but they just didn't have much work. This movie failed because of a threaded message. SORELY disappointed.
