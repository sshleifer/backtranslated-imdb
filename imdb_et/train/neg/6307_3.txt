I give him 3 just because it showed a history that we need to know to avoid it happening again. I agree with the comments made by the United Kingdom. The film was quite terrible. All the clich√©, the real plot. Historical and technical inaccuracies are great. See DE 529 or Everts Class Destroyer Escort Technical Data and see what I mean. I am now a month of my black history in the US and I call it racist just to say that, but the history of this ship is not so great. They did some messenger work, shared a "submarine", which turned out to be a strain they died. Sorry, but black people did much more in World War II, but this stupid film gives them credit. This film turns them into visionaries. Let the name that calls you start, I can handle it.
