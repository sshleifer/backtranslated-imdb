What Hopkins does with this effort, because the writer and director give us the feeling that we know absolutely no one in the film. But maybe this is a problem. His film has many ambitions, and his intentions were obviously complicated and deeply drawn, but it is so impersonal. No characters. We never know who is, so there is no investment on our part. <br /> <br /> It could be about a scriptwriter who interferes with his characters. Is it? Maybe. This does not mean that Slipstream is unclear; I mean, don't say. Hopkins film is a test. This face may be a potential scriptwriter who, at the time of his fate meeting, realizes that life has hit and miss, and / or success is a blind chance, as he collides with the "slipstream" of clashes between times, dreams, thoughts, and reality. However, it is not so harsh that it does not leave room for emotions, even because of its small, rather rudimentary scale, which allows us to associate it with the characters. <br /> <br /> I didn't think the nipple was impressive and spooky, the camera-work with a gun gun and the editing school removed me, but I thought about the movie that it was a lot to do with it. There have been so many films in the last decade where cuts or camera movements are both sound effects and other atmospheric degrading technical doodles. I think it was justifiable in this case that its purpose was to create an impressionist response to dreams. But I was hardly watching Slipstream looking at it and I came in the same way. And I just don't care because Hopkins didn't try to take care of us. There are interactive movies and there are movies that sit on a rocking chair and woven without knowing your presence. Slipstream is the last one.
