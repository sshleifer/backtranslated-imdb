Despite the English title, it seems to have little to do with the Devils and much more to do with the power-hungry ruler who is looking for a philosopher's stone and wants gold to be made of lead (and virgin blood). Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have little trouble with death if he thinks they are threatening their position or if they need their blood virgin. He is basically employed by his wife's love and alchemist, and it is more of greed and madness that seems to be his problem than demonic possession (unfortunately). There are parts that are at least somewhat fascinating, such as stretching and grown-up men who are trying to hit each other with big sticks, and the film has at least a good look, but otherwise it is not recommended. There is nothing to be feared at all about Molina / Naschy and not to be afraid at all, no inadvertent humor. So out of 4 out of ten.
