I've heard about this novel long ago, and many of my friends have suggested that I read it. I was looking for it in every place and finally found it. This is a book that every person should read because it is a genius and because of its vision. I enjoyed every page. <br /> <br /> I knew about the movie and couldn't wait for it. When I was finally very disappointed, many of the things in the book are not in the movie (I don't think it's a spoiler) that just makes the movie logical ... Michael Radford can be a good director, but a bad writer. Especially as a recipient of books. The film is not at all dark, writing is really bad, the only thing that is good, even great, is the actor. John Hurt is an amazing actor and the only face I saw as Winston Smith. <br /> <br /> What makes me most angry is the people in IMDbis who called it "best ever to adapt" even without reading the book! Or knowing something about writing the screen! <br /> <br /> You can only read the shine of the story by reading this book, not considering it an alternative. As a fan of the book, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The points I gave to this movie are actors.
