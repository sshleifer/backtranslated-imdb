Trite, clich√©d dialogue and drawing (the same kind of things we saw through the 1980s fantasy films), hokey music, and color-coded characters bring it out to everyone, except for the toughest fans. <Br /> <br /> What saves this movie from spam is the beautiful Bakshi work, the rotoscope, and the fact that Frank Frazetta taught animators how to draw him like this. It's Frazetta. Violence is remarkable and the artistic direction and animation are different from other sword and witchcraft films. <br /> <br /> I like to turn off this sound by submitting the first Conan movie instead.
