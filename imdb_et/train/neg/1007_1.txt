I found it very difficult to watch it after the first 5 minutes of the movie. I had been able to turn off the 45-50 minute stomach on the ground and instead of watching Monster House (which is, by the way, a lot of fun). <br /> <br /> The story contains tremendous holes in it. The plot's line is utterly spoken and boring when acting is terrible, especially from Justin TImberlake, who should really stick to what he's good at (watching and singing like a castration). Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable, especially when he made dance around rock music for no apparent reason after the movie and Timberlake met. The characters of Freeman and Timberlake seem to be some kind of father / son relationship or something that is simply not obvious except that; Although Freeman's character seems to be contemptuous of Timberlake's unknown and rather foolish character, he never pulls all the stops that would help him find a completely ridiculous cover. <br /> <br /> It takes some incredible incredible time to tell a story that is just absurd and that is just proportional. <br /> <br /> Don't look at this movie, it's a waste of time.
