The Dull Haunted House thriller finds an American family moving to a 200-year-old Japanese house where a violent murder suicide love triangle took place. <br /> <br /> The Romance setting is the only interesting element of the Hell Director's motif on this very slow motion horror screen. The film generates zero frequency and consists of somewhat unpleasant scenes that seem rarely at all leading. One obvious example is a fairly early scene, where a male passage visits the temple when he understands that his house has been haunted by a monk warning. Munk reminds the history of the house (what the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence) and then the movie just cuts something else. Earlier the monk offered help. Well, where's the help? The family is still in a haunted house, when things get worse and worse, and the mention of the monk is not done until the end when he turns up to do what he should have done one hour earlier - try out the spirits out of the house, though by that time Viewers find it difficult to take care of. <br /> <br /> There are some (obviously) unintentional camps to laugh when they see American players at the end of Japan's spirits and suddenly start with bad martial arts, probably because the scene is more than a bit reminiscent of the same director Motel Hell, apparently be fun, but in general it is forgotten.
