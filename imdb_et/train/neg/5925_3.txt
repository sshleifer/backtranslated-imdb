Is it a "worse" Star Trek TOS episode? Maybe I can get at least my voice because it's only 5. I mean, this episode doesn't make any amazing sense. Seeing something that makes you go crazy? Leave me alone. This episode also has a different feeling, music is elevated, almost forced to increase the sense of suffering, so it sucks. Give me some Klingons, Horns, Tholians, Ruins, Higher Beings like Triskelion or anything other than Medusin, these are very boring aliens who surround the episode. McCoy can hear his famous phrase "He's Dead, Jim". Spock puts the goggles on the shuttle, but Kirk does not. They're going through this amazing "barrier" now for the third time I remember, boring. The next episode of at least the third season would be "Spectrum Weapon" and "Dove of the Dove" and others that would follow, making Trek a decent show to look at syndicates where he would choose people like me. Personal observations, Trek loved the use of purple, pinkish floral, as if they were in the corridor outside the section, the gray gray is now purple. We have never had a purple bridge, but it is interesting to see, I noticed it in several episodes, a light filter and it works very well, but in this episode the ships are quite flat in the corridor.
