I just looked at one episode of this program and I didn't even get to the end of the program. Every minute I was watching this program where my I.Q had to be about 10 points lower. It's basically like a kids program, but passionate. Not even the vows and insults he told others to laugh at me. Anyway, the story must have been written by the monkey and the people who actually kept the program script at the gun point and had no choice but to film this slow, frustrating and terribly running program. Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she actually made from this program and get some godly lessons.
