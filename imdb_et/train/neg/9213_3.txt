I hit this film with a little screening organized by members of my college club. We were warned that this would be a refreshing madness in the games, and that this movie is more than delivered. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man who starts his college career after a "rest" semester. As we progress through the movie, we view that Robbie was hopelessly addicted to the role play "Mazes and Monsters", a game that he once again introduces after the gambling group recruits him for the campaign. This film is ridiculous at many levels. In one scene, there is a group of "playing candlelight", which is probably the best way to describe it. While I am sure it was to be "cultivating" in some way, as most players know, it is terribly inaccurate. Most role-playing sessions are done in well-lit rooms, usually with some cheeses and soda cans. <br /> <br /> Operation, not an Oscar caliber, is not dreadful in the gut. . This is one of Tom Hanks' first roles, and Bosom's friends and bachelor were still in a year or two. Supportive cast, though not very memorable, delivers decent performances. <br /> <br /> It's basically a bad thing that it's a TV movie that shows "gambling dangers". see if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night.
