The opportunity was there. I saw Creep and thought, "Oooh, it's interesting" many times. But somehow the plot features were unexplained or ignored as they never happened. The character of the lead was irritating throughout the film, and at one point I and both cried to want him to die. There are some really horrible / scary moments, but they are seriously overshadowed by moments that just irritated me. This is one of those horror films that have been growing and intrigue you for some time, but eventually leave you frustrated and a little confused about what filmmakers are trying to achieve. The movie is a bad boy, but if the baddie is more pleasing than the leader, you know you are a loser.
