A movie from some filmmakers who want to make a documentary in new scary water. As an absolute film fan, including some witch animals or monsters, I thought it might be my movie ... it wasn't !!! It should be more of a guide on how not to do it! It has a lot of random humor, and the evil beast is an incredible joke, in the last scene it goes beyond the main characters *, running *, legs probably in the air! It seems ridiculous! Good laugh though. If only the lack of participants, the embarrassingly silly dialogues, and the absence of a fun silly crocodile would make it at least ridiculous, but it gets worse: I think the people responsible for this film noticed how weak it was, so they rose from the idea of ​​selling old sex ... Completely, I mean ALL without any reason one of the main actors showing their breasts to the savage. And somewhere in the beginning there is some pointless "makeout". This is the last ingredient that makes me a movie in the absolute trash. It's incredible how people actually make such garbage! If you are looking for a real waste of time: watch this movie !!!
