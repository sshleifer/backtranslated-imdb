The back cover of the DVD (it came out when it came out) is by Hitler - Evil Of Evil - "A Triumph" (New York Post) and "Mesmerizing" (Newsweek). Do not forget the post, but really, who ever wrote this word in Newsweek in the same context of this peace, ahem, art must be defeated. <br /> <br /> I don't want to do that. Why try to paint Hitler's evil colors that don't exist? He was evil, but now his character is depicted as being often historically inaccurate (compared to his love for animals, the gentle and weakened way he treated women) and so on. <br /> <br /> Participants are good, so you have to defeat them because they are imprisoned within their one-dimensional characters. Some of the churches here with Peter O 'Toole: This is the second time in his honorable career when he has played in an unsuccessful film of an old and failed leader (or in this case TV production to be exact). The first was of course the legendary Galigula. <br /> <br /> The list of historically inaccurate scenes alone would fill the 1000 words allowed by IMDb, so I think I'll leave it here. <br /> <br This is OK if it is on the TV and you have nothing else to do but believe me - it's the best local Virgin store on the shelf.
