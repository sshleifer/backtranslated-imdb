This is the beginning of the 80s. There's a group of teenagers with suspicious old views. And there is a maniac that chases. Yes, it is slasherville. <br /> <br /> This movie is called Pranks. Why is it called Pranks? I have no weakest idea. If your idea of ​​a big prank has never been hit by someone with a baseball bat - balance, not bigger; In fact, it can be said that there is indeed a trash. But you go. <br /> <br /> The film itself concerns a group of teenagers whose job is to clean the decommissioned dormitory. They find out that the psychopath is open. To fight this development, they were divided into darkness and walked. Most of them end with tears. <br /> <br /> Pranks is a badly made movie. The DVD edition was one of Vipco's. It looks like it is being cut off from fair violence. This makes the DVD even more meaningless, because let's be honest that a violent bright film is a waste of time. Only for film and video film graduates.
