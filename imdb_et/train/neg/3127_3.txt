The archaeologist (Casper Van Dien) accidentally gets to an ancient 40-meter mummy that has been well preserved in the Nevada desert. They have decided to keep it secret and invite a Jewish translator to help identify its history. The mummy, as explained at the beginning, is the fallen angel's son, and it is one of several giants that apparently existed "these days". In order to save his son from the devastating flood that was predicted to kill everyone, he mimics his son, burying him with several servants over the centuries - planning to wake him up for years. Our fallen angels today are still on earth, and the mummy is resurrected and a ritual is expected. Most of the movie is slow, with a lot of Bible tricks and a few scary, air-struggling struggles. The mummy has a decent look, but it's almost not shown enough. It should have done more, but it drew a lot ... eh. Do not worry.
