This film is a bad and bad design line, as well as an affectionate line of sticky lines and a flat plot. But it's so fun to watch. All this is fun. The basic piece is a group of scientists traveling in the future who are trying to catch their evil co-worker who is going to destroy them all. They arrive with him in 1146. The 'futuristic' laboratory of 2033 is an eighty-style room with a bunch of futuristic flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a lawn table. The actors give their lines to a unicorn-like aplomb, which is not difficult to understand given that these lines are usually earthquakes like "I checked everything twice!" He checked everything twice? He checked it four times? Not only that, but they will feed you throughout the film for the first five minutes and continue the quick fire until they hit the medieval part. When Roger Corman ran out of money. And I had to stop traveling time and hence different sets. The medieval mass is a comic mash-mash from the late 10th to the 16th century. They all used the costumes they found. I think the chain was not in the budget because the boys are wearing shirts that mask the armor. Fighting scenes are ridiculous, because men who accidentally throw themselves into cardboard swords are abandoning and dying to death, throwing a member. It sounds really awful, but I enjoy it every time I watch it. The lines alone are enough to make you fit, and everything else pulls you together to create a fabulous B-movie. And if you have, read an overview of unknown movies. I love to hear them, emphasizing all the funny, really terrible movies.
