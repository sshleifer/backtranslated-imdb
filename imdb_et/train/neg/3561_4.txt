Adapting Stephen King (written by the king himself), where a young family, newcomers to the Maine countryside, find a pet cemetery near their home. The Dale Midkiff then finds himself at the Micmac burial site outside the pet cemetery, which has resurrection powers - of course, everything is buried there, not quite right. <br /> <br /> Below the average "horror" image, clumsy, offensive, and unfair commences and will continue for some time, with the Midkiff's worthless power being the absolute worst element. It gets a little better with a really disturbing final. In fact, the whole movie is really annoying, so I can't completely reject it - at least it's SOMETHING to make it memorable. Fred Gwynne, like a clever obsolete neighbor and Brad Greenquist, is a decent support because the amazing spirit of Victor Pascow is not enough to redeem the film. <br /> <br /> The King is his usual comer as Minister. br /> <br /> This is followed by a queue directed by Mary Lambert (is it any wonder she is not from the main films?). <br /> <br /> 4/10
