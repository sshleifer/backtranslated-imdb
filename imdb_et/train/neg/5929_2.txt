People who praise this movie are real disappointments - I hope at least that Leonard looks out of this good because his life is occupied by the driver a few years ago and he is over 70 years old. But this movie is just terrible. In the beginning, Leonard himself says that he is not sentimental in his past, and then in the next hour and a half the Leonardo song's worst sentimental elements are emphasized. It's so bloody PRECIOUS with its endless close-ups over emotional singers. Cohen's interview is all done in lo-fi video, and I wanted to see my whole body in a medium or long picture! I didn't care less about commentators, especially those who were overgrown with the ego boys Edge and Bono. None of the performers of this movie have made any song as well as Leonard's own music, and if you think about seeing it and you have any doubts, then note them. It may be a one-off exemplary PBS, which is special. But I even hesitate about this DVD. When the movie finally shows Leonard's half-filled "Song of Tower", Bono has destroyed the verse. Even occasionally good performances (Antony, Rufus's first number, Martha The Traitor) have been violated in the context of the rest of this cod-end blabla. Forget it and go to buy Leonard's last album if you want to pay tribute to it.
