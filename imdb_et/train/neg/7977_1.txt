Well, Montreal Jesus is basically a smart movie. The actors are really good and the technical side of the movie is okay. But while I was very interested in the subject and would like to believe and discuss religion (I am an atheist), it was hard for me to kill the film and, in my opinion, somehow unconsciously look to the end. Why is this movie so incredibly boring? I do not know. It's simple and not recommended.
