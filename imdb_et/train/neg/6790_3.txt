Ohhh brutal, ohhhh dying breed, ohhhh loss feeling, ohhhh bias! Jeez, when are you all the people who are tired of auditing stop talking to western countries for a loud voice? S ** t happens. If it breaks your socially-designed feelings, go back to your Meryl Steep collection convenience. <br /> <br /> A boring, tedious and very tiring celluloid residue, especially in the light of Coburn / Hackman / Bergen's presence. There is nothing interesting or intriguing here if you are not obsessed with dental care in the 19th century desert. Perhaps it has been a bit better without the constant spread of the on-site Mexican boy with a bad tooth. A monument of 60 / 70's stupid ultra-fast, subtle sensitivity. Almost impossible to sit through the whole movie. I think my eyes would be open for the whole Lucky Luke / Trinity series. 4 Horse / 10-all Hell.
