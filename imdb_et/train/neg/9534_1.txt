I'm a fan of the previous Best of the Best movie. But it was terrible. No wonder I had a hard time finding it. I tried 4 video rental stores until I found this copy of the movie. The action was terrible, the plot was funny and it was bad. <br /> <br /> I miss Alex Grady, Travis Brigley and the original kickboxing characters and the theme of this movie in the first 2 films. <br /> <br /> John
