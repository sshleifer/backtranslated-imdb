This film is supposedly about non-institutions (aesthetically and sexually) who apparently cannot resist romantic basic needs. While some great players are involved, including Jon Tenney, Timothy Olyphant and Cynthia Nixon, they are the basic principles that rely almost entirely on smart dialogue; which is not. Nixon's role has the best features, but he often lives too fast for them, which is a timing error that has to come to the driver. The grotesque climax uses all the existing clich√©s that have been spent or not, and completes this drabic experiment for comedy.
