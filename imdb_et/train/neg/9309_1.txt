Hey everyone ... <br /> <br /> There's not much to say about this movie. The main thing is that the boy (Brandon) takes some friends out of his cabin in the forest during the weekend. After picking up the girls, things get badly wrong in all of them. <br /> <br /> The story alone (written by Brandon's acting actor, I believe though it may be wrong here) is unlikely and convincing, and is done accordingly. "Clown Killer" itself is rather a sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Not far from the dark, mysterious, but above all intelligent predator, we are offered a clumsy, nursery rhyme, who seems to be going through a small medium life crisis. The only thing that was justified in writing this comment was the sex scenes and whatever was in the film (the quality of the film made me happy about such things). <br /> <br /> In short, this movie falls below every possible standard. Of course, when I looked at it, I shared some of the beers with a close friend, so we managed to bring out some relative entertainment value from this movie and it is therefore fair to mention that S.I.C.K just fell into the shame of two ratings. In reality (and in retrospect), the rating of one star for this film is more than a legitimate result. <br /> <br /> 1 star from ten.
