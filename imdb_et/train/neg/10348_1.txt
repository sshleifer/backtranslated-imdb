I was very excited to see that they had ever made a movie of their favorite book. I didn't know it was Disney until it was too late. I had many drawbacks of the important parts of the shocked story. It would be like someone who made a fourth-class book report on the novel. Meg did well in school, and neither he nor his father wore glasses. Mrs Murray (mother of Megi) was not so much a scientist; they left their kitchen cabinet and replaced it with the internet. And that's just the beginning. Halfway through the movie, I was screaming on the screen, a lot of other people who didn't read this movie. I wish I had more thumbs so I got four thumbs down for it. The only good thing I can say is that for a person who hasn't read a book, this movie is pretty good.
