Well, I hated knocking, I despised a 40 year old virgin, and this little pearl is a worthless piece of trash. do yourself a favor and skip it. I admit that I don't like the actors of this movie and after my 18-year-old son showed me a DVD, I was like, "I wouldn't want this movie," but at his request, unfortunately I decided to try it. <br /> <br /> After about two minutes I turned off the movie, I was so offended. it's just nasty. every dignified person would be offended by the attack on this film. call me old-fashioned, but putting my hand in my pussy juice to my friend's face to know that "I got some" is a sense of duty in my mind. yes, it starts with this tiny movie and i can only imagine that it gets a lot worse. another real winner to Mr. Rudd. I bet he's proud. Imagine if you only get valuable roles as it gets, would you stay in the movies? despite the salary I would not have. <br /> <br /> I should have felt better; next time.
