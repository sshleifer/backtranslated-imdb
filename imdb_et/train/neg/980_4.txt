My first complete Heston film. A movie that everyone already knows. "Sci Fi Thriller". Campy factor. Everything that comes with this film was injected on my head when I rented it, and in the morning when I watched it, it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood I was (not wanting to move. Blankets). And while I was trying to understand what happened, to finish what pop culture is ever destroying, it just didn't. Everything was all over the place, there was no backbone in the relationship, no leadership at the end. Everything was in this sense terrible, and the guard has no choice but to leave some of the overwhelming end to what he's getting, because even though we all know it's people, it's a quick answer, why WHY people make serious attempts to enjoy something else as stupidity thrown out of the window.
