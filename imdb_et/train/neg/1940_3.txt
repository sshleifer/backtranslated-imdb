the writing of the journalists and the required utterly reckless spokesman and grandmother's resurrection were a dental fissure and a clich√© was driven. <br /> <br /> I can't blame the actors, but definitely someone has to say, "Are you kidding me to say it! "<br /> <br /> This episode was in the press and in the perspective of the police, while the police viewpoint was sufficiently standard, the perspective and characterization of the press were exaggerated and the points insult unbelievably. <br /> <br /> I note this was HBO cogeneration, if so, may perhaps explain the stereotypes of the backbones in this way, <br /> <br /> I was completely at a press conference, it had no credibility, and it wasn't a failure, 40 minutes after the first episode and I'm still waiting for tension <br /> <br /> Skip for five days 2008 - 2008 production with these characters is much better and unstoppable even when crime is up. <br /> <br /> This story was an unforgettable moment, what can only be described incredibly unbelievably. <br /> <the journalist starts the press conference to deal with the press questions of the investigating officer. <br /> <br /> so unbelievable that it seemed to be amateur hours. <br /> <br /> Then I started tip suck journalists named "Scoop" and "Perry White" for appearance. <br /> <br /> I saw the 2009 hunter before "five days" in Australia, not realizing that it was a prequel and waiting for Bonneville and McTeer goes over again. <br /> <br /> Shaking the head with awe.
