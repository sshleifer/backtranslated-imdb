First of all, when I saw Wendy Wu's teaser trailer, I was excited. Brenda Song, one of the hottest girls on the Disney channel, would be making martial arts and I was happy with it ... until I saw the movie. The action was poorly designed, the film could not really show anyone, the fight was unrealistic and suck ... with the plot. If you really think this is Wannabe Buffy Vampire Slayer, a girl who is the offspring of other warriors who were women, she wants to ignore her call and wants to become a king, a guard who prepares her wrong. Fight against some ancient evil. The idea was simply not so original, the film is a waste of time.
