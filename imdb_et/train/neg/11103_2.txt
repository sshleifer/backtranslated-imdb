OK, so I just saw the movie, although it appeared last year ... I thought it was usually a decent movie, except for the story that was stupid and terrible ... First we never know anything about the creatures they appeared do they do in our world and really have they been on Earth before we were or they just came from space? Secondly, the role of the meat industry in maintaining the order is just as obviously designed ... Indeed, how big could the underground submarine be? There were only so many of these beings, so I think that instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could just have planted some tactical bombs, or maybe it would be clear that Nuke would have done that job. I know it sounds funny and that is, but I don't see people killing because it's REQUIRED ... Third, Leon acts like Superman jumps on the train and fights Vinnie Jones, who was taller and bigger than he was. When he faces the conductor, he does nothing and acts as a wimp, looking at all the abominations. I mean OK, the conductor was horrible help (lol), but if Leon was so brave, he would have gone all the way ... I mean he'll risk his life for the first time, he won't do exactly what he should be. She could have died as a hero, but she lives as a coward ... it can happen, but not after she was shown so much cruelty before ... Then, cop ... come on! It was a city with a subway, I can bet there have been other policemen, except this lady, other police stations, it was really stupid ... All in all, Vinnie Jones's great actor, an interesting idea until the reason that doesn't Not at all built ... By the way, what was the chest? Vinnie Jones is unable to make up for the rest ...
