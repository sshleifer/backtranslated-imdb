I am sad that Christians (and I am one) feel that we have to make films like "left behind". We have many better stories to say it doesn't have to be so preaching. I was very disappointed with this movie. Like Christ's incredible filmmaker, I see this movie as a perfect example of what I'm not going to do with my career in film.
