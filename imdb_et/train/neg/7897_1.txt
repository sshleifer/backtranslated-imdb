This movie was made for people who found Gremlins too serious and hardcore for Critters. Like many 80's critters / trolls / gremlinside films, this movie is bad. The sad part is that there is no blow to this comment. It's just a bad and not a funny way. <br /> <br /> The problem with this miniature monster movie is that it tries to be funny and as successful as Howie Mandell was walking like A Man. What made the other 80 horror movies classic was that they were really trying to be scary, but they were fun because they couldn't do so. Someone has to talk to Bettina Hirsch (yes, Bettina Hirsch) before she started the film with comedy. Unfortunately they were wrong. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you see a strangely mutated cross between a ferret and a tumor that carries brown trenchoat and throws the pool balls by the missing boys, it's fun, but not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing part of the movie is Paul's character. His Paul Reiser wannabe schtick is enough to start a quick transfer from the time of his first scene to ending the final credit only when you see a scene where munchie throws the pool balls with the guy ... not that I did. br /> <br /> So the bottom line runs, do not walk, the closest Blockbuster and shake the driver and thank him for not having grapes to store this shelf on the shelves.
