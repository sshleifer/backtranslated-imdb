ROAD WARRIOR barrel base, unimaginable and practically invisible remake. This film follows the exact plot of filipino movie STRYKER and is worse! Bad operation, dialogue, effects, duplication, pace, sequences ... The list goes on and on. In the early 1980s, Italy literally made dozens of Road Warrior attacks, some good, some bad. It's the worst, not the race. The mood of the movie was not only dark and unhappy, but the experience of sitting there is half and a half. At the beginning of the movie, there was one (one) good chase and a man with an explosive hand grenade. But everything else from this movie is serious! Follow the ENDGAME copy for the real doll fun fun after NEW YORK or ESCAPE BRONX. They are much more enjoyable than this garbage.
