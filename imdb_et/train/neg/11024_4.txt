I saw this movie for the first time in the Soviet Union and a lot of censorship just edited erotic scenes. But then in Poland in 2000 I looked at it in full form. So what? The plot is incredibly unreasonable - 2 men live on a genetic disaster and find themselves on a planet full of feminist, strong, straight, and heavily heavy women. Men are now trying to combat it and then a whole host of extremely stupid clich√©s - sex drive, constant male desire for sex, feminists who are shown as complete idiots (you can accept them or not, but idiots are definitely not), and so on. Already starring Jerzy Stuhr is a wood and a strangely bad thing - he just draws an unforgettable face and repeats, saying "I am naked with a lift and I haven't done anything to him!". It was supposed to be a comedy, instead it turned out to be a steam farce full of predictable jokes and waist. Don't waste your time - it's just bad.
