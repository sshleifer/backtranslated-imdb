I was watching this movie late last night and usually when it's late, I'm pretty movie forgiving. Although I tried, I was not able to hold this movie at all, but worsened and worsened as the movie continued. Although I know it's comedy, I didn't find it very funny. Especially unrealistic and jaded imagination was also rural. If this is what someone thinks that rural life is similar, it is certainly not. I have to agree that some of the bachelors were cute, but the French man was really fake. I have to agree that he tried to make a good lesson, but in general, my suggestion that someone over the age of 8 shouldn't look at it is just annoying.
