The movies have put me before, but no movie has ever done it twice so it took me three sessions. The dialogue was bad. The women spoke firmly and the men were cartoons. And two allegedly Japanese women saw Chinese, they had Chinese names, and they spoke with Chinese accent. I still try to understand why the men of Emmental were sexually wrapped. 10 minus 8 1/2 equals a difficult choice: Will I give this film one rating? or two? <br /> <br /> Films have made me fall asleep, but no film has ever made it twice so it took me three sessions.
