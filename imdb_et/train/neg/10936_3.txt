I wanted this movie to like, I really did. It has some good actors, but ultimately it falls. In some places (daughters over eager cooking experiments) trying to be too funny, over reaches others (a scene where they cleanse someone's yard so he agrees to join the team) and has some scenes that are somewhat interesting, is really just a filler (all workplace scenes). And I didn't find the "woolly" scary or angry value as far as I found them childishly annoying. <br /> <br /> I met people in the movie when playing the balloon. And I say that the judge is on the ground, Finally, I finally didn't care about the characters or their aspirations for the glory of the balloon. Perhaps because they were all so one-dimensional that I might not think so much if the film was more funny or it seemed to flow a little smoother. <br /> <br /> Entertainment by Kurt Hale and Halestorm has made some good movies, but that's not one of them.
