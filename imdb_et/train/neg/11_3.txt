If you look at Corey Large's information about IMDb, there is probably a film called "Reload" (from June 08) where he plays a character called Sebastian Cole. <br /> <br /> First of all, how does such a dirty film ever make a difference ... and secondly, did Sebastian not kill "Loaded" at the end? <br /> <br /> I watched it in the morning when I was fighting insomnia, and so I was drifting in and out when it was. I'm sure I missed some plot points, but in general it seemed very weak. Great performance was one of the strongest parts of the film for me. I'm also a little surprised when all the people comment on the beautiful girls because I thought the actor who played Brooke was beautiful but not exceptional.
