Mary Pickford becomes Chief of the Scottish Clan after his father's death and then has romance. As my colleague commented on Snow Leopard, the film is quite episodic at first. Some of this is fun, like Pickford, who whips his clans into the church, while some of them are just there. All in all, this story is weak, especially in the area of ​​recycled, revitalized romance and its climax. Transmission is so dark that it is difficult to evaluate the landscape, but even consider it, it does not seem to be the best work of director Maurice Tourneur. Pickford and Tourneur once again collaborated in the somewhat more accessible "The Poor Little Rich Girl".
