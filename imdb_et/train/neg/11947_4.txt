An interesting change from the first. this film was more mysterious than the first. Even if it ended up asking yourself what happened, it was a killer. There are some good parts through the movie, the first half starts slowly, and then the speed is accelerating in the last half. The whole movie is pleasant. The story is 22 years after the events that took place on the first film, Norman Bates is out of the shelter and back to the Bates motel, but when the woman comes up to be her true mother, things are wrong. Perkins plays older Norman again, and at the end there was a great scene, he created that the shoulder was terribly difficult.
