I've never been to Paris, but after seeing "Paris, Je t'aime", I'm crazy to visit this city! I've been to NY several times and I love the city and its neighborhoods. I hope this film touches me on how I jump on the plane and fly there right now, but look, I regret the time and money I spent with it. There are no love stories between people or people and the city. There are many dysfunctional meetings and relationships or people who know each other and it just doesn't work well. Perhaps it reflects a feature of the city that says they have thousands of independent people. Don't you find love in New York?
