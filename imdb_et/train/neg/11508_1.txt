Regardless of who he was, Guy Ritchie, to make Wertmuller's film incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> This new movie is a mess. When I saw it, there was another person in the audience and he stayed for about an hour. (I hope he demanded a refund.) The only reason I ended up was that I never left the movie. <br /> <br /> But I sat down with this piece of spam thoroughly flabbered that Madonna and Ritchie thought they made a good movie. Dialogue is ridiculous, acting scary and the only nice thing about this film is the landscape. Ritchie took Lina's movie and turned it into another "Blue Lagoon". <br /> <br /> This is a movie you don't even take late at Cinemax. Time is too expensive to mess like that.
