This movie is both funny and painful at the same time. "Cinemagic" almost gave me attachment. Despite what they mean, "cinemagic" is not an innovative technical process. It was "advanced" as a result of the accident and they used it because it conceals the fact that their "monsters" were so stupid. I don't think it's a coincidence that the writer is Sid "Pink". <br /> <br /> This movie is a good laugh when you are really looking for a movie made for $ 200,000 in 9 days. This is fun; at least I can say that. The best bat is a rat / rat / spider.
