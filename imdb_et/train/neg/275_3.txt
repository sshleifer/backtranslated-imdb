It is absolutely unbelievable for me that someone could comment that this film is not preaching. It is not only oppressive preaching, but absurd, staged, dramatically straightforward and obviously burnt. Looking at it, it seems that an 8-year-old child is punished if he has to write "I can't become a fascist" 100 times. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that it's done in WW2, and that was supposed to be Hitler's brave condemnation and the terrible suffering he caused (which everyone delighted with) and I'm sure it hit the day's mood. But it is presented in such an immature, obviously, slippery way, it does not work as a work of art. <br /> <br /> The only good performance here is Paul Lukas, who brings his role of sincerity and intensity to a quietly heroic fascist; and Lucile Watson as a funny badly rich grandmother who slowly realizes how dangerous the world has changed. Although their rootless cultivation has subjected them to all kinds of difficulties, the children are ridiculously shown to be small well-behaved robots. They are far from similar to real people. And Bette Davis, the great actor, here is such a one-dimensional noble, as I every time he was on the screen, I shook. His every word, his gesture, is meant to convey how he is the proof of SACRIFICES and DEVELOPMENT, which his wife must do, and the great reason he fights that he must be wired to get a hurtful electric shock when he dares to promise any suspicion or tint of the surface in your image. <br /> <br /> So yes, this is a very important movie, just not very good.
