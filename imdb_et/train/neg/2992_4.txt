Along with the slower films of the 1970s and 80s, those who were dead were probably the second most popular horror sub-genre. Although slasher films had "Black Christmas" and "Halloween", the whole thing was going, the zombie clips were George Romero 'Dead' films. And surprisingly, after the success of their first two series, other executives wanted to bring in the money. Many Italian directors were particularly interested, for example, Lucio Fulci, who brought us a year after Romero 'Dawn of the Dead' 'Zombie. known as "Zombie" in Italy and some other country, and there was a Fulci movie known as "Zombie 2". After dead death he has no connection with Romero, but it's a good movie. It was a great success in Europe and 9 years later it was a succession. <br /> <br /> Pros: lots of beautiful, lush landscapes. Awesome score. Action is not quite good, but the majority is a game and it seems that it enjoys this experience. After a slow start, the pace moves the same way as the momentum. A lot of cheese and unwanted fun for lovers of bad movies. Good work on makeup effects. Lots of blood and some decent gore. <br /> <br /> Cons: Practically less plot. Something you haven't seen before. Extremely hang a few things from the first couple of "Returning Living Dead" movies. Cardboard characters. Not too old age rock music of the 1980s (not because I say that all this time rock music is bad), clothes and the overall feeling of the movie. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: First, this is not a true sequel to the Fulc cult classic. In fact, I don't know if it was ever meant to be a movie where this movie was left. For those who don't know, Fulci was sick at the time of production and finally left and was replaced by Bruno Matte. Matte's movies are pretty ridiculous, but like this movie, many are good fun. And that's all the movie that's just for fun. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (so bad it is a good rating) 2/5 (Serious rating)
