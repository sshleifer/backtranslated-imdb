My husband and I found this movie very buggy. It started well, but quickly became incredible and ridiculous. Most of the action was poor, except for a little girl, Abbie, who was really terrible. In addition, the dialogue was predictable and flat - especially Gideon, Angel. Also, if nothing is given when one character has a tragedy, it seems almost controversial. First we thought it was a shock, but then we realized that it was just a terrible script. We love almost all Hallmark movies and their warm-hearted stories, but this movie doesn't rise to one. There are so many great ones - don't waste your time with this terrible movie.
