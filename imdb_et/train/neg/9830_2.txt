I am afraid you will find that a large number of people who value this film as ten are very Christian. I am not. If you are looking for a Christian movie, I recommend this movie. If you're looking for a good general movie, I'm afraid you'll have to go elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I liked these characters and their illogical behavior. The prerequisite for the film is that teaching morality without teaching that it is Jesus, who is the basis of morality, is wrong. One scene shows the main character who talks to the boy that it is wrong to steal, and then the character says it was Jesus who taught us. I find this offensive: do we have to believe that "you must not steal" Jesus? I think he wrote ten orders? And before that stealing was stolen? I rented a movie from Netflix. I should have understood the nature of the movie in the comments. Oh well.
