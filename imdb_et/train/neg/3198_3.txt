In short, the film was a bit of a weak first act with some forced behavior and somewhat divorced rhythm and pace, a somewhat decent second act that was able to create some tension and intrigue despite some inconsistencies and some lower performances. and the third act ... practically was NOT a 3rd action! <br /> <br /> In the third work, the movie ends sharply. There is no resolution or any way from the climax of the second act, so there was not much action in the third act. The bad guys are dying, and that's it; final credit roll. There is nothing to show what is happening with the protagonist and supporting letters, etc. Viewers would have left after the movie theater asking it to be? Real fall. <br /> <br /> The music was composed by David Bell, who worked well to make the most of the movie, but it is definitely not something outstanding. It is just functional, but it simply achieves it as a general and derivative. It is also obvious that the score is very slow with the use of synthesized thymules for some percussion instruments. The least impression on me of this score is that some rumors of the tension holiday are proclaimed as James Horner's "HRS 48". and "Commando", especially brass. <br /> <br /> All in all, the film had a potential because the basic story itself is good, but the performance was weak, mediocre, weak, and somewhat controversial. br /> <br /> Story 3 was not completed correctly and this omission is great and unforgivable as it does not allow the film to be satisfactorily completed. It may be a scenario, or maybe the production was supposed to cut filming or editing a third action into the finished movie due to budget constraints (but I'm speculating why there's no third action). Whatever the reason, sudden termination really hurts the film in general. <br /> <br /> This is good for viewing when you're curious and getting the movie VERY inexpensive and learn the reason why you need to do 3 actions (start, middle, end) when you write scripts and make movies. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you may not waste your time if you don't get the MST3K version for at least some laugh.
