"Die Sieger" was highly recommended to be one of the few good films in Germany. I looked at it last night and I have to admit that I am deeply disappointed. If it were to be the "last best hope" for entertaining and challenging German cinema, then there is not much left yet. there is nothing like that. The characters are made of wood and stereotype, and if they do something unexpected (which does not happen too much) it works against their nature. This makes it almost impossible for me to monitor or even associate them. <br /> <br /> The most important thing is that the movie is very bad. I don't believe any characters. Perhaps a higher officer of the SWAT unit - but that's it. Those people who try to look or act like special units, such as elephants, do not believe them. Not the other. <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad. But I think it's badly said. You don't feel bad boy at all - for example. And after the "very dark" show, Karl Simon (a good guy) asks his already dead opponent "why? ... what?" I asked myself the same question, knowing Dominik Graf would have no answer. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope - no - I believe that Germany can do even better films.
