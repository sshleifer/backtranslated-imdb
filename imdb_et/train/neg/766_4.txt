When Columbo's story differs from a familiar plot (a colored killer commits a crime, then Columbo smokes a killer, Columbo becomes a pest of the process), writers are in no way capable of quality and interest in most traditional episodes. This episode is extreme and the result is a big flop. <br /> <br /> Do you believe Columbo will never touch the end of the cable? !! <br /> <br /> Frankly, the temptation to turn it off was about two-thirds. <br /> <br /> Oh, the sacrifices we made ourselves do !!!
