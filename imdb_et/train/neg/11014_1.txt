This is the worst film I've ever seen in my life. It says quite a bit, considering some of the choices I've made in renting a movie. <br /> <br /> I got this netflix, relying entirely on the fact that someone I attended high school is topless in it. The Topless scene lasted for about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as fun as the pungee sticks under my toenails, being forced to listen to the Roseanne song Big Spender. <br /> <br /> The skits are foolish and consist of the worst humor of the young bathroom and the gags of the dressing room, and it is so sharp (and bad) hanging on The Kentucky Fried Movie that you beg for Big Jim Slade to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of "Vince's offer" (whoever it is). <br /> <br /> If you are not a masochist, beware of this trash.
