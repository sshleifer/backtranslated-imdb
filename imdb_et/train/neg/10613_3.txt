Dancing was probably the only traceable thing about this movie - and even it was a disappointment compared to other films. My gawd! <br /> <br /> For me, this is the worst film - one that assumes that it is a work of art, because it has all the cinematic works. Yes, it is beautifully photographed, but in the end there is no depth of dance and tension around which the film is supposed to surround. Tango is tease, it's hot, it has drama, it's cruel - that's just what this movie is not.
