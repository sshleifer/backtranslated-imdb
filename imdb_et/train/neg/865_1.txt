I had a misfortune to sit for the whole 102 minutes of what I think is a shockingly bad film. It fails at almost all levels; The cast is terrible, the best-performing ham and the plot have no depth, leaving me with a violent apathetic of any twisted story about the results of the lines. <br /> <br /> Plan B has no charm in this genre, and I found myself in physically different locations where the script changes its regular misjudged curves towards the community region. <br /> <br /> Film with Bona fide saccharin.
