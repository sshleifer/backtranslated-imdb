I just signed up for this commentary (which comes from quite a few of those already here). The performance is worse than the subpar, it talks about the usual stereotypes, has some of the worst tasteful female presentations (all bod brains), and has some human-known cheesy lines. <br /> <br /> Including, but not limited to, "Allright lets you see what these guys can do". I should also mention that if they show the clashes of innocent civilians, you will stop feeling bad about innocent people and hate the characters themselves. The character of Eddie Griffin is also one of the most stereotypical black men who simply rub people in the wrong direction. He may or may not be a good actor, but this film does not allow such character to be investigated. Want a movie that leaves audiences with bad guys? Oceans 11. This film simply makes you hate the vicious, instead of occupying the audience. <br /> <br /> Even cars are not able to make up for this movie momentum. This Enzo, which Griffin destroyed, perfectly captures this film. It just sucks.
