I got this DVD from a friend who got it from someone else (and probably goes on.) Even the DVD cover is cheap, like the whole movie. Punches and fist struggles with late sound effects, some of the worst actors I've seen in my life, a very simple plot, it made me laugh until my stomach hurt! With very little financial resources, I have to admit that it seemed quite professional. Looking at the film, it was one of the twelve of the twelve wannabe gangsters nobody expected. So if you're tired and want a cheap laugh, look at this movie. If not, throw it out of the window.
