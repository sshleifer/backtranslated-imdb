Although behind the house, where Evil Dwells may be intriguing, filling is completely pathetic. I'm not even sure where to start, because I have so many problems with this movie. I think I just think a few of them: <br /> <br /> 1. Acting? When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure and Susan George (and his teeth) are the stars of your movie, you know you're in trouble? Not that it is very important to me, but they are hardly on the A list. Susan George could have been a few movies I enjoy, but I've never seen her as the biggest actor I've ever seen. And in this movie, his behavior is embarrassing. As for the other two, the less is the better. <br /> <br /> 2. Ghosts? Ghosts or spirits, or whatever you call them, reminded me of the ghostly haunted manor house. Disney World. And they are about as scary. And why should they be so obvious? Fineness is not a characteristic of a house where evil lives. <br /> <br /> 3. Content ?? How predictable is one movie? The result of this film is painfully evident after three main characters. If you didn't see where this movie was about 15 minutes away, you'll need to see more movies. <br /> <br /> 4. A comfortable priest? What are the chances that a strange house you buy just happens through a group of Japanese monks? Not to mention that one of them knows the history of his house and comes over, knocks on the door and asks if you need help removing evil spirits. Absurd is the word that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> 5. Anything else ?? It is very difficult for me to think of positive writings. I think I'll give him a point for open scene and house architecture. Is this a sure sign for the winner? The highlighting of architecture as a film does not talk much about the actual film. <br /> <br /> I'll stop. You should get an idea of ​​what I already mentioned. And I haven't even mentioned a tedious little girl or an invasion of crabs or many other problems. Warn, this thing is terrible.
