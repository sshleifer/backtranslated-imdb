What was the sound? It sounded like it was all dubbed. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bad. Plot = bad. Highlights = bad (even Dougray and we live in Scotland), act = bad, harp = bad, sex scenes - bad / remarkable. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, we looked at it until the end of disbelief. How could such a good list of participants act so badly? Will they ever get a decent job? Bad, bad, bad. By the way, we gave it 3 because we have at least been tempted to look at it for an endless observation. <br /> <br /> And for the older reviewer - I totally agree, it was like a romantic farce from the 1940s. How was it done in 2004? <br /> <br /> OK, OK, some OK bits. They had a nice house in Bristol. Dougray was a nice boat. Jennifer looked nice at the little equipment. But how did the sister get all the men?
