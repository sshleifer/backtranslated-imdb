Some people think this movie is classic - I don't know why. It's terrible to be ridiculous. The only sustainable grace of this film is the delivery of cheeses that are so embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh. <br /> <br /> Here are some good songs and good choreography. movie, but so what! There's no plot, it's set in the theater without the change of landscape, and Michael Douglas is as frustrating as ever. My brother forced me to watch this movie because he said I didn't believe how bad the movie would be! He was right. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would recommend this movie to the horrible thing that people shouldn't look at it, but in that case, I think people should, because it puts all the other bad movies you've seen in perspective.
