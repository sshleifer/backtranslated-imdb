I'm so much a fan of Tony Scott movies. When this movie came out, I had a great hope that it would be like "Man On Fire". To find out that the film is the most distant thing about it! The story pulled out of the water and Mickey Rourke's choice wasn't that good. And the whole hand was too free! <br /> <br /> At the heart of the movie is Kiera Kinghtly and this movie shows that she will never become a movie star! The film has brought some of the worst activities ever. <br /> <br /> I like Tony Scott's direction, but it takes the whole friggin cake! Sorry, Ton, out of 10!
