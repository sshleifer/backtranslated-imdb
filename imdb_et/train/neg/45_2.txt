Since the number of videos has not yet been seen, this little bunch of garbage rose to my "rent" list when I saw it. <br /> <br /> The premise is a fashion model or something that has been kidnapped and taken to the jungle to be won by the dirty team of idiots for ransom. Some other horses are hired to bring him back, and he is given a purse that can be used as a negotiating chip, although if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut. He has brought a helicopter and a pilot, and this pilot is one of the worst EVER! In this case, they are all terrible and duplication makes you cry. After going into the jungle, we steal that there is a cannibal culture nearby whose flesheating-landed god travels in the woods like the human king Kong, who is looking for tribes and destroy. Now this companion is just a naked guy who ever has the worst makeup, ping-pong eyes and it's pretty much. Her crumbling and storms are a constant feature of the soundtrack, and I found myself silencing these scenes. <br /> <br /> Did I forget to mention almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason why this movie was forbidden, although there is one particular scene, about one second long, where God attacks a girl and pulls her guts out, but this is not a redemption factor for gore fans. Jess Franco also goes beyond the usual T and A, and also shows the longer close-ups of the female genitalia as well as the male. So, if you want a "fair" exploitation, then you got it. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this to the trash. It's not even a good bad movie. It's just a brutally cushioned trash that only the Video Nasty fan will probably look at it and even if you make the list out, leave it last. When you see it for the first time, you can understand that this is a norm in the list that is certainly not true.
