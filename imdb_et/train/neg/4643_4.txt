I rented this movie on DVD. I knew the film didn't live the way he promised me, but when I saw Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) I had to rent it. It starts pretty well, provided the sneakers are transmitted via cable. But the main character does not have anything to do with her, and the end of the movie is really hanging out for you. There are too many unanswered questions. At the end, there was a great scene that took me by surprise, but in general it is a very subpar movie, but I think it was worth $ 3.99 a rental fee.
