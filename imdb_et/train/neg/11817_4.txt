Pretty average sci-fi movie. The plot was more or less obvious from the beginning. Although the actor was quite good, writing seemed very diffuse, using ideas from numerous films. they have been in orbit. On board, they find a stasis shop that coincides at the same time. After 2 or 3 minutes of people on the pod, you know he's totally crazy. Something that can fully access the research vessel's 3-member crew ... <br /> <br /> After that, it will become every other film that includes a psychotic madman who terrorizes innocent victims, in general I think Speed ​​2 was a better investigation a topic that I didn't consider a good movie. <br /> <br /> Not a good movie, take out the aliens and watch it again. <br /> <br />
