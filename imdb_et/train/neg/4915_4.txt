One of the previous reviewers wrote that the story of Love does not seem to be in the middle; one loved it or hated it. But there seems to be a significant distribution of opinions across the scale of 1-10. For me, this movie was estimated to be 4. There are some beautiful scenes and places, and Ray Milland is turning to fabulous work like Oliver's father. However, the film did not give a particularly convincing job in its story, and the story was not so unique that at least several views were guaranteed, not for me. I can be a bit snob, but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal - I've still not seen Barry Lyndon - most of them, but not all, have been destroyed for me because of my presence. The only exception is What Up, Doc? Where his straight presentation is the perfect underline of Barbra Streisand's goofball protagonist - and not by chance he is a good figure for Love Story! McGraw and O'Neal tend to hug their lines rather than act. <br /> <br /> This movie is remarkable at the beginning of a career: it was Tommy Lee Jones's first film.
