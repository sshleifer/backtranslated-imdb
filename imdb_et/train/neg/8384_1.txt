When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie under 250 movies, I thought it was too harsh, but I knew little about the low rating. <br /> <br /> I'm a great friend of Wayans brothers. I loved my scary movie 2 and even enjoyed white chicks. But the little man had very little smiles and the jokes were old. <br /> <br /> Of course, Marlon Wayans, who plays a recently released dwarf, is joking around. He and his partner Tracy Morgan are stealing a diamond designed for the gangster. Things go awry and the dwarf has to place a diamond with an unsuspecting pair played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. In order to get back the diamond, the dwarf pretends to be an abandoned child who was left in the reach of unexpected couples. Of course he's in and the drama begins with looking for diamonds. <br /> <br /> The film features some actors and actors from Saturday night, including Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider, as well as In Living Color. All these talents, however, are unable to help the poor script and jokes that just weren't funny. <br /> <br /> The special effects that make Marlon Wayans dwarf were OK. I think it wasn't 100% plausible, but it was OK ... something big. I just want Wayans' brothers to do more to develop a good joke script instead of trying to deviate their bad script from the bags of famous comic artists and actors. <br /> <br /> Wait for it with cable or television. It's not really worth the money.
