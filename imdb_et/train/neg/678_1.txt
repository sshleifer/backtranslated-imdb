All I can really say is that I'm glad I made socks while watching the movie, or I would be very angry because I spent 2 hours of my life. The action was terrible, the plot was even worse. There were some scenes that had to be serious for my husband and I smiled. I recommend this movie to people who want to make their own MST3K version.
