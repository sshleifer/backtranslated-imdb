Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who does something to keep her wife young and beautiful. In order to drug brides during wedding ceremonies, it would look like they are dead so that it can steal their body. I'm not sure what he does to the bodies. I do not remember that it was ever fully explained. I know he's doing something out of them and injecting it into his wife. (I just think it's a spinal fluid. Spinal fluid was the rage of crazy scientists of the '40s.) You can pretty much think the rest is here. <br /> <br /> There are a couple (well, really more than a couple, but I only write about the two problems I have with this movie. One of them is the use of Bela. Of course, she does enough work in her excessive way (BTW, the rest is just exhausting. But to hide him in the back of the ear or let him return to the reporter's bedroom to do something, it's just stupid. Also, why has he beaten and / or killed all his henchmen? Well, someone who robs a comatose bride doesn't really have to look bad. <br /> <br /> The other problem I have is the idea of ​​stunning the brides Why brides? 20-year-old women don't look at how Bela goes to these victims, reminded me of an idiotic fisherman who still knows what you did last summer, in any case, it seems easier to achieve your goal by using a seemingly impossible plan that depends on the big under your control (BTW, the alternative title of this movie is the case of lost brides. I think this partly explains the need for brides.)
