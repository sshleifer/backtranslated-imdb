The writer / director of this film knows nothing about the film. I think the development partner of this project was linked and replaced with a monkey, because every vision was either too dark or a warmer place than the sun. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible, the characters were very one-dimensional. So someone would have said that this movie was made for poker fans and not for movie fans, someone jokes about themselves (this was probably a writer / director). No poker fan in this world likes this movie. Even your money hates this project. You don't have any experience with poker to go to the casino and play some hands. Keep your day's work. And if it plays poker, you have to be painful.
