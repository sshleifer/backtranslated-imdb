This film was so predictable that throughout the time you hope the obvious suspect is innocent and there is another big twist. But ... it's not. He just acts horrible, and he ignores it. Mary found very incriminating evidence and still trusted her? And what was "trapping"? There was no catcher. He stepped at him, saying, "Excuse me. I have to kill someone" He left and it was the end. They try to use other suspects (like one of the older carnival girls at the end) but they are completely underdeveloped. In fact, all signs are underdeveloped. They have no depth, and it's just strange ... who hangs at the recycling plant? It's unpleasant and nothing is well developed. For example: if he leaves his place after a beer and he finds the pictures and runs out and he catches him and they end up in that car ... what was that? His reactions were not shown. In the car he was scared as if he could have practically rape - but then everything we see is in the next morning in the shower. booooooooo It could have been so much better .. so much better.
