INSPECTOR GADGET (1999) ** <br /> <br /> Star: Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Andy Dick, Dabney Coleman Director: David Kellogg 80 minutes Rated PG <br /> <br /> Blake French: <br /> <br /> Disney's new film "Inspector Gadget" is related to a policeman named John, who lives in a disaster and has been recorded in a modern experimental operation that turns him into a robotic machine-like agent at his disposal using tools and constructions when he says "Go Go", which is called the Inspector Gadget! <br /> <br /> The actual movie structure is similar to creating an inspector widget itself. It is noisy, fragmented, energetic and consists of a number of half-hearted contractions that are put together to do something that doesn't contain much else. The film is basically a series of actions that are sort of stuck together with characters and an uneven story that only 6-9 year olds would enjoy. played by Matthew Broderick, who until the "Inspector Gadget" was blessed with films like "Elections". His character becomes the Inspector's Gadget after he met Claw, a heavy-handed frog in the movie. He is played by Rupert Everett, who has already experienced a terrible "William Shakespeare Midsummer Nights Dream" this year. <br /> <br /> In this movie there is a romantic sub-block and plenty of scenes that include the weak body parts and mechanism elements of the Inspector widget. It has Gadget and Claw, who flee to the attractive character Brenda played by Joely Fisher, both for her appearance and for the knowledge of a particular invention made by her late father, previously killed by Claw. Competition develops into combat scenes and causes a number of events in the film. Also the main character is Gadget Mobil, a life like a car that has been developed on the inspector gadget. This is expressed by D.L. Hughly from sitcom comedy "Hughly's." <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" is a movie that I found quite bad. I know I'm not just a target audience for filmmakers, but even my 10-year-old relative found the movie with their unpleasantness. The film is full of various mistakes and obvious problems. I never found signs of caring. There is no mood disorder except for some clean opening credits, unlike the much worse 1997 movie "Mr. Magoo" that opened the original comic book clips. Is it too much to ask the same type of things in this comedy that is rarely funny and hardly convincing. The overall design of the production is nothing more than the confusion of incomplete visual disturbances and it is made up of one joke: the cosiness of the Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> In such films, the audience wants to see boundaries - something that helps to find out what can happen and what can't. There are no such limits in the "Inspector Gadget". It is really something other than the time of the actors who were very fun. I am reminded of the comedy "Blankman" released a few years ago, which again contained many props and energy, and the participants had a great time with all the gizmos and props, but it also lacked something that would be needed for each film: audience participation. <br /> <br /> The character I find to be a lot is the daughter of the Gadgets who, at the end of the movie, still has no idea what her name was. He is used only as a plot device and I doubt how he used it to develop the plot. His presence does not bring anything important or productive to the film. We never know our reactions to dad's actions or accidents. So this is someone who could have left out completely and wouldn't have had a little impact on the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to say that the "Inspector Gadget" is a terrible, inadequate excuse for children's comedy. And believe it or not, I'll find myself comparing this film with the violent and very anti-youth audience of recent years "Blade". I reassure you that I have a lot more in the movie where nothing happens than everything happens. At the same time, "Inspector Gadget" was as much as it did, literally feeling dizzy. <br /> <br />
