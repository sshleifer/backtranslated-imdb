This is the romance of the most saccharin I ever sat. The perfect film for an empty housewife in claws, housewares, and ostriches in high-end mules to look at afternoons lying on the couch. In fact, bonuses play an important role in the movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I got to the end was to finally see the dream face of Keanu Reeves in almost every scene. In most of his films he moves too fast to get a good look. The only quick action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini, who casts his hands on Latin emotion - more Italian than Mexico. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is as strong as wood. Unfortunately, the rails are not hanging - the hero is shamefully perfect and light. The aristocratic warm-blooded old-world family clinic is as old as the mountains. What is it if they are Irish or Italian or Mexico? This is a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> Before I made the headlines, I knew it wouldn't be the movie I was hoping for. Glowing grapes looked like advertisements for all foods in a women's daily newspaper. I didn't see her name, but the art director was definitely Thomas Kinkade, who paints millions of dollars from Irish houses on canvas that has been in fuchsia. This film was literally viewed through pink glasses. If you like dreamy pink and blue sky, this movie is for you! (Bonuses also seemed very good!)
