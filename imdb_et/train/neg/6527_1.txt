Certainly, it is not bad for a TV show for children on Saturday morning. After all, these manufacturers had to hope that the audience would come back. Well, at this terrible offer, they could at least read the money they saved in the collections. The script might have been a bit of a forgotten space opera rejection, a couple of ridiculous lines to add to the cool guy Gerald Mohr to murder Naura Hayden. No director would have been able to do something like this for a gentle talk, so that this action will be forever. The spacecraft requisites are absurd - for example, the Bulova wall clock and the portable typewriter - but the planet has to be the worst in cinematography. Most of them are crude oil drawings and all of them are sworn often in the wrong red light. Even Mohr's bare hairy chest is used in proportion. And it's bad - like a plot thin. Any viewer able to finish this movie will hear the March message - and will probably agree completely!
