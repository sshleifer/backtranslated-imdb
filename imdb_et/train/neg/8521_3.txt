It also gives some plots. Charlie Brown's Christmas is one of those timeless classics that teaches you the value of Christmas and just enjoying your holidays. But that is not the case. He's trying to capture A Charlie Brown's Christmas emotions, there is even another Christmas fight, but he can't do it with twilight and light jokes. Charlie Brown no longer thinks about the spirit of Christmas, but instead wants to buy a Peggy Jean gift ($ 25 gloves ... what?). His sister Sally is the most annoying character of the movie. Here's one of his jokes: Sally wants to write Santa's letter, but he doesn't know how to write Charlie (for whatever reason he must be in his letter), that's why he's called Sam because he knows how to write Sam. Sally also plays angel with one word a day: "Hark!" Instead, he says a hockey stick (har har). If Sally says to think 12 times (all strange sounds exactly the same) will not kill you, nothing comes. Peppermint Patty and Marcy are big contact points, but it hardly makes it better. Marcy's funny answers to Patty, but Patty is another story. He sounds like a boy (who doesn't talk about rumors) and gets crazy when he has to play sheep (terrible base and everything). Obviously she has sheep every year and is worried that she will forget her lines (lines she doesn't have). He's so worried he'll mention it twice, one right after the other, and he gets the same answer. I assume he needs to have a short-term memory loss or something. Lucy and Linus are more welcome (although Linus still has annoying tips), but hardly a lot of time. I'm sure Schroeder is not even in that. All in all, it tries to be a parasite to its original, but threatened the message with some quick laughs.
