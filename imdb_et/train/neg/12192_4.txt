I think we all start with many comments: "It could have been a very good movie." Demented ex-con freshly sprung, orderly suburban family for his purpose. Revenge, punishment, manipulation. Marty's usual Karo syrup installation. But unfortunately, the monument to the universe's high-rise fell: everyone put it up. <br /> <br /> Nolte talks only with raised eyebrows, Lange slips through cigarettes, Lewis "Ohmagodi!" Her paths to her scenes and Bobby D ... well, she's a whole other magic carpet. He influences a Cajun / Huckleberry hurt-accent hybrid, he breaks the fat cigars and grabs random fears like "Troubled Child". And I want you to depict the above-mentioned accent. Imagine now that it would spray the religious rhetoric of brain clanging as it swallowed six bibles and you have a De Niro schtick here. But most of the troublesome is the use of his most used "De Niro face" because he is so puzzled. Eyes sliding, forehead wrinkled, lips curled. Crimany, Bob, you saw like Plastic Man. <br /> <br /> The story probably started off the screen 14 years earlier when Nolte was unable to prevent De Niro's time in the shelter from various attacks. When released, he feels that Nolte lies behind him, and that he and his relatives are being terrorized. And we should give De Niro a character a bit, because Nolte kept the information that could shorten his sentence. De Niro is one of those criminals who feel that the lack of freedom justifies continuing such acts, even though he is guilty of inexplicable acts. Mmm-kay. <br /> <br /> She goes to Notle's mistress (after some maybe wants to turn back), her wife, her daughter, a family dog, you know. What is one of the drawbacks of the Wesley Strick scenario: perfect predictability. Since all of De Niro's harassment is becoming more frightening, you can call a lot before the rest of the case. Strick should not be completely discredited because he leads some compelling dialogue-driven moments (De Niro's and Lewis's dull theater is the best scene in the film), but most of the time it is all-over. Scorsese's cartoon approach comes out as forced, not to mention HORRIBLY's outdated Bernard Hermann score (I was expecting Wolf Man to appear with a genetically extended tarantula). <br /> <br /> This is how we reach the comic part of the flick. Inadvertently comedy, that is. You know those scenes that are terribly terrible, but you can't help but see the sight of others? You do it here. Nolte and Lange talk about infidelity, the flirting of De Niro's thumb, the dressing and slipping of the kitchen to a certain substance to be believed. And Bob's infernal, incessant, CONSTANT, mind-damaging, endless vision of all the "philosophy" he had in prison. I wanted him to kill him to prevent him more than to save this annoying family. <br /> <br /> I always hate to borrow ideas from other reviewers, but here it is necessary. It's really a * Scorsese version of Freddy Krueger. The way De Niro learns, speaks, stems, can withstand pain, only with his one liner, is vintage Freddy. After kneeling is kneeling: "Are you trying to" hot? "Please. And this is just one example. <br /> <br /> If you weren't an original 1962 fan, you want and want Balsam, Peck and Mitchum to see almost 30 years later (or want a serious head-shattering movie ), avoid traveling to Cape.
