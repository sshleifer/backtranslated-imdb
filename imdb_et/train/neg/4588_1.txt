I have created my reality when I stepped out of the theater, which my girlfriend raped with my mother. We (my g-friend and I) walked for about an hour. What is the burden of a pseudo-scientific new age jargon. <br /> <br /> Sub-atomic particles are thoughts? By sticking labels to water bottles and blessing with a Buddhist monk, did that little real crystal grow? The decline in the murder rate in DC was 25% when the number of people wondered. Wow, which is a rigorous scientific study. I'm sure someone ate cheerios on the same day straight. Should we conclude that eating cheerioside caused a decrease in the murder rate? <br /> <br /> Hogwash, hooey, bullshit! <br /> <br /> BTW- This was funded by the Ramtha cult, whose leader was one of the experts who were interviewed by filmmakers. There are no rear motives here, right?
