What did producer / director Stanley Kramer show in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy in a very puzzling scenario? Were there a few pieces for purpose? And how are Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this very confused story? <br /> <br /> And why was the terrible force that gave Candice Bergen such a grateful role? <br /> <br /> The Domino Principle wants to be on the same footing as Parallax or Manchur and leaves a very wide margin on the mark. Stanley Kramer's main mistake.
