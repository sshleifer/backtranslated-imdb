I recently stumbled upon Nine Dead and read the current comments that I thought I could do with the middle film. However, this film was a bit below average, but traceable. The script was poorly written and it was a B-level film with a couple of good ones. At the border of the plot is the boundary of the Sawi, to teach people what they did wrong in the situation, and to try to value them more for life, but this is actually the place where the comparison ends. Nine dead are trying to heart and purpose behind simple ideas that are not new. The main mistake I found in the nine dead was a tear face to the eye-catchers, which took place 3 minutes before the film and was a totally unnecessary and completely inadequate end for people not to see in a bad way. . Blocking spoilers has seen a worse situation with bad movies, and even they didn't end it badly. Decent flick, bad performance and ends ...
