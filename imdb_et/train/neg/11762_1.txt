In South Africa, it is an insult to think that someone was actually paid for its nonsense production. <br /> <br /> Although the director was one of the original Shaka Zulu mini writers, the series is terrible! The original series was based on historical facts about a person who was a great strategist, leader and warrior. A man who played a major role in shaping the history of local tribes in South Africa. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie, however, is nothing more than a horse-water that has been scraped from below. has not been able to impress since the mid-nineties. <br /> <br /> While Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are the good actors David Hasselhoff is doing here, are the slaves sinking with their red boy and bleached smile? <br /> <br /> I was expecting blonde, busty women to appear somewhere and run the screen in their tiny red swimsuit for no apparent reason. Not that it was more bizarre than a fantastic plot line that had probably dreamed of having a 10 pint of beer at a fancy dress event where someone's caveman costume inspired the writer to return to the African theme for his next "blocker". .
