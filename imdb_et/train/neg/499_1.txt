Horror Channel plays not only the erotic soft porn gothic flicks every night from 10 am to 4 pm, but their "scary" factor is very limited, if any. In fact, I'm sure I will find a multi-million pound lottery that will win more scary than what this channel offers. <br /> <br /> Bloodsucker Leads, which dance deserves special attention, because I feel the undisputed low channel full of lower. I can't even tell you how bad this film is, but in order to meet the minimum of 10 lines required on this site, I'll give it at least. <br /> <br /> First, the title is misleading and not similar to the on-screen activity. In fact, a movie can also be called a "toothbrush" or "background image" of everything that is related to it. At least they used toothbrushes ... at least they were wallpapers. <br /> <br /> There are no blood cleaners around miles, and worse, no dances, no one. I'm sure they made two different films wrong. <br /> <br /> A more suitable title would have been, "Horny Italian Count takes five people to a scary castle and carries us silly in ninety minutes." Yes, what's better. <br /> <br /> Operation is terrible and duplication is terrible, and the man who plays Seymour was almost as wooden in his walking as he was ... abysmal. /> <br /> The only sustainable prizes of this movie are the small but somewhat interesting lesbian sex scene, two small and very interesting heterosexual sexual scenes and the added attraction that every female character gets her kit out. Bonus. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, drive away a wide birth. No vampire, dancing, brutal or creepy scenes or any way for gods I never see it. <br /> <br /> The wrong word, this movie could make you remove movies for life.
