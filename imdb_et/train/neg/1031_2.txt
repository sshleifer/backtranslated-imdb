This movie is one long chiche after another. First of all, though they did their part, there is an unreasonable stage where John sniffs like an idiot. Wigs and accents are terrible. They sound worse than the old Beatle cartoons. John is a nasty, envious, homosexual closet, a Yoko slave, which he depicts in a discredited Albert Goldman book. They even keep the song headlines in the usual conversation "it was always just our two"! John wouldn't have liked his fans either. As his death showed us he was too nice than anything. One funny scene is the place where stupid Beatle fan only recognizes John and asks him to sing to Paul yesterday. One insulted John says something like "Of course, and when I crown, why don't you kneel down, put your wife's wig and lick my lips." It made me laugh. Really, this movie is funny, how serious it is trying to come down ridiculously. John and Paul did not sit all day pontificating, they were funny, light-hearted boys who, even during the Beatles, disintegrated much more peacefully than they imagined here. Forget it.
