It was a really bad movie. The biggest reason for this flop was the character "Cole" played by Michael Moriarty. The actor felt that creating an incredibly uncomfortable southern pull would make this character bad, it wasn't. After about 20 minutes, if I had wanted the speech therapist to appear, it would have added some sincerity. <br /> <br /> - 1) Bad - 2) Undead characters - 3) Razor thin line <br /> <br /> Yuck! <br /> <br />
