... but it just doesn't work and I'm surprised how many people consider it good. For what reasons? There are some loose tips here and there, but the whole material is self-conscious and convincing. Lynch films are generally intriguing because they create confusion and are still very playful. There is some visual thought, some subplots, characters, ideas, etc. But it's boring and yes, pointless. Because everything that needs to be explored is either "small", too far drawn, or simply described above. It's just Lynch, who is investigating DV, nothing else, as it should be treated. 1/10
