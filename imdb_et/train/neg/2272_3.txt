I am not a regular viewer of Springer, but I look at his exhibition as a glimpse, and I think this show is a good guilt and a good chance to kill for a while. So of course I look forward to seeing this movie to see "Jerry Springer Uncensored". First of all, Jerry will appear about twenty minutes of movie time. The second hour and twenty minutes is spent on building this pseudo-farce on trailer-trash, jealousy, incest, and fraud. Jaime Pressley (who looks hot as HELLLL) is a trailer-garbage bitch who sleeps with her father (very unusual, chain-smoker, drunk Michael Dudikoff, who is ultimately a hero of his activities). Mom finds the thing, they get into the fight, they want to show it to the "Jerry" show (that's right, from Springer). And then we have a parallel story with an African-American couple. They will take this "Jerry" show. Characters collide. Blah, blah, watch blah! The Recycle Bin is BORRRINGG !!!! I was wondering why Hell Springer has millions of fans, but none of them checked their movie. Well, now it's quite obvious !! Do you love her or hate her, hate this movie! How do I explain? This is the complete confusion of the film (if you call it). It's so badly changed, scenes that just don't connect, and after a while, the ghost has practically disappeared and it's just the whole map! Imagine a predictable soap opera that would become a comic. Rarely laughs. <br /> <br /> My only positive comment is the hot girl-girl. It's as steadfast as it gets. Don't get me wrong, the scene is upright, but if you look at a general movie that compares it to the Springer program material - this catastrophic farce seems to be extremely disinfected. <br /> <br /> My score: 3 (out of 10)
