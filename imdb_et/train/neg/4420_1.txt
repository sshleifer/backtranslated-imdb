"All that is a great documentary"? Yes, if someone is deaf, stupid and blind. Everything except meaning, mind, visual style and interesting subject. Besides that. . Seriously, Volken. This is a film that is completely authentic. An adventure without adventure, a war document with no knowledge of war, a campy send-up with no trace. It does not mean anything, does not know anything and carries an indirect message that is not important. No wonder it has so many IMDb fans! Of course, you do not have the big Skip Lipman starring in culture, intelligence, spirituality (except corrosive juvenile jokes) and recognizing human emotion? just adrenaline. "Darkon" is not a movie - it's a panic attack! Avoid. There are too many real documentaries and too little time to waste on building lounges, such as Darkon.
