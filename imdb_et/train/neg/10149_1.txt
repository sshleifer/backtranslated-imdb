I can't believe that Steven Segal's career has been so low that he has been reduced to fifth-grade secondary actors to make 4th grade films. I was looking forward to seeing this movement, so that he could see him out of some sugar beet as he usually did. If he is reduced to using one of the jazz pieces between the shoulders to remove the opponent and the boy falls like tons of bricks, there is something wrong. <br /> <br /> The plot is incredible and even if you apologize for the visuals and read this story as a novel, you might have wondered why you even picked up the book. <br /> <br /> Steven Segal passes through the suggestions and seems to be just because he has a duty. He does not see any effort and enthusiasm, and in some scenes he does not appear at all. <br /> <br /> I don't want to repeat other people's comments, but use frame recordings for cut scenes and visual images. aircraft planes are pathetic. The condition of the scenes that have been cut is shaky and scenes have deteriorated over time. The amazing film that shows President John F Kennedy's murder is more stable and cleaner. <br /> <br /> My honest opinion is to say that you don't waste your time watching this movie, it does not meet the standards of its work by a glowing man or outgoing wounds. I read one review that said the film had a $ 12 million budget (5 paid to Segal) and that the film was still in the budget. I have to agree. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder this is a direct DVD movie because no conscientious theater owner plays this movie.
