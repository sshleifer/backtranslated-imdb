"The Dream Child" is the fifth film of the "Nightmare" series in 1989 (generally overrated), and since then the series has got all the garbage. The only good films were Wes Craven's original 1984 and the third part of 1987, The Dream Warriors. The second part was disappointing and boring, and it was the fourth part where the former frightening madman Freddy Krueger began to irritate with the constant idiotic jokes. In this fifth series, little is recommended except for (rather large) visual images and one horrible scene, the setback of how Freddy Krueger emerged. The rest of the film consists mainly of our shaving habits of a manic-turned-joker who screams out foolish linings, and a bunch of old-fashioned teenage jackasses who are desperately trying to avoid falling asleep because good old Freddy is waiting for those dreams. Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson and a number of uninteresting nonsense, such as the super-stupid 'nervous' rhyme has been added for some other reason than to have any justification for continuing this excess and boredom. .. In short: there is no originality, but the fall of the old formula and painful annoyance of jokes. My (generous) rating of 3/10 is due to the great visuals and especially to highlight the difference to the terrible next stage, "Freddy's Dead", which is terribly incredible. If you are not hardcore, you should avoid Freddy Krueger's enthusiast, "The Child of Dreams", and even if you are, it's more than likely to be disappointed.
