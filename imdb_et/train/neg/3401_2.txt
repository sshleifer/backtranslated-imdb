I borrowed this movie after hearing that it wasn't for an academic prize, but once it has been reviewed, it's easy to see why it didn't. Despite its beautiful photography, the film is amazingly slow, despite having almost any plot. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a young boy trying to get his parents to death in what might not have been an accident (the film is never clear about that) and how his grandfather told him fairy tales. The fairy tale contains only the bits of interest to the plot, but they are very short and don't really look like a point. <br /> <br /> The first fairy tale is especially about a boy who is trying to save a magical flower to his dead girlfriend, but the boy will delay when he tastes the flower first to make sure it's not toxic. it is too late for him to save his girlfriend - the grandfather says morality is that the boy was too impatient, but it doesn't make sense because it was overuse and slowness that led to his failure. The perfect metaphor for this movie. <br /> <br /> Skye photography is beautiful, but this year, Stardus has another movie about fairy-tale pictures filmed in Skye - and it's better than that.
