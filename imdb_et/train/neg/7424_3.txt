A very, funny movie price here with Stella Stevens, who is going to hide from someone (it didn't take me long to guess who it was) in the Old Nevada city outside of Vegas, Circus Circus hotel in Las Vegas. Stevens directs the power of his thirty girls and they find that they have to act much faster than expected. Despite some glance at Las Vegas in the 1970s, with the most average, but reliably acting, and with a potential plot, the Las Vegas Lady sets one big boring egg. The film seems to change forever, and if it does, it will never accelerate here and there. I was disappointed with this movie. Of course, I didn't expect anything big, but at least I thought it might be one of those 70's pure exploitation movies or something like that. Not even close. No one will die. One year before his big performance, as the prosecutor's lawyer Bugliosa Helter in Skeleton, is a flat gunfight between Creaky Stuart Whitman and the official George DiCenzo. The bomb attack is all abrupt to look at the waterfall. With a sensitive instrument, there is one blow and one head. In addition, nothing is involved in the activity. And like girls, don't wait there. Stella and her girls (both very mediocre but pretty talented, sauna and bath. What do we see? Something other than a short side profile. Stella wears these nice open blouses that emphasize her true talent, but I wish she would have been a little more open with my presentation, so I could write one thing that would like to recommend the film. Yes, it wasn't, and I have little to say about this movie.
