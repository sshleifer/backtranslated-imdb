1975 THE MASTER OF THE ECONOMY is an amazing and wonderful film. This is not because the fight is particularly inspired or because the film has no meaning at all. This is because the film is so stupid and overwhelming that it is classic in the camp - bad, but enjoyable. The film stands for a blind man with a frisbee-like device in the chain that splits the head of a person when he expertly throws it at his enemies! Who cares that physics is impossible or that the film has foolish things like fighters who have a 12-foot papier-mache hand or a guy was blind! It's just a ball to watch from start to finish - and one of my favorite "bad" movies and nice to see friends. <br /> <br /> Because of this movie, I was eager to see FATAL FLYING GUILLOTINES (1977), although unfortunately it turned out to NOT be a sequel, but a little scratch - taking many original ideas, but leaving the film unchanged or traceable. Of course, this is silly fun, but it is never close to the captain of the FLILLING GUILLOTINE of entertainment value. Like the original film, there are some wonderful tools that break your head, but they are quite different - with a circular saw blade and almost your own mind. There is also no blind man, but there are a bunch of bad people who do not really have the depth and do not look at the audience exactly what is happening in this dubbed version of English because the plot is completely incomprehensible. However, some martial arts activities are very good. Although it does not meet the high standards of most Bruce Lee or Sonny Chiba films, it is a ridiculous and often confusing one. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a movie that martial arts fans may like (despite its many, many, many, many, drawbacks), but also what others are likely to hysterically turn off or laugh instead of acting because the film is just so ridiculous. But most importantly, it is never as funny or traceable as FLILLING GUILLOTINE MASTER. Damage.
