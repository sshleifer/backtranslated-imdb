Oliver Gruner is totally unknown to me. My friend showed me this movie because he had seen Gruner what he called a pretty good sci-fi movie Nemesis. So when we watched it, we found ourselves through the drama parts of the BS simply to reach incredible sequences of action. Gruner loves kick and kick and kick. And hit! haha <br /> <br /> Gruner's character is a graduate student who is forced to stay close to the ghetto he grew up with. He follows himself with the son who lives with him because he really wants to join the Mexican gang, which tortures his family. Instead of joining, Gruner tells the boy to fight back (against the gang?). Gruner plays a typical Van Damme character who kills everyone (or maimes them badly) and works to get rid of these gang players. <br /> <br /> The plot was very exciting and easy to think about. Gruner is probably not very well-known, because it is possible to choose his movie to compare possible choices. This ghetto is pure hell and I liked to see that the character team passes it as if they were able to resist Gruner's character. Music was a typical performance music (beat piano and tympanum, shining guitars), which really wasn't as bad as it sounds. The director really needed to keep going, instead of making a tight family break every 5 minutes for a moment. <br /> <br /> Finally, I gave him 4/10 because he really tried to be a normal movie, Oliver Gruner celebrated, but the overall feeling of the movie leaves you wanting to close what you just saw.
