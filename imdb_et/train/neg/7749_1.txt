This film would never have been made. Badly done animation to bad action. I'm not sure at what time people said behind this movie: "Ok, look good! I was terrified of this movie. At one point that has been very good, the computer-generated golden tooth has fallen from the roof that grabs the mouth in the mouth The movie's villain was paralyzed by sabretooth, which was killed within minutes of its first appearance, and the other two are able to kill a handful of people before burning and retreating, then the jungle is a casual waiting for victims that scares me for just one reason. God is a part of people everywhere I hope not. <br /> <br /> This movie was a pure garbage.
