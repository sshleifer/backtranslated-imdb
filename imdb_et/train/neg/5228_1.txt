I saw this movie the second night. I can't even start sucking this movie. Writing, voice acting, even blaming. Terrible, terrible, terrible. It's like watching 24-hour C-Span for comedy. It just doesn't work. It is literally about every possible place. <br /> <br /> The movie's animation is also of very poor quality. I know it's a man-made film, but suppose he can make a 97-minute-old crap, maybe he's funny for at least one second. <br /> <br /> This exhibition can take the cake all the time as the worst movie. Yikes. It was really so bad. If you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh, avoid this abomination. My advice: don't even buy it or look for it. Your brain is about you.
