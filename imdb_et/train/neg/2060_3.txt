A repressed housewife (an annoying addition to Angie Dickinson, whose body doubles / frightens us with extreme joy) is her husband sexually bored and decides to branch out. This directly leads to a number of murders that will soon involve a high-level prostitute (Nancy Allen, obviously in the wrong business when SHE can bring home $ 600 at night and his psychologist (Michael Caine). If you look at the hang of De Palma (excuse me, "respect") Hitchcock, look at "Sisters" instead. "Dressed to kill", being a style and technical skill, is one of the most sticky thrillers I've had with discontent. The plot is absurd and tired. It contains some surprisingly effective intimidation disorders and nasty graphical murders that should wait for all the horror blowers when they get along a stupid line that must be dated back in 1980.
