Probably the worst film I've ever seen. When has Hollywood ever made a successful film that attacked Republicans? Why don't they learn. Dixie chicks are not. These Lefties are living in their elite bubbles that interact with each other; not forgetting the fact that most of America is much better than they are. <br /> <br /> The best Hollywood productions are not partisans and rarely political at all. <br /> <br /> The imitation of Dan Akroyd's Cheney was bad. <br /> <br /> I would have thought Cussack could have landed on better movies. <br /> <br /> It wasn't funny.
