First of all, I would just like to say to everyone who has seen this movie, that the actor who played the transvestite is one of my friends, his name is Robert Dugdale, he is a terrible actor, although it doesn't say much about his filmography, he has been in many games and musicals . He currently lives in Terrace B.C. this is where I come from, he comes to our house almost every Saturday * laughs * Okay, now about the movie, I don't recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it because it's not a movie worth watching, the main reason why i found it to be a bad movie, it is never in place, it bounces from time to time, so some points find it difficult to follow, and secondly, that it really bores * laughs * the movie just doesn't compare.
