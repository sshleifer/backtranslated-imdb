What? Should Jamie Foxx be funny? Does he really believe he's funny? Well, it's funny, watching his confidence in joking. The man does not know any identity ... I mean you can immediately see who his idols are, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, because he is trying to imitate them in most of his films. The only problem is that he does it badly, unevenly, and what comes out is some parts where he looks somewhat like Denzel, with his mechanic ** T attitude and then suddenly Martin Lawrence, a funny and clumsy-silly comic . It's not personally touched, I mean, he's not helping someone in the person he's trying to sell, and I'm sure he doesn't have anything to say personally. He's really Mr Dull-boy personally. <br /> <br /> I really hoped for Hollywood, and the American black community thinks it would be better for someone to run a superstore, such as Don Cheadle, but maybe the pathetic Jamie better represents the old generation.
