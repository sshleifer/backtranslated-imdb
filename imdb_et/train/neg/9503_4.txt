Also known as "Exorcism House", this filthy <br /> <br /> small movie takes so seriously that it kills all the entertainment values ​​<br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The backup card includes the European tourist Elke Sommer, who has the opportunity to travel with Telly Clay, who looks like a devil who saw a fresco square. Sommer will be given the opportunity to ride <br /> <br /> in a secret house where Savala happens. There, his long dead wife is misled and the actual <br /> <br /> soap opera theater begins. In the dark matriarch of the house, there was a male dead woman who was the groom of the matriarch's sons. A couple who drove to Sommer? <br /> <br /> The woman gives the drivers a "back seat <br /> <br /> lesson" and the husband knows and doesn't care. Ultimately, most of the cast is killed, Sommer is stunned and raped, <br /> <br /> flees, and the viewer is put to the top of an empty <br /> airplane ... which must be similar to empty theaters <br /> /> the thing that was played. <br /> <br /> In this alternative version of "Exorcism House", scenes have been added to the priest's involvement. <br /> <br /> A copy of this VHS from Elite Entertainment is crystal clear and <br /> <br /> a letter. After the end credit is "extras"; deleted sex <br /> <br /> and scenes. <br /> <br /> Mario Bava's direction is fast and furious, but his scenario is awful. There are half-baked ideas, abandoned drawings, and <br /> <br /> stunning amenities that do nothing more than just that. You have life like a mannequin in a funeral, the dark matriarch does not all work as blind, <br /> <br /> and the same lollipops that he had "Kojakis" (who <br /> <br /> haunted, baby?) Are given to Savala. . <br /> <br /> The project seems to have two names, then written the script <br /> <br /> quickly. takes place in Hollywood every day <br /> <br />. Savalas seems completely lost by offering his <br /> <br /> lines to stop and wishing his character not to die "The Dirty <br /> <br /> Dose." Sommer runs around and screams and hits a lot, but <br /> <br /> his character is empty, I use the term "character" loosely. <br /> <br /> The only thing we know about him is his name. <br /> <br /> This is a real strange movie and your reaction to it may depend on how strong you are in Eurohorror and Kojak. In the case of one I can't add "Add and Fuck" to <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> It is unrated and contains all the accessories at the end of VHS <br /> <br /> copy, includes strong physical violence, sexual violence, strong <br /> <br /> gore, strong female nudity, Men's Nudity, Sexual Content and Adults <br /> <br />
