With this erotic thriller, which obviously expresses Joel Schumacher's 8MM, it is again veteran-sleazeball Bruno Matte. But as expected, Mattei makes his movie with a small budget, so it's just released when it's just released. <br /> <br /> After her daughter's robbery, her mother enters the underground world of pornography because the kidnappers are part of an international organization that directs snuff as long as exclusive customers pay well. Finding her daughter does not lead her mother across Europe but also to prostitution. He goes to bed with some men to get his clues. When he finally comes in contact with a mysterious scouting organization led by Dr. Hades, he is in great danger. <br /> <br /> There is not much good to say about this, although it is going to allow. The problem is that the film is far from slippery or explicit, as one would expect from a director who was dealing with films like BLADE VIOLENT. SNUFF TRAP (which first appeared in Russia!) Is not quite gory nor does it include nudity and sex to really keep the viewer's attention. The plot is not so special, except perhaps surprisingly in many different places all over Europe. The end is very disappointing. Operation is not remarkable, except for Anita Auer, who plays Doctor Hadesi: she looks and acts extremely horrible. You don't want to meet him like that in a dark alley (or in your bedroom, on that matter). <br /> <br /> All in all, SNUFF TRAP only calls Bruno Mattei movie collectors. But it is good to see the man again on the wheel: it was his first thriller since 1994. GLI OCCHI DENTRO.
