Mona lives vaginally on the fringes of French society, with no meaning, no purpose or no direction. <br /> <br /> I was looking at it because of all the star reviews, but I'm afraid I need to miss something. Mona's character is little or no personality, while she lives through life, being rude to people, high rise, and nothing that puts her in life. He's not interesting or exciting. He's just useless. <br /> <br /> I have seen and known enough people to have no secret. They're just lazy. I wouldn't want Monat somewhere near me because he tends to steal anything that is not nailed and leave his friends out of fear. Of course he is mysterious - he has nothing. Many junkies, winos and booms I've seen have been puzzling; I don't want to see a movie about them either. <br /> <br /> There may be something I totally missed. Otherwise, I assume that all reviews come from people who take something that a French female director is a high art.
