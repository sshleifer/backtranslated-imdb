It listens back to matin√©e days when the children with whom there is no time anywhere else went to their balcony after the dumping of their younger siblings. It didn't matter what was on the screen - the little kids would sit out and the big kids would ignore it. Of course, adults never see it. <br /> <br /> But they put it on the video, but most other "B" horrors with a low budget for the golden age. on television. The natural and inadvertent humor of this film stems from an outdated ideology ("bad girls" who are picked up to replace poor Jani's broken body - they had come), an over-exploited plot (a crazy scientist trying to play God), a violent but conscientious monster (whose presence so far has been seen as usual) a scientist in a rural laboratory has never been fully explained) and acts so that it polarises from wood or from above. <br /> <br /> This is a great fiction film, assuming your guests enjoy the dialogue and commentary on otherwise amazing cinematic works. In fact, if you or your guests prefer passive entertainment, this movie is also available in the video editing "Mystery Science Theater 3000", where the host of hosts and dolls make the improvements you need.
