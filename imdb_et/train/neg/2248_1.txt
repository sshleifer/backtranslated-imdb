This movie is a huge steamy pile. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why anyone felt that the Garland / Mason version needed to be redesigned and why Striesand would have been the first choice of asterisks. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why our people (Gay Americans) tend to treat Striesand as treasure. At least in my opinion, he was a professional with a top-notch funny girl and Bogdanovich's What Up Doc. <br /> <br /> Take your preference and rent Judy's classic or even original (good movie), but please, please, please leave this stinkpot!
