When reviewing this movie, I can only go to my weekend warrior, who is doing his core training in July, August and September 1971 on the ground in Fort Polk, Louisiana. Take high ground was nothing like I remember basic training. <br /> <br /> But what was in Korea after that had to be remembered, which ended in a dead end, but it was a normal war when we knew them. It was not Vietnam, a jungle warfare war where we poured painless endless holes. At that time, the draft was undesirable, but was still considered necessary for state protection. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is a Korean veteran now assigned to the country to train troops to go abroad. The film is about one of his training cycles and a group of man he has to train. They are the usual ones you will find in almost all the war films of the last decade. One of the things I appreciate about Take The High Ground is that MGM now recognized our army as an integrated, black William recruit. It was consistent with the changing times. <br /> <br /> But I say that recruiting like Russ Tamblyn would have been treated with his lovely mouth from day one. Richard Widmark would not have risked death or eunuch to give Jerome Courtland confidence in the weapon. And in no way would he be so concerned about Robert Arthur's desertification. He has just let Members deal with him. <br /> <br /> Of course, fired at Fort Bliss and El Paso, and around Texas, Take the High Ground gave good authenticity. But look at it as an army recruitment film and you will definitely understand why the government was so eager to work together a day ago. <br /> <br /> I remember the cage sergeants who have small conflicts that you might want to take if you were not worried about the fact that they had something about 95% of their time. However, Karl Malden would not have had the opportunity to work out a number of witnesses during the open training in Widmark training. Both would have realized that it would have undermined authority, something that the military would not let it happen. talented director Richard Brooks, even Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington's silly theme that was fresh from the Oscar a year before High Noon. The film actually became the best scenario for the Oscar nomination and the story for Millard Kaufman. It must have been Kaufman's lively imagination.
