Before I explain the "Alias" comment, let me say that the "Desert Trail" is bad even according to Western standards that look at the Three Stooges. In fact, Carmen Laroux, as a half-haired girl, includes Juanitana, when you hear her Mexican accent, then you recognize her immediately from Senorita Rita's classic Stooge short "Belle Recorded". <br /> <br /> "Desert Trail" plays John Wayne to play Moe Howard's character and Eddy Chandler plays Curly Howard. Like their Stooge counterparts, the 53-minute rolling gag of Moe is Curly. Wayne's character, the temptation of the temptation, is not very cute, but it should be a good man. Wayne rodeo cowboy Wayne plays a rodeo office at the gun point and takes the money he could have if the presence income had been good - other riders would have to pay 25 cents a dollar (in fact, even less than Wayne attacks the box). No explanation has been given about ripping Wayne's riders and he is still considered a hero who gets a girl. <br /> <br /> Things are going to be difficult on this issue, because Al Ferguson and his cloak at Larry Fine (played by Paul Fix, who continues playing Sheriff Micah on "Rifleman"), see Wayne Rob's box and then steal the rest of the money and kill the rodeo driver. Moe and Curly are accused. <br /> <br /> So Moe and Curly move to another city to get out of the law and make their name Smith and Jones. Who will meet first, but their old friend Larry, whose sister will be in the love of the other side (Senorita Rita leaves this old town and no longer performs in the film). <br /> <br /> Larry's sister plays beautifully beautiful Mary Kornman (now grown, but on younger days she was one of Hal Roach's "Our Gang" shorts). Kornman is the main reason why he looks at a mega-lane west and his scenes with Moe and Curly are much better than others, as they use a completely different team to film them. <br /> <br /> Even in 1935, the actions of this thing are extremely weak and the technical filming is amazingly bad. The two main chase scenes will end with a wide picture of falling from the horse. In both cases, the editor cuts off one of the characters on the ground, but there is no horse in the frame, the stock is completely different and the character has different clothes than the stunt wheel. In other places, there is a liberal use of the film material, none of which is even convincing. One thing that needs to be looked at is the scene that has been in the midst of a movie where Moe and Curly get to their horses and drive away (right of the screen) from the cabin because the poses are on the left side of the cab. . The cameraman slowly follows the two stitches in the pan and then makes the whip pan to the left to expose the approaching post. I haven't seen anything like this outside my home film, not because it looks stupid (what it does), but because the competent director wouldn't get the scene in this way. They filmed two riders leaving and then replaced the camera and filmed as a separate approach. Or, if they knew creativity, they would step in sequentially so that the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the things in the background. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
