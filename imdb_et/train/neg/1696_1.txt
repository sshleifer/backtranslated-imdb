I hate to throw such features, but in that case I feel like I have to: The American GRUDGE remake is by far the worst film I've seen in theaters over the last 5 years. There I said that. And now that I've got it out of my system, please give me an explanation of why. <br /> <br /> "If someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse will be born. Those who experience it will consume that rage." This is a prerequisite for GRUDGE and I admit it sounds intriguing. Unfortunately, filmmakers do not take it any more. Those who experience the "curse" are indeed consumed by this rage, and that's all you get. You want more? Well too bad. Some critics and fans suggest that GRUDGE's only goal is to scare you. The problem is that if there is no plot to talk about, the horrible pictures and sounds can go far. Director Takashi Shimizu, pulling George Sluizer and reusing his original film (s), is happy to catch the atmosphere in the first hour? repeating the same scene over and over again. It opens up pretty much like this: <br /> <br /> - The person walks to the house <br /> <br /> - When the camera starts flashing and / or the strange sound is heard <br /> <br /> The staff is investigating <br /> <br /> - The sound starts to sound loud <br /> <br /> The person sees the ghost <br /> <br /> /> <br /> - Black & White <br /> <br /> even if the audience even gets a hint of the plot, it opens exactly the same scenario in the first hour 5 times. The first time was actually somewhat horrible. Every subsequent use became ridiculous when the film went. By the end of the film, my friend and I ridiculously wondered if this scene ended with "loud shouting and blacking". We were never shown wrong. <br /> <br /> There are no line waves in the movie, but there is a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled. I have no problem with non-linear storytelling, if that's right. The film jumps from time to time without rhyme or reason. I haven't seen a movie in that country since the opening of the HIGHLANDER 2 theater version. And this is the mystery of the storytelling technique that the film could have been. If you already know that ghosts have died two characters, how is it shocking when their bodies are in the attic? And why should we take care when a detective tries to investigate mysterious losses when we already know what happened to everyone? <br /> <br /> It's obviously green when the second American RING American version made $ 15 million on its first weekend. is nothing but a calculated imitation that is hidden in the actual film. The most terrible thing about GRUDGE is that it made $ 40 million on its first weekend and some people consider it the most frightening film. I don't know what will happen to those who are consuming the rage to see GRUDGE?
