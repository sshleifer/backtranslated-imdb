I hurried this movie in the hope that it would be similar to Dead Gentlemen Productions' fun "The Gamers" (which by the way is highly recommended). Boy, what a disappointment! The film is struck by this fake documentary, which has been made famous by the office, but it is not a success. This is partly due to rigid action, but mainly to writing and management. True, it can be funny to use the role of each ham clich√© in role play, but here it is done to make it extremely predictable. Already at the beginning of every scene you know what a "joke" is. But perhaps the biggest problem is that everything is depicted from above. There are no subtleties in this movie if there are inscriptions "LAUGH NOW" or a cheap 80s-style fake-laugh that wouldn't be much. For some scenes, you can't help thinking: "Yes, I get why they thought it would be funny", but the way it is done gives you all sorts of fun.
