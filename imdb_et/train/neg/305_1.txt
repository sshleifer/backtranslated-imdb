I'm glad I saw this movie after Mr.Sandler became famous. <br /> <br /> It's bad .... bad, bad, bad. No plot. It's like a painfully boring home movie. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy my other movies ...... but if you're like my fan, stay away from it. It may change your thoughts about Adam. You may never recover from the horror of this movie ... I've had a better time to grab old people at home .......
