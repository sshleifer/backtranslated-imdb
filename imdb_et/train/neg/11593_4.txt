I think this movie is one of the worst nightmares. It was so boring that I didn't remember anything 20 minutes after the end of the movie, even the tires tell me to write a comment about it. <br /> <br /> Okay, # 4 was a joke and Freddy was a joker. # 5 tried to return to the roots of the series. It was darker and more atmospheric than Nightmare 4, which is basically good. They tried to shoot a horror movie instead of a comedy. Unfortunately they forgot to skip and scare. Because of this nightmare 5: The dream child is neither funny nor scary. What we actually get is a boring movie with ordinary bad actors (maybe except Lisa Wilcox). <br /> <br /> The plot (Freddy kills Add friends Add to the unborn child's dreams) is a good base, but it's not enough for a 90-minute movie. Sometimes this story becomes very confusing (perhaps because it is not) and you cannot think of what the filmmakers wanted. The scenario must have more holes than Swiss cheese and therefore the film itself was very cheesy (let me say that I don't like cheese even when I'm from Switzerland). Not even the special effects were as good as, for example, part 4. <br /> <br /> Don't bother to rent / buy this movie if it's not complete, it's pretty confusing. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 4/10 (Practice it, # 6 is also dirty ...)
