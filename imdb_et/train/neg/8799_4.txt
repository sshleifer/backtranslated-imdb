Weaving for Paul Muni's patience who spent hours and hours every day watching Zola. Muni was one of the biggest stars of the 1930s and I don't know how many people today are anything but classic film enthusiasts. He was a giant in the company for at least ten years. For this competition, he could win the Academy Award, which would have given him twice in a row because he won this year for playing Louis Pasteur. My opinion is that, although he tended to overdo it, I still think he was one of the biggest actors of the "golden age". Whatever he played; you were nailed to the screen to look at her. <br /> <br /> Unlike the role of Pasteur, I thought that this story created too much of what we have seen over the last 60 years. hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood was not able to suppress his disdain for the police or the army, which is why it was the point where these organizations were "corrupt". Filmmakers love it when authority is challenged and defeated. In this regard, this film is already in its day, because we have seen this great time since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> However, it should be noted that the facts support this story. Nor does it in any way diminish Zola's achievements as a social reformer, getting rid of some evil. Good for him! I would like them to have shown more than focused on one trial.
