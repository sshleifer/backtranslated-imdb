Often poorly matched couples (in the general sense of the term) - Huston's films: "The Queen of Africa" ​​"Heaven knows Mister Allison" "The roots of heaven" "Misfits" ... "Barbarians and geisha" (check the headline) is another good example that talk. It seems that Japanese things were time-consuming, such as "Sayonara" "Suzie Wong's World" and "August's teahouse" witnessed. Huston's effort can be the worst of this pretty bad batch (except for Susie). John Wayne is perfect for the Ford world, in Huston he's like a horse in a Chinese shop. His Japanese partner is completely empty. dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) will not save the movie from absolute boredom. <br /> <br /> Only those who are completely in love with every work of Huston must choose it, all other great films.
