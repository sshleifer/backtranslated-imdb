I've seen some bad things in my time. Half dead cow trying to get out of the high mud of the waist; two car collision head; a thousand plates that crush the kitchen on the floor; people who live like animals. <br /> <br /> But I've never seen anything as bad as a hat in my life. worse than Vllad Impaler, worse than people who put kittens in microwave ovens. <br /> <br /> It's the most annoying movie ever, easy. jokes, some complicated joke and Mike Myers might have been a high cocaine sniffing drug-related betting junkie who lost a bet or something.
