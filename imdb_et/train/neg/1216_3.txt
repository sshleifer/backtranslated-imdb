The genre of the feature films is indeed diving in it. A great problem is RESPONSIBILITY. I understand that you need to create complicated situations that create tension and a tense feeling that will happen next, but this film was so predictable and simply incredible. I find that the more I watch such a movie, the more I say to things to guide them away from danger. Constantly making bad decisions is just a fool. If they took the time to make it more realistic, I would have enjoyed it a little. Having said that, you may be better off staying away from it.
