Withdrawal: Full Moon. The hunt is a great creature, a big werewolf. Not flesh, not blood (not that it seems we have to bite the road), but for a mate. She's a girl's hunt. No girl, however. The girl. A girl who is clean (and also a werewolf, though she doesn't know it yet). Three, well check that the two police (after the first scene) and the old bag lady are all able to stop it, or even know that the thing that kills and eats a lot of full moon is a werewolf. This extremely powerful werewolf, Darkwolf, closes the girl. When he gets him, mankind is doomed. Now the police have to find the girl, not only to convince her that there is someone, a werewolf who wants to rape her and maybe kill her, but that she is a werewolf herself. And then they had to stop him ... <br /> <br /> Comments: This is one for boys, teen boys. For many scenes, half-girls are more or less important. Mostly less. Well I think you need time to fill some time because the plot is (expected) thin. And, unfortunately, there is little next to the girls to help break the plot. Usually two main topics are turned. Nudity. Check it out. And then special effects. Hmm ... Well there are some things you might want to call effects. They are not very special. In fact, to be blunt, they are very bad. The film seems to be lacking funds. They couldn't afford some girls clothes;) and the effects are cheap. Some of the changes between werewolves and human forms that are apparently made on a computer are really bad. You can forget about such things. But Darkwolf itself is a very crude oil and you never see any killings. Later, there are only a few damaged corpses. And there is a surprisingly small amount of blood in the film, which should honestly shake the blood. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what to say about actors and characters. Most times they do well, but unfortunately it is outdated if the characters (or actors) just lose it. Some of these losses may be related to the above problems. Like a bad effect or a bad budget (?). This may explain why there is little shooting, even if the characters are armed like a small army and the target is striking (and not moving). But hey, if you are in real danger, there is nothing that will save your life like a good one layer ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, you cannot explain the times when the police officer, Steve, is the only person who knows how to solve the problem There is a werewolf running away when the only things he can be sure is that the werewolf comes to the girl who is right next to her and that she can't let her be. But be sure to let the makers finish a little more ... <br /> <br /> But I wouldn't want any leading actors / actors trying to try another movie. Well. A little conclusion: not the movie I recommend. <br /> <br /> 3/10
