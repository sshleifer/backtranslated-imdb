Maybe television will be brutal one day. Maybe? Big Brother was just the first step for Stephen? King Richard Bachmann described. But that's enough. If I spend too many words on the serious background theme of this movie, I will do this by choosing what the producers hoped for. It's the same as day 6. No matter if the film is primitive, this debate creates a topic that serves as a product for producers. DO NOT take it. The social criticism suggested by this plot summary is just an alibi that allows you to create a speculative, violent movie, more for video selling than cinema. <br /> <br /> I didn't read the book. I do not dare to criticize Stephen King without reading him, but when I saw this movie, I thought they could not make such a terrible movie from a good book: with the 1980s music and with some smaller actors, Arnold Schwarzenegger finds himself a policeman who drives away from the murderers in a brutal TV show . Audience rejoices. <br /> <br /> With Predator this is definitely the most stupid movie by Schwarzenegger. 2 stars out of 10.
