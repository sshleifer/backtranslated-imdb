The back of the DVD box contains Ellen Page in this movie. It doesn't even appear until two-thirds of the movie is over and it's not important. I do not see it as a supporting role, but rather as a "bit" part. The plot also has many unexplained elements. Some examples are: Why does the main character of his eldest son not allow? Why is his youngest son on the train? He tells his "mammal" for a contribution that doesn't explain anything. Of course, the scriptwriter does not know the definition of the mammal's contribution. In my opinion, this film is not worth the rental price. Save your money and watch it for free on TV if you think you need to see it.
