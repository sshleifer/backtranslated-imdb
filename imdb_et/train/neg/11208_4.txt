Raymond Burr, as an attorney, celebrates the murder of his best friend (Dick Foran), thanks to his affection for his friend (Angela Lansbury). It was a year before he started doing Perry Mason, so the film might be of particular interest to his fans when it was his casting inspiration. <br /> <br /> There's nothing more interesting here. Lansbury is always good, but his character is very one-dimensional, and in his mystery, his crime motives are quite obvious. Lamont Johnson's interesting performance is a painter who is in love with "femme fatale", but the character of Burr is quite simple. It is, frankly, strange to see an actor like Burr doing these romantic scenes with Lansburg, and his suspension does not fit here very well, as in most of the films I've seen him. the whole intercourse should be the title of the movie and the way Burr's character, Lansbury, describes himself as being linked (a double threat is not likely to prevent him from trying again after the original murder). He does it with a very large tape that he doesn't think when he enters the room. <br /> <br /> Some possible moments of unintentional fun and the rest of the thing could have been done on TV.
