The Hazzard Dukes are quite an achievement? A $ 53 million film that is worse than any 25-year-old TV show episode. The plot is usable, but meaningless fun is rarely possible to find and the pain is pretty cruel: Johnny Knoxville has more passengers than the protagonist, M.C. Gainey's sheriff Roscoe is a horrible thug, Michael Weston's Enos tiring, seemingly ideally cast, Willie Nelson seems just waiting for the check to be clear, and Burt Reynolds, who is stuck in the jar, where he has chosen to play his old films as a bit of a player, A curious choice for Boss Hogg to say at least, but he has one good moment with a heckler and a hundred dollar bill. You know the film is in trouble when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic screens? But worse than a script or casting is a hopeless direction for Jay Chandrasekhar: seemingly born without a comic book, can't do much more than two basic shots and seemingly helpless to talk about a few decent stunts in a movie, he seems to have decided to live a life of life before recovery signs. The confederal flag and Daisy's stereotypical role in every episode are a couple of pure postmodern moments, but no movie that makes you games for the days when Hal Needham led such a thing (and badly) can be a good thing.
