Since the 1970s, the writer / producer / director Charles Band is literally responsible for hundreds of science and fantasy works and horror B-films. Some of them are excellent examples of how to use a small budget for maximum impact; many of them are quite bad. Trancers (1985) was one of those rare gems. <br /> <br /> Trancers saw Tim Thomerson, who plays Jack Deth, a future police officer whose task was to track down a bad man. Whistler, who travels past, living in the ancestral body. Whistler is able to control other people with his psychic forces, making them obedient to zombies (headed "transcenders") and trying to change the course of history by killing the ancestors of future leaders. Jack follows him until 1985, deciding to stop him. <br /> <br /> In 1991, Jack still lives in 1985. After destroying Whistler, he has settled and married Leena (Helen Hunt), a young woman who helped her succeed in the first film. But for Jack, things won't stay calm for a long time and Whistler's brother E.D. Wardo, who is trying to build a military army. <br /> <br /> Action II has no original charm and simplicity, and it is a huge disappointment, considering how good the original was. The story is hard to pick up if you haven't seen the first movie (or at least not for a long time) and have many unimpressive activities and some bad special effects. The ingenuity and the mind have gone, which made Trancers so much fun; Instead, we get a single liner and script for the cheese that seems like it was written on the flight. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can recommend this genre to fans of this movie is cast, which has many names familiar with sci-fi and horror followers: Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch, Martine Beswicke . Unfortunately, it seemed that most of them showed that they had an off day while filming Trancers II and that the performances were mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> There are obviously fans in the Tricks series; Since then, four more sequences have been issued. If quality hasn't risen sharply, I can't imagine them.
