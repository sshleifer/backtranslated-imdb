Where to start. The movie started pretty well, but after the 30-minute mark, I got myself watching the watch. The horror at the beginning of the movie was good, but then the story went. It just got a stupider and a stupider when it was time. <br /> <br /> The participants gave the average score for this movie, but I got a bit of Vinny Jones's boring filming in the movie. <br /> <br /> As the movie pulled and took that word, it pulled on, it pulled more and more far. <br /> *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** Just when I thought the film couldn't get worse, the ultimate loads when the skeletons were looking for monsters turned up. which didn't make any sense at all. It turned out that it was some kind of meat that eats a cult and good guys die at the end. The end result just made me laugh at how bad it was. When Vinny Jones plays a leading role, he becomes a new killer. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie Creep looks like the best film ever made. I gave it to 1 star because the female driver did a good job, but even she couldn't save the train wreck from the movie!
