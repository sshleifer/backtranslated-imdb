In 1993, "visitors" in France were a huge hit. So this sequence was inevitable, and unfortunately this sequence is among the worst. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that doesn't follow its promises. Indeed, it should say the only story. Jean Reno must go back in the twentieth century and return to Christian Clavier in the Middle Ages that time is usually the course. The problem is that Clavier feels completely calm in the twentieth century, and makes him back to Middles Ages quite difficult ... Instead of going through several other stories with the main storyline. As a result, the film sometimes becomes confusing, sometimes a little confusing. <br /> <br /> But the film also features almost all actors. Reno and Clavier fall into the trap they could avoid in the first movie: they go over and become annoying. Then why did Jean-Marie Poiré work with her filmmaker Muriel Robin in her role as a woman? He made a mistake because it seems to be easy to find and completely pathetic. Other actors are no better: Marie-Anne Chazel is non-existent and Christian Bujeau, unbearable. This affects certain sequences and dialogues. It also seems hollow because Poiré takes back the elements that made the first film a success. So a young girl takes a close relative to Reno and asks her to attend her wedding. <br /> <br /> Unemployed and frustrating follow-up. Anyway, what is the interest in this movie otherwise commercial? <br /> <br />
