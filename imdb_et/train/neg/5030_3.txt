What is it in heaven? Is this an airplane? Is it Superman? Errr, no ?? This is TURTLE!?! This is what will change during the Cold War! Nothing but bad news and other questions! Americans shoot down the Russian fighting platform somewhere across the Artic territory, and the subsequent explosion literally breaks and awakens a giant prehistoric turtle creature called Gammera. He is not a very friendly critic if he immediately destroys everything and everything on his path. The alleged governments ultimately decide to kill an ugly bastard with a brand new and extremely complex ice bomb, but does Gammer have another surprise in the shop? Fucking turtle can fly! The first time this happens will bring a tremendously grotesque and more fun sequence! Gammera is on his back, who has been defeated when suddenly a fire blows from his armpit and he pulls himself into the air. How can you not love it? Then there is a terrible subtle guy who can communicate with a monster telepathically, but that's not just enough. Flying turtle, people! Of this Japanese (and American re-edited) Sci-Fi effort, it is very little to write that it is obvious and totally shameless of the classics like the original Godzilla and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. Impacts and monsters are extremely bad and, unlike the above-mentioned films, he never succeeds in creating an apocalyptic atmosphere. Distinguished actors such as Brian Donlevy ("The Quatermass Experiment") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") do not know what films they are and even the original Japanese chaos scenes are not very convincing. Gammera's own and personalized theme song is pretty cool, so it gets one extra point for it.
