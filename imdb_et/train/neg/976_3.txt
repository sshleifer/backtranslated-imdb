I am generally more willing to be more open to the Roma than many, but it was not a very good test. It had nothing to do with the comparisons made with the British original, which have not been seen and doubted. It has a lot to do with the curving plot, the lack of chemical properties between the stoves, and the characteristic force / character of the expected male cook (Jimmy Fallon). <br /> <br /> Fallon walks on a cloth-carrying screen and a 15-year-old hairstyle that runs ten years younger. He should be the teacher you see, and of course, well-known that school areas love the world to hire less mature people than the children they teach. The character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that I have doubts that any actor could have made him happy, but the old ones, such as John Cusack or Adam Sandler, could have defeated him. Not Fallon, who is neither funny nor actor, but thinks he's both. Never in a movie do you believe Fallon in his role and do not believe these two people should be or be together. At the end of the movie, there is a scene where Barrymore (who was ordinary cute but unable to wear it alone - it was a difficult one for a man's romance) tells Fallon that it is too much, and it has moved on. And instead of feeling bad about the scene or apologizing to Fallon, you are happy to rejoice at him - in the end he does what he should have done several months ago. But, of course, the mechanics of the plot do not allow this to end (the end that could actually have been out of this confusion), and instead we see that a rational career girl throws it away to track this childish idiot and encourage her frustrations. Of course, it had to be buggy and satisfactory, but it made me more disgusting than anything else.
