"It's not that big a mechanical toy," says the early sign, commenting on "Jaws". Well, "Blood Surf" only wants the beast as convincing as the "Jaws" series shark. In other words, the special digital effects of this movie are TERRIBLE. Action and leadership are also not much better; they are more suited for deodorant or mullum, which is commercial than horror film. The attitude of the people working on this film shows contempt not only for the genre, but also for the public. Saying "I liked", this film only encourages filmmakers to offer us more nonsense, destroying even more horrible horror music. (* 1/2)
