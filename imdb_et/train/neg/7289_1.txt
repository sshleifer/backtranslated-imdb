This is a tremendous appeal to a relatively well defined group (which I am not part of). I went to the preview of this movie without knowing what to expect - I finally found this disappointment. The history of the Hungarian Jewish family, which is terribly functional (often "twisted"), is not my cup. Indeed, such an epic saga should give its viewers more. Ultimately, such images as a human condition - this picture does not let almost any new light on any of its more substantial aspects.
