This is the first horror movie I watched, and after Im almost thinking I don't have to see others. I was told that this is a "thinker fear film" and say that if it were to think of me, I mean to you to think about the splashing eyes of the collection. Don't get me wrong, even the gore of this movie isn't worth sitting on. <br /> <br /> The piece is very washed out too much for the sake of art. Camera effects and music are away from most of the time and the characters are small. Several characters and scenes seem to endlessly end up as they begin to uncover some of the "Hamiltonian" hooks. I thought Lenny was about half an hour when I thought of the film. I was so visual when Lenny was confused and confused that I felt like I was completely hanging. I waited for what I got, but they could have gone so far, in fact, all the colors would be completely flat. Movies like "Hostel" and "Saw" come to a movie that is "too graphic or too distracting for the audience", a little better.
