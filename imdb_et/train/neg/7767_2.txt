For anyone who doesn't know c.S. Forrester's book this movie should be interesting. It's colorful, well-functioning, and a great adventure, but for those who know the original stories, it's terrible. I hardly sit through it. <br /> <br /> For some reasons, screen savers seem to be forced to write the stories they're working on. Of course, the spoken word differs from the written word and there are some episodes that would be difficult to film. But why do screen readers appear instead of just customizing it? In this case, the writers themselves did. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: Renown had no distortion. The officers took the ship after the semi-skipper was fully driven through the day - for reasons that were intended but never given. There was no judicial fight. The trial court took place in a nearly congratulatory environment. Captain Pellew does not appear in this part of the Hornblower harvest or the wife of Colonel Ortega. The Hornblower itself was never on a ship or shore. Forrester's story has many such manipulations. > Why, oh, why did the screenwriters not have to mix good stories?
