I saw that this movie knew nothing about it before. The plot was terrible and lacked much information. The film lacked a "brainstorming". The actors just pulled out the nonsense, sometimes causing me to torture my teeth when they went in and on. The plot was predictable, with the exception of the ultimate abdominal-erotic erotic scene (I'm not homophobic, but made me physically sick on my stomach), even the end was predictable. And you could say that the detective was in the costume of Jude Law, everything from fake height, terrible dental work, face-to-face costumes, everything that suggested that it was hidden. The whole movie was just like the time I lost in my life. This film felt like a doll show with Jude Law and Michael Cain, like dolls and houses as a window, indeed, in my opinion.
