"Hey everyone! I have an idea, we found this egg-shaped space from space so why don't we push it and open it?" "Yes, I know it would be the most knowledgeable thing a scientist could do, and it could be full of contaminating bacteria or viruses that are unknown on earth and potentially destroying humanity, but hey, I want to know what is there. " "And no one tells NASA that they can take us away." "Wow that this guy is giving up!" "Yes, really strong contacts, so don't touch it, but it's okay to open it." "Hello, beautiful, look at my tips". (Later that day); "DO NOT OPEN" !!!!! We have to run to the lab and say they won't open it because we don't have phones or radio or intercoms, though we have other gazillion dollar equipments here. "I've never seen such organic technology!" "Yeah, lemme takes it and stabs." "I get out of here, I don't care if I kill the other 6 billion people on Earth, nobody tells me!" "Look! This is" Abyss "friendly aliens! They want us to accompany them." END
