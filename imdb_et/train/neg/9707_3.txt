He didn't want to see it. I bought this on a DVD and found myself irritated under the film and turned off the movie for a moment. <br /> <br /> Here's what I didn't like: <br /> <br /> 1 They shot at Dad <br /> <br /> 2 The tribes were really annoying <br /> <br /> > 3 dinosaurs (mostly) looked fake. 4 A bad scientist well he was annoying <br /> <br /> 5 DVD quality was really bad. <br /> <br /> I like: <br /> <br /> 1 Jerry Goldsmith's music. This music is really great. I have the band music of this movie. Unfortunately, the sound quality is not good, but its time is right. <br /> <br /> 2 For the first time we see dinosaurs that inspire a kind of fear. <br /> <br /> 3 The child is cute when he is in the water and plays <br /> <br /> 4 This fun scene with a tent. <br /> <br /> 5 Children who see this movie will hopefully learn that evil always loses.
