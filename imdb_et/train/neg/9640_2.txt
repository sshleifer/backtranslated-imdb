I was always curious about this movie because it is so hard to find, so when I failed, I beat over $ 10 and bought it, now I understand why it's so rare! This movie is such a bad, so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the ending credits that show all the scenes they cut into are literally highlighting the film. The film is about psychic (Pettyjohn, cast for one obvious reason, his topless scene) who uses his powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality. If he pulls some sort of box like an object, the army throws it with the army that one soldier watch it, and the gee, what do you know? OVERVIEW! Foam foam monster costume jumps out, kills the soldier immediately, then flees to a nearby city. But instead of using it for the county's armed forces to find and protect the public, they leave Pettyjohn and Ray looking for themselves, but no matter how this film blows its credibility LONG before. This barely escaped vote by just one unintentional laugh at me has to tell the Mystery Science Theater 3000 manufacturers if they don't already know it! 2 out of 10, really, really bad!
