Bob Clampet's Porky's Bad Fish is both a caricature of dreadful stunts and one or two pleasant moments. Porky's Poor Fish at Porky's Fish Shoppe is an inconvenient area between standard black n-white Porky comics and one of the most popular book-to-life Merrie Melody at that time. Usually, Porky is far from the stars with many early cartoons, appearing only in a rather inclined opening and the climax of the film. For the rest of the time, the star is a starling cat who sees the fish shop as a free meal but gets more than she wanted. Unfortunately, the audience gets much less than they wanted. As sometimes in the book-life series, attention is drawn to a sign of light that could have worked just as well in non-animated media. Little is laughing, and although Clampett's energetic direction has been recorded as a comic, Porky's recommendation for bad fish is very small compared to other Porky Cups.
