I just saw Stephen Kings nightmares and Dreamscapes' small series for the third week; meaning, I saw 6 episodes so far. I must say that the stories are very weak. I've read Stephen King's Skeleton Crew, his short collection of stories that was released. I remember most of the stories were poor in average, but there was one that was really great, if not outstanding. <br /> <br /> I want to say that just because this mini-series comes from Stephen King's stories doesn't mean that it is good. In fact, if his previous short stories are a sign, most of this mini-series is poor. <br /> <br /> In Stephen King's defense, I haven't read these new stories. Maybe they are good as stories from the book and are not easily adaptable on television, or maybe it was the scriptwriter's fault to try to write an interesting script. Who knows. They may also be short-lived for the mini-series and not for printing. Maybe this may be a problem. When Stephen King had edited the editor with these tricky stories, I'm sure the editor would have told him right away to make it more interesting because, as it is, it's just boring. <br /> <br /> What is clear is that the problem is the stories / scripts and not the actors and the actors, because this mini-series has some great people who act on it. <br /> <br /> Seeing this mini-series makes me really appreciate these old Twilight Zone series, but it was just half an hour, but it was heavy and riveting. I'm sure that this mini-series had good money to make a good mini-series, but unfortunately you can't click anything. <br /> <br /> For example, there were two episodes this week. The writer begins to see the changes in the picture as he travels to his homeland, feeling discomfort, throwing away the painting, but it is close to him, and the portrait of the individual kills people and is about to kill him. the second week of the week involving criminals and their looting, because it was even more unpleasant than this episode!) <br /> <br /> This assumption is interesting and so the story should be good, but after seeing I was disappointed because the story was too much and also a remote one that showed you didn't do anything. After the last scene I got more questions than answers. <br /> <br /> I tried to go to this mini series for 3 weeks, but it was too aggravating due to bad stories / script. If it were a film, I would have recommended that people wait until the film came out as cable or as it was. I don't even recommend renting it to my video store. Given that it is on the TNT cable channel, I would say that if you haven't already seen it, try it in one week. If you don't like it for a week, then you don't like the past or the future because they all have the same boring feature.
