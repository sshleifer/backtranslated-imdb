This is an overview of the Freddy Mercury The Untold Story, Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007 One of the foneest, uninspired and annoying biographical documentaries I've seen. If the film I saw in the cinema in the theater originally appeared on television, I would ask my producers and distributors not to rummage the public with a false promise of a cinematically worthy documentary. Even though the television documentary, the sentimental piano chairs accompanying the interviewees, sitting in the hotel rooms in front of flower arrangement and pompous, pseudo-literary narrative, are more of a dreamy bed with Infomercial. The only redeeming aspects of Freddy Mercury's hope - or, um, were: "Princess Diana's untold story" is the original concert, video, and television material - shortened by Freddy Mercury and Queen. Characteristic interview with irrelevant eye witnesses, for example: "He was a free spirit," (really ... I thought Freddy Mercury was a company man ...) who reduces those Freddy's opinions that Brian May or Montserrat Caballe gave a new and affectionate light Mercury in complex life and character. And ... what about the segments of similar staging schools in Harry Potter? How did the interview with the first girl break ("... now working in a travel agency") and Freddy's first school band lead me to what I really want to know about Mercury? As an important milestone in her personal life, her sexuality, artistic style and growth, the Queen, the band remains undiscovered. These filmmakers do not ask a provocative question and do not deal with independent or visionary research on their subject, but give a desperate and tremendously empty commentary on a mysterious and glorious rock legend that does not deserve the biography that grandparents will let down on Sunday evening to commemorate this channel of history.
