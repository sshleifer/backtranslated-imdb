After some lean years, the 1968 Elvis was a rather swollen time: not only did he make "Comeback" TV Special, but also became a father and played two pretty decent movies? SPEEDWAY and LIVE LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE. That is why I can personally forgive him for what STAY AWAY, JOE, at best, comes up as an interesting failure and not all that bad. Of course, Burgess Meredith and Joan Blondell are really embarrassing? like a living in India's father Elvis's character and a terrifying bartender, who also has an eye on Presley - but is happy to see Elvis surrounded by top veteran Hollywood talents such as Katy Jurado (like Meredith's Mexican woman), two Jones? Henry and L.Q. - and Thomas Gomez, who is especially funny, as a sarcastic headache who is Meredith's stubborn father who still attracts his old headgear today! <br /> <br /> Although the lack of songs is surprising (if it is not their usual failure), it seems that the men of Indians are not free to all parties, while Presley constantly practiced his female skills behind him! As can be expected, a typical West Arizona landscape here is very important and sleepy, snoring a bullhorse is not only good, but a big plot. On the other hand, the climatic "destruction of the house" is an episode that we have seen too often and does not work too well here ...
