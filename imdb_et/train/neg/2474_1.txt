When I watched this movie, I thought it would be good for a good moment ... I was wrong. The real best part of the movie was when it was over. Complete waste 92 minutes. All the serious deviations were best when Wendigo finally showed what was at the end and you couldn't even see him very well. And the tip of the tail was really stupid. There were too many sections in the movie where you thought something would happen, but it was let. Worse, Wendigo was told more, then Wendigo was. To make the creature so bad, you definitely can't say that movie.
