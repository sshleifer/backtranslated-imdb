This horror film is very weak ... that's when it's the right movie I comment on. Nothing really terrible is going to happen, because the family receives the cute little German Shepherd. I had a German Shepard and this is a really good dog. I couldn't get the idea of ​​this movie, but the comedy "K-9". This is another story together. This movie does not have much horror at all, because the most terrible scene is at the end and it looks really cheesy. We also see that the boy put his hand in the lawnmower. That's it. However, the father suspects something because his family seems to be rather strange, somewhere he finds out if you have a mirror at bedtime to see if they are in possession. All in all, there is a very weak horror film even with television standards ... the television films that work are "This House Owns" is pretty good and there is another haunted house about the film about the wife and their strange creatures, which is also quite good. It's really quite boring.
