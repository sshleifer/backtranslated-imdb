I really liked Margaret Atwood's novel The Robber Bride, and I was glad to see the movie version. The woman frames the police boy for her murder and her friend, a former police journalist, is trying to erase her name by controlling the mad woman's friends. Luckily, the movie script improves Mrs Atwood's clumsy drawing, focusing on the story of these two men, the victims of the victim victims ... <br /> <br /> Heh. Okay, you me. When these guys are mentioned in the book and I'm pretty sure they're ready for the movie, I eat their hard copy dust. Apparently, the three main female characters of the novel are not enough to wear the film. Zenia's manipulations are not interesting if we don't see them happen to a man, and the life of a man is turned. Roz, Charis, and Toni tell their stories to people. Because it doesn't matter if the man doesn't hear them. <br /> <br /> I liked the characters in the book. It hurts to see that they put the man's story aside. Usually we do not look for feminist angles in the media and I tried to enjoy the film. If I hadn't read the book, it could have been a lot more to enjoy. So if you like a policeman and an ex-policeman, and you want to read more about them, you're lucky. Read the novel if you want to enjoy a delicious brook and testimonial that is hidden in pieces. This is the same plot: the film is dug, ironed and sprayed with male angels. It's like Zenia's revenge on Margaret Atwood.
