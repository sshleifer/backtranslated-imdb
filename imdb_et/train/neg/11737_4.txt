Well, I don't think the picture is as bad as most comments do. . . but you can't deny that this is a problem. <br /> <br /> Mostly, there are problems with the script. There's a plot - but not a lot of story, and definitely no one who could be called a believer; it passes through all the self-conscious strange and / or stereotypical signs, lines, moments that you are, and ultimately, not much added to in this department. <br /> <br Sorry, but I didn't care less about what "social ill" Farnsworth could try; there is always a population sector that wants to break its brains, even if it requires corn fields around drinks, trying to steal ammonia or whatever it is. So, as a movie, you don't find me "Iowa" "important". But at a stylistic level, the picture is more than interesting, and some Farnsworth's choices in met-head wigged-out are beautiful, fun, annoying, and - yes, I say - inspired. /> <br /> Operation is uneven, but it may be a dependency caused by a dependent person. Look, Rosanna Arquette is a beautiful actor - but she's not very good here, so a discriminating audience member has to ask, "What happened?" It's strange that Diane Foster manages the simplicity and grace that so few other participants can come to somewhere. For example, I can seriously consider any explanation that Farnsworth might foresee for Michael T. Weiss's national referral as a probation officer, but I doubt that I would ever buy it; It just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Then it's the most alive and the moment I've seen John Savage for years. So go to the drawing. <br /> <br /> This is a job that hugs, but doesn't allow - and that's okay; the film does not require Farnsworth or anyone else. So, if Farnsworth has another movie, it is not yet seen, but if it does, it seems quite likely that it is not buggy. The age when people plan their life for the last installment of "American Idol", maybe we would allow, not to frighten, Farnsworth's legal and indisputably flawed movie. What's more, perhaps we can greet, not soothe, our energetic and sometimes blissfully idiosynthetic imagination.
