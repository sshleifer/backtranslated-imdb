I looked at the incredible alloy man for the second time and it was even more boring than when I first looked at it. I do not understand why it has become such a "cult class" if it is so annoyingly boring. The open scene looks promising when a fat deposits drop into the blood canister and runs for its precious life. After that all that really happens is the melting man's stem around some forest and houses, while he lives as an astronaut. Makeup is pretty good and her melting face face is quite realistic. There's a cool scene where he throws by the river, and it swims until it reaches the waterfall where it falls on rocks and cracks. However, there is not much to moisten, but most scenes are released in the dark and you can't really see what's going on. There is not much gore, at least on the Vipco DVD that I watched. <br /> <br /> No, incredible melting is not so great. I'll give her some signs of my cheese factor, but that's it. If you want a true sci-fi / horror culture, check out Deadly Spawni instead!
