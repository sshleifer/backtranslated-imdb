LOC could have been a very well-made film about how Kargil's war fought; it was locations, budget and skill to have been India's "Saving Private Ryan" or "Black Hawk Down". Instead, it has met as a swell, a 4-hour-long war to move the Masala movie. Even the war scenes were terribly executed, using the same threshold in all of their battle scenes and spending unnecessary time on random talking. Instead of trying to turn to the Indian public, a better film would have been a book review of what happened in Kargil (such as "Black Hawk Down") or even spending time in a military perspective (such as "Tora, Tora, Tora"). Even better could have been a competent director for writing, directing and editing a film, such as Ram Gopal Verma. So far I would like to see someone edit this movie again, with only the relevant parts; it would make the film more watchful.
