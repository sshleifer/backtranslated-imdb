This is a surprisingly enjoyable original big step. This sequel is not nearly as fun as the first part, and instead it spends too much time developing land. Tim Thomerson is still the best thing for this series, but his compulsion is underlined in these records. Performances are all sufficient, but this time the script lets us down. The activity is just routine and the plot is just a little interesting, so I need a lot of stupid laugh to keep "Trancers" entertained during the movie. Unfortunately, they are laughing little and far, so this film is at best observable.
