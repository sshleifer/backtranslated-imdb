"Little Man", now DVD, is the Wayans Brothers flop. This is a story that is smaller than the dwarf criminal game played by Marlon Wayans, who hides a woman's wallet diamond after the legacy. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, are preparing a genius plan to hide Marlon as a baby and plant her in her wife's home. He then goes through all sorts of "home tasks" or "child games" like chaos to get the gem back and treat it like a baby. I was surprised how low this humor was. Jokes have been made in many places so many times that they are neither cute nor funny. I almost think the film might have been funny if they didn't use CGI and used a small actor to whom Marlon's face was pasted. When viewing the deleted scenes (minus CGI), this actor was funny in the Mini mode, but they chose a different route. Some couples and Tracy Morgan make some funny scenes. Spend your Borat if you want to laugh these days. <br /> <br /> http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
