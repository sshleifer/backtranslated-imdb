The film must be photographed daily, with scenes where you can see camera reflections and a red cursor, even the green light of the landscape that mixes with the actors! Plot and lines are really terrible, not even the slightest inspiration (At least as a thriller genre for the film). The film is full and not exciting. If you want to have a fun b-movie relaxing evening with friends, go for what you enjoy (as I did), but this movie can't be taken seriously!
