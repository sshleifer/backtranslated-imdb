It was a classic case that should never have been. Gloria was now a single mother, her husband had left because she did not live with her in some area (she was crazy that Reagan was chosen and wanted to turn her back on society). Then and there I had problems with the series - Come on, I tell myself, is it the same noble Michael Stivic who answered Archie Bunker's right philosophies? The series went on, but it didn't have a pizazz. Whatever Sally Struthers got from the whole family, it was long gone. Perhaps, if the series had been given a different name and presented completely independently of the whole family, it could have worked out. Ah well, this is an exhibition business.
