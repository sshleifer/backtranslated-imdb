CAT O'NINE TAILS (Il Gatto Nove Code) <br /> <br /> Ratio: 2.35: 1 (Chromoscope) <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> (35mm and 70mm) prints) <br /> <br /> The Pime ex-journalist (Karl Malden) hears a plot of extortion commands outside the Genetic Research Laboratory and later teams with a reporter (James Franciscus) to investigate a number of murders in the lab, inadvertently placing their loved ones under the psychopathic killer grace. <br /> <br /> Accelerated into production after his unexpected global success as he led DIRD CRYSTAL PLUMAGE (1969), Dario Argento saw CAT CAT'S TAILS as a giallo-thriller much the same as his predecessor, toplining a Hollywood actress marked Karl Malden - fresh from his appearance at PATTON (1969) - and the rising star Francis (GWANGI VALLEY). Unfortunately, the resulting film - the ads of which were "nine times unstoppable" as "Bird" - continue to disappoint, perfectly captured and stylishly executed, but too general and meaningless. <br /> <br /> Malden and Franciscus are closely observable in sympathetic roles, and Enrico Menczer (DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses a wide range of Cromoscope to deliver a high-tech world where Argento's dark-hearted scenario emerges, but Euro-starlet Catherine The LIBERTINE as Franciscus's romantic interest is a little more than unnecessary cushioning. Highlights include an unforgettable meeting with a crowded railway station with a black-ring hired assassin (edited by the firm ceremony of the stalwart golden film Franco Fraticelli) and a night-time episode where Malden and Franciscus look for an important clue in the tomb and sacrifice the frightening mechanisms of the killer. But despite these bright flashes, the movie is filmed from one scene to another, gently welding without ever really boiling. Not surprisingly, "Cat" was unable to mimic the success of "Bird" runaway in 1971. <br /> <br /> (English version)
