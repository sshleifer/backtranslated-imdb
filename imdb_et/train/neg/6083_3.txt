Two types of movies we like are (1) westerns and (2) movies 30 or 40 years ago. We should have called the man's name Sledge; HOW ..... <br /> <br /> IF ... this picture is unpleasant, annoying and stupid from start to finish. Since the story is not someone (good or bad) to warm up, no one motivates the tension needed to keep the viewer interested. No friend wants to steal gold and any friendship among those trying to protect it. Sledge has a nice girl friend, but there's no reason she slips across the boy or why she wants to be in the same room with that pig. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from an intriguing and amazing musical score and extremely poor writing and Vic Morrow's leadership. <br /> <br /> The last 30 older movies that were rented from Netflix or Video Vault were rock, the only real cluster.
