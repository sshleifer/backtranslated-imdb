Imagine you are a high school boy in his girlfriend's dark, exhausted theater. How bad would it be to have a movie so you would be forced to leave the theater and go home before it ended? This movie is so bad. Really. Movies often become so bad that they are good; this film is far from this stage of malice. It's painfully bad. Terrible, terribly, crime-humanity is bad.
