<br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie last night at Cinemax, I was shocked that it was done. In my opinion, cruel intentions were one of the best teen-oriented movies. This prequel had certain things incongruent original. (Sebastian's father married a wealthy, why does he have a rich aunt on a long island?) <br /> <br /> Then I learned today that it was not a new film, but rather a television series, Manchester Prep. After that, I heard that it was sensible that it was not the same as the movie, like Buffy, Vampire Slayer, in the form of television. <br /> <br /> I think Roger Kumble probably added the end of this movie after Fox didn't take it against the series. It just seems to happen too soon (Sebastian gets to Kathary's male version) and I just don't know where they would go with the next episode because it wouldn't take the 1999 movie (what newer thing I didn't like was that he advised Sebastian and his father to marry prosperity that does not look good in this New York area, and Blue Kathary's mother was just her adult version, it didn't seem like a woman could do in her job, marry a man who is not her Prequelina is pretty flat, but I would be interested in seeing where it was going.
