Although I recently added this to my 10 worst movie listings, I have to say that this is probably not worse than the Burt Reynolds "The Maddening" or "Look Who's Talking" queues. However, it is quite nausea, even if sexy Drew Barrymore plays something like a horror movie against Holly Golightly, moving from New York to Los Angeles, but discovering that he is kidnapped by a murderous similar. Bad Sally Kellerman, a peculiar actor with great acclaim in the 1970s, still loses its supportive role, and Barrymore's leading man, George Newbern, is the worst type of sitcom actress, always laughing after every line. The picture is refreshing, but Drew's bloody shower room is fabulous and the psycho identity (although "out of the" Scooby Doo "episode) is interesting. But like the finals ... get real! Who had to clean up that mess? * from ****
