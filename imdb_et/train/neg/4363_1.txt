It's hard to find any positive in this movie. It would seem that the manufacturer should have done a lot without effort, and so we are treated to show the complete galaxy, which is the most lenient excuse for the most film of history. Police girls felt their little uniforms very sexy. More room for action from the two police and much less Galaxy would have been the way to go. Of course, this budget was added so that they decided to fill the space by working again. Ms. Albright makes a great looking sexy & her acting is first class. Ms. Stabs, whom I heard before, but did not see it on the screen, also seemed highly desirable, but she seems to have no basic ability to act. In addition to Mrs Albright, this is a real garbage.
