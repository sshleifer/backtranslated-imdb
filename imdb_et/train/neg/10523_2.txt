For the first forty minutes, the empire itself is shaping up: it seems to be a strong, solid, and relatively unknown gangster strike. At the time I didn't know why, I thought it was good, but now I do. One of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and completely unpleasant. I don't mind having movies with psychics and things, for example pointing to a point - take Jackie Brown, but they're all so terribly low in it, but it's probably for entertainment. You literally feel like pulling your stomach. Another big problem is the protagonist. He's unpleasant, arrogant, yet - ironically enough - not so bad. She doesn't look tight enough to be a drug woman. The fact is that at the end this film is completely pretentious. Not slippery, not smart, just boring and pointless - this colossal confusion should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> * out ***** (1/5)
