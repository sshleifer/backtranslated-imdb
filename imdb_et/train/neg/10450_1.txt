This movie was the worst movie I've seen since "Date Movie". I smiled all over the film, not to scare. It was funny how the snakes are looking for a part of the passengers' body to attack, for example, the eye, tongue, butt, chest. When we have seen the national geographic channel, we know that the snakes will not get stuck in the body when they bite. For each particular scene, the snakes bite the passengers and remain bitten by the body. I believe that the manufacturer did not study their information about snakes and their behavior. I can't believe I'm wasting my money on this movie. So I don't want to wait for this movie to just wait until it's in a dollar theater or rent.
