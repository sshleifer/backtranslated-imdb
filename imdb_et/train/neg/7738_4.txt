The film was "OK". Not bad, not good, just OK. If there were anything else in the theater, it would be missed. Unfortunately, fast and mad 2 also fasted, but I see it rather than FF2. :) If you have a fetish harrison ford or another young punk, this is a "cute" movie for you. Personally, I look forward to HBO or Blockbuster.
