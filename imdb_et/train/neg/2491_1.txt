The Maiden trip is just that. I'd like to say right away that I looked at it for 5 minutes before I could. As already mentioned in the second comment, this film is "not so bad that it is good", it's just bad. Operation is terrible, sfx is bad and the story is blissful and stupid. Even the extras suck, "bag boy guards" and such seem to be their weapons like water guns. <br /> <br /> Don't look at this movie, the only thing that's special about it is that no matter how low your expectations are, you're still disappointed.
