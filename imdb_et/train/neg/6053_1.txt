absolutely trash. I liked Halloween and since then johnny has been down. it concerns mines. we get this john. Pro-lifers are scary! you don't have to make a shining movie that will push me out of hell to tell me. <br /> <br /> Jumping is out here. John doesn't seem to work hard here. for his credit, he seems to have not written this spam. There are countless times when the camera just sits and waits for the actors to see the fool or say something stupid. I love a long paragraph. too bad a carpenter does not know how to use it. he needs 30 years ago with Herzog and Fassbinder. Please, John, stop stupid about yourself and bored me!
