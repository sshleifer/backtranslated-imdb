I bought this movie in a favorable box at Rogers Video Store for $ 2. I now enjoy a good B movie and thought it seemed good. <br /> <br /> The film is quite a click in the 1970s and is quite strong for it. Unfortunately, the story line is hard to follow and the movie doesn't happen much. In fact, I turned it off after 45 minutes of viewing and saw a week later that I should look at the whole thing no matter how slow it was. <br /> <br /> The movie has good places for it, but you have to wait and wait and wait ........ <br /> <br /> If you're in B movies, it may be yours for just saying that the movie is slow and not really happening, and did I mention a lot of the story ... <br /> <br />
