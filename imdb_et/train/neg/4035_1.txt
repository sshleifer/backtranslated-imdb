I don't want to have a rainfall on the parade (even a small one), but from the first scene you could say that this film is absolute. It's a shame, as I like Martin Freeman and Danny dyer. I was intrigued by how they interfered in the film, but for my misery they didn't even have a scene together! I think I have to repeat it - two leading actresses (standing side by side with posters and DVD) were not together on one scene !!!! They didn't talk to each other or appear on the screen at the same time. Almost in summary, this poor excuse for the movie. Wrong ad. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was painful, every character in every movie was unrealistic and non-human. The scenarios were far removed, the plot was nasty, the jokes were thin, Freeman tried too hard to be funny (and played by poor men Timo), no one was pleasant and worst that some characters were so annoying that they almost drove me off because I could no longer watch it or listen to them anymore. <br /> <br /> This low budget stinker was epic. Even Danny Dyer couldn't inject this humor and charm but blessed him, he tried. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> How could anyone rate this movie as "ten stars" next to me. Ten stars? Seriously? Come .... I don't even give some youngsters ten stars because ten stars means the movie was perfect. This movie was far from perfect, almost the opposite, which meant it was almost terrible. <br /> <br /> Look at it if you like, but if you've seen a lot of movies and watched a lot of great movies, your rating will probably resemble my own. <br /> <br /> 1/10
