Of course, we all want bad movies at one time or another and we really enjoy them. It wasn't even a fault of joy, it was just a mess. Some man, vince-bidding, big enough to make himself the main character, but apparently it's drunk / high - probably both - and I thought it was a great idea to make a movie. He then started showing his script equally to high / drunk people. In general, this movie was so bad, predictable, and uneven that I didn't get it in 20 minutes before I turned it off. It makes you serve like Citizen Kane. Bat Man? WTF ... Some guys who go with a bat, real original. Almost as good as calling him fat and fat guy walking in a superhero.
