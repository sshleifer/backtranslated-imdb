I didn't like the idea of ​​a female turtle since 1987 when we knew that TMNT was four teachers with Splinter and their enemies, and the names of every four brothers are known by the names of big artists like Leonardo, Michelangleo, Raphel and Donatello so Venus has nothing here meaning and importance, and I believe that the old TMNT series was much better than the new one, which includes Venus. A female turtle does not add to the story we like about the story of TMNT, which we knew was a new enemy in all parts of 1987, a good idea to take some action, but the female turtle is a very weak point to do some action we want to see new TMNT series, but just like the same characters we knew in 1987 without this turtle.
