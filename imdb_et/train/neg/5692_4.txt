An interesting premise of the action film: A young mafia-killer killer (Chandler) must show his boss that he is a good man for the service, so he goes to California to take a few hours with a well-known professional killer (Beluschi). The first and most important task: to kill a young woman (Lee), which is completely strange for them. But is he a simple target? The film continues and is based on this basic idea, but the result is just a bad routine; even strange twisting at the end does not save the movie. Good result from Chandler. I'll give it 4 (four).
