The moment you give 'art film' 1/10, you have people who have your ignorance, half-ass, artificially slowed blood. I am not trying to justify how I am not aesthetically challenged when I proclaim all the "art house cinema" I've liked, or I mentioned how I gave some unknown "cult classic" 10/10. I'm just asking someone to explain the meaning, purpose, and message of this movie. <br /> <br /> Here is a summary of the film's summary: Opening the legend of three unrelated cities, which represent almost absurd levels of incidence. This is followed by (briefly to save you 3 hours of pain): - The host of child games who dies of lung cancer, the coke-dependent daughter who has raped her when she was a child, and who is kept by a worshiping police officer in a relationship, while the game show contestant decides that he does not want to be an unsuccessful grandchild, the fate that has hit the competitors of the 60's in the show of another game we are seeing is now homosexual of the unemployed who love brace and need money for corrective oral surgery, while the game show manufacturer who he dies for lung cancer, asks his male sister to fast with his son, whom he abandoned years ago, and who later became a feminine self-help, even if another man's producer suffers from guilt when he dies to die a man; and oh, finally, the frogs (read correctly). And I will save you incredibly long and pointless, literally rhetoric monologues, which seem to indicate that every character does not come out without any rhyme or reason, if possible, to make sure that the film passes for 3 hours and is classified as a "modern epic". br /> <br /> You may have thought that I could have made a movie summary for a better job (and not to be confused by you) if I had written a fucking thing a little more consistently, maybe a few sentences ... not just one ... Well , now you know how I feel.
