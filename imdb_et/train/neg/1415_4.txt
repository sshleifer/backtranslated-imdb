I had great expectations of the indie who has undergone many thumbnails. Then .... <br /> <br /> Here are two more "cents" already posted, in an excellent "lost translation" review. Design: Morgan is a "dusty little town where he meets a cute Scarlet who works at a local supermarket. Does Morgan help raise the cute Scarlet from his trailer bin? <br /> <br /> Realistic Dialogue? NO. How about buying Target. First, Freeman looks at Target's interior as if he had walked to Harrods. Then he ran to the T-shirt shelf, confirming that he had never been to any of the shops visited by lovely Scarlet. Morgan is separated from all aspects of Scarlet's reality and is a gleeful in his ignorance of all and just Scarlet's life. <br /> <br /> One reviewer enjoyed the Scarlet and former hubby fight scene, where his survival, the car in this case, requires him to physically attack him ex hubbie. Does Freeman drive his defense ... naw ... he is surprised by the disbelief and is unable to fully cope with the very blunt aspect of his very real, unfortunate life. <br /> <br /> Freeman's character believes that the Scarlet job interview has the key to a car wash and a new, highly revealing, tight-fitting blouse. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. The Freeman's endless "performance performance", where all aspects of Scarlet's reality have been reduced to one or another stage of the associated Freeman experience, was irritating. <br /> <br /> Freeman is right when he emphasized that Scarlet is ahead of him with his future, and then ignores the bricks he is facing: uneducated, white collar skill or experience, VERY POOR, no family and low lifetime of self-esteem. Scarlet learns such life lessons from Freeman as: some people pay $ 100 for a T-shirt and a revealing blouse can open doors instead of his education and white collar work skills. After all, Freeman Scarlet offers a little more than a strange evasion of "an asterisk", not even paying a night of gas for Scarlet's night back to his unchanging life in a city called Freeman.
