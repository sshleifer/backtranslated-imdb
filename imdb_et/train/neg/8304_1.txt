"Christmas Story" is one of many people's most enjoyable movies. ACS was able to watch the time and place of the viewer with very few movies ever. It had sweetness and good will, which is rare. <br /> <br /> So I waited (and waited) for my sequel "It runs in the family". The film appeared almost a few times, but it had to be pulled in the last minute. When it finally came out, IRITF (and I think) was a complete failure. <br /> <br /> Sets and cinematography were just fines, but the management completely, the character remained completely. The film was nothing more than a lazy casting, lazy writing, and disconnected cash flow formula. <br /> <br /> Narrator Jean Shepard, one of America's greatest humorists and preachers, has been forced to misrepresent the warm idea he used in ACS. He felt over, and why he didn't know. He has somehow managed to get his annoying annoying parody. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting in the IRITF is unfair and forced. Participants may have seen ACS, but not all of the spirits and nuances in ACS should be registered in any of them. Action was embarrassing and pure Shepard's dry humor. <br /> <br /> ACS is always a real treasure, but to call the IRITF, the order is offensive to all Jean Shepard and ACS fans.
