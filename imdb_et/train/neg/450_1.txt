This exhibition is painful to look at ... <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the creators had no idea what to show, the constantly changing "jobs", the boys and the cast. It seems they wanted to take Amanda Bynes ... but she had no idea what and what came with this embarrassing show. They put him in service, surrounded by twenty and thirty times, and put him in a mostly failed comedy experiment in adult situations. Soon they will realize that it needs a "click" and, at the end of the 20s, sheds people who are trying to go through the teens. <br /> <br /> How this exhibition lived for 4 seasons is beyond me. Somehow, ABC has now decided that it is a "family" show thrown into the afternoon in the ABC family.
