I was very disappointed in this movie. Thoughtfully it was foolish: the spirits that can influence reality as they do? A mission that is apparently critical to Soul Hunters, who has been entrusted with one of their younger members? And the whole B story with "holobrothel" and the lawsuit against the case was so terrible that at one point I was hanging out on television: "Why are you wasting that time?" <br /> <br /> The "River of Souls" did not really go deeper into the soul issue than the original "Soul Hunter" episode. We see that Soul Hunters can make mistakes, but we still don't know our culture. (Are there any women with Soul Hunters?) <br /> <br /> Action was okay with the material they had to work on, and the special effects - especially the planets of the first work - were very impressive. But in general I would say I give it one.
