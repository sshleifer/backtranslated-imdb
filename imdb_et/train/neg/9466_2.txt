This film was physically painful to sit through, perhaps because (like many of my age and younger) I grew up with dr. Seuss and loved my books - funny, smart, vibrant and subversive. "Cat in the Hat" sucks all the interests and sparks, and Mike Myer's Cat's performance is mostly amazing. Why Borscht belt accent, ununny radiator, unsuitable jokes, charming costume? I had to go back and read the books again to see the real problem: the books are simple. This movie is OVERBLOWN and five, too long. <br /> <br /> You don't expect every child's movie to be Toy Story or Iron Giant, but it sets a new low. How would Mike Myers need money?
