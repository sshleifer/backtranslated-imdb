I have no idea what the Shield manufacturers were trying to do, but the result says for themselves: Shield is virtually unnoticeable. <br /> <br /> Supposedly Shield's performances are superb ... <br /> <br /> In reality, this show is so heavily packed that you can't even see the performances. For example, editing will crop the reaction images before they have had full effect. <br /> <br /> I give Shield one point for my goal, but it's pretty much what I can give it. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see many talented performers wasting their gift so strangely badly filmed.
