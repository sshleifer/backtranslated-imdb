I hate this movie! It was not like a book, and I just thought it would make me crazy. If you watch a movie before reading a book, yes, that's a good movie. But the king's book was AMAZING and this movie was not something like that. I mean, the overall meaning may be similar, but most aspects of the film are completely different. For example, it ends! So the book is very intense and Danny and Wendy flee for a second before the hotel explodes. but in this horrible movie version of the nest, as it takes through a stupid labyrinth ... yes, there is no maze in the book and there's no reason for that. The second part that made me angry was that Jack just kills Mr. Hallorani! With the devil, he is basically a book hero and they just kill him out as he wasn't important. All in all, it was just bad that the film was so extreme.
