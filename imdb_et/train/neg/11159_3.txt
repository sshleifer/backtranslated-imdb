I saw this movie in a "hidden preview" and honestly admit that I don't like Meryl's movies. This picture was the worst. Half of the theater wasn't left halfway after the break. I could not blame them, if it was not a true story, there was no need on the other side of the picture. Immediately before the film took about ten years, I waited for the credit to appear.
