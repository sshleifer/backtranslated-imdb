Doc Savage: The Bronze Man is a terrible film. Poorly written, overly active and just silly. Saying that ... is actually a somewhat enjoyable movie. This movie is being watched in a group with enough cheap beer. This is one of those movies like "Santa Claus Gets Mars" or "Yor, Future Hunter" ... so bad is almost good. If you have the right group of people, this is watching a movie. It's campy. This is fun. The theme is Sousa. If you're looking for a good movie, look elsewhere. 3/10. <br /> <br /> BTW, I've heard rumors about what a studio is studying when it can be done ...
