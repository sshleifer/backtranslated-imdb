... at least in the first half. If it had started with three navies and focused on naval activities, it would have been a much better and stricter film. The other side of the film is worth it, especially for the activities and brackets of ships in the early 20th century, but it's like dull toothache. Also, don't look at this movie just because Ginger Rogers is in it. It has an important role to play, but it is small. <br /> <br /> The film will show three New York City friends working in the tourism trade, as well as a good competition for Sally (Ginger Rogers), a song candy sales event along the way. The First World War breaks down, three buddies seem totally indifferent to the fight, but they have any fleet anyway. One of the three, with the least industry as civilian (Bill Boyd Baltimore), completes another officer (Robert Armstrong Holland and James Gleason as Skeets). To make it more complicated, Sally is in love with one of the three, but has no chance of telling her before three races. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit more interesting on board, mainly due to the close frames of our ship and also because the chemistry of three friends is plausible. But, at the age of 49, James Gleason looks a bit long in the teeth, especially when the celebration adviser says you need to be 17 to 35 to be eligible. <br /> <br /> One real obvious mistake in a movie that made me believe that all out-of-the-navy scenes are the costume design under minimal maintenance, or, say, its absence. Just before WWI events in New York, everyone is dressed in the 1931 fashion, and everyone who drives with the 1931 cars wasn't trying to bring this movie period. <br /> <br /> To sum up, if you look at some of these scenes with Ginger Rogers and for the last 45 minutes that include a naval suicide mission, you've seen everything worth seeing. The rest is cushioning.
