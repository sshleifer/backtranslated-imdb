This movie is another medium activity, but it could have been so much better. When the weapons came out, they really needed some choreographic help. Someone, like Andy McNabb - who made this brilliant action in the Heat when they were robbing the street - would have made the eternal sequences something special. Since the rest of the movie was well - predictable, but traceable - better than expected from this type of film. Then came the last scene, the exhibition, what we expected, but it was like an A-team in the 80s. They shoot wildly, nothing hit, and they run around the house trying to kill each other - the same old, the same old.
