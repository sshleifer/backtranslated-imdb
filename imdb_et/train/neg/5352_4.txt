Honey, I Shrunk the Kids franchise was a big deal and not to mention very famous. I loved dear, I watched the kids when I was little. It was an original story and it had such an exciting plot! Sets were so amazing and cast it seemed they enjoyed each other's company. Now dear, I blew the boy was pretty stupid, so I think they wanted to go back to the story that everyone loved. <br /> <br /> As a matter of principle, Adam has grown a little and his mother is leaving her husbands with her children on vacation. But when Wayne's favorite object threatens garbage, he wants to cut it down and keep it, but he and his brother are on their way. But when women forget about forgetting some of their medications for their son, they will remain in the machine, leaving the children alone at the house. <br /> <br /> The piece is silly, but as I said, It was just a family movie that I think some might get out of. The original Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is the best, I think everyone could agree. The third of them was not as bad as I would recommend it at least to Honey, I was kid Kid, it was a bit more fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
