When it comes to horror movies, I am more than ready to stop the disbelief, ignore the values ​​of parameter production and forget the good of the plot for the sake of fear. This movie does not just provide good fears. You can't even enjoy it at camp. Bad dialogue, bad behavior, bad direction, killings were predictable and poorly staged, music was annoying, camera work was sad, even costumes were bad. I felt very bad for the participants who apparently tried, but who had to deal with a dreadful, viable dialogue and a clear focus. I doubt they also have some samples. It's embarrassing to look, and as boring as the fact that it's a thoughtful "surprise" to the end requires immense endurance. It's quite easily one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I usually don't write comments, but it was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This movie is a waste of time. If you need to watch this movie, don't skip "making". The writer / director seems to have the impression that making the killer's wife was a bold and bold move. He saw that he and the cast hour half-deconstruct this film as if it were a new era of "Citizen Kane". It's like listening to a third-class group that takes you behind the scenes of your Christmas picture. They think they have created something essentially. It's sad, really? The only reason I gave this film "2" is that I think "1" should be reserved for true cruelty, such as "Manos: Fate" and "Space Mutiny". So "American Nightmare" is not a WORST movie I've ever seen, but I have to say it's somewhere fifty.
