My first review of 2010 is "Blue 2: Reef". The story is about two divers, played by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort, who love to explore hidden treasures at the bottom of the local reef. One day, after the day they were studied, they turn to a couple playing with David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They talk to young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artefact on the hidden treasure of Columbus, reported at the bottom of the reef. <br /> <br /> The next day, the four dives of the reef and the coarse after a full diving day will not find anything. A few more days and two hired divers discovered that they were part of a large deadly plot where they could not escape, otherwise they would be killed. They were hired to find two large containers. One includes a nuclear reactor and the other contains a core. <br /> <br /> The film also has a story of a second person (brother-in-law brother) who tries to tie things with his girlfriend. the story was a waste of time, it also includes a very steaming sex between the pair, which for me is a complete waste and was not needed to show. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film has some good underwater photography and the colors fit well, so it gets 4 stars. Blue 2 is a sequel only by name. None of the original actors or characters come back, has a stupid plot, stupid characters, and a dull climax.
