Interestingly, everyone who felt such a film was not expected - I think it's a trick. Unlike them, I had optimistic expectations and that was a mistake. As soon as I saw the cameras close to the face, I knew that we were in the hands of an amateur leader - it's always their clear sign, they think they are holding or effective or intense about two inches of actress. However, the participants of this film had only one facial expression. <br /> <br /> If the close camera was not enough, the film's lack of light was killed. The film seemed to be completely filmed in the dark. So now we know that the operator was also ranked amateur. "Ooh ooh, we'll illuminate the set with a flashlight! It will make everything seem intimate!" No, it made it all invisible. <br /> <br /> In addition to serious technical flaws, there was absolutely no story that was not far from the idea that was never developed and something about such a relationship. was illuminated. (Perhaps this new film is for Germany, but for Los Angeles, forget it.) <br /> <br /> The fact that this film won a couple of film festival awards does not mean their quality. but the quality of these specific festivals. I can assure you that this film won't win anything at the festival where I saw it. In fact, it seemed twice during the film that it was finally over and people started to leave (this was one of the side effects of the operator's "total darkness" technique). But when the film went trembling, the audience was moans. And when the film finally ended, it was clear that it was not important if it actually ended in one of the two previous points. Earlier termination would have saved the audience even more monotonous home scenes (folding leaves, cutting vegetables, spreading honey on bread). Yes, we get this, the life of a lonely old man was boring - but we thought one was from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I recommend that the audience leave it away, has nothing to offer to complicated movie visitors.
