When I bought this DVD: “It seems like a nice light comedy of love and Portuguese standards? Let's give her a chance? ”I was completely wrong! What a disappointing movie! First, it's not comedy; this is a cheap drama that can be so melodic that it is even worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Second, the plot is so boring and leads somewhere? It has no structure, it just flows like wind, in one direction or another? Production is also bad! Blending the sound is terrible because sometimes the voices are disconnected. It reminded me of the 80's old Portuguese films? Should it have been better to act? All in all, this is not a movie that will improve Portuguese cinema! In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese films I've seen in recent years! Bad argument, bad behavior, bad production? I had no great hopes for this movie, but it was much worse than I ever imagined! Just forget about it!
