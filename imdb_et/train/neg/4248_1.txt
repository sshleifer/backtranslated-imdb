This film was mediocre, lazy and thoughtless on all of it. If you are going to make a movie about vampires that have been made thousands of times, then it's better to do a damn good job. I'm the first to say that this movie just didn't cut it. Some scary / horror movies just can't break "let's do something forbidden and abandoned for fun, because all the stories are just". That, unfortunately, wasn't different and like all the scary movies, if you appreciate this, you won't go back. <br /> <br /> And it ends? How do the heroes go through the same film and work again, but then they mysteriously start to knock together and can't do that job? The end was a very anti-climate and written part 3, which I never look at. Terrible movie.
