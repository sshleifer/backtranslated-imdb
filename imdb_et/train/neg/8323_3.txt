From the beginning, this film had some bugs. Hayden Christensen's main character is a rich young mogul who has inherited his father's remarkable wealth and strength, and he struggles to fill his father's shoes and cut the apron's mother (and co-leader) too small. He also has a problem with heart disease and a waiting list for organ donors. There are also small back attacks that your first instinct are usually ignored later, such as his friendship with a surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his romance with a middle-class girl (Jessica Alba). Create a story, but not enough to destroy the movie. The only real "oy vey!" the moment was the name of Lena's character. An exuberant woman named Lilith ... exquisite! <br /> <br /> Surgical scenes are not censored at all. I appreciated that people who find surgical scenes frighteningly may not. At first it was a wake-up during well-done anesthesia. You look at emotional embarrassment because Christensen screams inward through the chest incision and the rib spreader. At a time when the trailer is irony, when it is one of the unfortunate few that she is awake during anesthesia, she is also lucky because it helps her find out that her surgical team is going to kill her. However, the great twist is very predictable and sends the film to the conspiracy and his memories of the small signs there, but he, like us, initially missed. <br /> <br /> There are two more twists at the end that include her relationship with her mother. One is an impressive gesture from Olin, which is as inconvenient as bad writing. The second is the secret of the family's past, which seemed very confusing and pointless. <br /> <br /> The originally well-made drama of anesthesia awareness disappears in the drama of a poorly written conspiracy. There is one last attempt to bring it back that coincides with taking the whole movie.
