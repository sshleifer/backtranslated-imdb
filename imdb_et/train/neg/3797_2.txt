It has been years since Alex Rain (in the first film Olivier Gruner) hit a terrible plot involving replacing people with machines, but since then a war between cyber and people has appeared and we have lost, now the ultimate woman, Olivier Gruner character's daughter (She also suppresses only half of her minimum ability to act), which I think is the minimal link between the films, but when she is created she hides in 1980, while the future visitor hunts her in the future with this confusing sci-fi clunker. Nemesis became a cult position, so I see why people liked it, even though I wasn't a fan of this movie. Nemesis tried to develop a wide variety of ideas, to create a beautiful look and to offer tons of activities, almost working. Nemesis 2 does not even have such an ambition, it is a cheap crushing of the Terminator for a muscular woman who has such a low ability to act as she makes Olivier Gruner an unknown master and the action sequences have no explosive scope, which was the main selling point. I testify that I was not a fan of the original, but it did a better follow-up. The original was also well cast as Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and yes Jackie Earle Haley, who has no one, and this time it's just a boring film with a pretentious vibe. In fact, after I saw it, he inspired to mark the original. <br /> <br /> * 4 (bad)
