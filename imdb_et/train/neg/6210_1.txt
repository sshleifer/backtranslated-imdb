This is the worst film I've seen with Lindsey Lohan, "I know who killed me". <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I can assure you that there is nothing but disappointment and frustration if you decide to see it. Hey, Tim Burton, I was your big fan ... did you see this movie? I mean seriously what is f% # k? <br /> <br /> Without giving away anything, here's the story of vague text ...
