Everything in this movie is bad, story, actors, effects, but funny, funny, funny! Scott Valentine with an army form that is ten size too big is so bad that a permanent attempt to face like a face is a special opsgrup leader for this fun! '' Terrorists '' are as frightening and realistic as '' robbers '', it is both cumbersome and bad for everything you want to laugh at. The part where the giant T-REX, who somehow gets on board the ship and then somehow down, is blown up and you see that the metal is not closed when its head is the perfect end. If your bad movies are, it's a gold pot, bb-bad mona add !!!
