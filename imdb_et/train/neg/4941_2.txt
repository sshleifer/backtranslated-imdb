I really didn't remember Geico's commercials the first time I saw them, and even found them to be a bit nervous and entertaining, but seriously! This is the best thing these people could come up with?!? This show sucks! It's happier and looks at the "Office" episode, whose characters are hidden in a cave (I know a lot of you hate to say that "The Office" just doesn't do it for me). Okay, I get it: we have a bad slipper who just tries to keep his nose clean and has a dirty boss who hates him; a pseudo-intellectual with just a barely functioning intellect; and one who just wants to receive, but so what is !!! I've worked with these people and found they were as annoying in real life as I was on television ... why would I want to spend 1/336 of my week watching more of these types?!? Please call your parents and ask them if they fell on your head if after that you thought you still believed it was entertainment.
