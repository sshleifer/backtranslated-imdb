Is this a movie ??? Is that what the Indians are trying to show? I think this is another painstaking director who gives up Pakistani soldiers and actually the country .... but what we know of Pakistan is that we are always ahead of India in all parts of our lives ... not just armed counters. <br /> <br /> Well ... this is badly filmed as Border at the beginning of 1997 ... and the director and writer were just trying to overcome the shame of defeating the Pakistani Armed Forces at Kargil by creating such films ... > <br /> One thing is very clear ... When there is a meeting between Pakistan and India .... we win .... !!! So Mr Dutta is trying to make good movies instead of Nonsense films
