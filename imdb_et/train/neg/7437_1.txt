This movie is not just a waste of time or money. Full of clich√©s and a plot that makes no sense! I don't think so many people have given this terrible movie 10. I think they're the filmmaker's stogs. <br /> <br /> If I could make this movie zero, I'd like to. Too bad IMDb does not allow it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched it because I went with a friend who really wanted to see it. What's sad is that I never had any bigger expectations of this movie, but I felt short. Take my word, don't waste your $ 8 on this trash. The only entertainment I got out of the movie was the name of the director. All in all highly recommended!
