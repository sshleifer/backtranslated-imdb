Tony Goldwyn is a good actor who apparently tries to lead. "A Walk on the Moon" seems to have borrowed from other, better-made films. This story takes place at the end of the sixties as a summer vacation for working class Jews far from Woodstock. That's not going to do much with the processing of Pamela Gray's screen, so it's a mystery why Mr. Goldwyn decided to solve this film as his first attempt. <br /> <br /> The Kantrowitz family spends time at the resort. We see that they reach a small bangalo that is their temporary home. Father, Marty, comes just for the weekend; he is working on what seems to be a family-run small business that mostly improves the TV. After a few days, the first man goes into space, so the excitement is obvious. <br /> <br /> Kantrowitz women are left behind. Pearl, Marty's wife, and her mother, Lilian, spend their days idling until the "blouse salesman" arrives. Pearl browses and finds much more than shmatte; he also gets a salesman. It seems that Pearl and Marty have no sex life at all. After two children, Pearl, who seems to be sexy and high libido, is ready to enjoy extra marital status. <br /> <br /> This is the main premise of the movie that turns into a soap opera, when a young daughter, Alison, decides to play a hook and go to the Woodstock festival, where horrors, horrors, witness her mother, doing it with a saleswoman! What girl is that? Well, stay tuned for the finals when the little pups' beds are happily reunited with all the parties, when the wasps eat and the salesman starts to use some home remedy and the father is called from the city, aware of Pearl's betrayal. <br /> <br /> Poor Diane Lane, she later became "inaccurate", an expensive version of this dud. Viggo Mortensen is a salesman who takes care of his lonely female clients who whisper their ears a little. Liev Schreiber, who was Marty, a cuckold husband, doesn't have much to do. Anna Paquin plays Rebellious Alison and Tovah Feldshuh is an unhappy Nana who wants to stay in the city to watch her soap operas instead of recognizing her hand at hand! <br /> <br /> Look at this at your own risk or put the DVD in your home if you have a fun crowd, and you really want to laugh or two movie dictations.
