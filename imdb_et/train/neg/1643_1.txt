"Whipped" is the most terrible movie ever. It's an average, angry garbage that forced me to stay in the theater more than any other 2000. the film, in addition to "The Grinch". It's not like people call it an insightful portrait of modern relationships. This would be a little movie called "High Fidelity". Because this film was honest and sympathetic, "whipped" is a hostile, cynical, misanthropic film poison. Avoid it as many scourges as you don't want to see how really bad "comedy" gets.
