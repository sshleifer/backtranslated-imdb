True, there are some very weak moments and a little gore, but the way the movie's cargo and general story just hit me was an idiotic and lazy attempt with a rich "shock" tactic ... A controversial graph starts with a man who rapes and murders a woman who is a path stranded. He and his wife are imprisoned until the brother leaves and arranges to meet his girlfriend in the forest. He forces him to force the house where they screw, and later he shows a group of boys kidnapped in the basement. Heavily stunned prisoners consist of her old boyfriend, raping her, the "grabby" neighbor and her sexual abrasive boss. He explains to him that he is killing them all. He stops killing him and then draws his attention to the men (or pigs) he tortures and kills ... Most of the violence and humiliation is related to eating and genital mutilation - everything is far from disturbing and essentially light.
