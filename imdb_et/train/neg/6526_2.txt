A hopelessly uneven and boring film, where characters are surrounded by spaces or missile ships, and they speak indefinitely. It may be thought that when Mars is discovered, things get up, but these scenes are filmed through a heavy red / orange filter, which makes everything very dark. The Mars landscape / vegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are absolutely convincing. "The Bride of Dread" is a echo when the heroine gently winds up on the octopus, like the meat growing around the carcass, before it weakens, the difference being that Ed Wood's film is a hundred times more fun. Better wearing ear plugs if you look at the sci-fi music score that is repeated repeatedly will make you crazy. If you find yourself unable to sleep for one night, slip it into the VCR and your insomnia will improve at some point.
