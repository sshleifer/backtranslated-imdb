Yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the genre of adult film. However, I didn't like it at all. For a woman who suicides a horror film in a better matched arena, she is given the opportunity to briefly turn to the earth to live a lustful life that she never did before in her daily life. Watching sexy scenes. Why are they beating because they are trying so hard to be artistic that they take away the actual sex act. I mean, we watch porn for sex. Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way, but it is still very erotic and nice to watch. Of course, the girls are very cute in this. Here is a pretty unpleasant actor and it doesn't help. If you find the uncontrolled management of your adult movie, there is no artistic vision that would make me enjoy the movie. Sex scenes stretch from yuck to odd ... I mean one of them has a snake. So for me this movie just fails because it doesn't excite me at all, but rather turns me off.
