*** SPOILERS *** Let's start with the "good" of this movie - what Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton do. The rest of the action is terrible (it is not helped by a scary script). The worst offender is the villain, Buntao, leader of the Asian crime syndicate (played by Frans Tumbuan). I smiled at my head as he expressed his "rage" because he had lost a lot of money; terrible performance. Patrick Muldon is not much better and his "it's hostile takeover" line (that's the title of this movie) was delivered about as badly as it did. There are no other main characters, but no other actor / actor was different in this movie. Next we come to the plot. It should tell you all you need to know: In the original "Rage and Honor", Cristh Rothrock, who plays Chris Fairchild, was a downtown teacher. It is now C.I.A. agent (or was it another government agency - sorry, but this movie was so bad that I don't even remember). Hmmm ... I can imagine what this C.I.A. the application process was similar. Interviewer: What is your past work experience? Chris: I was a teacher. Interviewer: Okay; you're hired! I'll just give him a "2" because some decent action and a nice plot are wrecking at the end (although we know Tommy (Muldoon), a secret villain, is caught).
