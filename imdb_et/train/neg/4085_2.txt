"Sir" John Gielgud must have become senile to celebrate such a movie as it is. <br /> <br /> This is one of the films I think is considered "art" but not. Don't be cheated ..... it's garbage. Try to stick to "art" because such films that are labeled as such are usually so inexplicable fakes. <br /> <br /> In this masterpiece, Giegud describes Shakespeare's "The Tempest" when the camera puts the nude on people. one of them is a little boy urinating in the pool. Wow, it's tired stuff and real "art", isn't it? This is just one example. Most of the story doesn't make sense, it's impossible to follow and so is that liberal critics are afraid to say they don't understand, so they give it high marks to save their fake egos. You want Shakespeare? Read his books.
