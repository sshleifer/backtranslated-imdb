Of course I have seen bad movies in my life, but it was so bad that I was angry at the theater. I wanted my money back. I wrote to the director asking him to pay back the film, of course I didn't get any refunds (or even an answer), but that's an important point. On a scale of 1-10, I'll give this movie -42. Why did "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ??) run when he was hit? Why They Came "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ???
