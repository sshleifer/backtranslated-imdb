I'm not a horror movie, but my wife's brothers and grandchildren are. So, I saw the first movie. It was tough and tense, but not to my taste. However, it is good. For similar reasons, right now, I'm in the queue. <br /> <br /> The premise is still absurd. I can buy accidents in the desert. I can buy mutants there. I can even buy that the events may be so weird and strange that the army may decide to participate. It's unlikely, yes, but I'm ready to stop my beliefs. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I am in no way prepared to believe that a military group set up to reconstruct such an area will not be able to displace the mutants. As a member of the United States Army, I can assure you that although fresh recruits may not be experienced eyes and martial arts, all such recruits will be integrated into a capable team. <br /> <br /> An armed team of soldiers is not going to take out a few mutants. That's how it works. Squad movements, much better fire power and, of course, radio support, would provide nothing less than the whole victory. I'm not saying you don't have the victims, but as soon as the area is hostile, military training would take precedence, no one could even use his own bathroom. <br /> <br And when it was discovered that the site was so infected by the enemies that the team couldn't cope with the threat, they radioed in the reserve. And believe me that their radios would not be stuck if there was a chance that ordinary radios would not do so, the team would have a satellite phone with a military question. It is possible that if they are unable to check every hour, the search will be called. <br /> <br /> To accept this movie, you have to agree that our soldiers are incompetent fools with incompetent leaders and an incompetent chain of command. Although it may be true that the world's most dangerous thing is Lieutenant Card and Compass, our armies are full of intelligent, well-trained and competent soldiers. Knives with knives are much smaller than our ability to handle. <br /> <br /> Since the movie's full performance depends strongly on the impossibility to imagine, the film cannot play. Instead, we think we believe that our soldiers, sailors, and aviators will not be able to cope with even the most mediocre threats. <br /> <br /> Fighting veteran I find the film offensive.
