Another extremely unprofessional film about computer programmers. <br /> <br /> The authors of this movie do not know the real world of programmers. <br /> <br /> 20 top programmers in the world, a program that has satellites (what?), a program that uses satellite freq., someone kills someone to steal codes (why?) and many other stupid moments on this movie. <br /> <br /> People who are not programmers see this movie as terrible as there are no professionals in it. But the peoples do not see real things. <br /> <br /> Programmers find that this movie is strange and terrible - because the moments inside the movie are not related to real life (why is the film not a scifi in this case?).
