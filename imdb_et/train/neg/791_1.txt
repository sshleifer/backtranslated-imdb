A scene of a scene where a scriptwriter is sitting at the table and one says, "Let the black woman approach the public in the streets (including the black) and ask if she is black, then walk away." Other writers will fall hysterically laugh until one wants them to repeat it in every episode. More laughter. Now that you think the assumption is funny and that the show contains many such situations, you will enjoy this exhibition. For the rest, use your zapper and find something more fun than drying the paint. Those who have written about the glowing reports of this exhibition should either come out or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny. Another example of humor at the show is trying to pay the girl at the supermarket's cashier, trying to hypnotize the cashier. Marginally funny for the first time, but why repeat it with different cashiers at different shows? I could give you other examples, but they can be seen as spoilers that show why this comedy isn't funny at all.
