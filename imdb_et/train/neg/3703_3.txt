I didn't expect much of this movie, but boy-boy, I didn't expect the film to be that bad. Chris Rock doesn't see good deeds here, you can't feel his character being real, I think the film would have been a little better if his drama or romantic scenes had been less of a movie and more humor. The film is like a filmmaker who did it with a bad ghost. "Doing" they don't show any smiles - this is a very bad movie! I gave him ten out of ten because a few smiles gave me, but I never laughed!
