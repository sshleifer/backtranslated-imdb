As a true Elvis fan, this movie is completely confusing and the script is a disaster. The movie is opened by a beautiful son, Stay Away, and the Grand Canyon landscape gives the viewer something special. Elvis gets into the picture and her talent has been wasted for a long time, especially on the rest of the featured songs. I sat this movie twice to make sure it was spam !!! 1 out of 10 !!!
