"Why?" <br /> <br /> This simple question was to take place on every New Yorker's lip during a 12-month terrorist attack by David Berkowitz 1976-77. The same word will surely be as bright as the summer of 22 when people leave theaters that display a faithful and exploitative "Sami Summer". <br /> <br /> Director Spike Lee is trying to tell misleading catchers looking for marked psychopath - who paralyzed New York over a year - with harsh and graphic images of killings, demons inside Berkowitz and meaningless NYPD-man disappointment. He presents a band of despicable losers who hear their "barking dogs" when they live a life without love, honor and humanity - no different from Berkowitz. Lee browbeats audiences in almost every frame "not one of us is what we seem to be". Often Lee puts a white body critic into a stereotype, adding a scene where Mira Sorvino, who plays with his newborn husband (John Leguizamo), hopes that oral sex is a black man "behind a big black Cadillac." The Italian Mafioso tells the black detective that the famous Willie Mays midfield was "happy". Lee even gives a medieval black woman a racist impression, saying, "I'm glad that the white man kills all those white people, because if a black man killed all those white people - the biggest race in the history of NYC would be the biggest competition." <br /> <br /> Other than the outstanding opening pot that arrived at the disco (reminiscent of Martin Scorce's "Goodfellas" or Orson Welles' Third Man's). he has no soul, purpose or passion. He parades with the characters on the screen that have lost human dignity. Although we do not know anything about the real victims of this terrible spree, it seems that Spike Lee says New York got what he earned for two decades during this doubtful, boiling summer. <br /> <br /> "Such love for his beloved city?" "How could anyone show such hatred to their husband?" <br /> <br /> Are these suitable questions for Berkowitz or Lee? <br /> <br /> You decide.
