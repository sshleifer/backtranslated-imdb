The film's author, Steven Greenstreet, obviously does not appear to Michael Moore, but also follows in his footsteps using a number of Moore's propaganda tactics. Moore has experience of distracting the viewer while Greenstreet is probably less qualified here. <br /> <br /> Having been worried about all Moore speeches in the UVSC, I was disappointed that the biggest community complaints - that Moore was paid $ 40,000 from Utah State Education Funds to fundamentally promote John Kerry's campaign and promote his liberal movie - Greenstreet brought to the background while few questions were sensationalized. br /> <br /> The marketing methods of this video have been biased and reluctant ... promoting the movie, claiming that "Mormon was trying to kill Moore". Not only is it superfluous, it is a great religion that Greenstreet has probably some personal problems. I followed Moore's visit very closely, and all major news agencies noted that Moore's visit came and went without credible security problems or incidents in Utah. <br /> <br /> Greenstreet has been trying to make a film-making career on this film, even after leaving the film school to speed it up. However, this seems to be a serious miscalculation, as Moore's visits to some 60 other colleges and universities in 2004 reduced interest in this fairly common event. Greenstreet's assumption that the American audience would be interested in this film due to religious and conservative angles does not seem justified. <br /> <br /> Even the name of the movie, this shared country, is somewhat related to the election of Utah because it voted predominantly for Bush's re-election and thus seems more politically coherent than any other country. The division of the film's title seems to be more of a clue to the ideological differences between Greenstreet and its religion and state. If anything, I find a humorous correlation with the religious angle of this supposed documentary and Woody Allen's fun-filled Sleeper's (1973) dispute that "I was beaten by Quakers".
