Slackers is just another teenage movie that's not really worth it. Dave (Devon Sawa), Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael C. Maronna) finish the Holden University for losing, cheating and shocking. Three of the roommates are proudly disappointed in their college over the last four years and now, during their final exams, these big men-campuses are the most unlikely guy in school. The plot is very stupid and there is no reason to look at it unless you are looking for some time to close your brain. Slackers is just a predictable service that really adds nothing to the genre. Slacker comedy is either a hit or a lack, but the movie has no real funny or original moment. It's really just a set of gags and some are actually pretty funny. Although there are at least eight more for every joke that works. The scenario is full of penis and chest jokes that some high school and college students can enjoy. Even if they don't remember this movie for a while because it's not a very memorable comedy. Jason Schwartzman is playing an unpleasant Ethan, and after the appearance of good comedies he is pretty low. Jaime King and Devon Sawa are the other main stars, but in this movie they do a pretty bad job. It's led by Dewey Nicks and it's his first film, so you can't blame him too much. The most fun character was probably Laura Prepon, she's not very much in the movie. The film is only a short 86-minute-long film, but it may be too long for some people who don't like this type of humor. Slackers is not the worst film of 2002, but it is definitely less than average. Compared to other genre movies, there's a lot better than Not Another Teen Movie, American Pie and its sequel, Scary Movie 1 & 2, and so on. So if you haven't seen most of them and you are looking for something new then Slackers could fit this bill, but it's better if you just look at something else. Rating 4.3 / 10 below the average teenage comedy that is worth skipping.
