The first few minutes of the "Bodybuilder" is a combious charm: it opens with the Bible-indexed text (the part Samuel Jackson proclaims to his immediate victims in "Pulp Fiction") with two Karate schools in New York, teachers claiming the eternal question of mankind (who is better? Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?) And then Chiba, playing with herself; he immediately stops the robbery and interrupts the bottle with two bare hands. Unfortunately, entertaining value, deliberate or involuntary, hidden story, lack of activity for a long time, and poor quality of current activity are broken. For the sake of simplicity, here's why "bodyguard" is an intolerable movie to watch: <br /> <br /> 1) You don't know what's going on. <br /> <br /> 2) It's hardly hard. <br /> <br /> 3) The fighting there is short and terribly filmed. <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba is cool. Judy Lee is proud, her face is glorious. It's just for those I give "Bodyguard" to another star of 10. This film takes 87 minutes in 5 hours.
