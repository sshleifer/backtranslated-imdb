Although I heard this film was a little dry, I look at what Scott Bakula is. At the beginning of this movie, I had a great hope for classic cheese, but for the enjoyable Scott-gets-girl, and up to 20 minutes before the end it was going big. The plot twist was crazy and unexpected and very smart. I kept my fingers out to work and it would be a terrible misunderstanding until the credit passed and I realized that it was not a happy and contented end. Unfortunately, I regretted that I looked at it and quickly took some leap forward to restore my faith in the great Scottish good!
