This topic deserves a much better script and the end result when this movie works. The script is full of holes because it has never been counted as a story, but rather a nightmare scenario that has been loosely knit together. There are many gaps and loose ends. The scene where the victim of the robbery is told that his parents are not dead and who has been looking for him is a couple of strange. For a moment of cardiac therapy, the head of the shelter head has been written, giving him a "missing poster" when he was eight. In the real world, if the shelter of the shelter discovered that he had had a kidnapping under the roof, it would have been an immediate appeal to the police. This is a law enforcement issue, not Oprah's 12-minute segment. Everything that goes there is so short that I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes were free. Funny, that's what this film must condemn. Finally, it seems to be united.
