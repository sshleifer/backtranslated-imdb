this film has no plot, sign development or budget. it really sucks to say it briefly. Since there is no development for the film, it cannot even be seen as an attempt to be artistic or trying to make a statement against torture. Which leaves two other reasons to look at it. To be shocked or stepped out like a sick little freak. Well, this is also here. Girls' reactions just seem foolish. it's extremely easy to say it's a fake (honestly professional wrestling looks more realistic than the mess they're trying to hit in this movie.

Not only do they both contain realistic violence, but there is also a real story that draws you in and takes you to care for people such as America's fears of aliens, moral issues, man-to-people testing, human instincts and civilization, and many other things, plus they are carefully written and contain good humor, if the story doesn't focus on volence, these are much better choices for this mess
