The scenario was trying to rebuild the "exorcist" badly, but put on a blaa-blaa love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you busy. There is no substance in this film. but blows it, showing a number of people who dare to do something that no one cares about. Particularly boring, I wanted to leave the theater when I saw it, but stupid movie tickets were expensive, so I had to withstand the ugly torture that seemed to last forever. <br /> <br /> They use computer graphics here, instead of calling me (as I was, I hate CGI), it destroyed the movie even more. Some people say that this movie was terrible in movie theaters because it was "thought-provoking" and "slow-paced-action because it's an intelligent film". What is so smart or thoughtful when the story is basically a beautiful boy H eath Ledger as a priest with a love interest and who doesn't believe in his faith? This seems to be a forced concept. Oh and there is a mumbo jumbo about "your eater" (the movie was originally called "sin-eater"). The concept of Lame, but the film took the thing "your eater" too seriously, making the film pathetic and misleading when it was dark and intelligent. Yes, I know that in the Middle Ages there were indeed sinners of sins, but this film makes it hard. <br /> <br /> There was nothing in the movie and I forget why I even watched this movie. If you want horror movies that are really deep, look at Rosemary's baby, tenant, naked blood, society, cannibal, holocaust, pin, exor, Omen or some of Romero's "dead trilogy" movies. Nonsensical dialogue is not equal to intelligence, mainstream fans think it is (the same type of people who think a ridiculous film like Hulk is a cinematic masterpiece). If you want a gratifying boring horror, look at it. This film makes the church feel like a skateboarder.
