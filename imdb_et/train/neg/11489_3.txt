In the United States, there have been very few films about Rome that were not during or shortly after Julius Caesar. Hollywood swords and sandals epics are mostly a Christian issue that makes it harder to enter into the history of Rome (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule and found some resistance in Hollywood because it had no Jesus). /> <br /> It is interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before the time of Emperor and Christ, but also when Rome was just one city among many on the Italian peninsula, and he just hated the king. Tarquin and formed the Republic. <br /> <br /> But this is not a historical film; it is peplum, and although the production values ​​are not rocks, cartons work and characterize. I can only imagine what the dialogue was in Italian, but copying English with wood is very combative. I got some good laughs first. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many such genre films that most of these 60's Hercules movies have disappeared. It's fun to the point, but when the movie goes on, it's getting a bit boring. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain: when I saw this movie when I was ten years old, I would have loved it. At that age I went to Rome and sword fight. So this flick brought back some childhood memories.
