I'm not criticizing the film. There is not so much to talk about. It has good animal testing scenes that were probably quite surprising at that time. Clyde Beatty is not exactly a matin√©e idol. She is a bit light and not very good looking. But that's OK. He's the lion cage man. We know that if he does not take his lion's time to lean on his girlfriend, he will come to him on the island and save the day. Someone said earlier that this is a lesson in history. Circus scenes are still one day, especially for kids hanging. I didn't know that even in the thirties, they drove to three masts. It seemed like from 1860. I think this is their film material. No wonder this stuff got. They always talk about how to set him up. There's even a manageable one. It tells us a bit about male female relationships, a kind of giggly stupidity. But if you don't take it too seriously, you can watch it.
