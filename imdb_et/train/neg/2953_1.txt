Those reviews claiming that this movie is so bad that it goes well beyond that. This film has no innocent joy that Leonard 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli had. These films were entertaining in their horror, but this heap of dinosaurs is so painful. I have not struggled with this great pain as I looked at Baby Genius and Superbabies. Let me tell you the story before starting the review. Theodore Rex is a $ 35 million bust New Line Cinema refusing to put in theaters. They reduced the number of frames by sending it directly to video, making it the most expensive direct video in decades. Whoopi created this disaster after a huge salary. <br /> <br /> Plot: Millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch rockets in the sun to kill humanity and start another ice age. Female policeman Katie Coltrane and the idiotic dinosaur, whom Theodore Rex reluctantly called to stop him after the death of a friend dinosaur. <br /> <br /> The plot will be given to you at the beginning of a movie that robs the film of all its secrets. Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is really terrible. Whoop looks irritated and tries to push it with his results, but without results. Theodore Rex is flat and irritating, and its worshiping behavior is thin after five minutes. Most of the jokes rotate, threatening to bite people and hit people with the tail (accident and purpose). I thought the burglary was bad, but it takes Theodore Rex back: The worst film in Whoop's career. <br /> <br /> Don't let anyone tell you that this fear is bad enough to be enjoyable. I didn't see it when I watched this movie. I only saw a train wreck written by people who had to be sick of Howard The Duck. Humor is at this level and Theodore Rex looks like a cousin of Barney's relative. Completely painful from start to finish.
