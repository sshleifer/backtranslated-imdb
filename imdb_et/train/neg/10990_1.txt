I stopped watching this whole (very long) movie because I was interested in its empty stupidity and naivety. It seems hard to believe that so many famous people (Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Olivier, John Gielguld, Vittorio de Sica, etc.) would have been happy to participate in this farce. But maybe in 1968, people were really * so naive? The plot seems to have been written by some confused Latin American Marxist priests who have an agenda. There is a tremendous conflict, and the Russians are really good guys, the Communist Party's Secretary General is a nice and spiritual person who suddenly sees the light after 20 years and is forced to release his poor conscience in prison by releasing the priest from the Gulf of Siberia. Then the priest instantly becomes a pope. We are allowed to see the secret Vatican Pope voting process depicted in the weakest form you can imagine. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the Chinese Communists have been killed by their usual socialist economic miracle in a starving way. To overcome this small sweat on the relentless shining path of communism, they want to start a nuclear war (to fairly spread Western capitalist riches to poor Chinese workers). <br /> <br /> Our good old comrade General Secretary worries and invites the Pope just before his crown to ask him to mediate peace. They meet Peng, a Chinese leader, who looks and acts like a 15-year-old boy. You roll on the floor laughing, which people in 1968 thought China was looking out for. Society Peng demands that Western capitalists pay (which is quite logical whether capitalists do not always have to pay for the madness of the socialists) and that the Pope must also sacrifice for an altruistic cause So, when the Pope is crowned in Rome, he promises the richness of the entire Catholic Church around the world to feed our poor Chinese brothers in Christ. And it saves the world from nuclear weapons. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are also some smaller sub-plots that unfortunately provide little to redeem an incredibly bad movie. I would give him three oscars for stupidity. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony Quinn seems like a Pope rather unlikely. He is much more plausible than Zorba Greece.
