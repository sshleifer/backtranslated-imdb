I went to school with Jeremy Earl, so I heard this movie, I don't know if it was in the theater at all. I don't remember the name. I've seen it, it's like one of those after school specials. Operation is OK, not big. The plot was weak and the lines were pretty horns. So the only comment I can give about this movie is "Eh". I borrowed a movie from Jeremy when I was at a movie rental site, I would go past and after I look at it, I wouldn't recommend it to an old age in school. I have also noticed that many times when portraits of urban children are portrayed, the slang is excessive or simply outdated. Many times I think it makes their characters incredible.
