Killing High acquaintance with a funny man's revenge, who fell into one of the coolest and coldest jokes in cinema history. Unfortunately, after a promising opening, the flick went straight to hell. Very tedious and superfluous confusion with mediocre cuts and the last half hour that sucks at a completely new level of sucking. The man who played the nick killed himself immediately after the flick was released. If you want to rent a flick, stop it after prank and remember to pick a life.
