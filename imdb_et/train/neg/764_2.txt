The script for this Columbo movie seemed to be pulled out of the 1980s soap opera. Symbol-based movies are great, but only when characters are convincing. And in this movie, the only thing convinced by my desire to change the channel. Kaabur's dialogue sounds like a novel writer wrote. The great producer, Columbo himself, is not near his famous, lovable, self-expressing, wrinkled self; and the victim of the bride / robbery is a scary, one-dimensional girl (barely a scalpel that she held lightly in the kidnapper - come on! I could have knocked her scalpel and knocked her into your knowledge in 2 seconds). In any sense of reality, at least TRIED could have had little to fight. And talking about reality .... the story revolves around the kidnapping that the police are working on and solving. Police ?? Leave me alone. Everyone knows that the FBI takes over all the cases of robbery. It was NO Columbo, just a low and completely predictable criminal drama for our familiar colleague Columbo, written and stretched for 2 hours.
