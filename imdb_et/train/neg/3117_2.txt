My husband is a big fan of Robin Williams. I also like him, but he has generally found that he should "stick his best" and focus on comedy roles. My thoughts were confirmed with this film. I was totally bored in the whole movie. The story was predictable. I understand that it is inspired by a real story. But I guess it could have been some tension or intrigue even in keeping the truth. No character was well developed. There was a side story about the main character and his partner. This relationship could have been further explored. But it would have been more important to have a deeper examination of the "boy" mother. His psychological profile would have been interesting. Obviously, he has a long history that is not touched except in the most superficial way. If my husband wasn't such a big Williams fan, we would have left it for 20 minutes. Too bad I can't get my $ 20 or 2 hours ago.
