I just saw this movie and I have to say that although at first some effort was made to create a decent film, it was absolutely terrible - but not in the sense that I was sure. <br /> <br /> It was like a child guided this insult to intelligence with the conviction that all the viewers wanting are morals or extremely hard for entertainment OR both .... Thank God for a quick start! I can't imagine what type of viewer this meant when making a movie. I mean, you have actors who are trying to be serious, though hardly, and a script that cries out for rewriting. I can no longer say. If Harlequin Romance decided to make horror films, it would be good. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie fun, I suggest you look for some instructions about the purpose of the movie. There is a much better price. Join the club, READ REVIEWS, but first of all, avoid such a mess.
