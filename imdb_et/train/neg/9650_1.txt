Earth where I start with this godly film. Bad bad bad story speaks. I don't know what the director thought about making this movie. Namaste London was a pretty enjoyable movie to be honest. But this one ... and my good ... for a movie that should be musical ... songs are so bad. AR Rahman should have been a music director. <br /> <br /> Given two big players, the director would have had to do a lot better work. Although the first parties are sucking, the movie's last 30 minutes is OK. The Salman and Ajay performances record the film as a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> See if you have anything better to do. The last good movie about Bollywood was watching (and I watch their load) on Dev D and Wake Up Sid.
