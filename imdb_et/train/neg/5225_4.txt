There is no Drummond entry. Most of them have elements of their stupidity, later weddings, etc. But it has an infinite number of events that occur in the dark as characters move from one place to another. The house seems like a city. There is also Leo G. Carrol, who has such an obvious suspicion who no one seems to even see. He's a stranger and he's acting rather suspicious, but Drummond and the people don't look up. Still, it's a reasonably good activity and a pretty good end. hard to imagine someone with his taste or intelligence. Is he behind history explaining how he and Drummond joined?
