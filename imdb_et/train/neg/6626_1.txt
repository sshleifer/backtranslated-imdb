I saw the movie and got screwed because the film was stupid and boring. I thought ram gopal sure justified his job, but unfortunately failed and the whole movie got corrupted and they broke "sholay". cast and the team was bad. the whole theater slept while watching the movie, when some people ran in the middle. amithab bachan's behavior is bad, I thought this film is the biggest hit of the year, but this movie is definitely the biggest flop of the year. no one made his work fair, including Ajay devagan. this film does not deserve the viewers. I bet this movie will flop. <br /> <br /> "Finally, the movie sucks"
