I thought this film would be much better than it was. It sounded like a spy attack, and its beginning reminded me of Pleasantvili, but this movie came in a short time. <br /> <br /> The plot is just ridiculous. The KGB and the Soviet Union in Russia have begun training spies to teach their spies how to act like Americans, but the city they have created for training is a bit outdated so they grab two things from the US to spice up . I don't know, but it seems right there. It becomes really strange if someone besides it speaks Russian with a Russian accent. Somebody screwed in the work. <br /> <br /> It is also painfully dry for comedy. There are one, two funny spots that have nothing to sing and dance. Ultimately, the movie is likely to fall asleep. <br /> <br /> This film is as complex as the face, so it is so good in the United States that it makes me sick. The film is being spoken over and over again, the US is God and Russia is the devil. This is a pattern campaign that was made against Japan in World War II. Such films make everyone think the US is full. <br /> <br /> And I'm kind. It should really get one, but the dance scene was funny, but then it pulled back a long way to be really funny.
