I have rarely moved to make such comments, but after sitting through the most terrible movie of the rank I feel I have really deserved the right to say what I feel about it! I couldn't do it to the end and got one half or more walk (about 1/3 of the audience) after a dirty plot, a fascinating dialogue and an offensive character that became too much to wear. this film is all visual and not art. any style and substance. it is considered terrible action, a truly terrible script, indifferent cinematography and student-level production values. how it got funding, getting started and finishing is a mystery to me. I bet a million quid, which he doesn't release at all. the right critics tear it apart. really bad movie. shockingly bad. really really a very bad effort AND it doesn't even mean that there is no mention of a free-born kitten-gets-drop-in-deep-fat-fryer at the moment. completely useless, totally light, poorly assembled; this movie is terribly embarrassing for uk cinema.
