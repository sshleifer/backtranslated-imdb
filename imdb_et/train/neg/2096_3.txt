BSG Razor was a big fan of BSG Razor for only the first two seasons, and I hope this edition will return the franchise to its original day of glory. Usually I have no problem with scientific fiction, which is mostly in dialogue, not in the visual sense of special effects. If the script is tight with some good ideas from some good actors, it is possible to create a deep movie with little CGI money. This license does not have any of the above requirements. The world of virtual reality created by terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous and unbelievable. This scene was just there to raise the release rating limit. Not that teenagers do not love the virtual reality that is full of sex and violence and heavy dance music. This is part of the same teenagers who have intellectual depth and cause or a political and religious passion to create such futuristic software or get into suicide attacks that amaze me. These kids are definitely not on this planet. The film plays like a soap opera, but the last 10 minutes are a little interesting. The scene where Eric Stolz gave his cyber a doctrinal awareness through the renewal of the student's firmware was fun, if not fun. But this old concept was much better and much more credible in the brilliant, classic "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff. Caprica hangs her only interesting idea of ​​an old Hollywood horror film. No surprise there! In general, this film was bland & unoriginal and cheap looking using recycled CGI of Caprica BSG. I doubt I look at this room for the first time on a soap Sci-Fi channel. If, of course, it does not happen that I suffer from a bad sleep, then this show would definitely be a cure. Zzzzzzzz
