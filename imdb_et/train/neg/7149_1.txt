Anyone who wrote "Redline" as a great car movie must be able to pay off Daniel Sadek to promote this ultra-dirty, steaming stack of amateur suits. Just the worst autofilm or any film ever made. This changes Showgirls like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Get out every cheesy clich√© from every 80s TV series, put some really special special effects and flat characters that don't matter, and you have life proof that Daniel Sadek shouldn't write scripts or produce movies , but should remain in the real estate business. <br /> <br /> This is a flat film that has such a flat plot and most developed action sequences. What is offensive to me is not that the filmmakers are idiots, but that they find the film public so that it is enough to fall for that mess.
