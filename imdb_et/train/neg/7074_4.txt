My God, this movie is terribly boring. I'm a great fan of Gina Gershon when I rented this movie, I waited for a romantic drama and a great performance by Gershon. Gershon is great as always, but he is not the right actor for this role, he is too good for Rade Serbedzija. The romance of the Gershoni and Serbedzija characters is too convincing. And I totally hated Serbedzija's character (the winner's organizer), she's still not charming in the movie. How Lauren Graham (Gershon) is out of my understanding. Perhaps Sean Connery, Robert DeNiro, or Harrison Ford would have done a better job in this role, but they don't have Europe looking at it. In some way, I was so boring druing the movie. If you're looking for a good Gina Gershon movie, check out Bound's best movie. If you're looking for a romantic movie about a younger wife and older man, try Harrison Ford or Sean Connery. Gina Gershon is so underestimated and deserves a better chance if I want her to make a better choice in the future.
