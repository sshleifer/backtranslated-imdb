I don't know what it is about this film director Sam Morrovich, which somehow confused the little aspect of this film. I would usually say that this is a movie that shouldn't exist, but this film can be the most important thing. This film should only exist to be the "worst film ever made". I have seen bad movies during my lifetime, but it breaks what I find bad, something much harder to imagine. <br /> <br /> All in this movie is fun, but one of the most fun things is that Movovich himself sees it as a big movie. <br /> <br /> Oh ...
