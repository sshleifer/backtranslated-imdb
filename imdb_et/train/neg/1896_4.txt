This movie shows us something original. Each idea or (action) scene can be found in many previously published films. Fabulous Nick is quite normal here. Even Will Patton is calm and evil and not good. Mr. Duvall is ok but is very small. So does Angelina, so how can we identify our recently recognized stardom? In general, there are too many signs, so no one and nothing is very detailed. This makes the movie forgotten. Too bad, don't you think?
