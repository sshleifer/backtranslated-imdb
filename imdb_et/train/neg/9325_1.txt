S.I.C.K. really celebrates so incredibly crappy i killed myself. There was no action to talk about. The best part of the whole production was the box cover artwork. Budgeting this movie was enough. Filming was on the street of Allsam. The production looks like a film of terrestrial films. The props used in the film were stolen from the clothing store. The end was so predictable that you should move forward quickly in the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there is a book for this movie, I'm sure it's better. I would avoid it at all costs. I enjoyed the intimate scenes that made the whole movie worth it. I was joking.
