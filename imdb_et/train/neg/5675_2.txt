In the seventies, Max Seed (Will Sanderson), a killer of convicted serums, killed 666 people in six years. He is condemned to the death penalty, but in the case of an electric chair he does not die even after a triple shock. <br /> <br /> Detective Matt Bishop (Michael Par√©) and other officers cover this mystery by burying Seed alive. The seed breaks down and goes after the people who put it in their living coffin. <br /> <br /> The film, which has been filmed by the world's worst leader (Uwe Boll), is not a "Seed" other than a snuff that tries to stretch the envelope of a decent society and cannot provide any storyline. And he said it was based on real events, because if a person lives in an electric chair after a triple shock, they are free. It is a legend of the city and it will never happen. Like Boll's other abominations ("alone in the dark" for one), "Seed" is just terrible.
