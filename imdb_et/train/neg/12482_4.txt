Deathstalker is led by John Watson and marks Rick Hill, who is a bodybuilder and famous when I understood it? According to the plot, Deathstalker (Hill) tries to get back from the evil master and has to drive to the master's cave. He meets many dwarfs and monsters during his journey, and settings are close to Tolkan and, of course, to Conan Barbarian. This is Conan's tremendous success, and although it is a very stupid movie, it has a lot of trash and is recommended for garbage fans and tolerant movie bots! in this movie. A couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and exciting, but what Deathstalker concentrates show are naked women and big Hill's muscles. Women are usually helpless victims and also very stupid, so this is a very macho movie and so many feminists may not like it! Fighting scenes are nothing special and quite boring, and monsters are nothing special. And all other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and badly made, but what did you expect from such a small budget effort? It's trying to be as big as Conan, but he can't quite be miserable. As I said, it may be a pleasure for fans of Turkish cinema, but not for anyone else. It belongs to this category that is so bad that it is great! of course! If the bad movies are your cup of tea, try it and have fun, but if you don't understand "pleasantly bad movies" then stay away. And if nobody can hold on to the big nudity, stay away. There is more nudity than violence and because of these scenes, the film has an R rating. Otherwise, it might be a safe PG family movie! <br /> <br /> 4/10
