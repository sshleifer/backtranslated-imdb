Wow, I just saw it in T.V as a "scary" movie they show around Halloween. Was it rated G? This movie was really nothing else to scare or watch this movie. Other people also say it's junk, but I don't believe it. Fraud requires something called "humor". This low-budget crap-fest wasn't a sense of humor, and it didn't make sense either. You basically have a cozy looking monster (a man from a rubber suit) that comes out of the closets, kills people, I think you never see a monster who does violence to anyone or any bloody consequences. The spinning message tells you that the monster killed people, so I think it's good enough. The army is trying scary to kill a monster that is not much bigger than a man. They have a very bad purpose. Then the military FLEES! Wow, did this film make the US Army beautiful or what? Monster, though hard to kill, doesn't do much but shuffle and roar. Oh, and from time to time comes out of the mouth and shines another head. It was somewhat interesting, but still a complete alien looting. <br /> <br /> What was the scientist who was playing xylophone to attract a college? Due to poor audio quality, a lot of dialogue was difficult to understand. Why did the monster wander around for so long with his grandmother? Why didn't the monster go to the closet if he had a chance? Why do I need to insist on a meaningless mindset?
