The predicted factor completely undermines what might have been an interesting and emotionally charged character study. Fox is OK, like Nathaniel Ayers, a Julliard-trained musician who dreams of playing with Walt Disney orchestra, until his races with schizophrenia drive him to the street and eventually slip. Looking at a good story about enhancing his flagship career, reporter Steve Lopez {Robert "Rehab" Downey} gets to know him and tells his story. Every element of the classic movie "how do we beat" movies, borrowing very freely "Beautiful Mind", so "Rocky" films fake "good feelings" when you choose a sequence number and whip a lot of the 1930s-style melodrama, all on the screen, is the burnt shell of the movie. It's bright, tricky, completely predictable and too often playing our feelings. I hate to say this, but it's a movie that says you hate it, people give you a bad look. I really wish I could say something positive about this movie, but I really can't. The action redeems it somewhat, but it is not enough to give it more than one letter. Strictly made for TV movies. Not worth your time.
