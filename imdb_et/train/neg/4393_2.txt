I didn't like Frosty back and that. Both films are absurd, with poorly written characters and bad voices. The voice could have been done, but Frosty returns because of the worst snowmen. Frosty's winter lands were great and so the original heartbreak drama. The only good thing about this movie was Frosty, the snowman was a classic 60-like and funny line, as if they were talking about things that were not real, and then Frosty walks out of the window to chase what he does, but everything else was bad written and poorly animated and I hardly got a plot. I saw the library's DVD cover about two or three years ago and the art looked nervous, so I couldn't find it until the street because the pictures on the back looked a bit touching, but I played this movie. It was badly bad for art characters like DVDs and it was just terrible what's going on. I looked at it at night and found that it was boring that I fell asleep (Wait, I'll do it whenever I look at something) But this movie was boring <br /> <br /> Overall rating: Grade -C <br /> <br /> It's like another vacation special bad rip-off for cold returning and this. This is a bad 4th sequel like home alone 4 well, I thought the movie was OK, but alone at home 3 was great. But it's like a bad home alone with 3 and 4 people hating it. My sister didn't look at it so much, because when she looked at my room for two minutes and half, she went out like "I hate animation!" I agree with him as the third Frosty returns. Just terrible!
