I just came to watch this movie and decided to see what others thought about it. I don't know if the people who give the glowing overview saw the same movie! This is a potentially very good story, but it doesn't hit the mark. The script is very weak - there are so many holes in the plot that it would make a big dip network for fishing scenes. The characters were not well developed and the story jumps so much that I found myself asking "How did we get here?" at least one and a half times during the movie. <br /> <br /> There was no chemistry between cast members. This is probably related to Lindsay Lohan's films. It was quite clear that everyone showed up and did their job, but did not commit themselves. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie worth seeing ... go for a walk, play board games, take a nice warm bath and save your money on something worth it!
