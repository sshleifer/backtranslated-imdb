When I refer to Malice as a movie poet, I do not compare it with masterpieces such as Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or The Maltese Falcon and do not compare director Becker with Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Luis Bunuel. I just register a protest against the darkness that passes through this film from beginning to end, in so far as most of the time can't just do what's going on. I understand the darkness at night, but this movie was even in the dark in the dark, so I understood. But as it is, it would not have been a big difference if director Becker had filmed it in complete darkness.
