The stuttering plot, the uninteresting characters and the sub-par (at least say) dialogue plagues this TV production that would hardly have been an interesting even billion dollar production budget. <br /> <br /> Characters are not plausible, their motives, actions, or their recognized agencies. The plot is hacking bad Dungeons and Dragons (TM), but with plasma rifles and force fields. There are serious issues of continuity and the degree of meaningless interaction between the characters is at least the author's momentum. Avoid this as a plague. Look at any of the Dark Angels episodes and you have better action, dialogue and plot. Yuck.
