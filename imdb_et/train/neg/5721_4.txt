I wasn't at all a fan of the 2005 gore fest hit "Hostel", and most of these flat ass knock-offs are just as bad or worse - yet the "Live Feed" managed to keep me somewhat entertained for about the first 30 minutes. Started with a lot of sex and sliding settings, followed by some good death scenes involving a Chinese organized crime group and a 7-foot, burnt-out butcher ... What made me out of the movie was a harsh "hero" of weapons and contempt to save the day. I would call this movie mediocre, at best, because the premise, which mainly involves horrible young people who are killed in a sweet porn theater, doubles as a mafia, is a pleasure to me. If only torture was extensively extended, my assessment would be very different. Unfortunately, most of the dreadfulness accumulates in one scene, leaving the rest of the movie a revenge scenario. So, basically, it's just a low budget "hostel" where you can get free delivery, almost constantly in the first half of the movie ... Generally, I wouldn't worry about it.
