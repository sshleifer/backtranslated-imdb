It is hard to believe that in 1997, David Duchovny was at the top of his fame, X-Files, one of the best sci-fi series, at the top of glory. Nine years later, he has almost forgotten and his aids, which make it on the big screen, failed. I can't even explain why he is a fair actor, but apparently his celebrity moment gave him an eternal role that would break the great talents. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Angelina Jolie was much less well-known and she was really happy that the film, like "God Playing", didn't put her career in a dead end. Fortunately, "Bone Collector" and "Girl, Interrupted" waited unexpectedly, and when Lara Croft came, her career began. <br /> <br /> There's not much to say about this movie. This is the only Andy Wilson big screen movie and there must be a reason. Everything is banal and most of what is happening on the screen that is expected in the former clinic, who saves the shooting victim in the bar just to find work on the mobile. The off-screen voice is particularly bad, with a moral text that kills the shadow of every film's cinematic experience. It's probably not going to come to the movie, but to DVD rental stores or TV. Try to look for something better.
