How can I best express my feelings about this film: ugly? headache? the absence of a single written letter? plain stupidity? Try all of the above events. And that's just the direction. <br /> <br /> Story? Well I think there's a story. Two foolish blondes are looking for work after they have reached the plane. They are mistaken for "the world surrendered assassination" (sarcasm) and are "hired" by two "mobsters". One thinks that "take it out" means date and the other gets a minor actor whom he dreams of. And, of course, for the turtle turtle that they are building with casino wins. <br /> <br /> Sounds like it's all funny? Guess again. They're trying to make it funny, but not. Filming sequences are not well done. I've seen better filming in Hong Kong movies. Visuals are averages of films from the 80s. But the problem is that it's a 2007 film. <br /> <br /> It's not worth my time to watch it again. He still does not take Danny Glover's "Out" from the beginning of the 80s to the worst movie ever since, but again this movie is in his class. "F"
