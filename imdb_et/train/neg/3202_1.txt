If you hear the three words you have said ... "Joe Don Baker", be afraid ... <br /> <br /> The ultimate justice is a low-budget movie based on the Sheriff of Geronimo in Texas. (pronounced as Heronim). He is a ugly, sloppy, rude character who has been chasing a criminal in Malta who killed his partner in Texas. His partner pulled the film down twice. Very poor editing. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) comes to this movie jail like 4 or 5 times, making the plot fast. Plus, he shoots everything as he is in the wild west. I think no one told her it was the 20th century. The woman's policeman is destined to show her around Malta (who looks like Elaine Seinfeld) and she's the only one who can catch a red neck. He must be crazy! <br /> <br /> Bar strippers are the most fun characters in this movie. Their dance is shown throughout the film and I started to tie with sliding women. Well, at least it was better than looking at Geronim to try to clear something out of his journey. The end is faulty and somewhat predictable, and I was happy that it finally ended. You will never forget the latest movie by Joe Don Baker. <br /> <br /> It's so hard to imagine how he was in a thirty bond movie ... very strange! Anyway, if you laugh, look at it in MST3K sometime. Also, I've heard of her other bad movie (among many), "Mitchell" MST3K version is released by DVD by Rhino. I can't wait to see it!
