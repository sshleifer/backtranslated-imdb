Camera Work - Why is the camera so jumpy in this movie? It's annoying and annoying. Editing - The flashes of the pictures were too short. Many other scenes were too short. Just blinking. Sound - the background music was too loud and the voices covered. There should be no need for rewinding and repeating to say what was said. Does anyone control these things or do them again. Please reduce the amount of background music in the future. Is regulating the relative sound level the work of editor Julia Wong? The plot had too many open ends. The main feature was potential. I think the film needs more work. Did it hurry? Maybe they ran out of money. Like many movies, it started to be big but just bumped out. I really don't understand this, you know you have a story before it goes into production, so not all open ends are groomed on the storyboard. <br /> <br /> Sorry I'm so critical.
