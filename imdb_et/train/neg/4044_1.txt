From a plot and movement point of view, this film was terrible. I found myself watching the clock in the theater, hoping that it would end and relax after 80 minutes when he mercifully did it. In principle, five characters appear in the film: Son and Dad, Girlfriend of the Son and Two Male Characters of the Sons, who appear and disappear without context or explanation. The film and the scenes seemed to refer to homo-eroticism, but nothing ever happened in one way or another. There were a couple of bright scenes. At the beginning of the film, the girl's girlfriend appears in a window in her room and is engaged in an odd conversation. Photography and action made the relationship between the two unbelievably seductive, ending with acknowledging that he had another man who was "older." End of this story.
