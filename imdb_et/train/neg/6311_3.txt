It's a bad, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> For people, a real realistic movie is good. That's not for me. Life is also predictable, bad, disgusting, trivial, pointless, sometimes. Perhaps this is why people say this movie is real. <br /> <br /> Too many common places: you are black, you are a criminal, you are doomed and damned, whatever you end with taking pictures or taking someone's pictures; Don't let children play with weapons, it can be dangerous; and then there are those who go to church, and then they are good, very good ... <br /> <br /> Before that I hadn't seen such a bad movie. This is perhaps why I have never noticed how important photography is to the film itself. It is out daily, the scene shot outdoors is clearly and disturbingly blue. They didn't care about improving the balance of colors. Oh! I have rated over 300 movies in the database so far, and this is the lowest (3/10).
