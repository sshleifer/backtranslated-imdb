the boring things we got here. His 5-minute shorts are better. know why? because there are only 5 minutes and not 91 minutes or how long it is. <br /> <br /> The plot is a glove ... eh .. the last half hour is boring, the rest is boring and not funny = (I had hopes, the trailer made it funny, but this pace movie is rather slow and unfortunately not funny, just plain boring klymen, who runs to each other and tries to laugh at us .. does not work. Cutting this movie again and adding better scenes would do a lot of improvement, but now it's just good.
