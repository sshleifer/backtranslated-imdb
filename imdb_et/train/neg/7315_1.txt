OK let's right. We have five recent college degrees (we have to have F vocabulary) that go on the weekend. They get into someone who needs help, but instead of helping them, they decide to come instead. Nice number of people. Next, some of them begin to get sick - there must be something in the salon where they are. But the neighbors seem to be OK. Well, when things get really bad, they lock their companions instead of getting help (try the neighbor by the way). Some locals don't like them. They drive at one high speed through the forests for many miles until the truck breaks down. Somewhere ten minutes later, he appears in the cabin (how he found it and how he could drive at speed to get a secret). Another type of brain surgeon in the salon understands that something is wrong that he hides the cave to blow it. He then decides to return to the cabin the next day, believing it to be a shrine. He's relaxed that he lived (he had to think it was a 24-hour mistake). Unfortuneatley he has met some not so friendly police officers. The second couple decides to have sex while the meat bug is working on their charm and then women realize that it needs to shave their feet (taking a lot of diseased skin by shaving). Anyway, you get that idea. There's no point here. These are the five people I don't want to be. I took the meat to eat bacteria. Other characters were introduced, who were also somewhat amusing, but also completely unlikely. Ninety minutes of good lives wasted here.
