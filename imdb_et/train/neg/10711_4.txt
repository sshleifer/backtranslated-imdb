Minion is about ... well, minion. Satan's servant and its purpose is to get the key that opens the door where his lord is trapped. He is a demon who owns people and when his body dies he has another. Anyone who happens will go to some berserker. Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas, a member of the Templar secret order, whose task is to keep the key away from the minister. The film begins a thousand years ago, in the Middle East, where a few knight's temples escape the minister. Then flash ahead in 1999, where the key comes up somewhere underground in New York. The archaeologist is assigned to explore / dig the place where the key was found. Needless to say, the minion is the key, and the film becomes a long-lived chase scene between the ministry and Lukash and the archaeologist. <br /> <br /> The film is just a small budget flick of a B-movie. The film lacks energy and just trods. You follow the pursuit, but you never feel the story that deliberately takes the ideas of previous films (especially The Terminator films). Fighting scenes with a minion is cumbersome because you never know how good or how bad a warrior this demon is. This "skillfully" becomes a one-man army when he fights for group templates but sucks when it comes to one-on-one. And it should be around for a long time. All this shows that some sense of logic is simply drained. The whole idea of ​​the secret organization of the Templars, the door of hell and the key is not well explained. We just have to accept that they just exist. The film seems to have been made with the feeling that the story is not big enough, but only enough to make a few bucks. Dolph Lundgren is sure he wants to be somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Decision: 2 out of 5 stars.
