Sugar & Spice is one of the worst films in 2001. The film tries to overcome Heathers and brings it in and fails. When I saw last January, I was so bowed down with the film I walked and talked to my cellphone with my girlfriend in the last half hour. I've heard that the DVD has a director's section, maybe I'll look at it, but this PG-13 trash is s *** and the worst s ***. Maybe if the film had R&D that would have done it. But the gags are flat and the behavior is terrible. Worse than Troma movie.
