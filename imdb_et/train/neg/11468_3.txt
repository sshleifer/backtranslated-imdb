I don't know who got the idea that the orcas are going to kill and revenge people, but my god is absurd. Certainly, Orcas is not the cold bloody killer that this movie ... makes it foolish. The orcs are extremely intelligent, don't get me wrong, but I doubt they know and understand the concept as vengeance. So I have to say that coming out of this movie was entertainment from how embarrassing it was. So I was at least somewhat amused. Personally, I would advise you to go and see the jaws if you want to see an animal-killer-type movie. But if you are like me and you want to laugh at something far from realism, I'd say I'd go on. : D
