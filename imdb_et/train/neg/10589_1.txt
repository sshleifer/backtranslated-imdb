Universal soldier: Return is not the worst film. No, this glory should go to a film that tried to make some kind of statement or perform some artistic presentation but was not pathetic or offensive. But none of the films I've ever seen have been so little tried and successful as Universal Soldier: The Return. <br /> <br /> This movie is a sci-fi / action travesty that has nothing to suggest. Action is as bad as any movie I've ever seen. The plot is terrible and predictable. Special effects are pathetic. In short, anyone who even connects to this movie should be ashamed. USA: Returns make masterpieces of cinematic works similar to the previous Van Damme ticket price. Some movies are so bad they are good. Believe me when I tell you that this is not one of them. I'm not really sure what to say here. I doubt many people were considering watching this movie if they hadn't done it yet, but just in case: away.
