Very disappointing movie. Finally, I no longer care about any characters. I enjoyed seeing a very small part of Ving Rhames and William Macy was always good, but he still didn't look at it. It starts strongly and just becomes weaker and weaker. Insomniacs likes this because I'm sure it will make them fall asleep.
