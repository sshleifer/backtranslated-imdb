If you have a lot of time wasting ... it's OK. It is moving fast, but it should be a little longer to pull this movie out, a little less in the background. <br /> <br /> Operation is OK. Mariana Klaveno as a nanny does the best job and is most likely. <br /> <br /> William R. Moses played a good role as a spouse. <br /> <br /> Gail O'Grady, as a woman, had a weak part and the reasons for her return to work were not developed. <br /> <br /> The end is sort of stupid. Like most of these sitter films ... there are parts that are interesting ... but in general it leaves you wondering why you spent time.
