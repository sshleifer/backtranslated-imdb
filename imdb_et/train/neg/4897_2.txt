For me, this film is Tsai Ming-Lian's ultimate disappointment. It erases the laziness of your every frame. So I'm not going to analyze it thoroughly. But some observations: <br /> <br /> 1. If drought is a prerequisite, why do we see urban landscapes with blooming green trees? I don't know if it meant something in the metaphorical context of the film (where thirst is reported by the intimacy of lust and the trivial substitute of the watermelon). Or, it's just making harsh movies that don't fucking fucking be cohesive. <br /> <br /> 2. We don't know what happened to a porn actress, why she's unconscious or probably dead. The question does not seem to matter if the message of ultra-alienation is successful (= bombastic), but afterwards its inert body has proved to be a cheap dramaturgic trick, an excuse? as free and exploitative as the activity it uses. <br /> <br /> 3. In this movie, nothing has been said that Antonion wasn't 40 years ago better? and without their participants unnecessarily humiliating. <br /> <br /> 4. Musical numbers ("Recycled from Hole") felt the idea of ​​a high school teacher about the artistic resistance that was made at this level of secondary skill. If it was a point, the point was sucked.
