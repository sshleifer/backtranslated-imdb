Billy Chung Siu Hung's (Bloody Sword Film Assassin since 1993) is one of the strongest products of III Love that lived in the HK cinema in the early nineties. It consisted of films with strong gender, nudity and violence, which were more or less free and shocked only. Love To Kill is definitely a "more" category with some unforgettable ideas and celluloid disease. <br /> <br /> HK psycho Anthony Wong (Herman Yau's award-winning story from the same year) plays a businessman and a man who wants to torture, humiliate and rape his young woman (Elizabeth Lee Mei Fung), who for some reason does not leave her or Save yourself and your sons from being disturbed by the tormentor. One policeman (Danny Lee, famous police characters from films such as Dr. Lamb (1992) Billy Tang (and director Lee) and The Killer (1989) by John Woo for some, however, call the problem and begins to protect a woman and son, but Anthony doesn't know it at all, and drives rain and a typical ultra-centered spiral and graphic finale during the rain. <br /> <br /> The film is almost completely without serious achievements as it is just one use to bring in cash when these films were so Images and events are something that Western cinema has never found, at least in the mainstream, and all this becomes even more amazing when some movies to Western countries, such as violence and child witnesses, are often broken in these films, making drawing drawings alone would change most viewers feel bad about it, and it's going to be great for this movie. <br /> <br /> The film still mentions the pretty interesting and creepy Dr Lamb's tradition Typically, HK's music and soundtrack started to interest and adds images, especially in these terror films. Cinematography is also worth mentioning, especially in the film, especially in the finals, with blue and camera lenses (like Assassin), and the furious storm is well covered in the camera. Otherwise, there is nothing to evaluate the film at a higher level than the nastiness meter. <br /> <br /> Actors and actors are talented and professional and therefore do not make the film worse with their behavior. Nonetheless, the film has the usual HK humor that makes the sick even thicker when some "humor" is thrown into the soup. It contains some jokes about Danny Lee's erection, etc. Something that was never found in Western "serious" movies. And this thing usually destroys amazing HK movies because humor is just so obvious and trying to entertain the audience and the masses. <br /> <br /> The film has a very high level of resentment, as it has many scenes that depict Wong's abuser in many ways. She gets raped and molested, beat and threw her husband. We also see some setbacks from Wong's own childhood, which turns out to be equally violent when his father killed him and turned his little son into what he is now. These setbacks, mostly at the end of the movie, also include some totally unexpected experiences, as the images are accelerated (for example, ax hits) and this creates a totally mad and meaningful atmosphere for the scene. Again, it seems that only HK exploiters can come out. The end itself contains a lot of sudden and shocking gore, because the madman keeps his ax and also meets some nails, for example, his fury. <br /> <br /> The film is, in my opinion, quite "suspicious" because violence and terror are, in fact, painful and do things NEVER to entertain, mostly to rape. The version I saw (I've seen in two versions) contains a very long and completely nausea rape that just tries to be as sadistic as possible. I'm not sure if the HK audience sees such a picture, but I think someone who has any idea about the morality of the movie / entertainment does not agree or do anything like that. Women get brutal and deadly in the most sadistic and lower ways, so that men's fate seems almost annoying compared to women. <br /> <br /> The second version I saw in the recently released DVD HK (without subtitles) is the brutality scene of this table in a much longer format than the subtitled Taiwan DVD, which is otherwise identical to the HK version. I have also heard that old HK Laserdisc is different from these two, and since the final credits are full of scenes and images that are not found in the actual movie, it is impossible to tell how these "uncut" versions that are released or shown are theatrically. Obviously, many excerpts have been cut out, perhaps even before the release of the theater. <br /> <br /> The movie was written by Law Gam Fai and Lau Wing Kin, who also wrote films like Dr. Lamb, The Untold Story and Gunmen (Kirk Wong, 1988), but from his other films I've seen, is Love to kill the most free. Dr Lamb and The Untold Story are both very cruel and violent, but they also have some attempts at some criticism of the authorities and men in general, when it is easy to exchange a beast to fight one or that. The Untold Story, a sacrificial torture, a victim of a crime, is very strong and will definitely affect something that can be rotten in society and the police. But none of this is to kill in love, it's just an honest, calculated, and quick-made exploit that, incidentally, is produced by Veterinary Director Kirk, the Office of Organized Crime and Triad (1993), Crime Story (1993) "Wong! <br /> <br /> Love to kill serves no more than 2/10 of me, because I do not have too much appreciation for such films. (HK) Cinema is meant to be and can be more, and movies like Love to Kill are only commercial parasites that live in true artworks.
