I quote Oedpius Rex because it is a tragedy that this movie was even made! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I'm not in any way Uwe Boll, who is most of the IMDb humorous people! <br/> <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll's movies, such as mail and tunnel rides, are fun and entertaining. But honestly, this movie was just terrible. I hated it so much that I would give him a star rating. The story is just nonsense! It spends four-fifths of the plot on film and then they are in the middle of what is just grizzly terrible tasteless and murdered murder scenes! Finally, this "wool beats ends", which is perfectly acceptable, but certainly could have been more delicious than this! <br /> <br /> I am not against Uwe Boll (as I said before) or against violent films! I f ** King loves violent movies! I loved Saw movies, Hostel movies, Tokyo Gore police, New York ripper, 28 movies, Dog soldiers, My Bloody Valentine, Last house left, Watchmen, Wolf Creek, every Tarantino movie, Sam Sam Peckin, even Cannibal f ** King of the Holocaust! But that's it! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> It was just cruel, sadistic and perverse! And watch the movies I just mentioned! If I like Cannibal Holocaust and not that, it must be bad! Uwe, don't go dark again! You're funny when you're with a light heart like Ed Wood. It was just a terrible experience! I felt awful all over this after I saw it! <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE! OFF ALL COSTS !!!!!
