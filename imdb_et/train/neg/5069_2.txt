I have a serious problem with this exhibition, many in fact. At this point, a simple list is enough, later we go into more detail: superficial characters, a laughing ghost and boring humor. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to look at the rest, just read and read that you can feel the boss (as you would see at this show that I didn't see) often from channeling from Canada. In summary: Friends suck, not only because it is unusual, but because it destroyed new, good shows (Arrested Development, Dexter, etc.) for televisions. Friends are guilty of reality on TV, "Two and a half men" and "Queen of the King" as TV leaders. Now with the review. <br /> <br /> These characters are not the soul, they are exactly the same (outside the color of hair and hair). They respond in the same way to eternal situations and are completely safe in their bodies. Where is the conflict and the accompanying humor? Why isn't Rachel Monica after Monica hangs with Rachel's enemies? Why doesn't Joey commit suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously? Oh right, because he's stupid and he's happy with it. It is a curse of perfect characters: a permanent conflict and a (divine) personality becomes impossible. <br /> <br /> Laughing is one thing that should have died right after birth. Every exhibition with one is almost certainly a funny opposite. How can I make such a broad generalization? If an exhibition that claims to be "comedy" requires someone to laugh, it means that the audience does not want to laugh. Laughtracks destroys humor by preventing a quick return. Humor becomes a building rather than a free flowing entity (see office, seized development). <br /> <br /> This leads me to the next point: humor is boring. The perfect character can not do anything more than just humor (probably without a laugh) just because our daily humor comes from recognizing our mistakes. What if Monica is 17 years old? He immediately admits that what he does is not right and disintegrates with him. There must be a conflict, not a direct solution. Maybe his mother finds out or one of his friends is trying to get rid of him and get him seduced. That would be nice, it would be like a battle of custody! Now I have made my point. Many of my friends love this example because they haven't heard of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development, many of my friends hate this example because they recently started watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. <br /> <br /> In my life, I have been watching very little "friends", but I've been watching enough to see the tremendous mistakes that make the show completely unobtrusive. If you've read this far, thank you, and I hope you look at some of these exhibitions at least.
