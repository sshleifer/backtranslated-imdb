Dear Richard, I know we all loved you at home with Tim Allen. But seriously, do you have anything else to do besides the sheep queues for Air Bud? I would have thought that Tim would actually have given you a little role, now or even becoming his personal assistant. I know it seems to be ironic, but pay benefits are much more profitable. <br /> <br /> Everyone would see you around Timi and think about Tool Time instantly. You could even have Bob Vila roles more often. Instead, you'll see a 10-minute golden retriever and smiling. I know there wasn't a lot of script, but it could have been added. I mean, come on. Tim owes you. <br /> <br /> But seriously, this movie does nothing on the Air Bud line. On the contrary, fake talking puppies are bigger than playing sports dogs. The original was better. And you, Richard Richard Karn, know more than anyone else. <br /> <br /> This is an "F" movie.
