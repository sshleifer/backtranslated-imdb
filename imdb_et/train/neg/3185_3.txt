This movie was just MST3K by heckled and with good reason. First of all because it's a "police" movie starring Joe Don Baker, whom we all know, is as good a cop as Michael Jackson is the western singer of the country. <br /> <br /> All the typical police movie equipment behind your ugly heads, bar fights, child hostages shoot out, bad acting, flat police leaders, bad acting, revenge / justice, endless goons and of course bad acting. Don't look at it without MST3K filters.
