First, Jon Bon Jovi does not seem to be in a vampire movie. With another not-so-interesting character as well as bad style, the whole movie becomes predictable. If you keep this in mind and you are a complete vampire fan, you can have fun with some scenes. Don't expect any Tarantino-type chapters or the story of Anne Rice. (I assume I have forgotten the whole movie tomorrow);
