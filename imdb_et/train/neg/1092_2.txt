Well, I think the good news about William Winckler's 2001 Opus The Double-D Avenger is that he manages to combine it with Russ Meyer's mammal admiration - Kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven de la Croix. (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satana and Babette Bardot were busy during the week when they did this ... or else they managed to predict a copy of the script!) The bad news (and there is a lot) is that it The film - if it can even be called it directly recorded on the video - is a complete failure, complete abortion, fictional cruelty, absolute abomination and truly one of the worst pictures I've ever seen. Never look at what has ever been done! The plot here deals with kittens who are receiving superpowers after the destruction of a rare South American cockazilla plant to treat their breast cancer (oy), and later fought with the tripled trio of bikini dancers in LA. joking trotted falls completely (you should forgive the expression) flat that there is ZERO's actual nudity movie at all (except for some old photos of Kitten's prosperity), and that some shaving cream and papier-mache stone is a special FX amount. The Meyer's gals are a bit long here in the chest teeth to kindly put it, although Sheri Dawn Thomas, like the bikini girl Ooga Boobies (!), Can stand out. So why have I given this minor, unsuccessful, failed movie 2 instead of 1? Be short: Joe Bob Briggs. His voice view, which I just watched, is completely fun, especially when he pulls about 100 synonyms for "boobs" from 1000 on his "Canonical Hooters List". The man is a national treasure, and he manages to update the ring design of this album!
