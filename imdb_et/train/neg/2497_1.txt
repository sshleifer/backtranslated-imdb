There is only one problem with this website, you can't give a negative opinion. In addition, the companion evaluated it as a Class D movie. I say he was too nice. One piece of wood could show more of the emotions that the participants of this film and the money used to produce that film would have been better used to start the fire. It is absolutely terrible, 2 hours of life that anyone who carries this untalented bleeding will never get back. After 5 minutes of viewing, I thought to the boys and the boys whether the drowning big difficulties would make it more fun. Lastly, half of the packaging and 151 bottles were finally found in the G-Class, which acted remotely funny. It is an insult to the whole planet that the director thought someone could benefit from it, he should go and buy a rope. And for the flick actors, I hope you have that fun because I doubt you're ever working again. All in all, I fined all the 100 grand and 12 incorrect points for this film for their license.
