Don't spend your money or time on this pathetic film in the shadow of cinematography. If every third word is devoted to an unpleasant language and is not an actual plot, but also old actors who still give the same dated performances from the past and have not developed during their career, leave a lot to say. Waiting for the award-winning actor Benicio del Torol something better. Such a trash can, like Maldeamores, irreversibly distorts the vision that others can get from Puertorricans. At some point in the film, an inaccurate word may be used to emphasize this perspective and may even be funny or sad depending on the context (see for example Elsa and Fred), but it should not penetrate the plot. The film is completely embarrassing, and there was nothing funny about this movie or even cute.
