This is a film that should be shamed by all involved. Poor leadership, the top actor and the plot that has no sense in showing violence. I was thinking when I first saw that it was a media satire and how it shows violence, but that is not. I'm not sure what makes the movie worse. Oliver's stone makes the worst leadership. Of the scenes where Woody Harrelson's face is without reason, or the terrible power of Robert Downey Jr, such as Wayne Gale, a reporter who seems completely bonkers, this film is just a mess.
