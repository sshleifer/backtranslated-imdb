I'm a pretty young writer / scriptwriter Michael Chabon. His novel "Wonder Boys" became a fantastic film for Curtis Hanson. His masterful novel "The Amazing Adventures of the Cavalier and Clay" won a Pulitzer Award a few years ago and went on a "Spider Man 2" manuscript, which is arguably the greatest comic book of all time. <br /> <br /> Director Rawson Marshall Thurber has also been leading wonderful comic strips such as "Dodgeball" and "Terry Tate: Office Linebacker". And like cast, including Peter Saarsgard, Sienna Miller, Nick Nolte and Mena Suvari, it seems to be pointless. <br /> <br /> That's it. Literally. <br /> <br /> Jon Foster stands for Bechstein, a mobile (Nolte) son who recently graduated from economics. Jon is in a state of development: he works in Barn with minimal pay, communicates with his girlfriend / boss, Phlox (Suvari), which is little more than a lot of sexes, with no plans to devastate his career . <br /> <br /> One evening, the ex-roommate will introduce Jon Jane, a beautiful, intelligent violinist. Later that evening they went to the pie and asked Joni a question that would shake him from his catatonic state, "I want you to tell me something you have never said to one soul. Make that night indelible." about where he talks about the city, looking at the face of strangers passing through him, but none of them sees him. "I think it must be what death knows," he says. Jon, Cleveland, and Jane spend every waking time with punk rock concerts, drugs and drinking alcohol. It doesn't fit well with Phlox, who pushes Joni into a more personal relationship, namely to let him meet his new friends and father. The film tries to take us to Joni's journey when he shakes off his father, Phlox and his handrails put to him by his deadlock, because he finds his relationship with Cleveland and Jane with freedom and expression. <br /> <br /> It's a problem that we follow Joni in the whole movie: he's totally uninteresting. He has no ambitions, passions or goals. He walks through life as an invisible wraith, which he described to Jane at the night they met. At first this is not a problem. But he's no longer interesting. He's completely inactive. She just follows Bohemian Cleveland and Jane, but she never gives any impression of what she cares about or wants to do. <br /> <br /> As a result, the movie and its supporting characters are nowhere to go and do little to do anything other than having sex and getting arguments. In other words, there is not much to talk about. What we have here is the low skin of the good movie without the interior. Crippled cinematography, meaningless speech with stars looking far, lots of sexual scenes as straight as homosexual, big arguments, more angry sex, chasing and tragic death ... but it doesn't seem important. Ironically, at one point, Jane is confused by many of Jon's meaningless actions: "What's going on, Jon? What's this?" Yes, Jon, tell me. We also die for the public to find out. <br /> <br /> The title "Pittsburgh Secrets" must refer to the characters themselves, because that is what they are. These are all facades, one-dimensional stand-outs for real people. The film will never let us in. We never know what makes them either. We see they do a lot of things, but we don't know why. And the lack of "why" is one of the worst things a film can have.
