This movie was just bad. Almost every cop movie clich√© is present and counted. A bad guy is going away? Check it out. Partner? Check it out. Wacky personality contradicted by partner? Check it out. Rookie to prove something? Check it out. Rookie looks like a grizzled veteran. Check it out. From the one he didn't touch, the idiot fired his legs and retirons, but I think they'll save those old chestnuts for the next Dooley outing. Add girls to the Battle of Gender with tired old views and banal redundant materials like the Dooley Prize car that gets into the trash all the time, and you have a recipe for one really bad movie. Avoid it at all costs.
