I've given this exhibition (I watched only seven episodes) four stars because most of his jokes / devices seem to fail. Some are not funny, but some are amusing - a 12-year-old boy. He reminds me that a New York painter, who throws paint on canvas, calls it art and sells it for a lot of money. Silverman throws out what he's got, including a kitchen sink, while he prays that some things will stay on the wall to be funny but different. <br /> <br /> But what he has often received is not enough, as if he has no such follow-up that a good comedian must succeed. <br /> <br /> The whole company is like a potato made below.
