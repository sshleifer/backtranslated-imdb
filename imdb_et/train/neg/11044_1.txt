In Australia, it has been shown as a hydrosphere that this incredibly bad film is so bad that you are hypnotizing and you have to look at it to see if it can get worse ... and that is! The story is so predictable that it is written in high school drama class, the kits are pathetic but little better than miniature, and wood is exemplary. <br /> <br /> The baby beanie seems to have been stolen from the Total Recall props. There was no original idea in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I found this movie so bad that I laughed the most. <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell should shake his head. He probably needed money!
