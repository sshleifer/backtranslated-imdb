obviously he has some talents, Maria Bello is always great. but it is just a newspaper that depicts every character as someone who needs to be harnessed and exploited so that someone can bring out the "interesting" story of the film. I hope they got out of their systems. unfortunately, there is no understanding, sensitivity, context or humanity for the audience. all that would be good except that he has no humor, no horror, no context, no constructive say about the story he is trying to say. bad things happen, you sit and watch it, you don't care, so what? 99% of the time, the words "based on real story" constitute an unintended warning to the public. that is, the director and the screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some of the events they heard somewhere, so they just drop them on the screen and wait for the "real" nature of the story to make the audience feel something without the filmmakers having to do anything. I hope they had a great time to make this movie. it smells of ice.
