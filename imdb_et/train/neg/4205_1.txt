Alarmist has been so foolishly written that you have been thinking about why on earth this actor, like David Arquette, agreed. It has to be one of the weakest plots I've ever seen and without humor at all, it borders on the annoying edge. It draws a terrible conclusion that seems to be just because the director is getting bored and just wanted to go home for dinner. Stay away !.
