I love the episode where Jim gets Greenman. It's great! When Jim throws it through a small person's window, his face is priceless. Then when he starts to turn to the priest in the name of his wife to find out that he has become Pee-Woman? Great writing and great casting with excellent action must do so. I'm trying to find a photo of this picture. I would like to use it on my avatar board because I think Greenman is fun. Does anyone know where I can download a photo of Jim from Greenman? Does anyone point to me to find such a photo in the right direction?
