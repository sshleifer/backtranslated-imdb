You have to admit that this version shames Shakespeare! No one can act except the sister who was my favorite! Juliet had good earning skills, but she can't give her lines an emotional depth and we never get in touch with it. He is doing worse than he is thinking of drinking a sleeping drink. I would have poured it in my mouth to shut him up! Anthony Andrews ... yikes! Given his other great films (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), he is very shocking in this. And don't get me to Rome ... talk! It's still good to see if you've been hunting to see every Romeo and Juliet ever made a movie story. The Olivia and Leonard versions are still the best, followed by Leslie Howard's version and then the current Leo and Clare!
