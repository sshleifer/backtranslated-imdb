This movie is beautiful to look at, but it's like a very bad experimental theater. There is no point in the plot (if any). But it's very "artistic". Lots of shots of semi-dressed actors who are wrestling and looking for each other's eyes. Lots of artistic frames through windows and people in the frame. Mumbling and people get lost quietly. Close-ups of faces and bodies. By the time you reach the cat with a cat, you are ready to throw the bottle on the KY screen. <br /> <br /> It should be about a father-son relationship, but you just want two of them to just f * $ & get each other and get it over. If you have always wanted to see bad Russian gay porn without taking money, your wish is given.
