It was a 75-minute waste of my life. Action was terrible and the plot was ridiculous. It revolves around an evil lesbian who gets rich married men to have sex with her, and then sends them for money. One of the victims is a candidate for DA, which causes problems in her relationship with her husband. The other is a plastic surgeon, also married, and the evil lesbian also happens to attract this man's wife! In the meantime, she doesn't like an evil lesbian girlfriend to sleep around her. It ends with a happy ending where everything is forgiven. Women also get a lot of naked, mostly in situations that stretch the reality. bad bad bad.
