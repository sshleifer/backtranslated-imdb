It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. This is the (I think) story of a rebellious college basketball player, his harsh, fair coach, his girlfriend and fellow students (played by Michael Margotta), who has a constant nervous breakdown. The story goes somewhere, there is near zero development, no one cares, and performances, except for Bruce Dern as a coach, are terrible. It is hard to believe how Jack Nicholson, like a talent, could lead such a horrible movie. Be sure to avoid this turkey.
