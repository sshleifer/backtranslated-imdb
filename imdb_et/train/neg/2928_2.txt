I really would like to see this movie and waited months to get it through our Blockbuster Total Access account. When this mailbox appeared, I threw it directly to the DVD player. <br /> <br /> I was a very sad disappointment, which in turn made me crazy. I'll give any movie a chance, even if I want to leave the theater / press "stop". I looked at it all the time, but did not get anything but disappointment. <br /> <br /> The actor was very, very good, but it was. Nothing is explained; although we understand that Mathieu is becoming a depression and landing in some sort of psychic congregation, we never give our "fall". While we understand that he and Cedric are breaking, we don't see it again or WHY it happened. In an interview with a physician at Mathieu, Cedric showed that he had deceived him one by one, but it wasn't a big deal. I thought I could see it in a setback, but not - nothing. We also get tips that Cedric brings Mati to the hospital, but AGAIN, we don't see it. <br /> <br /> I know some movies are "take it because it is," but this movie has chosen me honestly. When Pierre, Cedric exhibits in the club and starts to struggle, we don't see him hide or hair before the end, and it took some time to explain that Pierre WAS is the former. His personality in the club and when Mat finds him is completely different. I might even say it was confusing. The film assumes you know everything and move with your divorced, inappropriate and confusing. I can keep up with movies like "Pi", "Citizen Kane" and other movies with setbacks / flash-to-left and right, but the CU didn't hit and hold style. At the end of citizen Kane you know what is going on and discover the answer to the main secrets. The CU just leaves you hanging. There's air cautious about "we don't tell you things, see it in front of you". It's like reading a book, where chapters are switched and pages are missing. <br /> <br /> Good performance, as I said. I liked the characters, but the whole story was just too disappointing.
