Weak plot, predictable violence, only semi-interesting characters. Like a writer (including one of the stars), he fixed his screws and added an incredible fantasy of drugs and murders to make it "hot". Predictable rap and house music, family conflicts, bad performance, stereotypical and ultimately boring. Even the title has been made earlier - IMDb lists the VISA movie with the same name released 2007-2008 !! <br /> <br /> Note: I saw it in Showtime, which lists a summary of another movie. It was halfway before I realized that no one was a secret police officer. Even the second stereotype would have been interesting if it happened.
