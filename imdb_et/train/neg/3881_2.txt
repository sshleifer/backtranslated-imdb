A few days ago I watched the documentary "ALL TIME FUEL WORKING MOVIES" and this is where I first heard MANUAL MOVEMENT. Being a Schlocky movie lover, I'll try to find some movies from documentaries - not just one of those that includes POSSIBLE COMPILATION. In fact, MELTING MAN is the first "bad movie" I've ever seen, and I have to say I'm quite disappointed. Although this is really a bad movie, it doesn't come close enough to be included in this list. <br /> <br /> Now, before you see the documentary, I've enjoyed the book "The Fifty Worst Movies All Time" by Harry Medved. Despite the same title, the book came a long time ago, long before the documentary and the documentary filmmakers did not transfer this concept to Medved. I've seen about 35 films out of 50 in Medved's book, but come to a dead end - the rest of the movies aren't available on VHS or DVD. So, I thought I'd try the same name for the movie. <br /> <br /> The reason I was most disappointed with ADMINISTRATION was that the film had some good elements. First, the special effects of the melting pot were generally very cool and disgusting. It is obvious that a professional (famous Rich Baker) was involved in making it realistic. But I must also note that there was more than a cheap and cheesy effect - like a floating plastic head and the way the monster ran around after his left hand was cut off - you saw it. wisely hidden "under his clothes! As for the story, it is just stupid. The Astronauts group penetrates the suckling rings of Saturn without breaking. - it shouldn't look at it - it should be a big bullet. Regardless of what the scene changes instantly and we are told that one of the surviving astronauts is in the hospital. What happened to the last scene? can reach the survivor and deal with the murderous rumble when his whole body melts. Finding and pausing him, right? wrong. General takes one single doctor to find him! No army, no police - just a nice doctor. Even after the body starts stacking ldine something to organize a meaningful search or get backups. <br /> <br /> Now that the stupidity of the movie is, you wouldn't be surprised if you find a guy running around the doctor's house, the doctor gives his wife a powerful sedative and leaves him in the house. <br /> <br /> When the cute old couple rides late in the evening, they will naturally stop at the orchard to pick the fruits and kill them. When a woman sees a melting guy, she barricades the door to protect herself. It would be wise if he didn't have a house next to the back door! Instead of just leaving the house and fleeing, he's just waiting! <br /> <br /> When a photographer and his model take snapshots, the guy grabs his assistant and pulls his top end. Why? Well, to give the audience a cheap thrill and make it a rated R-leg. <br /> <br /> When the melting guy is finally in place and the sheriff has a clear look at him, the doctor will stop him - even if the monster had killed about half a dozen people. <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, the film has foolish plot elements. This is a very bad movie. But given the sometimes good special effects, it was not just a creepy film as I had hoped. Of course, this is a good laugh, but not where the PLAN 9 OUTER SPACE is bad and should never have been one of the worst movie listings.
