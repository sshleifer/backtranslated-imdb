After watching a lot of "Next Action Star" reality TVs, capturing TiVo for me with this gawd fear. For some strange reason - and I only have a fault - I looked at the whole thing, hoping that * everything * was unique in the film. After so much hype about Joel Silver's "Midas Touch" when he starts to act, he can be sure he's beating his alchemy. <br /> <br /> Firstly, Billy Zane was the only redemption value of the whole movie, and even he couldn't lift the slipshode out of the crapper. Having said this, Zane's performance stays about two-thirds on the road, because she doesn't even know what else to do except without seeing. <br /> <br /> You can't blame her here. Frankly, they were sucked in writing. Let's take the ideas of "Rat Race", "Enemy of the State", "Terminator", "Midnight Run" and all the bad gambling movies you can think of and just play. And who is the perfect idea to have two running sequences in ROW? <br /> <br /> Sean Carrigan, "The Next Action Star" for "hourly", shows all strengths and weaknesses directors mention throughout the series. With one comment, Johnny, Sean plays the amazing beautiful jock very well, but fights with the weight of the film. Frankly, we never seem to care about whether he lives or dies around the middle, because Carrigan cannot justify him to the audience alike. His silly, but happy routine is getting old, because in reality there is nothing to root. <br /> <br /> But Carrigan is a dream compared to the wooden rigid Corinne Van Ryck de Groot. Did Howard Fine really tell him you're pretending to be the Terminator of the first half of the movie? I do not belive. I was waiting for him to quote Arnie. His "performance" character can only be compared to the dramatic depths of "Freddy Got Fingered", though not nearly as well developed. The camera loves her in a dark, shady limousine, but in harsh daylight she sucks all the energy out of the screen. Jeanne Bauer showed her natural life in her five-minute section when Corinne showed her in any part of the screen. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Sean has a tough look to give the ensemble a good leader, but it shouldn't have been one solo. It was just a task for him. Jared Elliot, a "next action star" colleague, may have a somewhat more dynamic character, but it is hard to tell Jeff Welch's flat script. Someone should take Welch iMac away before he or someone else hurts. And finally, Van Ryck de Groot was just gone and got out, even if it was complete. <br /> <br /> Joel Silver should be ashamed.
