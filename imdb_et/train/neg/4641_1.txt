Sometimes I really enjoy bad movies .... those that occasionally occur when people (even talented people) get together with good intentions to make a movie and for any reason it turns out to be a disaster. Movies like "Killer Tomato Attack", "Plan 9 from Space", "Manos Hands from Fate" and "Heavenly Gates", etc. So when I heard that this movie "Rachel's attic" was one of the worst films of the decade for many people, of course I just saw it. <br /> <br /> Boy, do I regret this decision. This movie is out of the bad .... it's so bad that it's not as enjoyable as a normal bad movie. Exhibition, filming, script, etc. is even worse than low-budget porn film: sound is absolutely terrible, "plot" is completely incomprehensible, "acting" is ridiculous ... it's all a waste of time and money. At least a porn movie has a porn for breaking monotony, while this ridiculous nightmare is a boy who squeezes a rotten apple and a "mad hat" tea party. <br /> <br /> Lighting is nothing. Some "scenes" occur in half or full darkness, which is probably just as good. "Writer-director" (I use the terms loosely), David Tybor, is kinky trying with slavery scenes ... but the results would be ridiculous if they were not so pathetic. There is nudity, but it is so bad quality that it actually acts as a sexual suppressant. I could continue forever and not justify all the shortcomings and shortcomings of this truly horrible film residue. <br /> <br /> Avoid this train wreck for God's love. I know that, despite (or maybe) my negative comments, you may still be tempted to see if this trash is really bad when I say it is .... but trust me in this .... it's even worse than i have said, and you will regret the absolute, positive experience (and cost if you waste your money on buying or renting).
