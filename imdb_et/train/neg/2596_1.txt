Dear God! I was expecting this movie to "start" ... then I was expecting it to be redeemed ... and if he didn't, I just sat down, stupidly: 1) it could be so bad and 2) I I was just a few hours wasted just in stupidity. I believed Drew could not do that bad about the movie ... and boy, did I ever lose my faith! Don't worry about it! Drew tried, but the film was poorly written, badly behaved and just poorly prepared! I can't believe the script, what this bad thing ever funded! It was a million chance to do something (the word "concept" is too big for this movie to even qualify!) And STILL never went! Its just pathetic! If another reviewer got the idea that it wasn't the worst, I was bothered! Because, if it were worse, I would have gotten my wrists before my finish!
