Despite the fact that crazy people are there and there are religious nuts. <br /> <br /> Characters don't usually make any sense anymore. <br /> <br /> The film does not have a real start, neither in the middle nor in the End, nor has anything ever been explained. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a young man with an unlikely name Hazel Motes, which will probably return to the military. <br /> <br /> He grabs a ride in a two-storey house that has extreme deviations. He goes home, walks and finally writes that he is leaving. This scene is nothing, and we are no longer learning about the house or its history. <br /> <br /> It has never been explained exactly which house it is or where people are gone, but we are given the impression Hazel probably lived there at once. <br /> <br /> Hazel decides to go to town. Why - we don't know. When he arrives in this city, he writes the name and address he sees on the bathroom wall and visits the woman who is a surprisingly fat whore. He sees him for awhile and then apparently he doesn't see him anymore. Like everything else in this movie, it does not come with any purpose. <br /> <br /> A young man, named Enoch, is trying to make friends with him, but Hazel doesn't really care, even though they keep crossing the border. br /> <br /> Enoch is about as crazy as you can. One of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the Chimps are and talk to them insultingly. <br /> <br /> We never know why Enoch is acting like he does, or why Hazel behaves when he does, Hazel has an old time through the old parents of a terrifying, fundamentalist religion overdone. <br /> <br /> Later, Enoch began to amaze a man dressed in gorilla suit and able to get a gorilla dress from him and then run around. <br /> <br /> Hazel, who is wounded quite tightly and seems to be in constant rage, makes a little street preaching. I had the impression that he was trying to get rid of the inaccuracies of the faith he drilled in him. <br /> <br /> He has several meetings with the preacher and his daughter, although their relationship will never make any specific point, and there is no plot line. <br /> <br /> Finally Hazel completes the religious passion and starts hurting himself. <br /> <br /> This is a very strange film. Interestingly, it is strange, but not that he does nothing. <br /> <br /> Casting is a great job, but this film can't deliver both perspective and story. <Br /> <br /> Occasionally, the film also has characters that surround the N-word, which are not related to the rest of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
