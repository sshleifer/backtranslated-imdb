I love Geisha's memories so I read the book twice; this is one of the best books I read last year. I was waiting for the movie and was afraid that reading the book would jeopardize the joy of watching the movie. I didn't expect the film to be so bad. Some of the best parts of the book were left out of the movie and characters were worse than Hatsumom (Li Gong). If I haven't read a book, this film would be a little confusing and inexplicable. The film's graph describes: "Nitta Sayuri shows how she caught her fishing ..." Did anyone see how or when Sayuri became Nitta Sayur? Forget about the movie and read the book.
