We saw it on a shelf in a local video store, we saw "Coppolat" and excited in credits. It was the only time this film attracted interest. I could never work out well when it was an experiment with a humorous film that failed, or an attempt to make a serious film. Overall, the whole production seemed incredibly incredible. Especially this sound was absolutely terrible, especially in scenes shot in a small bar; the dialogue was so partial that it was incredible. Very disappointing.
