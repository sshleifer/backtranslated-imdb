I started watching this movie with great expectations. But after one hour I gave up this movie because it put me in a lot of unanswered questions. It started already in the opening order and continued to deepen. <br /> <br /> Why are they burying the Dutch figure? Why is there an Italian comedian? Why did Dutcher Hollander get away? Why didn't she save her when she was saved, instead of her life, to love a farmer's wife? Why didn't the farmers save Hollander at a time when the farmer wouldn't be? Why do these probably illiterate farmers understand Italian? Why did Italian comedian know about Dutch gold? Why did he hide it on the floor of the evil farmers' property? These and many other questions have arisen and none of them seemed to be answered in an acceptable manner. So I think I've got the point of this movie completely lost and I don't connect the story in any way.
