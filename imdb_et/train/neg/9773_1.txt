When it appeared, I thought it was one of the ever made prophetic films. However, thanks to Martin Scorcese and some other similar filmmaker, the worst films have been worse for language use, but it's a pretty brutal attack on the ears. Hey, I can take it a lot, but it got ridiculous. In the very first few minutes alone, I heard about a dozen uses of the word "f" in vain and unspoken. I don't know how many people walked out of the theater, looking at it in 1990? I would not have been the only one. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, some functional actors were Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Lake Rikki. From this film, it seems that Stephen Lang has improved his image, at least playing the "divine" Stonewall in the gods and generals. The role of Lang here is just the opposite: perhaps the worst trashy man in the movie and the film that falls in love with the transvestite at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Disgusting, gloomy, half-pornographic, repulsive: these are just some of the adjectives used - even by some liberal critics - to describe the story that is even worse in the novel. Of course, some of the best-known critics of the film, all the extreme Libid, praised. But they were the only ones. Most critics were outraged, as well as almost all paying public. It's incredible that someone could praise slag and garbage like that. <br /> <br /> Trust me: there are no good and pleasant characters in this movie. This is the average, sick movie: one of the worst of the "modern era". This means that if you do not see child abuse, drug abuse, teenage prostitutes, there are - and twice a day - not just atrocities, but just evil people. No thank you.
