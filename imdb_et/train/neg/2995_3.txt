In very rare cases, the episode of x-files does not create any excitement, or does the episode contain something that is simply boring to look at. The detective and his former partner both die in inexplicable circumstances. the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths occurred.Mulder has developed a theory that a policeman was murdered by his colleagues has come back reincarnated like a little girl and is demanding revenge.Now for a bit a bit.Long girl has no connection at all and looks just random person selected reincarnation.I think it was a bit lazy writing writers and this episode is one of the worst x-files in history!
