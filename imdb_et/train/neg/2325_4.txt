the first scanners may not be a great movie, but at least it was original. It is not such a novelty. This action is, in my opinion, worse, and this story is slower and something special. such as dialogue.and special effects are not better than the original. This is a film that is worse than any other way. The only thing different from this is that from time to time it is picky and chaotic. Don't make a good movie. if they had done something better and made it interesting, it could have been a decent film. I couldn't get it all without fast forwarding. movie, and not much more. despite the fact that there are many worse films. A generous mood, I give scanners 2 a 4/10.
