I do not believe in the praise of this film. The game and movie were Sleuthi ripoff. Michael Caine wants him to be Olivier and Reeves wants him to be Caine. Cain even had a nerve to do Sleut's remake with Jude Law, who played his original part. Jewish Law? You mean what made "Alfie" transformation? <br /> <br /> This film was made during Caine's career, when it was obvious that she had to pay off gambling debts. He did something for money. He celebrated such award-winning films as this and "Beyond the Poseidon Adventure". What seems to be the praise of this film is the death of Reev. He deserves to be remembered better than this mindless movie. And that's what Caine does. You can find this movie in the Walmart $ 5.97 trash. With gems like "the island" and "blame it for Rio".
