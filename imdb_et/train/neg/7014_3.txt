What waste! This movie might have been really decent, but above all the writing is nonsense and the main characters are rather low and uninteresting. Mike Meyers was good and the historic holiday of the late 70s was well designed, but in general it was a waste of time. Instead, there is a film about similar topics and the same basic time frame, BOOGIE NIGHTS.
