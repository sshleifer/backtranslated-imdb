It is a classic stinker with a big name, mostly among pensioners who were in this main and bedtime. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty frustrating movie when you think about it. Stay on earth and you will see the disease and eventually your death. Gwen Verndon showed he could still dance. It is too bad that the film didn't focus on it anymore. Maureen Stapleton, looking at haggard, still showed these steps from "Star Dust Ballroom Queen", so much more than a decade ago. <br /> <br /> I only hope this movie will not encourage seniors to commit mass suicide at Jim Jones. How can anyone be idiot enough to like it and say it thinks to you? <br /> <br /> Why did Don Ameche win Ossar for this mess? <br /> <br /> When seniors do this at the end of the day, is it a good reason why the young person was invited out of the boat? Why did Steve Guttenberg jump on the ship? After all, she had found her lady-love. <br /> <br /> It would have been a nice movie if seniors had just managed to find their young fountain on the ground and stay there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, with the exception of Wilford Brimley, Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn, and the Lord who are all gone, know this writing. Writers should have taken the scenario and put it into this group.
