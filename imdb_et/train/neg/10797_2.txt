Shaq played the gene, his name was Kazaam, and he was lazy. this film sucks Prolly did not make 20 bucks that he lives in a boombox, not a painful lamp like a cramp like a wet food temple. it is a silly movie with terrible special effects. Oh, and its confusion like hell. I'm not even going. Let's just say it belongs to the category "so bad, funny". Look at it once with your friends and have a good laugh. But don't expect anything remarkable.
