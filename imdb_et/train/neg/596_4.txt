Basically, here we have more than the amazing 1970s classic kitsch horror "Death Line", which was ironically like that of the goblins, as well as filmed at the unused Aldwych subway station. <br /> <br /> Take good advantage of the unused Jubilee platform from Charing Cross and the above-mentioned Aldwych, this movie basically contains the same plot - angry murderous mad zombie in tunnels that serve lost passengers who have forgotten the last train - originality no not to be a movie strong indeed, strong points are unfortunately incomplete. Gore extends unnecessarily from the poor over the gory, while the sub-Gollum nutter has never really been fully explained as it seems little more than an advanced plot device. <br /> <br /> Franke Polente has little to do with a thin script to run down many tunnels and scream as often as she did, indeed she was on the movie almost everyone else, in a small dog and taming rat pack. <br /> <br /> The creepy movies on the London Underground are your bag, or you just want to play "on-the-spot tube location" when they choose it on a DVD when it hits the trash. If you are looking for a classic horror, go and make a copy of Death Line (aka Raw Meat). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a high-quality, well-written and acted movie, you need to exchange trains .....
