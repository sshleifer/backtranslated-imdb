Jean Claude Van Damme is trying to save his career by doing a universal soldier step. But did this film save him? I think he's going to hell after death. <br /> <br /> In the first minute we see the interior of the object, which shows a bad boy. Scary, huh? But not as scary as the actor (details are as follows). <br /> <br /> Then we'll see Van Damme with a black girl (don't forget the name ... well, it's not important anyway) trying to escape some muscle man. Of course they are new universal soldiers. More muscles, less brain (like film). After a while Van Damme is fighting with Goldberg, but then "breaks". It was just a test (is this a test of our nerves?). It turns out that Van Damme is working in the government on a new Universal Soldier project (who has seen the first film, it may be the most obscure thing Van Dammes might do). But that's the sequel. And the "story" comes out. Ah, I forgot. She has a daughter. Very important for "story". <br /> <br /> Well, in about 20 minutes, the supercomputer will hear a conversation about closing it and completing the project. Of course, the cube gets angry and activates all the soldiers to kill everyone. Van Damme escapes from the facility, but the computer sends him some soldiers (he wants Van Damme as a soldier - because he is the best (actually?)). And don't guess what, Goldberg is one of the hunters who always had a stupid sentence for the audience before he gets asskicked. Funny? Yes, like the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> After a "story", Van Damme is trying to save his daughter (his wife's first movie reporter). The final show, where Van Damme is fighting with Bad Guy and you can see the most expensive scene in the film (see for yourself. It's just funny to say). <br /> <br /> You see that this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> So don't look at it. But if you do, hold a six-pack!
