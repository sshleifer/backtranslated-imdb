One of those "age-class" films that should have nostalgia for adults and promise to children. This movie does not. It is a bad excuse that Sylvia Kristel's body will double with dorky Eric Brown. Even worse, the film is stupid or stupid when it tries to be funny, sexy or dramatic. Laugh uncomfortably, because we should believe that the teenager alone is dead to the burial of her wife in her front building. Think vigorously why Emmanuelle's famous woman needs a double body. Continuing the film, I began to imagine a private and Little Miss Millions hybrid with Sylvia Kristel, who seduced Jennifer Love Hewitt because Howard Hesseman puts us in a nostalgic WKRP. See it laugh at other people's stupidity or Ed Begley Jr. Dedicated to the performance or contemplation that Sylvia Kristel Jennifer Love Hewitt would see. But I can give you my lesson, away from movies that look at Sylvia Kristel, who is not Emmanuelle.
