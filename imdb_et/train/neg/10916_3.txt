For domestic audiences, I see how they praised this movie. For foreigners who did not have the interests they had, it wasn't much sense. The Germans were portrayed as incompetent and Russian heroes. The allegedly romantic angle was superfluous and disturbing. How was a young woman's love of a lord to "love" just meaningless. How could he, as mentioned at the end of the film, ever marry just because of this demonstration that was next to me. I mentioned that the Germans were portrayed as idiots and this was again shown by the march. Several hundred German troops moved forward, pushing the Russians into the swamps. So the Russians were hiding and the Germans stood by the swamps and were just listening. I think they didn't want their boots to be noticed, but I'm sure the officer would have ordered 20 or 30 men on the water to look for swamps. But it would have finished the story. The Germans also entered the barn where the Russians hid in the attic and didn't bother to fire on the roof. In the worst case scenario, one soldier would have leaned into the attic and didn't climb the ladder. <br /> <br /> I saw some reviewers who said they shouted at the end. Interesting why? You knew that this little band would be killed and they were not in the heart.
