I write this because I felt I had to believe that Dark Remains was a good movie. Although this is not the worst thing I've seen, it's definitely not good. <br /> <br /> Weak scenario, weak participants and weak leadership. Even if they can't name a big name, would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actor? It was painful to watch an ordinary actor through the film with his boredom. The story was a clich√© and badly written. Special effects were minimal. Repeatedly used "temporary" tricks were difficult to swallow. <br /> <br /> To be honest, Dark Remains is no worse than quite a few horrors of horror episodes. But not quite par with high quality movies. Dark Remains is only recommended for hardcore horror fans who do not want to leave a movie in the genre, even if it is badly done. Like anyone else, time should be spent on something that should be extremely simple.
