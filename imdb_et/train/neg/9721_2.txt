Who can understand these two unpleasant protagonists? What is meant to be a mild, frothy comedy about neighbors who are unable to give up their childhood when they get older well into adultery, rather come to practice cruelty and gentle expression. As a child, the couple is unbearably premature; as adults, they are unacceptably immature. This is a bad combination.
