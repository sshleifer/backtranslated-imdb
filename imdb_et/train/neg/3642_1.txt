Unfortunately, the film is more related to making social comments on the actual event, but there are no balls that rightly document what happened. The obvious message is the constant rhetoric of how violent video games do not blame (I have the impression that Ben Coccio is an avid gamer), or how the media and music are completely without influence. burning ALL of their CDs, talking about fineness!), but the movie gets only because of its "fiction". Good test. Yes, it is a great idea to influence the media, but how do we know the children who have actually planned and conducted the media-influenced school education? or video games? We dont, and we wont this movie, because again these kids are smart enough to completely abandon the media but stupid enough to burn the Nazi symbol on the spot? haha i somehow don't believe so. the dynamics of the children who have actually gone out and photographed their fellow students. Why do all who are both murderers seem "normal" if they are not so? Totally wrong and fake imagination.
