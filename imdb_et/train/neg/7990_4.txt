"Anita and Me" is a drama about multi-ethnic UK growth, rather than "Bend it Like Beckham", or more about "East on East" with which he shares the 1970s settings. The tone is decisively passionate (despite the black accents), but the film lacks â€œEastern is the vitality of the East and the result seems rather thin and subtle. Moreover, the portrayal of the film's relationship between an Asian girl and her white friend is not deep enough to justify the film's restructuring. I've also grown from tired movies where heroes are writers, of course, often something real writers have experienced, but barely a fresh element of the fancy story. "East is East" was fun and sharp; Anita and I seem obvious and bored compared.
