Steve Martin should stop the classic comedy remakes. He's absolutely not suitable for this part. Like the out of towners' frightening remake, this film falls on the face. How did anyone think that Steve Martin could even stay close to Jack Lemmon's excellent performance, and that also applies to this movie. Dan Ackroyd could have played a better part of Bilko. Martin is great when he makes his original signs, but he doesn't try to regenerate other people's classical work unhappily. This is a sad statement when the more fun part of the movie is on the first line of the movie when the movie is over. The line "Manufacturers, thanks to the lack of full cooperation from the US Army" was almost the only line that actually made me laugh. If you want to see a real Bilko, keep the original episodes of Phil Silver's show. They are guaranteed to laugh, unlike the mistake that should never have happened. I put this movie in the same category as the Lemmon classic mentioned above and the remake of Psycho. None of them would ever have happened.
