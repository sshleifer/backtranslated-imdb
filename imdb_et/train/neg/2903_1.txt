Heldeke. This movie could have been titled "When Writers Go Strike!" What a stink. I really had great hopes for this, mainly after reading the IMDb reviews, which makes me think about the whole IMDb rating system, but that's a separate question. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, Office, etc., so I was expecting great things. To say that I was disappointed is an underestimation of the year. There are so many things about this movie, but I will confine myself to (a) any family insecurity that behaves like these people do (aerobics workout? What planet is that real life?), A tricky script (a murderer of love? Please), and the fact that the character of Dan is so unlikely to find you wondering what the girl saw to fall in love with her? This film was full of foolish dialogue, a varied direction, ridiculous set scenes and it was slow, slow, slow. We'd be gone half an hour if we weren't with our parents who didn't get much out and wouldn't want to waste money. Unlike the filmmakers who would have spent all the money that would have been better to make this movie campfire, it would have been more interesting. If you like movies, beware of the plague.
