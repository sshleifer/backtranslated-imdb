1st Review 11/7/2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-John Bianco): A pretty flat gangster movie from a godfather-like family in Brooklyn who wants to say a lot of four-word words and kill people. The only thing that interests me here was their attempt to show that the Feds have a lot like a gang. This is the only good film making attempt. The rest of the film was predictable and inexpensive. The quality of photography in some scenes within the scene almost changed the probability that your DVD player is experiencing problems due to poor contrasts, and some actors were sometimes difficult to hear due to poor sound. The action was pretty much a symbol of all of your favorite gangsters, such as Vinnie `Knuckles' and Jimmie`s Tattoos, and the plot also followed these patterns. So, look, look at the better gangster movie before you put it out.
