1 review 27/2/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Harold Young): 3. The Universal Moomin is about the same as the first two, from the viewer's perspective to the end. The story is similar and the results are ho-hum. This time the story is in the United States, because the new priest of the Egyptian priest sends a mummy to our country in the hope that he will be able to restore the killing of the discoverers of his graves. This time, the mummy plays Lon Chaney (which does not make a big difference because he hasn't really asked for much action on this character). The new priest will become a morgue in the city and send out the mummy to do his dirty deeds after giving her juice of leaf juice. Again, the girl is on the road when the priest falls to one of the descendants' husbands and wants her, yes --- be immortal with her (have we heard it before?). Of course, the plan is hampered when the citizens of the city burn woods (like the Frankenstein monster) and burning the creature stops the story ... how do they get a sequel? I think you get the next series? or not .....
