Frank Tashlin 'The Home Front' is one of Snafu's most private short shorts. Instead of taking some unwanted activities that would lead to a disaster, Snafu focuses on the home country of its loved ones and how much they have to offer for warfare. Snafu realizes that she was wrong when she thought it was easy for them. This is a concept that has few chances for good gags and instead plays Tashlin's stronger card, extending the fun associated with removers and little stained dance girls instead of much more effective comic. The result is a short, meaningful meaning with little importance or entertainment value today as a historical artifact.
