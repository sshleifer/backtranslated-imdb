This transformation of Tim Burton from the original "Apeside Planet" of 1968 (and starring Charleton Heston) is far from the quality and plot of the original. <br /> <br /> Certainly the special effects have definitely improved in 1968, but not in writing. The characters were boring and the dialogue was terrible. I was sitting in the movie with a friend (who luckily leased it only) and fully understood why all Target toys on the "Apeside Planet" were clear before Christmas. <br /> <br /> My advice to Tim Burton: Don't put it on your CV. <br /> <br /> My advice to everyone: Watch the 1968 Apeside Planet.
