Birthday girl doesn't know what she wants to be - is it a comedy, is it a drama ... it just doesn't know. What could have been a very funny or touching movie will reach someone's land. The assumption is original enough to provide a script full of interesting scenarios, but hardly able to do and end. This is a real shame when you look at the lie - it's very sure all the time, but they can't shine. Very disappointing.
