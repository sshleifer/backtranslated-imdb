This is a bad movie with any standard. Match Point had a story about some intrigue and some interest (Woody Allen mixed his culture with the classical English murder culture and explored what it can do). <br /> <br /> Scoop, however, has nothing like this. It's badly written, both drivers are hopelessly woody, and the story doesn't matter. The genre that it speaks requires at least a subspace with spiritual explanations and ties (why are tarot cards and keys kept in locked French horns?). <br /> <br /> Allen's cheerful and spiritual versions of various Hollywood genres (Jade Scorpion / Cairo purple rose curse, etc.) have given us so much joy over the years. Even when Hollywood was finished, it was a great central idea. Unfortunately, his inspiration has reduced him this time.
