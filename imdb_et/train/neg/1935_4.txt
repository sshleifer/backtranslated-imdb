Chinese Ghost Story III is a completely superfluous order for two great fantasy films. The film produces special spelling effects that can be expected but painful on all other fronts. All actors play very stupid cartoons. You have to have diapers to find your sense of humor even remotely. The plot is predictable and development is sometimes uneven and often slow. After all, the film begins to resemble the old Godzilla films, including the more lively larger life with different effects and (well, one more) Godzilla's head. Maybe I would have smiled when I waited for the camps. <br /> <br /> It is amazing to see which garbage fantasy fans have to cope with it - in this case, because somebody thought they could put some more money out. successful formula. They can't do it again: the cash cow is now dead like a dodo.
