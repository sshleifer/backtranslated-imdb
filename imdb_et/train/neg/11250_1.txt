I like the time, I like this experiment, but watching a movie that looks like I'm looking at it through the bottle of coke gives me a headache. When I played computer games that were such blurry and focused, I would upgrade my computer. It may be the appearance that the director was after, but not that it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes. If I didn't take anyone with this movie, I was out there. Even if it was a series and not a movie, the Brothers band did it. They made it look like a film of World War II, but a bit of sharpness, but it was still a pleasure to watch. Movies need real people with real sets and real locations; Use CGI if appropriate, not for the whole movie.
