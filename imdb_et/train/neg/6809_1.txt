One of Stinko's film, where there is a shop-shaped plot and to be kind, acting less than the Oscal caliber. But for me, one of the worst mistakes was the total misleading of the aircraft and especially the 747. Some major bugs: <br /> <br /> 1. No Engineer (or even Aviation Engineer. 2. False 16 F-16 Detection as F-15 (no Resmblance). "a tailgate" which is said to be accessible from the cab - even if such a chamber existed, placing its large weight so that the far rear would render the aircraft ineffective. SR-71 (on all airplanes) with a pressure-tight hatch 7. Opening the door to the outside - to the wind - on the flight !!
