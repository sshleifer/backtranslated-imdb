The African jungle is a man-monkey muscle muscled by an opportunistic expedition team; The team leader's nice daughter finds her first. Tarzan's story has a lot of boonhooed version with OK production, but it has been spoiled for the worst direction ever seen in the movie. John Derek has stayed beyond inspiration as cheesy slow motion shots and the look of the woman's Bo Derek's unclean body; he has about the same amount of talent behind the camera as Ed Wood. Touching sexy language, Dereks lacks fineness, spooky timing and taste. They have a sense of self-deception and abandonment of bravura (they keep the wind cautiously), but after promising opening, everything goes to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (who may have been in the marble all the time) has the title role but plays third violin with John Derek's ego and Bo Derek's sense of self-esteem. * from ****
