This film is a good example of the extreme shortage of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people were paid for doing this shows that there are original ideas and talents in entertainment. The idea that viewers are paid to see this film (and like the idiot I rented the film) is also frustrating. <br /> <br /> Obsessed teacher (3 years ago) kills teenage family because he wants him. For some reason, he kills his mother, father and brother. After the first five minutes you will see bad behavior and direction. Years later, the teacher cut off the prison. HMM - Normal Bad Writing - Someone he terrorized doesn't know until the last minute. Obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a naval SEAL and can sneak around, sniff people and a knife is a super killer. Of course !!! By now, the obsessed teacher has killed the hotel lady for no reason, the bellhopi dives it for fun and starts hunting for teenage friends. Now is the perfect way for a girl to love you. Obsessed teacher sneaks to the hotel --- again it is stupid, never a cop would know his face - but he walks directly by them. Now he kills two jails from a teenage house and somehow hits his bedroom and kills his boyfriend. <br /> <br /> There is no positive thing about this garbage. If any other profession puts this low quality job out, they are fired. But these idiots make hundreds of thousands of dollars to write and direct this trash.
