I rented this movie to see Amber Benson, though after reading the box I thought it sounded like a good story ..... but the first problem was that there was really no story ... or actually there was a story but it didn't give any point. Another problem was that these characters were not created ... yes, I got that they all went to school, but during the first 3 minutes of the movie they didn't understand anything and didn't like each other so why they came together. Error # 3 ... the director paused for a long time and the close camera shots equalized (especially for typical temporary music that was dubbed) ... he was wrong. It was painful to look at the terrible actor, as Amber Benson wastes time trying to get it back .... my only hope is that the money he made here was put into his movie production.
