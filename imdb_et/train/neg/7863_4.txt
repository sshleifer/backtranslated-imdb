THHE2 is entertaining in that you laugh a lot and shine and probably say "oh sh * t!" and "get your face away from the horrible hole you fool **" or things that are by their lines, but I don't know if it's really worth it - I was very annoyed with all the terrible military characters who don't seem to be there, there there was more violence, gore and higher body than the first, but I'm still wondering if it will cancel my sense of the whole movie as ridiculous it is (and not good ridicule like Dead Alive or Feast). My time would have been five times better for Aja's remake. <br /> <br /> So go laugh, or go to some gore, but don't expect it to come out.
