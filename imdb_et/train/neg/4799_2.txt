I myself am a big fan of the 80's horror films with a small budget. It's not the worst, but still not remarkable. The plot line is decent but moves too long. You're through half the movie before you see any zombie action. The killings are not very creative and zombies are not too insidious. I really think this film would have been better when they left the zombies and just turned it into a mafia flick. It's traceable, but I feel that this movie stole at least one hour of my life. I'm giving a movie credit for being a little original. If you really are in B-horror movies, you should watch, but if you don't, don't worry. But you don't have to take my word for that.
