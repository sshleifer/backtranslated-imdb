Walerian Borowczyks La Bete (1975) was obviously in different ways: Some were terrified, some were shocked and encouraged by courage. However, I am completely inviolable, bored and unable to ask myself why contradictory, contradictory images surrounding the central issue are surrounded by vague, intellectual paths. <br /> <br /> What was this movie really like? Growing sexuality in a woman? I've seen great movies on this, but that's not one of them. How can you try to portray a growing sexuality girlfriend, trying not to characterize her not only as a narrative to dream of (naked) wild animals. If there are no symbols, there is no character research. The woman persecuted by the beast was not a young man, a girl who had sex with a black polisher (is it also a beast?) Has grown very much with regard to sexuality, so where is continuity? Is this a film about religion? If so, you would need a little more thematic material than a priest with no function, character and charisma, but with a strong desire for two young boys. <br /> <br /> Is this the best? The metaphorical feeling of the film prohibits the study of any reality, especially since realistic research requires realistic signs. So there is no real creativity here. Some mythical beasts and two priests who talk to one another about the truth of goodness. Is it enough for a college essay on the subject? I do not believe it. <br /> <br /> Is this about sex? Is this something? I do not know. I only know that showing a fired weapon does not make the film a war movie. Addressing a topic should mean more than showing its own links to the topic. <br /> <br /> So look over the contradiction. Don't be afraid of goodness, nudity, ejaculation, masturbation and things. I am not. Look at it when you look at some other story and you may find that it is badly done, poorly edited, poorly acted, really badly written (okay, some pictures are pretty nice and the main character is a really beautiful girl) head brain masturbation who thinks the hypnotic slowly beating around the bush makes the story smart. This is not. It makes it boring.
