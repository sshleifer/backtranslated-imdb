SPOILERS HEREIN <br /> <br /> My high school made every effort to try us for exams. But the most memorable method they used to get us into the right position was the guest speaker, who was nothing other than Australian Kickboxing's favorite son, Stan, "Man" in Longinid. The first mistake they made was giving this guy a microphone because he cried for half a time, despite the fact that we were sitting at him no more than 3 and 4 meters away. Now his speech was full of ordinary "if you are unable to prepare, then prepare for failure", but there were several cases where I really worked. The boy stood in front of us, proclaiming how he had done everything for his life and not for anyone else. Previously, he was offered many offers to quit kick-box, but he never took an eye on Australia's biggest kick-boxer award. He said he was not selling, he was happy and retired, he had never participated in anything other than Kickboxing? then he combined his movie. Yes, you heard right, he put his new movie. When he talked about it, he got the woman who came in and kept it on the poster, and then he showed this funny 4-minute clip under the movie "Trojan Warrior". (It's all before Gurkan Ozkan won his final career in the fight (now)). Melbourne. The Ajax cousin, Theo (Arthur Angel), recently sold out (well, at least Stan was not too far from any) federals, and as a result, all organized crime views. Ajax and Theo get into all kinds of ridiculous situations, from fighting to Kebab shop to bleaching the slave party. It's all pretty ridiculous, but if Silverstein really wants to make a reliable movie here, this guy should never be transferred to the camera. I admit that I actually pumped it to see it. I love action films, even when they are dirty, and especially when it's in my own backyard. But what I introduced was the film that was what was terrifying about the word "go", and it continued after the words "for God's love, please make it stop!" Again, after they were open, the characters were marked for some reason and the most choreographic fighting scenes that didn't even reflect Stan's true talent in Kickbox. In the cast, there were useless camouflage images of almost everyone who was far from famous (Dermot Brereton, Mark "Chopper" and Greg Matthews). All the time you sit there and just play in the background. Too bad a film relies heavily on the division of former celebrities. Do you remember those plot holes I talked about? Ajax had repeatedly been locked, accused of murdering his wife. Now we hear that Ajax was ONE ONE sentence with WHOLE in special powers and then left the buggery. This is followed by another SINGLE sentence that convinces Ajax to help the same people who locked him wrong. Then I finally get to Ajax that her husband is not really dead, but sold to prostitution. Do we see him? No. Is Ajax going to find her as soon as she hears it? Now, it's a marriage! <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this annoyingly creepy mess, some websites described this movie as "Jackie Chan & Guy Ritchie ??" cross. Has this guy ever sat and looked at Jackie Chani's movie? Chan shows more skill than the garbage when Stan did? And Guy Ritchie is a criminal film of the Messiah, and you compare her to Salik Silverstein! This movie is more like "Pizza" and "Enter The Ninja". <br /> <br /> Now, where do you get the title of the whole Trojan warrior? Ajax's fierce fighting skills like an ancient Greek warrior? Connecting the gangsters to find Theo, like the Trojan Empire? That's because? wait for it ?? Theo wears a condom with him. Yeah, that's right, because he's always made a Trojan BRAND RUBBER in his pocket, he's a Trojan WARRIOR! <br /> <br /> I was dissatisfied with the "Trojan Warrior" on DVD, as well as the "special" feature: <br /> <br /> "Chop Chop" video game, Mark "Chopper" rap story Read: Chopper did it just to prove that everyone can shake. The funny thing was Chopper for just 30 seconds and then threw it on two albino teenagers Doncaster using his words "dis" and "dope" and so on. Faced with people, rap was developed in the countries, LEAVE IT! The clip looked like something that is on the channel's 31 camera ecstasy. <br /> <br /> ?? Refugees: There was no real difference between them and the actual movie. <br /> <br /> ?? Stan "Man" Longinidis Kickboxing Featurette: It wasn't too bad considering that it was just 6 or 7 different battles that were shown from different perspectives (I think I saw Dennis Alexio fall about 15 times during this 3-minute assembly). /> <br /> I do not want to say that this film helps the country go to hell when it comes to film, but ... wait, wait, I just did. My advice to anyone reading this is to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of "Trojan Warrior", record them and use it for pulp, because this movie is just that bad bad.
