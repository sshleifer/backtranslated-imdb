Abysmal with capital "A". It must be one, if not, of the most dishonest TV shows right now. I'm like an anti-shrub when it gets, but this show won't even get me off. What you think of Bush as president is absolutely nothing to do with whether you like to show this piece. "Jokes" is not funny at all. For example, in a scene where lil bush has his underwear: "Welcome to al-qa-eeda!" There's nothing funny about that. Should it even be a joke? The ads that showed during the weeks shown at the show were more fun than the show itself, and it's just sad. Hopefully it will not be taken for another season. He shouldn't even have been the first.
