I'm sorry, but it's just pathetic. The little girl was a brat, there were no pleasant signs for them and the plot was sucked. Besides, it wasn't even a gator because the film would want us to believe. If you look at the perfect guide for reptiles, you will find that this is really a crocodile, not a gator. Obviously they didn't hire a real animal expert or they knew the creature was crochet. This is a sad excuse for the movie. Especially the end. I almost fell asleep when sleeping.
