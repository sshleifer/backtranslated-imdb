It is obvious that all of the good reviews for this film are still from an insider who was either involved in the film or who knows someone who knows someone and has seen several cuts. Well, I don't know anyone involved and I've seen the last paragraph and it's a clean garbage. The only thing he has done for this is ambition and a number of horrors from the legends of horror (no one on the screen terribly long). It's like filmmakers made this movie at a weekend during a horror conference and got actors like Tony Todd, Tom Savin, David Hess and Michael Berryman to shoot scenes during coffee breaks. It is an ultra-inexpensive video game system that gives X-Files scary examples of non-actors with more bubbles than the 21st century. There are few or no operations; it is all too explanatory a dialogue that tries to explain an unnecessarily twisted plot. Computer FX is a joke, but there are not enough of them and there are not enough steps to make this movie enjoyable with MST3K. After about 8 straight scenes, nothing to talk about, you'll find yourself in a fast back and forth ... and don't let go. Absolutely worthless.
