No one should ever try to customize the Tom Robbins book for the screen. Although the film is good and the performances are good, the speech-speaking dialogue is fine. Or, to put it another way, nobody would probably assume that listening to someone else's name would be like seeing it as a pearl written in radium. <br /> <br /> In general, the film seems to be poorly adapted to cliffs Notes on the book - most of the book is hidden up to a fifth of its size, retrospectively and in the present story, and the end is wildly (and unpleasantly) different from the end of the book. Most of the book's plots are gone, including what makes everything reasonable at the end, and there is more than one reference that makes sense in a book that changes the viewer's statement "Huh?" Unfortunately, it is not worth the effort - the script should have been read, compared to the book, burned, and all actors were sent out to do much better. I admire Gus Van Santi tremendously, but no one of his caliber could have made a proper film of such a complex book without minisation.
