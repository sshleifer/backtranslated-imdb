Even Goebbels could not have pulled a piece of propaganda like what Gore has done with this complete fiction. This is a survey of how numbers and statistics can be said to say what you have pre-defined. "Scientists" Gore says they have signed up to global warming: social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists. Can you say that a meteorologist is a neurosurgical expert? Field surveys and data analyzes are involved, Gores does not support worrying claims about global warming. As one of those geologists working in this field over the last 40 years, I have not seen any evidence to support global warming. My analysis of this film and Gore's activities in recent years leads me to the conclusion that global warming is his way of staying relevant and relevant. No more, no less. Ask all of the global warming emergencyists or "journalists" one simple question - you say global warming is a big problem. Tell me. What temperature should Earth be?
