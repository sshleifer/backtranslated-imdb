I didn't expect it to be a great movie, but I didn't expect it to be so terrible. I hated my mother's character so much that I had to change the channel. I turned it back, hoping it was just one part of the movie, but not. And for the daughter to sit there, is it embarrassing or almost finished from the job or gone crazy in her home? Are you kidding? I raised my mother's respect (and even fear), but I quickly put her in the nearest hotel when she proved it was annoying in my house. I was supposed to follow the rules after my mother's house. <br /> <br /> I didn't buy it. I tried to give him several options, really. Sorry.
