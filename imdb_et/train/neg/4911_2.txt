First die 2003 <br /> <br /> First of all, I confess my mistake: I didn't know it was made for a TV movie. I was "thrown" in "R" certification. The plot is strong, but the film is about 40 minutes too long. The direction and continuity were excellent. Most were mostly extraordinary and did a good job with their characters. The movie below is that it will definitely fall into the "chick flick" genre. Although there are some violent scenes, no violence should require an R rating. There is no nudity or free events. In fact, there are no sex scenes. Ona Grauer (who is absolutely beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa, and Glynis Davies were all guests in the SG-1 series, but this film didn't do anything to advance the career because they were all used as low-level supporters. Robert Patrick was fantastic as he is usually and Mitch Pileggi made me think of today's Lee Marvin. Very talented Megan Gallagher, whom I respected as an actor in the millennium, did not give him any challenges to show his abilities. The biggest disappointment for the pain was Tracy Pollan. Besides being an average actor and not particularly attractive, her voice is completely annoying. I found myself silencing during the TV dialogue. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys lifetime TV-type programs. I wouldn't like to see this movie to see this movie. Given that I could not find anything that would cause censorship, this is a film that deserves only watching television because nothing is cut. Like a TV movie, I'd appreciate it for 5 to 10. "R" as a feature film, such as a strong pain, appreciate it as ten out of ten.
