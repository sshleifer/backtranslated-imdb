Film without conscience. Drifter agrees that he will kill money for one nation. Then they baptize him twice. Meanwhile, he falls in love with the husband of a dead man, and without him knowing that he is a killer, he moves with him. Then he "accidentally" kills him when he discovers. Then, in WALKING TALL's heroism, he gets revenge against those mobiles who doubled him. The first problem is that the agreement with the letting of the murder loses all the compassion, value and heroism. We cannot accept any kind of goodness in him and as a result, the rest is not a moral center. We just don't care about this guy. And her husband (well-played Kari Wuhrer, a sheriff in eight children), a high-class lady who heads a homeless mission, loses her compassion by jumping straight into the bed with homeless stairs (despite her apparently weakened after her husband's death). And when he discovers he's a man? what does he do? She locks her inside the house (as if all the houses had locks that you can't open from INSIDE), and she continues her. Stoo-pid. George Wendt, however, is in a terrible thug. Director Stuart Gordon did so much better with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.
