I went to the Athenean cinema today, where my two children (6 and 8 years old) paid 3 x 12 euros (totaling about US $ 45), not to mention gas, popcorn and soda, asked to send their 3D special glasses back after leaving that could have been a great 3D movie masterpiece, but it turned out to be a sick "cold war" propaganda clip, as I have never seen in the last 20 years ... AND THERE ARE MORE FOR CHILDREN'S FILM ... HIGHLY NOW! <br /> <br /> PS 1: The average working Greek language is no more than â‚¬ 850 per month (about $ 1,050). <br /> <br /> PS 2 My children liked it ... but then again they are no more than babies> in Greek: mora, morons> like the one who wrote the script and others who did this "3d shame" place. <br /> <br /> PS 3 3D animation is fantastic but who gives ....!
