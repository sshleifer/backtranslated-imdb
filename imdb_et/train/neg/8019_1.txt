I read half a dozen other user comments about this board and it seems the opinions are very different. I have to agree with those who found this movie terrible. I have the pain to write that since I had hoped it would have been great, I would not have seen it the other day. I like supporting indie cinema, especially when they are gay, but this film is almost too tolerable. Those who walked out, as I thought after about three minutes, probably wouldn't mind taking out $ 11.00, or just thought it would go somewhere fast and not improve. Maybe I'm a little more optimistic than they are, whether they paid to get in there. <br /> <br /> Logan is bored. She is klutz. He's gay. I'm fine with that. The problem is that since the main character of the movie is boring, it does not necessarily mean that the film about him must be boring! There are ENDLESS scenes from a child who just puts lingerie like a load, restores everything you already learned in the first scene, and the second scene, etc., etc. NO ONE says something even remotely insightful or funny or interesting. Probably the most terrible thing is that I didn't know the slightest empathy with Logan. This in itself is a great achievement. He did not grow, he did not change, he did not learn (there is no one to teach him), he does nothing, and did not make a film! The scene after the same scene does not make a movie. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the title does not make any sense at all. 1/10.
