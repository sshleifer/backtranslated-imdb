First three words: READ THE BOOK! Really boys - it shows that the actual transfer of esoteric issues is difficult. I loved the book and was completely disappointed with the movie. It was ridiculous, half the heart and story bad. Novel - First! - did not have to focus on adventure! It's just around. The film focuses on this, and the message is back! In addition, visual effects were on parsimonous to show the energy of all living entities and to explain the end results. They turned it up! ... I'll never see it again!
