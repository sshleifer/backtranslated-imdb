Wow. This is as much as I am currently saying. Who writes it? Who produces this stuff? Which self-respecting actor agrees to act on this matter? Oh my God! I don't know how I got this movie, but I assume I had 8 cups of coffee that was the day to keep me awake. Holy God! It was one of the most droned and predictable cinemas I've ever seen ... and for the record I never intend to "witness" it. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw a DVD when buying a movie (MISTAKE # 1). I mean ... I thought hey! Julia Stiles. I like him. He's cool. I look at it as soon as I get home (MISTAKE # 2). I tried to look at it without having to pinch it every five minutes, thinking that if this horse stacked, I really did. But I was unsuccessful. It was one of the worst things I've ever seen. I mean ... what is the point where he imagines what will happen, then he returns to real life? It was quite annoying when his father did it "in seniority" like ten years ago. "Jokes" - and believe me, it takes a lot of me out to name them - are stupid, the characters are empty and forget, the storyline is completely predictable ... it makes a movie that should be WIPED FROM HISTORY DESCRIPTIONS! I should have thought something was wrong when I realized I had never heard of this movie. Probably it was directly on DVD. <br /> <br /> For everyone who thinks this, I have one tip. DO NOT! For God's love ... DON'T !!! I am ashamed that it is in my DVD collection, and I can't get rid of it ... Somebody and I mean NOBODY wants to buy it from me! And I'm talking about used and third-hand stores that buy mud shoes and keep it in the store window. This should let you know how this CRAP is.
