After Chaplin made one of his best films: Dough and dynamite, he made one of his worst: NÃ¤rvi gentlemen. In the first year of films, Chaplin made about a third of all his films. Many of them were experimental in terms of advertising, editing, gags, location photography, etc. It takes place on the racetrack, where Chaplin and his friend are trying to get paid. Mabel Normand is also with his friend and Chaplin is able to get rid of both his and Mabel's friends. Then woos Mabel grandstand without any apparent consequences for his behavior. Lots of slapstick here, but there is very little to recommend this movie to others when you watch Chaplin. I saw the print that I saw was badly deteriorated, which could have affected its enjoyment. Charley Chase can be viewed. * 4 stars.
