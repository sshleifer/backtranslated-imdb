I saw this movie opening weekend in Australia, assuming Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts, and Rush with great pain to signal Ned Kelly's final story in front of me. Unfortunately, despite Heath Ledger's outstanding performance in the lead, the plot paper was thin .... which doesn't inspire me to read "Our Sunshine". There were some other plus points, especially the support supported by Edgerton, the guaranteed direction from Jordan (also confirming the talent at Buffalo soldiers' show) and the design of production that gave the Australian bush a real feeling, just as Irish immigrants at the beginning of the 19th century have to see. But I can't feel the Australian folk costume (or was it?) .... the real story of the second chance I suspect it is for a Hollywood concession and selling a picture in the US. Well, at least Jordan and the manufacturers did not agree to lose the beards just to ask Universal ... <br /> <br /> I think I just have to fill Peter Carey's excellent "Kelly's secret story" Gang.
