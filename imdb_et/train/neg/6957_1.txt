Avoid this if you want to watch an expensive but poorly made movie. Example? The sound is good, but the dialogue is not clear - the French movie's cardinal sin. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to combine western, drug intrigue and ancien mode costume. What? Consider it. Cowboy's music is fun during sword fighting. Or how does a woman in her underwear who keeps a knife and jumps up and down in bed? Somebody should do "What is Tiger Lily" on this bomb. Re-write the script and then copy or subtitle it. Heck, it's almost now. (BTW, Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, both known to an American audience).
