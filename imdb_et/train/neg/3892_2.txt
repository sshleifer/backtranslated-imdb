Want to watch a scary horror movie? Then drive away. There are not enough movies in the world to make this movie enjoyable. <br /> <br /> However, there are enough scots. Single malt, if you can manage it. <br /> <br /> If previous comments were not enough to keep this movie in sight, let me help. NASA sends one person to space and two unpaid bonuses. Really great solar energy causes Colonel Steve West's nose to bleed. Things are going down there and there is resentment. <br /> <br /> I actually read the book adaptation that was published and published only in the UK. MILES better than film, and the book was terrible. At least some of the complaints are made for a mid-term review and some explanation of events (rhymes with "gas") is drawn by the author. <br /> <br /> Don't say the movie is completely worthy. Rick Baker learned that he would actually have to read the contract before signing the film, and Jonathan Demme found that he was directly fit. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is an MST3K episode with this flick, but it is of course a bit edited. Without the obligatory flashing of the breasts, even the healing power of Scotland cannot be saved. Please, just look at the lost ship Raiders if you want to see the boy melt. See Space Cowboys when you feel the need to see astronauts. I can't give this movie to a recommended movie in any good conscience.
