I can't believe this exhibition is still out of 9 out of 10. I saw these voices in the first two seasons, but who would embrace someone who would appreciate it? I was a big fan of the 1st season. I was hooked - all mystery, intercourse, inexplicable events. You never knew what would happen next. I was still loyal to the 2nd season, but I was a little disappointed that some basic things were still unexplained. And instead of giving you more answers, it just seemed like more questions. I love intercourse, but you have to throw people every time to keep them. <br /> <br /> Now I don't remember what finally turned me off, but somewhere in the season 2 was enough. I'm not a huge number of viewing the meetings - and you can't clearly leave the episode to stop what's happening. So, it wasn't worth it for me anymore. <br /> <br /> It's shameful that they couldn't be a little smarter and more attentive to loyal fans. I agree with some posters that seem to have the ABC got greedy and decided to see how long they can show it. Don't they realize that eventually they lose more fans than they could get.
