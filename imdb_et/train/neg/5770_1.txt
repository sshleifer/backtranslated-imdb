If I were to create a film counter, this film would be an absolute zero. Ten stars would appreciate it as follows: <br /> <br /> Volume: zero stars Quality of the video: zero stars Sound quality: zero stars Acting: zero stars <br /> <br /> It's like high school students got together in the afternoon with the camera, made a plot and photographed a movie. It is so lacking in any artistic value that I rather look at children in high school when they watch this movie. <br /> <br /> HOW to say something about the depth of unfairness. The "shootout" staircase is one of the most train-wreck funny scenes ever. First, fighters simply waves plastic guns to each other, jerking their hands back and forth to simulate the setback. The couple actually mates each other's non-existent bullets. No squibs, no sparks, blanks, just squashed squirtguns around. If you want to see two adult men play "actress", give it once a spin ... after you have cleaned the refrigerator, combed the carpet, polished all laptops, looted gravel, stretched books on the shelf, and so on. .
