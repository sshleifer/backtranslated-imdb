I had been waiting for Dreamgirls to see for a while ... what all this blurs comments, candidates and media attention. And I have to say that the first quarter of the movie was good! It really was a black music scene. But as the film was wearing, I and my family missed all of my thought. Singing was supposed to come one after the other. I mean seriously, another music number and it would have broken even with RENT. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, I noticed that no character was present in any symbol; I just didn't care what happened to them! Even if Eddie Murphy's character died of drug overdose, I knew I should have been sad, but I couldn't feel the feelings about that character. The characters were given a quiet background about singing in their childhood and not, but the personalities didn't appear enough to pull me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the conflict was not just enough for the viewer to care for the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of Ray, a Chicago-based copy-film and Rent (Ray and Chicago were, in my opinion, great movies). In general, I think this movie would be best for anyone who doesn't care about the general story, but would enjoy two hours of fun and fun singing games.
