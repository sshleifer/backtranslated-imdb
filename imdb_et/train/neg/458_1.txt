What's this mess? My little cousin obviously chose it for the league girlie-DVD and the title ... I decided to watch it together with her that she wasn't bored, and I'm definitely terrible quality. <br /> <br /> First, it was terrible. Amateur actors seem to read smart cards. Shipping is sub-par and very formal. Scene cuts were terrible .. it seems they took it straight from the story if it was there. Secondly, jokes and stereotypes were neither original nor well played - very, very formal. I can't count on when I could predict the next joke. I got a couple of nervous "fine" sexual innards. Cat, Beaver Patch, Hung Wong? .. c'mon! Just .. away from this movie. It's not cute, it's not funny, it's not even stupid. It's just stupid. It's like a PG childrens movie with unnecessary sexual inspiration, vulgarity, and violence to collect MPAA ratings. DO NOT open. <br /> <br /> "Do you want to ride your yacht?" <br /> <br /> "Is that what they call now?" <br /> <br /> "You could drive your ding." <br /> <br /> "Oh! I think I got blood from my stools!" <br /> <br /> Badly played, sir .
