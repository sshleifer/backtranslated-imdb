I found this movie a great idea that didn't give. They seem to have found a way to build tension, but were unable to steer their salaries very well. In one case, the police have a clock to find the kidnappers. To the dentist to the dentist for the dental care. At the same time, a robbed person (Mason) gets through an elevator shaft. At the same time, after the whole reconstruction, the police are getting free, which is very unlikely. There are scenes of great narratives that lead us to thinking about a terrorized man and a woman, which rather reduces the intercourse than adds it. We are fully aware of their tensions and the transfer of votes is an insult and robbes the viewer of any possibility of personal experience, as Hitchcock has occasionally proved to be more effective. The biggest disappointment is to sit through the whole movie and get a quick, rather endless ending. I mean, it's just ... "ending" snoring.
