I was looking for a little bit of "K-911", I think it looks like a lovely movie that I could get into. I always loved the comedy films of the dog. But it seemed to be a Jame movie, not Jerry Lee. The plot was pretty flat and the two interests of love were not chemistry at first. Not to mention that James had a full sexist view in the film, despite the fact that the writer did not go in that direction. James just pulled me more than half of the film. The dogs were real stars, and it's pretty sad that they shook the actors. <br /> <br /> So I'm glad it's not just me in IMDbis who agrees it was a pretty stupid movie. Hopefully, Jacob understands that his brother Jim was talented, not an offense, but not everyone can be a brother of these stars. Don't you want Ashlee Simpson to take the same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
