I wouldn't call it terribly, but this movie doesn't look like anything and it is loaded with some serious incredible plot developments. It starts well, but when the main hit is made, it goes around a long subplot around a young girl who is not convincing, and some activities that are unrealistic to an absurd theater. For example, there is a long-term shootout at the airport, where lighting is all stroboscopic. There is no explanation. How plausible is it that the airport storage room has luminaires that blink in and out and just enough to let Snippes make their incredible escape script? This is one of the few scenes of action that has been drawn out indefinitely by tunes that simply cannot pull the conviction. <br /> <br /> In addition, the US CIA team seems to be shooting down, but get it off by saying "national security" to the British. This trick depends on a stereotype that is far from reality to satisfy. <br /> <br /> There are many better movies. Better worded, better done. It is fun from time to time, but there is not enough meat in the bone, and after a while it becomes completely boring - something that should never happen in good movies.
