Seventy really great horror films were produced in the seventies, but this movie is definitely not one of them! This is a shame The child is no better because it works from a decent idea that takes a couple of sometimes successful horror themes. We have an idea of ​​a charming child who worked so well in classic films like Bad Seed, and then we have a central zombie theme, which of course has been the backbone of many successful horror films. The plot is basically like this: a young girl blames the death of people for her mother's death, so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to revenge (as you do). It's all well and good, except it's boring! For most movies, nothing happens, and although it rises at the end of some nice gore; it is not enough for the final to justify the session through the rest of it. The film obviously appeared on the budget because the places were cheap and all the actors were debris. There is not much to say about the film because there is not much to it. The child is a frustrating seventies horror stroke and I certainly don't recommend it.
