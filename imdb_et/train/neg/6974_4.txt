The blue monkey is actually mentioned in the movie, but in no way what makes it possible in the sense. At one point, some children migrate to a deeper level by studying. <br /> <br /> They start discussing what you find there and one of them (the girl) says she is betting that they will find a blue monkey. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's it. Completely story, the only sad link with the title and no idea why he thinks he found a blue monkey in the hospital basement. <br /> <br /> I am embarrassed for remembering this, but someone had to remember that I think!
