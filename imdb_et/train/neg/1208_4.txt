OK, if you're a woman with aggression problems, this movie may be a pleasure. Hate your important second? This movie is for you. For the boys, this is a bag of laughter. <br /> <br /> It's sad when former award-winning actors have to cut down on movies. <br /> <br /> The only really good part is the last 10 seconds. Even it was a cheese load. <br /> <br /> My wife has recently chosen the worst films. This is what you get (I) by letting my wife rent movies based on reviews on movie rental sites.
