I read the United States Chris_m_grant comment. <br /> <br /> He wrote: "The fantastic documentary of 1924. This modern geography of Iraq at the beginning of the 20th century was powerful." <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Chris and the people who are interested in the Iranian Bakhtiari Nomads, the Zagros Mountains and landscapes, and watched the Battle of Grass, A Nation for Life. These traditions seen in the film have lasted centuries and continue as long as life lasts. I'm from this region of Iran. I'm Bakhtiari. Chris, I'm sorry to bother you, but the Zardkuh area Bachthian is in Iran, not in Iraq, as you mentioned in your comment. Iran and Iraq are two different and different countries. Taking Iranian Estonians is almost the same as taking Americans to Mexico. Thanks, <br /> <br /> Ziba
