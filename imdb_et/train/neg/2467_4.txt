This movie gets both 6/10 ratings and 9/10. Here is why: as a standard horror film for a standard horror, taking into account action and fear and fear, this film carries you. Basically, this is a family drama that resembles what you would see on a lifetime channel, but put it in the horror universe. The story and formula are old, recovered hundreds of times. If you are looking for some originality in the plot structure or minimal conflicts, you are disappointed. Take the zombies away and you have something melodramatic as well as beautiful mind when you get into the cheese. That's 6/10. <br /> <br /> But the basic summary and idea are quite original and up. It is literally something you and your friends would joke when you're half drunk. . . but this joke actually came from the theater. The idea comes from 9/10. The only reason why this is not perfect is that they could have taken it even more, but they didn't. I thought it was funny, but like most comedies, it wasn't so funny. I had my mother and a little sister with me and the jokes we did about it were more fun than jokes. There were moments of perfect genius, but there were also moments of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope that other films take such a general risk and original ideas. I just can't say that it was perfect or even close to it because there is no originality on the plot. <br /> <br /> A great family movie. A great movie to watch with a lot of boys (or girls). A great movie to watch with someone. . . but if you look at it alone, it is a bit boring. Other people always make this movie fun and richer. <br /> <br /> 4/10
