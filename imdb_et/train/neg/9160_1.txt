This film was ridiculously bad. A friend rented it from Netflix and made me watch it. There are so many gaffe and goofe that are impossible even to get to know the characters and the plot. How are they like ... <br /> <br /> "Vermont Airport" surrounded by palm trees <br /> <br /> Ben's wonderfully appearing shirt during a phone conversation <br /> <br /> The priest's spatial office. .. with card board table. <br /> <br /> Behind the very bad movie is a decent story. But even if you look beyond technical mistakes, you'll find terrible action and casting. I was the most heavily spoiled by choosing an amazing gay actor to play the right-wing religious passionate brother. At her opening place, where she sat in her impeccable apartment, where she was kitty, she was having fun. <br /> <br /> I commend the writer / director / producer / editor / star / caterer / cast dentist / composer (and whatever he did on the road) to get the kind of movie he's on. If you have nothing better to do, it can be a fun group movie or even a drinking game base, but don't rent a powerful story about homophobia and gay marriages.
