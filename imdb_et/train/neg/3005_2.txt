Slaughter High is essentially a slip of your 80's symbols. The stick goes out, leaving the geeky guy terribly burning. In a few years, geeky returns to the boy and kills the people who hurt him. Now, this story may seem intriguing and very fun, but what makes this terrible movie different from the 80s slip is that it has some unpleasant mistakes and bugs. <br /> <br /> Operation is terrible, but it's not as bad as you suspect. Although it does not help that every film character is so high and unlikely. Lead, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) is the greatest tormentor of all of them, and he is the one we seem to share compassion and root. Not to mention, geeky boy is almost too geeky and I think even stereotypical gays would be foolishly crazy and just reluctantly how he is, so when he starts, does anyone really care? <br /> <br /> There is a lot of unintentional laughing potential. The lack of Munro's functionality is quite obvious, putting it on the same level as the rest of the terrible. However, the most fun is when the film tries to make a bad job for Munro, who is among his teenagers in the mid-1930s. And when it comes to later life, and Munro plays around his real age, the rest doesn't move as adults. It all goes well with the theme song, which is a fun heavy metal thrash with a manic laugh and a voice that despises "I'm you. That's not saying Slaughter High is really a very good slip, but it has a bad entertaining value. Maybe it's important for hard fans but don't expect this to be a dilemma, relationship or credibility.
