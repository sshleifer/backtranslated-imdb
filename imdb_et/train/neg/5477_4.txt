Take the SciF original and mix a little alternative / revolutionary history and you'll get "Aztec Rex". Apparently Hernand Cortes had to conquer Tyrannosaurus Rex and his companion first before taking over the Aztec empire. This is the thrust of this movie. Considering the plot, she could have really sucked; the fact that it's only sucked is the publisher's tip. There are some problems. For starters, Cortes plays with Ian Ziering. Even Black Wig, Ziering as Cortes is as convincing as Axl Rose plays Gandhi. And while Cortes conquers Mexican indigenous peoples, it seems that the Aztecs are played by the All-Hawaiian band. The T-Rex (s) look aside to look pretty good, although every time one gets off, he's just finished with CGI. And they die too easily; I think that if T-Rex were in real life, they could chop down or at least be wounded somewhat rudimentary with 16th century weapons. But it takes away from the movie. There are also some graphic T-Rex swallowing-human scenes that are surprising, but in this context I thought they worked well. There are many activities and the entire colonization angle is widespread throughout the region, but it does not perish at the corner of the dinosaur, unlike the other recent SciFi original dinosaurs, "Warbirds". In general, mediocre (but according to SciF original standards) the film is very modest 4.
