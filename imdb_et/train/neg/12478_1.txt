I had to give this movie 1 because it was so bad, but don't think I wouldn't like it because I laughed and laughed, and I even had some questions. So half of the time I laughed, half of the time I said, "What's going on in hell?" or "why should anyone do that?" et cetera. I mostly enjoyed the terrible fog effects, the 80's style nude scene / battle / dialogue / naked scene and how the warrior swords appear in the wind when they drive their horses. And there are some funny model effects (they don't have to be real trees, aren't they?) And I still don't understand the man they find in the caves, what the hell is? My friend told me about these films and I thought I'd give it a try, and I liked this movie, like people like Ed Wood movies, I don't really enjoy what the movie was meant to do, I look at it myself for fun. So don't let it bother you if you really thought it was an action movie, that is, I just liked it for other reasons. It is much, much worse than Evil Dead, so it can actually think of you as wasting your life watching it (which came to mind for some time). I think most people would have the best thing if you had some drinks, some friends and laughed at this movie. Maybe it's a bit harsh, but I don't believe in renting and seeing. Yo.
