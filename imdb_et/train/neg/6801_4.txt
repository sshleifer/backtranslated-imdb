First, I'm not telling you why I rented this movie because I'm still confused ... <br /> <br /> Air Rage is much like any movie I've seen where the plane has been hijacked. Of course, an airplane has one important person and a hijacker to seek revenge. The sad thing is that some hijacking methods have already been used in other films. Are we really so vague so fast? <br /> <br /> Although this is Ice-T (who for some incomprehensible reason makes painful attempts during ACTING, if he is not busy "c" back in the rapeseed), who has glorified the film, the film is actually filming less than amazing Kim Stream as a stewardess who has been surprised by five hijackers, which of course returns to them. As for the rest, the only person I managed to recognize was Steve Hytner, better known as Kenny Bania from "Seinfeld". <br /> <br /> I will not forget my favorite movie when the hijacker used PLASTIQUE POUND to blow out the door ... BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> The plot was unnaturally predictable. <br /> <br /> Script - cruel. It reached the point where I could say something that felt like it was a stupid comment, and that would be the next line in the movie. <br /> <br /> As for special effects ... the only thing special about this movie is that I wasted my TV and videotape for 100 minutes on electricity consumption. <br /> <br /> And the title - movie DID is in Air. But because the films were less than stars, the only rage of the movie was what the viewer was. <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood to even choose a movie, it's because it's bad. Please save yourself, don't choose it.
