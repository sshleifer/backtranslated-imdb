There were many shared loyalties during the war; Obviously, many "border states" took place where the North met geographically geographically. From the border, the young father, Owen Moore, joins the Union Army. Soon, the Confederate soldier Henry B. Walthall will talk about his regime to the assets of an isolated enemy in despair; he finds a delivery where the young daughter of the Union seat Gladys Egan sits. When the Yankee soldiers follow him, Little Gladys helps innocently hide the Confederacy. Later, when he returns to his father to kill, the goodness of a little girl is remembered. Sweet, Little Story by D.W. Griffith. Location material and humanity are loved. <br /> <br /> **** In border countries (6/13/10) D.W. Griffith ~ Henry B. Walthall, Owen Moore, Gladys Egan
