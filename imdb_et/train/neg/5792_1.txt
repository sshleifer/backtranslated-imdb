Another made TV piece junk! It is an insult to war films (I use this word in the freest form!) I thought that Telly Savala's career had hit the bottom when she made her voice over this visit to Birmingham, which is shown halfway on Tarran, but then I forgot that she was involved ! I tried to push it into my subconscious, but cable TV brought me out of memory and yelled at me! <br /> <br /> I like a little (laughing sarcastically!) in a movie claiming to be a scene from Liverpool in the forties, but it's blatant at the end of the eighties of the Zagreb Cathedral. The steam train trained by the Congress also shows the JZ (Yugoslav Zeleznice or Yugoslavian Railways) logo on the locomotive side quite clearly, even though the makers have tried to exclude them. Why not just a movie in the UK if it's the place where most of the movie is set? <br /> <br /> Cheap rubbish and celluloid waste!
