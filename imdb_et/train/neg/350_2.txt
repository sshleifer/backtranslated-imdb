The performances of Fishbourne (who seem strangely funny) and Ed Harris are remarkable, unlike Connery, who does not seem to have a role to play and reaches the motivating behavior of an 80-year-old old man. In fact, the scenario does not make sense; imagine 60 minutes. a happy ending plot and a steep swivel that has no argumentative structure for the characters. It is rather an accident than a scenario and it can be a good exam. The more you remember, the stronger the impression. The death penalty is not a question here, although it is from the beginning; it disappears without any further comments. The subject and the environment could have been good.
