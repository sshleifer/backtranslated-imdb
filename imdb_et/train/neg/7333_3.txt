I enjoyed the feeling of opening a few minutes, but in 20 minutes I used the free-return button. Too many shots of Stewart (Michael Zelniker) walking from room to room, corridor, door and street, and so many of his pictures looking for fun and confusion. I had the impression that this story was originally meant for short (20-30 minutes) and then stretched the function between the work of the director Grieve and the star Zelniker (they wrote the script together). <Br /> <br /> Maybe it would have been more fun if some characters had said something that I had never said in many other films or if the ending was not - disappointingly - what I had predicted for three minutes in the movie (independent / smaller) studio atypical). At least his heart was in the right place - it wasn't your standard Hollywood manipulative nonsense.
