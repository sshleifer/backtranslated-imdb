I am the current A.S.L. The student and he was forced to watch this movie in the classroom and what came out of it was a blatant bias in the film. The film is probably inclined towards P.O.V. "common sense of deaf" is not in their midst. The film did not mention or take into account other situations that are also discussed in this topic. I.E. Deaf People who were born of hearing and later went to the deaf. Is that right or wrong in this case? The film is biased and almost all deaf w / capital D view. Not that it is bad, but in order to be a real documentary, it should try to be a little impartial.
