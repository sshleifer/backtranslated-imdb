There is nothing to redeem this movie. They took a stupid story, mixed it, put it wrong, filtered it wrong. It has a bad dialogue that is badly done with a nervous and dirty story. <br /> <br /> Like bad art, it's worse than trade. Who could have been its target market. What age group? What interest group? <br /> <br /> Someone should film how and why they made this movie. That's what I would pay to see. <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of bad movies and it's with "Sailor Who Fell from Grace" and "Manos" ... my choices as the three worst bad movies I've ever seen. All those involved should force VanDamme to talk forever. <br /> <br /> I'm challenging you. Watch this movie and complete the academic exercise - how did you take it and make it worse? I can't think in one way.
