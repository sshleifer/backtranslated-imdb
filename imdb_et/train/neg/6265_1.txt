I'm going to be the director's nephew. It has taken me many years to get a copy of this movie and I can assure you that this is indeed one of the worst films ever. My uncle can no longer get a copy of it (I asked). Waiting for him a copy. <br /> <br /> The movie's current average rating is 1.9 / 10. As far as I can tell, it should put it down to the mid-30s in the IMDb's "bottom 100", but with only 206 votes it's not yet placed. <br /> <br /> It is sad that the movie doesn't even respect the 100-year title. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I will give family members this year a copy of the movie for holiday gifts. Best / worst gift ever?
