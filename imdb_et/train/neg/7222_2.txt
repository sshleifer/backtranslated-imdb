Knowing Enki Bilal's comics for some time, I had to watch this movie. I thought it would be a good way for Bilal to spread his art and ideas to a wider audience. I thought it would be a good movie to recommend, and I thought I enjoyed watching it ... I was wrong! The film was a real torture. Thought has the potential ... but the film leaves too much to be desired, and basically everyone who sees the film has the impression that he can do it better. I'm not suggesting if you should see this movie. It is possible that you read the pages you have already seen, or that you see it - but be prepared very bad for 102 minutes.
