this movie was terrible. I hardly got it awake. I would never see this movie when I paid for it. The so-called horror scenes were largely predictable and over-played. There was really nothing in this movie that would have made it original or worth $ 7.50 what I saw for that. Don't look at it, don't rent it, don't read it online, because none of these things would be a waste of your time. Sarah Michelle Geller was uncomfortable and really should be ashamed of her good name for thawing this movie. Shame on you, Sarah, that you associate this terrible and terrible movie. A terrible movie, you never have to see it.
