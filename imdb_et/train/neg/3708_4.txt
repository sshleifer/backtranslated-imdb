The ground is about Lance Barton, a black comedian who hits the truck. She goes to heaven and she gets another body. Lance gets the white guy Charles Wellington's body. That's what Lance Charles does in the body. The film has some laughs, but it's not special. This is a good movie if you're a Chris Rock fan. Madagascar, the 2005 animated comedy, is better. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock has done it better. This will make you laugh at just four times the movie. And it's not really ridiculous funny. You laugh at yourself and you can strangle, but you definitely don't let the floor laugh.
