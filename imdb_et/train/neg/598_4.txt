Please, caution: this movie, though a pretty bad story, was one of the most terrible movies I've seen ... EVER. Remember to enjoy your movie before you live on your couch. <br /> <br /> So it officially starts with the party. Just your middle half, but there's some guy. She's a beautiful Kate ... if you know what I'm saying. Remember his face; This will help later later. <br /> <br /> So Kate is going to find George Clooney (didn't I say the plot was bad?) and took the tube. It's London Underground at night, but it's just stupid. So the timetable says that the next and last train will arrive in 7 minutes. Now, Kate, a stupid party girl that she is, decides she can get rid of it in 7 minutes. He usually misses the train and finds himself locked in the London Underground. Alone. Well, almost ... <br /> <br /> So the film continues from there. Blood, bold, limbs, even certain parts of the body that I do not mention are truncated and captured and eventually amputated from the body. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a typical horror; pretty, but thick girl in emergency type and sick, weird psycho. Or if it is, Creep. <br /> <br /> I'd say I'll give it a go if you're a Saw, Hostel, or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but with the rest of us, scare the horrors of gratitude very much.
