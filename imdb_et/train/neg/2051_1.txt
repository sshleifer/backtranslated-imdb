Since there was nothing wrong with the act, etc., writing this episode is far from the phantom or phantom of this series. It took 42 minutes to see a Martian hunter. You have to know that in the middle of the sixth series, what's happening, it's not true what's going on and really doesn't give the story of this story unless you meet a hunter again in March and 30 minutes to do another bad case in smallville soap opera. I really like to show, but mostly thanks to cast and 3 or so good episodes every year, but who has ever written a cast that works or has been working with soaps must be preserved. It was overwhelmingly one. The first 4 minutes you know that what is happening is fake and something happens is a dream based on Clark's fault, probably caused by the nature of the phantomcone and when he wakes up, he and blah blah blah so writers don't have to really create a villain , which promotes the story this week. One can also add another criminal who died in the last episode, where the Martian male hunter was and made him fly again or back and tells Clark that he forgot his sunglasses to look closer to this episode and named it daily.
