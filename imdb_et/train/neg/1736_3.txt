Let me start by saying that I liked Betty Grable, especially "Down Argentine Way", but by the time she got into this catastrophe she was "round" and frankly the whole movie was embarrassing. Costarred with Douglas Fairbanks JNr (who must be quite desperate) had a bad story, the colors were good and the film was too long. It had some old billboards like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner to try and stimulate interest, but without success. The music score was terrible, and I have to say that one voice was not memorable .... since I was a Miss Grable fan, I always wish I had never seen it!
