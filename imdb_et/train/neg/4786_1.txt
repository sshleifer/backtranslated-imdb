I despise horror films, it's no secret. No plot, bad behavior and gallons are not the clips of these cinema errors and this "film" is no exception. I can't believe some cable stations actually run this garbage. (This particular rubbish appeared as you remember.) Because mentioning another movie would be a great offense for this second movie, I say this: All Phantasm movies, all Jason movies, Freddy movies, Chucky movies, and most Michael Myers movies can be summarized in one in: TERRIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> Rating (Phantasm III): 0.5 / 10
