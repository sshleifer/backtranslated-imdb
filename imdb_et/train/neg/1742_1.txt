Well, maybe I have just run badly with Hindi movies lately. I asked the Apharani (Prakash Jha) video shop boy, but being a new version, it was not yet available. So I had to live against it. It turned out to be the stupid Hindi movie I've seen (and I've seen quite a few). No wonder BOllywood is the laugh of the whole world! If IMDb has negative ratings, I'd give Garam Masala a -10. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing a television show about the jazz premiere they had to get rid of in Mumbai. All the usual celebrities and their sides appeared. For both reasons, people expect good things from Piyadarashan. I didn't like Hulchul, Hungama or his other films. Hulchul, apparently dubbed Tamil or Telugu, took a very tough, face-to-face ticket, which again didn't make sense except for the Bollywood flick. This last piece of CXXP proved that this man has no patterns. Who made him a director, even a Bollywood director on it ??? <br /> <br /> Anyway, for the movie now. What begins as a romantic imprisonment becomes a non-sensitive female forest. Two magazine fashion photographers share the apartment (is it not like No Entry, where 2 dudes work for the press and share the office? Jezuz Christ, now they copy their stories!) Some chefs or chefs trying to help one of the dodos with their multilateral love (multi-tasking + multi-timing). What finally happened, I have no idea. I turned off in the middle. What a ridiculous junk. I can't believe they even released it. And how sadistic to beat your bliss! For what audience did they do it - poor illiterate Indian masses (700 million at the last reading) or the well-biased NRI desises in Phoren? In both cases, this is not important. Both groups have no idea what makes a good movie and probably deserves such a pious thing. <br /> <br /> Its a brief overview because there is nothing to write, but an F-class garbage bag. Bollywood should change its name to Follywood. And yes, this review is much better than the film itself.
