An idiotic dentist discovers that his wife has been unfaithful. So, there's no new story here. But the authors managed to create a stupid, nasty movie. If you like vomiting a child or seeing a dentist to pull all his wife's teeth out of a bloody horror, look (or rent) a movie. If not, go ahead (MY LADY, anyone?)
