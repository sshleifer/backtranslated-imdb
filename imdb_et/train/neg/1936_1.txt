Spoiler warning. <br /> <br /> When the main character's sister is pressed down the stairs, the killer next to her breaks a glass of vodka to feel like she is drinking. But before he is killed, he tells his sister's business partner (Teri Garr) that he is not drinking within 4 days. However, the results of the toxicological report by the police are not mentioned! And the characters are telling him he's dropped down on drunk stairs. Ah? A really bad mistake in this movie, which is quite terrible. Surprisingly bad considering the big lie. Some bugs: writing is not very good, music is made to be a bad thing on TV and there is no tension, because we already know the answer to the mystery of the first scene of the movie.
