This movie was in a sci-fi 50 pack, my friend got me for Christmas. It is very similar to the first Gozilla film, and this film has scenes with American players for no real reason. One interesting thing about the scenes entered is that there is a tension between the Cold War between America and Russia. Like Godzillas, Gamera has aroused an atomic explosion and rampage around the world, paying close attention to Tokyo, as no big monster movie is complete unless Tokyo bites it. All in all, it's okay to film. Some Gamer-related scenes, especially Toly's scenes, are quite remarkable and have quite special effects at that time. If you like the Japanese giant monster, you can really get out of it. I'll give him 4 out of 10. If it had become a Japanese version that I watched, it would probably have got 5.
