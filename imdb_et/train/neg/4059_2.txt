Rarely has such an amazing cast so badly wasted. Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, and John Turturro, all jumped on board to be only torpedoed by a script that seems to be something other than funny Hollywood. The addition of Martin Scorses's name to it was probably a calculation, but the final result is less than the sum of its parts. Remembering the nightmare went horribly wrong, every scene seems to be more weary than the next. "Searching and Destruction" is nothing more than abstract, stylish, self-evident mess, and the whole movie is definitely boring .......... MERK
