The man made a lot of headlines for the cinema and I think he said one day; I should choose a cheap scenario, try to put as many headlines as possible (the reason I am the headline designer) and try to convince people that this is actually a movie. One of the worst I've ever seen is sure. If you fell into the desire to see beautiful headlines, see if some posters don't waste their time looking at it. <br /> <br /> Is it ironic, don't you think you saw a poster? the only part of his project whose title work should have been almost non-existent!
