When I saw this movie on TV, I was very expecting it. I grew up in the 1980s and, like everyone else who has grown up in this era, has seen every 80's teen and summer camp movie there. So I couldn't wait to see the movie that completely violates the movie genre. What a disappointment! The film was nothing more than really a lot of bad jokes and gags, over and over again, but almost no plot or substance. And the filmmakers are trying to completely fail the dark humor - some of these so-called jokes did not come across anything other than honest cruel and offensive. The only good things about this movie were wardrobe, music and actors. It was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all the styles of clothing in the summer of the 80s, and the same applies to music. And the actor was the highest: almost all of Hollywood's best comedians were there. Too bad they didn't have better material.
