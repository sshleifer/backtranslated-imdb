It seems that this is the only movie Johannes Saxon has ever directed, and that he had a good idea to stop after that and stay in front of the camera. This movie is a dog, from start to finish, and it's boring and wood that doesn't have much. A Vietnam war hero takes a job that works against a mob boss, gets a little too friendly with his wife, and then kills the woman's head of violence and the hero of war who is sent and sent to prison, especially to the death penalty. Now this particular prison has tested the prisoners and is testing some formula that makes men the ultimate killing machine (zombie). Of course, everything goes wrong and then all these infected people are stuck in prison, some of whom are becoming zombies and the rest who suddenly just don't want to be there anymore. It continues and continues, but nothing much to show or say to you, and I stopped it before the end that seemed to have come a few times, but no, apparently he started to make a different and equally dull path. If one looked to the end, they could change the zombie themselves, so don't risk it. 2 out of 10.
