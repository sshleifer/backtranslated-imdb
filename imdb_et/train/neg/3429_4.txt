I got a copy of this film writer for soulsek. I have to say that it is pathetic and just painful to look at two police officers, but I looked at the movie as a joke and because it is a tribute to the August underground I had seen in my book as an awesome movie. Its quality and everything about it is pretty bad, but it's entertaining and something to talk to friends. Reminds me of troma, but good things. I recommend seeing it under two conditions if you are bored and need a good laugh or high, otherwise let it be. Definitely a recommended download. o and the killings are pretty funny. like when the zombie hangs on the worshipers of Satan and strikes someone with it.
