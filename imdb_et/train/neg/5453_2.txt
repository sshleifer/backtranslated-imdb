OK, I tried this movie halfway through, but.oh.dear.god.it.sounds.like.they're.all.reading.from.scripts. <br /> <br /> Especially the guy who is currently in the teachers and the group of books, though at least he has proven to be able to act when he wants to! (The part where someone is a heart attack faces a bad movie bastion in terms of functioning, scripting, and overall credibility). Apparently, it seems to be a cash flow in human traffic, but although it is not the best film that is at least original and had participants whose delivery was not like the serious but hopeless GCSE students who tried to graduate. Not as much as human traffic as a small car accident!
