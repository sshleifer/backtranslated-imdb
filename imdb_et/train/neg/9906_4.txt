After reading the comments, it became clear that all the intellectual work was done. How totally boring. Oh, how about the good Olympic days there was nothing like that. Of all the comments, no one expressed this work or any other emotions. <br /> <br /> I grew up right after the steam age and this cinema with Dan'l Boone on Saturday afternoon in matin√©e. It was an annual film that made a round and filled seats with gripping, gripping, folding, strangling, buckwheat monsters like me or myself. And that was the film theater at that time. Almost as big as Ozi's wizard. <br /> <br /> IMDb requires that every criticism contain something about the plot. The problem is that it was rather a template. Here goes. Randolph Scott (cowboy / hero) gathers friends and goes against their evil people. Hooray! <br /> <br /> All of us kids thought of this plot before we started to see our quarter. It was almost a drawing line for every Scott, John Wayne, Roy Rogers movie. If you take the time to return and review each movie - just don't ask for surprises. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind the context of time. The TV was not or was small. Not for children. There was a school there. There was a great outdoors. There were toy guns. No cyber time. And the age of steam had just collapsed. But such films offered entertainment and filled the imagination of young whistles. Even the girls got into it. <br /> <br /> This movie was entertainment. And it is just as meaningless as it produced today. It was originally aimed at propaganda. But soon the children came to the movies. <br /> <br /> Our fathers had experienced a real thing. And it wouldn't be until Sam Peckinpah decomposed the red squash of the blood protein ten years later in realistic and rich quantities. It was only when his board died, that someone died slowly, with great pain and misfortune. Until Peckinpah's war and the fight against weapons was a rather bloodless thing. Thanks to Sam. <br /> <br /> There was no blood or blood at all to see the movie, and adults don't mind. They wouldn't have thought that. The burned plant life is not sprayed. So this film had all the honor and no gory. Gung Ho was then suitable for children. <br /> <br /> You see, I set four for this rating. Why should I do this? Well. It's a terrible movie. No matter how I love it. I love this movie because it brought back one childhood from a happier moment. But this is not just a good quality movie. Basically, Gung Ho has become a romantic novel for children. <br /> <br /> Should people watch it. Of course. I don't want to stay away. Realistically, however. The plot is easy. Are the characters low? they are hairs. You can love a bad movie.
