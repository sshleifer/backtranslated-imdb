After two long, long-running skittles, one of my brothers saw the final conclusion and the other totally fun, we start the fast back and forth festival that GROOVE TUBE is right for. Of course, the uber-foolish frat-boys, who are still on the main line of JACKASS or Tom Green, find out the idea of ​​stools coming out of some tubes, SEX OLYMPICS (I don't really need to give you details, I) and the clown who is basically "not very" loving clown a bit i think i've seen about ninety times now eat it like manure beetles: well, more power for you. <br /> <br /> I just want to express this, despite what you have heard, was not in any way a model for many infinitely fun movies like KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE. The Skit movie was already made and now, if you want you to know about SEX, and so on. And done better.
