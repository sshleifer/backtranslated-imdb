This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. I don't care what the critics say, it's bad. I think the problem is with the Kundera novel. It is not that it is unclear; It's just that, like 99% of his work, it's frustrating and redundant. He seems to be in love with himself, his characters come as a navel-eye and his novels as a whole are miscommunicative. I've read many of his works (even his socialist realistic poetry. It was really terrible) - I just don't understand what the noise is. Characteristics (such as self-squeezing) in their novels create stigmatization of reading. In the film, all things I didn't like about Kundera were increased. Maybe I just missed something, but I don't think so. In the side book, I cannot believe that it is a DVD of criteria collection. In no way is this film important.
