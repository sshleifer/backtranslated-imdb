Portly nice boy falls on luscious blonde; he also likes him, but not for the reasons you think. Black comedy, a little seen by writer Pat Prof, is a very good performance by Joe Alaskey and Donna Dixon, but it has no lasting effect. Norman Bates, by Anthony Perkins, is just for quick flights. Even at the B-comedy level, there is a somewhat similar "Eating Raoul" choice. There is definitely a fun setting here; Unfortunately, the second act has nothing in the picture. An interesting touchstone, but it fails. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
