First of all, we agree that Lorenzo Lamas can never be considered a qualified actor, hardly even a decent, sometimes just null and void. But this @ *! ^ The piece, called SnakeEater, fell into the film industry as a whole. <br /> <br /> First we start with a plot. The Vietnamese veterinarian named Jack Kelly, or Soldier (who should be as harsh as the leather strap and some that can be believed when he slides his nails through the legs of two boys and attaches them to the floor) gets the word that his family has been killed and his sister abducted. That's why he goes alone to save his sister. There was some potential, but still pretty thin to get started. <br /> <br /> Now acting. As an actor myself, I am qualified to say that it was part of the art that worked in art history !!!!! Lamas is fine. Jackets played by Classet / Deliverance must be pulled up and released for their so-called performances, which offend all the players, especially talented people who never get their big break! <br /> <br /> Finally, the action. Fixed fighting is both good at BEST and fights are regrettable. I've seen more real struggle at the Renaissance Festival (and they were pretty fake)! <br /> <br /> Readers, Listen to Me: ALL FOR CACA! HOW TO BE ONLY A FILM, HOW TO WANT TO PREVENT! Don't look at this thing for your brain cell count!
