Final Score: 0 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> *** Possible scene-based spoilers (but who cares) *** <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right: zero. And I rarely give 1. Even for the movies I'm looking for, I'm looking for things like music, cinematography, imagination, it's humor, even a good pace to be as objective as possible. Looking at it within your families or subgenera. But there is absolutely no redemption here. I don't remember the second time the movie actually sent me looking up and down the room when it was over. The only reason I came to the end was that I couldn't change the channel - I was sitting there just amazingly, I was looking at what the insulting stupid would be like. It was like a rat looking at a snake. <br /> <br /> But let's have fun and pull that kid out if we do. First of all, there is nothing technical that works in "Whipped". Visuals are all in sitcom style. The cut scenes depict all the images that are just moving on the street over and over again at night. Music and score, not only does it help the film - it's unpleasant. Not to mention that it has nothing to do. It is a carton, as it is, and it also applies to Amanda Beet (clearly the "star" that got this train wreck green). These men, supposedly good friends, no longer have chemistry or expediency when director Peter M. Cohen would have rounded them off at the bus stop before minutes to the bus station. t the original bone in its body. It has no imagination. It doesn't show us something we haven't seen thousands of times. The whole premise or "twist" of this movie is based on the male and "idea" that empowered women can play with men "just as they play". Anyone who thinks it's somehow twisted or somehow original, probably never turned on the TV. Twisted, low women are common. Male-bashing is the norm. It doesn't steal anything specifically, it's worse: it steals clich√©s. I cannot imagine that women would make a film that depicted other women with so many stereotypes and disdain. I like to rent "In the Men of Men" - or better, "Mary has something". This movie wants to be an "Edgier" version of "There's something about Mary" so bad you see a sweat. <br /> <br /> The film does not include women, men, dating, sex or really anything. Cohen is just content that revives the myths he has indoctrinated from other sexist films. On the other hand, the film does not function as a satire, because although it is mature with exaggeration, it can be seen as "satirical", but it does not actually have the basis for the satires. It doesn't even know what it is satirizing. Then there is a dialogue that is a little more than the characters who overshadow one another. Example: Mark 1: "F ** k sa" Note 2: "Oh yes, well f ** k you" (repeat) <br /> <br /> And the bottom line, something that can excuse all the other discretionary powers: There are many films without plots, without good deeds, morally repressive characters, and a funny hidden dialogue that has been funny and so good. "Whipped" is not funny. Not the other. It has no comic skills or timing. The situation is all totally fake, not based on breaking any truth, especially to laugh at us. The characters are all broadly drawn so that they are relative to the lowest value of the lowest common denominator of SEEM. Just look at the "marquee scene", the "cult classic" hairstyle scene. One of our troubled heroes opens the medical cabinet and sees Mena (Peet) vibrator. For some reason the light comes on as if it had found the Holy Grail. Why Cohen thinks men are reacting in this way to vibrators that I don't know. When he robs himself, he falls to the toilet and then tries to catch the fish with his naked hand, if, Mena, walks to him. Oh, my half. <br /> <br /> But strangely, people like this movie. Of course, people like "Friends" and the introduction of reality show that I shouldn't be surprised. All this, however, is a common thread. "Whipped" is a great proof to me that there is only a large number of pockets in America that laugh at every joke because it is related to sex. They love all the shows or movies (or think they like it) just because they are dating or relationships. Any lack of quality will not prevent these people. Just as people have indoctrinated white teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs, they are also indoctrinated to get around for the sale of their cheap, empty, effortless TVs, movies and any number of products. <br /> <br /> The only consolidation is that when I die because I saw this movie, I have got credit for 80 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
