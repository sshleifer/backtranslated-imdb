A black boy becomes a rich white guy, and a rich white man seems to embrace the hip-hop culture and most of the "funny" moments of this movie play out. I have a problem that it doesn't work and almost never works. <br /> <br /> OK, so no one would expect Lance to grab such a body and suddenly start acting like Charles Wellington. That would be too much to ask. I'll give it. But at the same time it goes too far to the other. I should imagine a rich white man who is singing rap and stuff, playing as he is a hip-hop culture bastion, and people just * accept him? And how is Sontee, who falls in love with him * as a rich white guy *, though he doesn't care about his money or power? It's so incredible that it's not even funny. <br /> <br /> I just couldn't stop the belief and I couldn't finish the movie. I added one extra letter because it made me laugh a few times, even hard. But I just couldn't get across the "white boy who does the hip-hop" thing I've never done, like a movie I've ever seen. This was no exception.
