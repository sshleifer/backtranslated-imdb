It may be a bit tough for me, but unfortunately it is still true in my career. Just see what he did so far. They don't do it near the 3-star sign. <br /> <br /> Why did I watch this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lawless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg. Lucy was remarkable in this film, her performance carrying the whole movie. I hope he gets a "blockade" and breaks down into a bigger league of players, he clearly has the skills. Greg was not that impressive, typical TV style. <br /> <br /> The movie is categorized as horror. The only "horror" is short setbacks and they last for a maximum of 2-5 seconds, in a small amount of blood. Personally, I would call it more "drama / thriller". <br /> <br /> But no matter how interesting this story is, it's bad leadership, editing and acting (from Lucy). You do not get real links with the actors, something that is very important in such a story. You just sit there looking at not knowing anything. It's like watching a bad TV soap .... actually I think TV soap would be more interesting. <br /> <br /> My advice: stay away from this movie ... or better just away from all Michael Hurst is involved.
