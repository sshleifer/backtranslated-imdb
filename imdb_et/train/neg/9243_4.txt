Simply put, I don't like Westerners. And having ever sat down from one beginning to the next, I decided to watch "My Darling Clementine" and see it all the time, no matter how painful it was for me. At first it was unexpected. I found that the actor is ridiculous, the landscape (ordinary dessert, horses and cowboys) boring and music and its timing along the painful edge. But after talking mentally to start fighting, it started to endure more easily in the first 20 minutes. Focusing on cinematic art and how John Ford managed to make even the worst situations (boring in my mind), it seems quite stunning at times, making it much more interesting. Finally, I can't go so far as to say that I enjoyed this movie at the end of it. But it was good enough to sit down to the end and it will impress itself.
