This is the first Japanese guinea pig film and I think it is the worst. A bunch of boys tortured the girl for several days before finally killing her. And here I say that these movies are not real! These are fake horror movies that try to be as realistic as possible. <br /> <br /> Scenes are ill but in many cases unreal. For example, when they hit a girl on the floor, we can clearly see how they hit and turn the floor near the girl! And how stupid it looks! Sound effects are also unrealistic and do not make sense. Other scenes include the bowels of animals thrown at the girl, the girls exposed to loud noise for several hours, the cutting of the nails, the worms placed in the wounds of the girls' bodies, the piercing and the distorted horrible detail. Very sick and average live film with absolutely nothing valuable or cinematic significance. This first entry is sick and the most amateurish guinea pig, although it is not as bloody as the next part, meat and blood flowers that try to be as shocking as possible. <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: Fucking Experiment is perhaps the worst thing I've seen and the closest thing to sniff. It is still (of course) a fake s (n / t) uff, the only difference with a true "sniffing movie" is that no one dies and does not make the film real. I can't recommend it to anyone because it's so s **** and reluctant. Those who regard it as a big horror movie do not understand anything about the cinema and its true meaning. I looked at this curiosity (like the other series) and now I know they are insignificant. They only work at the stroke level and this is not too valuable a cinema achievement. Devil's Experiment is perhaps the worst film I've ever seen and the Mermaid Well (guinea pig 4) is perhaps the most disgusting film I've ever seen. So they are quite extreme in my book, but they are all.
