Spooks is an enjoyable trash bin that has some well-managed sequences, ridiculous plots and dialogue, and some third rates. Many have said that this is a UK version 24, and there are similarities. <br /> <br /> The American version shares the weak foolish plots, but filling is so much thicker, sexier and suspicious, dear. <br /> <br /> Some people describe weak comedy as "delicate comedy". . <br /> <br /> This is a gentle spy hour, which is exactly the opposite of John Le Carre's creation. <br /> <br /> Give me Smiley every day.
