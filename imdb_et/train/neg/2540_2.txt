I thought I had seen this movie twice. Then I read all the other comments and they didn't match. A man and three young students, two girls and a boy, are visiting this city to explore alleged bigfoot observations. I am still quite confident that this is the film I saw, despite the differences in the review. That's why I put my review back: if you like a casual "B" movie, return to Boggy Creek. Whether it's set to sleep, and nodding to your favorite movie or just with friends. Boggy Creek, the Mute Button and you have fun with the evening healing. Look out! Is the legend true? I think we can just find out with the pain of a non-star. Are there particularly moments in the film in the operation of the equipment? Are our blond, masculine, young heroes hair? Is the exceptionally advanced Technicolor running for the whole movie? You have to look for yourself.
