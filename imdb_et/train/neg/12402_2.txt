I always thought these old Andy Hardy films were a little cynical. A few of them were not bad. Modern film critics are not the ones who prefer a nice and disgusting nice movie like they rarely praise. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I can't protect this movie either. You still have a dated dialogue, but still laugh and capture the story. Looking at it, you shake yourself asking, "How stupid can you be?" It's a cornice if you know what I mean. It's so funny that I can't understand too many people who sit for an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The story is basically "Andy" (Mickey Rooney), who is trying to get out of the jam, because he's making a story of d√©butants from New York, as if it were the ultimate. People were much more social in the old days. You would hear the term "social climber" as the knowledge of rich or beautiful people is the highest achievement you could do. Of course, this is all pointless and seems even more today. <br /> <br /> But it is about the same innocent and clean story and series (half a dozen of those made by Andy Hardy) as you could find. Also, if you want to hear Judy Garland singing, it's your ticket when she sings a few songs here and she goes to Andy's heart. Oh, man, I'll end up almost even in writing!
