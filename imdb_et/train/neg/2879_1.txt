It was the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies. First of all, it's from Kansas that this film has no truth at all. Similarly, they took the name of the BTK and created the rest. Besides, it seems that someone was just $ 20 bucks here and I take a movie and oh yeah, don't worry about btk just for something. Seriously pure dookie no one should ever see this movie. The scenes of killing cows and eating their victims and describing the killing of animals The BTK did not do any of these things, but the film does that God's love does not see this godly movie. TVs are better and more accurate
