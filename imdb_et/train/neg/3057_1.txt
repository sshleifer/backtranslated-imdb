Although "Santa Claus Conquers Mars" is usually referred to as one of the worst films, this Mexican film is so bad from 1959 that "SCCM" looks like "It's a wonderful life". You have to think about what the people who did this movie thought; maybe they meant it as a third world allegory of capitalist greed and conspicuous consumption. Nah. . . They were just not very good. The same manufacturing company made an even more worrying version of "Little Red Riding Hood", where the wolf's obsession with our heroine is unmistakably clues to pedophilia. (Perhaps this was the "Freeway" inspiration.) Back to "Santa Claus": Instead of the North Pole, Jolly lives in a satellite in orbit of the Earth in the Saint Saint Nicholas ("MST3K" tones); instead of girls, her toys are made by children of the world; and he had experienced spy equipment to check which kids are naughty and nice. The result is like a Orwell space sweat shop. It's enough to turn you off forever. This and other low-rent Mexican children's films were named in English and widely distributed in the US in the early 1960s. No wonder the sixties became such a worrying period in American history. Childhoods who were forced to endure these "family" movies as children would be too eager to turn.
