I bought this adaptation because I liked the Anne BrontÃ« novel when I read it a while ago and usually enjoyed the BBC drama. But I'm very disappointed, I've never thought it would be as bad as: the whole series made me laugh much more than I was moved to the novel. <br /> <br /> First of all, music (and songs) seems to be completely vague in the periodic drama (it sounds like it was written for today's horror film), and like the other commentator, I was particularly annoyed how the cameras rotate around and turned around. I've seen some scenes that have been filmed in "North and South Estonia", and it seemed there was everything, but the tenant is surely superfluous and just annoying. Camera movement cannot be lively with wood. <br /> <br /> Most other roles were difficult to distinguish first and the script was not clear. No characters occurred correctly. The little boy gave a very good result, he is very cute and the best feature of the movie. He doesn't seem to be able to cry realistically at all. I just couldn't believe Markham could have fallen for him and I don't mention the terrible hair he gave. I couldn't feel some sympathy for my husband! Fancy is married to such a post ... Besides, she was the only main actor who sounded right to me. Toby Stephens I just found OK, Helen Graham's brother was not very good. Perhaps it is difficult to adapt the novel about gloomy issues such as alcoholism and cruelty. Moreover, what the book only depicts and imagines the reader's imagination is to adapt to television: some scenes are both big and comic (as when Huntingdon's eye starts bleeding) and others are too sexual! I mean, do we not get enough modern drama from these bed scenes?
