not your typical vampire story, not the bram stoker or the talent of rice here. a truly original vampyre story. these vampires are genetic mutants that are not disturbed by sunlight. they are pure evil. <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect. many actors are clearly amateurs. two of the van chelsea and vampire chicks are really good. The film is strongly violent, which can disturb people. it is also loaded with scientific detail that many find it difficult to understand and get bored. I was sold wisely and in a few good steps. does not say how successful this film could be if they had a bigger budget and got a mass distribution
