I'm glad some people liked it, but I hated this movie. It had a very good idea, but it ended. It was badly written, badly behaved and badly done. <br /> <br /> It had some interesting plot points, but they just skipped too fast, the writers had to understand what to keep and expand with these bits. like lying, why he was kidnapped, and ditching the ditch. Instead, it was "what's going on?", 5 seconds later they'll tell you. <br /> <br /> This movie was not tense and I missed it from start to finish. I just wanted it to stop. <br /> <br /> Go and rent misery or create the best plans if you want intercourse or twists that will keep you out of the way.
