when we talk about a movie called 'snakes on an airplane', we should note early that snakes are quite important to the plot. <br /> <br /> What we have here is very bad cgi snakes that don't look or move like real snakes. Snakes are scary because they seem to be slippery, they crawl to slip. these snakes do nothing like that. they slip along the video game. they are comics. I would like to say that even someone with a big phobia with real snakes does not find them to be frightening <br /> <br /> why would you want to add extreme close-ups of these cgi failures? why not rely on .. all "less is more" ethics. Or better yet, why not just make them look good? and then maybe you're still using them sparingly. <br /> <br /> Let's look at John's carpenters. here we have real mucus and nervous proportions. 20 years goes by and we get this bunch of sfx crap's "snakes on the plane". when will these people wake up and smell coffee? special effects go back! <br /> <br /> Are you sure you could say .. but the movie is a joke, get it? sure I am with this idea, but do it well! In addition to the above, this film also has a dialogue. and music and sound effects are by no means creepy or memorable. <br /> <br /> I could handle every other actor who is part of this movie, except for Jackson. what did he do there? a man who played 10 years ago in cellulose fiction. is this career progression? do you offer people money for money? no. I would like to know what Tarantino was thinking about when he was half way through the movie stinker <br /> <br />. and Hollywood seems to offer them exactly what they want. when I left the cinema I saw several real fearsome future advertisements, including ... DOA: dead or alive, (second) cgi animal film called the so-called. In addition, I saw terrible trailers, including one (another) mess of British horror / comedy. I really haven't seen the film industry in such a mess as long. <br /> <br /> I expect this movie to be sold in a favorable DVD DVD for 1 month in 6 months. and if you look forward to seeing the black comedy that tons of great looking snakes are looking for, and some bad ass cool dialogue from the samuel l jacksons lips. forget it.
