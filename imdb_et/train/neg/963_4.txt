"Opportunities" is a big mistake. You might want to know about the director Emile Ardolino's 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and wait for her fun. But I think I must disappoint you. He did a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> According to the story Christopher McDonald dies to defeat as a child. The child is growing up Robert Downey Jr. and Jr return his former hometown where he meets his former daughter Mary Stuart Masterson (complex, which?). <br /> <br /> They love each other. Then Jr ex-wife Cybill Shepherd appears and Jr loves her. I don't even have to mention that he loves Ryan O'Neil. <br /> <br /> In one of his first roles, Robert Downey Jr is at his worst. He copies Michael J Fox. <br /> <br /> After "Moonlighting" shepherd proves that she is not suitable for acting in movies. <br /> <br /> Anyway, one thing this unusual comedy can use is insomnia.
