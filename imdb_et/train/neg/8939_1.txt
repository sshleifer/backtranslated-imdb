Yes, I saw rough cuts. Unedited sex scenes. Shiny cut scenes. Almost equally with the movie "Need" for terrible action. This movie is so bad as bad movies are a bad script, bad performance, bad effects, bad places, bad stunts bad everything. The best actors in the movie were the dancers of the child they were hired as vampire supplements! <br /> <br /> Sean Harry, who is a "foppish actor", when someone else puts it, will make the toy gifted. His amazing ability to drive a car when it is obviously shaken by the hood (check the reflection of the windscreen), his inability to turn left, which is a class. Oh, and don't forget the sex scene. plus its remarkable use of toy weapon, which props boys could not even bother to hide as a real weapon. The other participants on the screen could hardly offer their features. It would be half the time they waited for the line that wasn't there! <br /> <br /> "Special Effects" were so good that the guys who did this took their real names off the credit! <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh at the party, rent this movie ... then there are many good comedies that are just as funny and don't give money to people who don't deserve it.
