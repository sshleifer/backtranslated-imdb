It took time to watch this movie. I don't like science fiction. I don't allow any genre by itself because good work can be done in every genre. However, this film is not a good job. I can't blame the visuals (if foreigners aren't involved) and the special effects are impressive. The story was not called for BAD, a track for the comic book. But fx-visuals were probably where all the interests / attention / money of the makers went. The direction varies between slow and confusing (one was not sure who exactly what and what and to whom at least one important step did). "Working" was mostly very bad. There was no reason to read most of the lines besides the hint "It was on the page and the director told me that I had to be crazy / sad / scared / whatever. Okay, so it was a SF series pilot. Since then, it has been an excuse for liberating mercy in areas where it should be seen as an important part of dramatic media. I'm surprised that the pilot sold this series, or is the money in the technician?
