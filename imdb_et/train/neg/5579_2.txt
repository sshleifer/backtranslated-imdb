The 60s is an occasional entertaining film, most of which is laughing on film. It is extremely uneven and contains many annoying elements. Take the black-and-white switch, for example. If done correctly, it would have been quite effective, but because it was done badly, it became unpleasant and only bad experience; much of the film seemed to him a strange feeling. The action was not very bad for a television shot, but again it was sometimes embarrassing. Many events were not coherent and were confusing. How did this family somehow reach the major events of the 1960s? The end was too much for my taste. because it was hollywood, everything had to be sorted out. I advise you not to waste time in the 60s and do something different with your time. I'm glad I watched it in class, not my time. I think I can say for sure that the best part of the movie was the involvement of Bob Dylan's music. These are just my thoughts on the flick. I hope you take my advice and stay away from it.
