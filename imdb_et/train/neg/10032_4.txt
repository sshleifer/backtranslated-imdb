The story was okay. Akshay Kumar was always good and it was the only good movie. Kareena Kapoor looked bad. There was a tone and cry in his zero, but he didn't look good. I don't know why Hell made Anil Kapoor such a bad role. There wasn't much to do in the movie. Just because it is Yashraj, it does not mean that the actor should assume that role, even though it is bad. Said Ali khan was fine. I think it is high time for Indian directors and producers to think about Indian clients as an intelligent party. What are we? fools !! What they think, they show 2 men who take the SWAT team and we believe them. Is the Indian police so stupid that they are trying to steal some criminals ... they take a 100-seat police officer and no one was around the palace. The activity was nasty and I've never seen such a bad thing. Akshay Kumar was between 30 and 40 police officers. No police officer touched him, but he killed all the police officers. Crap. CRAP. <br /> <br /> I think the fighter who thought this scene should retire.
