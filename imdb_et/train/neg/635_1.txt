Luise Rainer got the Oscar for good country results. Unfortunately, his role was not needed. She didn't say much and looked pale throughout the film. Luise's character was a slave, which then gave Paul Muni a character (she did a fantastic job for her performance). Both actors in ancient Asia were not Asian but very convincing in their roles. I hope Paul Muni got his Oscar for his performance because that's what Luise needs to get for his Oscar. He must be a breakthrough actor, one of the first methods. This seems to be something Hollywood often does. Al Pacino has played Italian and Cuban. I felt Luise's performance was weak all the time, and when she died she didn't change any of the previous scene's expression. He remained the same for the whole movie; she changed her expression or emotions only twice. If his brilliant behavior was so subtle, I didn't see it.
