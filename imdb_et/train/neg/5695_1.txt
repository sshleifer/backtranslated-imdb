This movie is described as an action / comedy. The first 15 minutes and the presence of James Belush indicate that this is a humorous gangster film. <br /> <br /> However, the introduction of a ridiculous female cord begins with a number of ridiculous plots that do not obscure the hidden end. The film moves between comedy (using the description loosely) and the surreal drama where some context has been removed from the adult scene. The leader (the title angel) has been badly acting and the actor does not help the script, which requires some incredible, extreme lines of portrayal. James Belushi is the only one who is going to handle his part well, but he also gives up the poor script. One to avoid.
