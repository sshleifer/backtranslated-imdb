In short, this film is totally worthless. <br /> <br /> The idea is to make a movie about what someone from the beginning of the 1900s could think about the future. An interesting idea, but the lack of compelling stories or signs prevents us from ever stopping our beliefs, so the idea just flips. <br /> <br /> Probably the whole movie is done with actors in front of green screens and we should be impressed. But as a graphic person, the cushioning was a clear crowd to hide the problem of a hard sharp edge by green screening. The paint should be washed mainly with the exception of visual quality reduction. And I don't understand why somebody should be present in this movie to be somehow breaking. If anything, ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar to really bad graphics - they won't even measure the ancient Jurassic Park graphics. Robotic models were so simple, simple and very compact. This island had a number of strange prehistoric animals, but they have not been explained in any way. <br /> <br /> The story is daunting. Actually, I can't believe I'm just not out of this movie. The relationship between Polly and Joe is unmotivated and mistrust and deception all over the film. Why does Morris Paley's character even exist? We are not convinced that Joe is heroic - I mean he's flying by plane and saved one person (Polly) for personal reasons. Yes, you have a big hero. Dex has very little screen time, so why should we take care of Joe who wants to save her? Who was Nepalease who locked Joe and Polly's mine house and why did they do it (remembering that the whole Totenkopf operation was robotic)? (Significant decline in his great character in The Crow) stopped the robots who had taken Joe? They were looking for vials and couldn't find them. (2) Why would Dex be busy in hell, but not killed (he doesn't know or know what the vials are, and the bad guys didn't know Polly had the vials and joined Joe and Dex)? (3) Polly shows that "they" don't know anything about Totenkopf, but he has a secret source about him that contains a pretty FBI-style file for him. (4) An empty place on the map described by Nepal - if they know this mysterious area, why is hell in this place empty? (5) At one point, Polly and Joe will have to give up their clothes (they are burnt) - Joe will be given new clothes identical to her old clothes, but Polly will be forced to wear some very strange clothes, while Polly's original clothes are in the order of continuity. back. <br /> <br /> * sighs *. How far should I change my brain to watch this mess? <br /> <br /> We need to be enthusiastic about the music produced, even if nothing interesting or far-fetched on the screen. <Br /> <br /> And the actor? Should we have impressed a lot of bad British accents? Which sign is not annoying? I think the Ling Bai dialogue was probably the best in the film (he doesn't have one line). The dialogue was not in the camp and did not even reach the level of cheese. It's just bad and tedious. These people are not heroes or compassionate; they are people you try to ignore or divorce if you have ever failed to meet their real life. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this movie gets an average rating here in IMDb. IMHO should compete with "Batman Forever" all the time, out of 100.
