This collection really sucks! <br /> <br /> I rented it, I thought I would really enjoy good fighting. Man suck it! Rapidly flashy cuts, extremely annoying speakers and struggles themselves were heavily edited and shortened (I mean especially Jet Li in the fight for legend fists and Jackie Chani's fight for drunken master 2). > <br /> And what about dealing with street fighters?! What is so "cool"? I have seen more interesting struggles against the right to fight! <br /> <br /> This is a collection of foolish cuts for fools. <br /> <br /> Never buy this movie! Don't encourage those people who did this mess to do more! <br /> <br /> Instead, go to the movies where the fighting came and fight for your uncut glory!
