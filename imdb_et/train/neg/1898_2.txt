H.B. Halick's classic seventies chase movie is just terrible. With a point of disappearance, Gone in 60 Seconds represent a representative car movie. The remake takes the original and stands on it. When Halick gave us a 75% car and 25% drama, then in GISS 2000 we get 25% car and 75% drama. Cage as a super man, rescues his brother, kisses the girl. MTV changes, tits and ass. Save your money, rent the original. At least Halick didn't live to see his child (he wrote, produced, staged, and celebrated '74' in the film) in such a way.
