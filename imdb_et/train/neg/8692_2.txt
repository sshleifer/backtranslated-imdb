I think Elisabeth Rohm, although she can try hard, is not very good at all. I think that was the only budget they received for that price. I looked at it mainly for Myron Natwick's performance, whose work I know very well. <br /> <br /> He was the most credible and undoubtedly the most weighty watch. If he wasn't on the screen, the thing went dead. It was filmed in Vancouver. He gave me a slip, but be sure he is a kind, funny, compassionate man in real life. He even said that playing this role gave him a slip. <br /> <br /> I look at her, but Elisabeth Rohm - never. He was as exciting as the tape on the law and the floor. Maybe a very nice person, but not an actor.
