Imagine, if Hitchcock scientists and experts find themselves, the talk of the masters' big films, such as "North By Northwest" or "Strangers On A Train", but less known efforts like this in 1931, hidden and seriously flawed Emily and Fred Hill (Joan Barry and Harry Kendall) are the mid-class London couple who are staying ahead. He scares their lot; he accepts it. The change is happening by the letter of the uncle, saying that he will put them up so that they can enjoy the life of globetrootic luxury. They make plans for a world cruise. But their problems have just begun. Ask Richard Hannay, Roger O. Thornhill or Marion Crane. Well, Marion is currently inappropriate, but you get that idea. Travel and Hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight, which sets the best dangerous journey. This is probably Hitchcock's upcoming topic, not his most successful or memorable one. Hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element, in this case, rather than a home drama, but two are not at least in one place. <br /> <br /> Mountains are boring, flat, without chemistry or personality. If they find themselves in Folies Berg√®re, which is a cut material that is ten years older than this film, they are ridiculous for female performers. "The curtain has risen too fast!" Emily shouts. "They're not dressed." <br /> <br /> When the mountains drift on an ocean cruise, mercy seems to kill more than a tragic thing, even if the people they partner with are drops, too. Emily's man, Gordon (Percy Marmont), carries photos around him with the empty chairs he wants to fill Emily. Fred's "Princess" (Betty Amann) holds Clara Bow's eyes and Wallace Beery's five shadows. There's also a reluctant traveler, a terrifying spinster, always represented by Hitchcock with a cartoon horn. The fineness was still coming. <br /> <br /> Everything is shot with a sudden, confusing and tense dialogue. Hitchcock catches Fred and his umbrella early on comedy that doesn't come out, and Kendall seems to be trying to laugh while Berry plays tears. When Fred and Emily interrupt, they are seen worshiped with a pair of wedges, one of many sympathetic attempts. <br /> <br /> Emily is the only vaguely sympathetic character, partly because she cares about her husband and agonizes her attitude to Gordon, but mostly because she is among the first Hitchcock's many magnetic blondes, her platinum circles are whipping her face around like Botticell's Chinese junk on an open deck near the movie's conclusion. > <br /> The main characters in a dangerous situation have to be signed to cope and presumably improve their relationship. Only they are not active participants in the resolution, and apart from the fate of a friendly cat, nothing ends with the final resonance. <br /> <br /> At least you'll get some enjoyable views of London in the early 1930s and the chance to see Hitchcock when he was still working for food. "Rich and Strange" is Hitchcock, who pays his fees and learns his trade, one for scientists, but not for visitors to casual movies.
