The film begins with a promise, but remains too long for a sepia world from alienation. We have been hanging, but nothing else will save the fun of the grave and meaningless men's faces. Certainly there is no rope attached to the wall that would help us climb. It is a disgrace because the concept is not unreasonable. as claustrophobic beyond imagination. This loss of presence in the real world is rather too obvious and unnecessarily contradictory to the fact that the son is involved in the armed forces. Why not circus, so we can at least evaluate some color? We have an unfortunate feeling, but unfortunately, enlightenment, which is confusing because of the film, is clearly not something we can all achieve.
