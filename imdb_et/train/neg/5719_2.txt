This movie is very similar to the Hostel, except when it comes to * BAD * and not much aisle. Gore elements exist, but you don't know anything about the characters, so violence is not very effective. Some parts are just strange ... like to force the snake down the throat. What is it about? Should it be scary or gory? It's just stupid. As far as torture is concerned, there is really nothing (except that a man who bounces at first, which they still do not show). The main bad man says they are doing death slowly, but the butcher is killing them all very quickly. Deaths are all relatively fast. Yes, I watched the "Unrated" version. So, in general, not the worst gore movie I've seen, but not at all good. You miss something when you skip it.
