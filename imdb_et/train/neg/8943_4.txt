John Wayne & Albert Dekker competes for oil rights on Indian territory and Martha Scot's attention in this republic. An American movie from Utah. its more modern location where Wayne & Dekker plays Western old and new factions. It is based on Thomson Burtis, who writes the script with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell manages his career in the right way. Indeed, the daily story is actually recorded by the last third, where fortunately the activity is occupied and we are treated like a pulse. The light heartfelt approach to the romantic branch does not sit right and Rogell has destroyed the brilliant fist fight between these two protagonists, as he cannot hide the work that is doing this job. But hey, the stuntmen always deserve the glory of their glory. Strong support from George Gabby. However, despite its better budget, it is still an interesting film for Wayne enthusiasts of the 1940s. 4/10
