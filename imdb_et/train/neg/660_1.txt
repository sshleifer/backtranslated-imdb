Good Grief I can't even describe how bad this film is. Don't do me wrong, I didn't expect much to start with. Let's face it, the PG-13 slasher flick is predefined so it wouldn't be ummm ... slashing so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore. But it was the level of incompetence and clich√© in every aspect of this film that really blew me out. <br /> <br /> We have a protagonist who is just so useless that you find yourself rooting for a bad boy. And here is the accumulation of letters ... IF NOT CHANGED - thus violating the basic rule of screen writing - character development. If you think that at the end of this movie a poor little girl is going around and finally hitting some ass, think again. <br /> <br /> In addition, we are probably giving the least intriguing (and certainly the least frightening) killer ever to the genre. I'm not kidding when I say Dora Explorer has more movies than this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, since all the tensions or rewards are lost (and probably thirteen years old), what could be left to complete the 2-hour screen? <br /> <br /> Cabinets, that's it. Many and many lockers: large closets, small closets, mirrored cabinets, Narnia closets, so many fucking lockers that you don't want to wear for another year. In fact, this movie was just called "CLOSET" and had a picture of a big scary DVD box. On the back could have been a photo of the audience who is sleeping, and Roger's and Ebert's quotation - something like that: "what f * @!
