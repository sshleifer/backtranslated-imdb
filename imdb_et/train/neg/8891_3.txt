Just the most well-known of all Shakespeare games, it has dropped seriously here. Dirty direction, stalled studio work, and insecure performances violate the tragic tragedy. <br /> <br /> In Verona, Capulets and Montagues have been bothering for years, but Rome (Patrick Rycart) is about to be tragedy. Montague, falls in love with Juliet (Rebecca Saire), Capulet. Bleeding will soon break out ... <br /> <br /> Studio work, especially during the day, will seriously stagnate the energy of the games. This is a story that deserves to be shot off with this energy. Together, the costumes are outraged, too many tights and ridiculous codes. The production struggle is terrible, stretching too much and rolling to be interesting. Patrick Ryecart is too light to be a truly effective Romeo. He controls the intensity of character when the plot goes, but his big accents and blissful, often unlikely eyes limit his scope. For the audience, it's very difficult to communicate with Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too young to be a good Julia - she captures the character's naivety, but a little more sassiness would have been appreciated. <br /> <br /> Supporting roles are not much better. Joseph O'Connor's soldier Laurence is good, but too many of his best lines have been cut. Anthony Andrews' Mercutio belongs to the stage and not to the camera. She burns and moves too much and, as a result, looks pretty ridiculous. Alan Rickman, who plays his role, lacks practically Tybalt. He developed the edge and intensity to provide some fine screen presentations in later years, but this is not the proof here. The prince may have a subtle role in his short performance, but the actor Lawrence Naismith does not give the camera a part of it. Only Micheal Hordern, apparently for his best role in this series, deserves this dignity. His Capulet is well played and a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> See another version of this story.
