Just a stupid old movie. The first son of Stanwycki gets his feet really stupid, and then his wife gets his leg again stupid. In an attempt to save him, Stanwyck is again unhappy and found himself fled. He has the chance to kill him, but he is not very buggy. Finally, his wife is rescued and Stanwyck tells us through the story what is the stupid message of the movie. Everything is fine when the fool ends. <br /> <br /> I could never figure out how a nasty woman like Stanwyck made this Hollywood glamor-oriented Golden Era a leading woman; that nose is so beautiful? So photogenic? The film is lovingly short, lasting just over an hour. It would be as if the director had felt that he was making a mess so he thought it was short.
