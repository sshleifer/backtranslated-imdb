The assumption of this anticipated stage was really good and after the great success was very much anticipated. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and unfair. Situations are dark and well-founded, and acting is truly terrible. <br /> <br /> This time, there are no pleasant characters or violins, unlike the remake. Nor is gore so abundant and, if it does, it is really bad. <br /> <br /> Violence is minimal and it is disgraceful because there are many arguments that make you think there is room for violence. I mean, there is a SWAT team that heats the cannibal mutant family. You are definitely waiting for something else! When I watched it in the movies, I wanted my money back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a clear example of how hurried movies turn out to be confusing and show poor quality in all aspects. <br /> <br /> The confusion that left me with remake fans. That is why the after-results are never welcome; at least this movie is not as terrible as 1985.
