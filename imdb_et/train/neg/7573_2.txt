This film is for the vehicle of the Schwarzenegger clone Alexander Nevski. His charisma, however, is not enough to lift this film over the poor script level. He has little to add to his Arnie work. <br /> <br /> Michael York is quite pathetic as begging. Looking at her again from her D'Artagnan act, since she was a better actor, she made me worried. Come on, you can do it better! <br /> <br /> The story is full of holes and unexplained relationships; the title of this bill is Vlad, who sounds like an American woman, but the context seems to work for the Russian government department. <br /> <br /> Although the story goes well after the Communist regime, all Russian characters are still very communist. In contrast, Vlad is allowed to drive a police car to the entire utility vehicle. Action scenes are poorly captured and therefore lack dynamics. <br /> <br /> Cannot See Movie ...
