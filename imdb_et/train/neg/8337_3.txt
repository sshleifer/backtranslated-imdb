Millie is the juice. She marries a rich man with Maitland and has a child. He then tries to deceive him and divorce him ... but lets him keep the child he loves. Then, in the early 1930s, there would have been a right to get hefty spouses and babysitters, but let the boy be amazingly simple ... without support ... what juice! Later, if he has a boy and his life looks pretty good, it turns out he is deceiving! Wow, he's having to choose heavy men. <br /> <br /> As a result of these bad relationships, Millie becomes. Now she's a wild party girl - doing everything she can to crush her for her luck. Suddenly, several years pass. Which daughter she left early in the film is now 17 years old and strange fashion hasn't changed. What old husband (yes, this is another evil man!) Is pretending to be his daughter's friend, but she has very kind images about her. Millie promises her that when she touches a girl she kills. Take a wild guess what happens next! In general, the film is confusing and often a strange mess - a bit like "Mrs. X" but much less focused. So Millie's motivations and actions often seem to be pointless. And the film probably has little to do with it - as long as it confirms the perception that all men are pigs. Unusual, but not particularly good.
