One of Scorsese's worst. The average thriller; the only thing to recommend is De Niro play psycho. Typically, Finale has this genre, that is, all over, with another almost invincible, immune-analgesic. I didn't like the original of the 60s, and this version wasn't much improved in this respect. I have no idea why Scorsese was wasting his time. And again, considering how bad his last films have been (I refer to his dumb Buddhist film and all those who have their new favorite actor, blonde girl Di Caprio), this is not even so bad compared. And since Spielberg wanted to do this, it could have been much worse.
