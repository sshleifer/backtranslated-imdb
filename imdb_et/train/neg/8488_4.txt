Virtual reality, the potential of computers, communicating with the past, the continuing struggle to express one's identity in a limiting society, and the exciting Ada Byron Lovelace, represented by exciting Tilda Swinton, should have been great. But it's weak, terrible when you consider the potential! Deviations by Tilda Swinton and Karen Black can withstand frightening. Building a plot is inconvenient to say - a modern programmer is a boring one-time sign, but half of the film is spent on creating his character, and when Ada finally appears, he is telling about his life's events, not presenting an interesting story (Swinton almost pulls it off). You never know him as a real person, but you know the icon of grad graduate paper. <br /> <br /> Digital effects like a digital dog and bird are bad and annoying given that it was 1997 and not 1985. And finally, the script is just bad. Bad, often pretentious dialogue - especially fighting between the programmer and his boy, which made me tough - cold and distant characters, and a zero attempt to create a mindset. The programmer successfully contacts the person in the past! Amazing! But that hardly seems to surprise anyone and his boyfriend says, "Well, be careful." (Although we have no idea in any way why this may be dangerous, and it never seems dangerous.) <br /> <br /> Also, despite being computers and Ada Lovelac and her love of math, it is not clear that no one is involved with a script on mathematics or computers - all the references to these topics have come up with such a perfect mumbo jumbo that violates any suspicion of belief. <br /> <br /> One scene, the end of the movie, is pretty good, Tilda Swinton's monologue, expressing his sadness for the weakness of life, but his joy in this life. Poignant, passionate and insightful, seems to have fallen into another movie. <br /> <br /> So I'm disappointed in this movie because it's a lost opportunity for an exciting little cult movie. If you find the topic interesting, you might want to rent it, but warn it. See Orlando for a second, much better study of gender roles in history with the great performance of Tilda Swinton. <br /> <br /> Spoiler / Question: * * <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Ada asks that her memories be kept (which I thought was the best scene in the movie). But now it seems that today's programmer does it anyway, carrying memories with his little girl (hence the title of the movie). Am I adjusting that the programmer violated Ada's wishes without even fighting it? Or is it another confusing plot that I have misinterpreted?
