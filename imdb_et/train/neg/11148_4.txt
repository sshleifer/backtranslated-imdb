This is an example of a low budget that won what would be a good story. We'll return Samaire Armstrong (having seen his work in OC, I know he can do better), then find a better script and budget. <br /> <br /> Special effects were so bad and mostly badly computer-generated that he almost lost me when the wolf was visible on the screen. And Samaire Armstrong (attentive!) Turned into a werewolf, first reducing him to a bad GCIF indicator before he even changed (Final Fantasy people, like Pixari, are ridiculous, think this figure is naked Barbie Doll). <br /> <br /> The story was interesting, although the idea of ​​blood pressure in werewolves is nothing new. If it also fell between the end of evil (maybe) not the possible end of evil as well as the human type, these two lines should match. The sub-block of the "Linear Book of Werewolves", which for some time had some other character, was effective but could have been expanded to explain what has happened in the past. <br /> <br /> Bring a better script and direction and I'll be back again.
