Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were as big as usual. Ritter wasn't bad either. What his name was as usual as usual. It could have been a good movie. The plot was terrible. It was completely predictable, tritical and boring. After the first 15 minutes, the rest of the film was placed in the routine of the child's color. The characters were pieces of chopped board. There was nothing new or interesting to say, and it completely outweighed what was wrong. <br /> <br /> Finally, a bad script writer was not a victim. Especially with "incorrect" lines that were absolutely unbelievable for the child. <br /> <br /> Again, this is just what prevented a much lower score.
