Really shows that hype is not all. Shows and what is the abhishek of the devil actor and only receives movies for his father and his wife. Amitabh is always sure. Ajay Devgan as always is shit and useless and a new man is a joke. Leading lady is a waste of the actor. Such a pathetic film about such an honorable director and such a big industry. For such movies, I've reduced the number of Bollywood movies I watch. <br /> <br /> For some time now, RGV has made very foolish films. Time to get different participants. Hrithek anyone? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajoli back. Every other leading lady wants to be a half-brother. Pffffft.
