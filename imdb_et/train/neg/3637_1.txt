I am surprised at the positive comments of the Uninspirit movie. <br /> <br /> For foreign films, I often leave comments that complain about the slow pace and the obvious "lack of action" because many of the best international films are not sticking to the West Hollywood cinematic storyline. <br /> <br /> I often enjoy an abundant movie scene and a lack of clich√©. I like that many foreign films do not tie things with a clean delicious little belt. <br /> <br /> This particular film did not offer any redemption value during the time I watched it. No substantive character development, no interesting story, no way to emotionally participate in any of the characters on the screen. Synopsis: Emotionally immature affluent prejudices colonials treat their slaves poorly and a little girl gets into her only friend when the "house-boy" finally arrives and takes her abuse on her. <br /> <br /> Although the above paragraph is amazing and dramatic, this movie is worn at the time of the screenplay. I was so relaxed that it took three sessions to complete it, and I wouldn't even have done it if it wasn't for positive evaluations. <br /> <br /> If you have no academic interest in this period, I strongly recommend that you clarify it.
