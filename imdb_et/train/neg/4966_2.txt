I understand that this film is made with a very small budget, but it is not an excuse for Grendel's monsterism. Deathstalker, the fire throne, the barbaric queen, the conquest, the Invincible Barbarian were all done when they made the budget and the poor special effects, but they managed to create a cult classic by adding somewhat covered women warriors and a good sense of humor. Primitive costumes, dark castles and a beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the chance to be a very good low-budget sword and witch film, but the creators destroyed this opportunity using the totally bad CGI effect and colorless characters. Compare this movie to Beowulf (1999). It may not be Citizen Kane, but it is a good example of how an entertaining, low budget sci-fi / adventure movie can be done using reliable special effects and tempting signs.
