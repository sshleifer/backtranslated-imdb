I'm sorry to say that this movie is really bad. It reminds me of a c-class porn movie with one big difference: no porn. <br /> <br /> The story and dialogue require a complete review. Perhaps bad behavior would not have been so noticeable. At least we should have speeded up the pickup. <br /> <br /> Although I agree that it had a small budget and the director did a good job visually, considering how little resources he had, he would have had to spend more on the story or better, yet someone writes it. Many action scenes were just pointless. <br /> <br /> It was a complete waste of my time.
