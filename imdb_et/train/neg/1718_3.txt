I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and it's definitely more accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version because of its costumes and localizing the real photos of the echo. Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actor looks exactly the same as the photos taken on Blanche's day, dying over his dying wife. But this movie is still in Hollywood, and our anti-heroes will end up pretty much, even after the holes are full (in life, Bonnie burned badly in a car crash a year before his famous shadow and didn't look like a surprising cheerleader at his death). The script is annoying and acting is bad, especially for managers. Very disappointing. Stay with Beatty and Dunaway. They may not be a "real story", but it is a great movie.
