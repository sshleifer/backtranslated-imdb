Squeamish 11-year-old Luke Benward (as Billy "Worm Boy" Forrester) moves to a new city. In their new school, young Benwardi pick up other boys. They put the worms in their thermos. Benhi comes under the control of his worm reflex, pushing a dwarf into the dwarf Adam Hicks (like Joe Guire). Benward betting can be eaten by 10 worms in one day - no return! <br /> <br /> High, teased Hallie Kate Eisenberg (as Erika "Erk" Tansy) uses her archery skills to help Benward. Director and former SCTV writer Bob Dolman promises: "No worms were damaged when making this movie." In a related note, the SCTV star Andrea Martin has one funny scene. "How to cook fried worms" is based on Thomas Rockwell's popular novel. Girls who are pre-earning children need to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> **** How to Eat Fried Worms (25.08.2006) Bob Dolman ~ Luke Benward, Adam Hicks, Hallie Kate Eisenberg, Alexander Gould
