My comment is the Russian version of Space Race called Bitva za Kosmos, which is shown on Russia's first channel on April 10-13, 2006. A bad translation could have destroyed some details, but I doubt it is so. The number of factual errors is such that it is impossible to list them, especially in the first episode (development of the first missiles). Even the US side of the film has several flaws and shortcomings. The viewer is not talking about launching the US V-2 / A-4. Three different Jupiter C rockets are launched with the same serial number "UE". Apollo 1 opens to the moon, etc. On the Russian side, every person is ridiculous. Korolev is afraid of NKVD, Glushko is a saboteur and a traitor, Mishin is alcoholic and so on. no motivation, no life at all. Uniforms and decorations are terrible. Gagarin sings a frivolous song waiting to be launched (I think it was specifically designed for the Russian version).
