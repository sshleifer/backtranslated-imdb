This is the worst brain damage, very cheap, super stupid, stupid, meaningless garbage I've ever seen, incredible rubbish among exclusive cult status, among fans. If you think Ed Wood's "Plan 9" is bad, then ... let me tell you that it looks like "Citizen Kane". Â¿Special Effects ... ... "Plan 9" is "Star Wars". Ing Acting? ... Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... so it's far from bad. But if you are looking for such incredible movies then this is for you! I'm a fan of American International for so many brilliant horror movies, Price-Corman-Poe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff, but with "Star Creatures" they are down to Z-level. Of course, my 1 in 10 works the opposite if you want to watch fun movies (a man who plays the Indian chief is great) so have fun and enjoy ... if you can.
