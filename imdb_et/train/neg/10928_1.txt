Just saw this movie and the waste of time. The film was predictable and slow. Basically, this is the bad news of Mormon that plays the sanctuary of sanctuary in the church. Instead of watching this movie, I would have had a root channel. Kayak performances were probably guided by sponsorship / funding. This film had the potential due to the outrageous behavior that the Mormons showed when playing the sanctioned basketball of the church, but because it was rated PG, the actual nature of the spectacle could not be transferred to the film. Operation is terrible, except Clint Howard and Fred Willard. Thurl Bailey's appearance in the film was totally unnecessary.
