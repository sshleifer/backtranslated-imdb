The feeding of masses in Providence, Rhode Island, is trying to be a satirical look at the role of the media in government. At best, it could be applied to how the US tries to control the media during the Iraq war, but it reaches the cavity. The story is never really tense and never works very well. The worst, the film's direction is terrible, the focus is more on the odd camera corner that can't pass on anything "Isn't this a strange way to keep the camera." The special effects are pretty bad ... at one point the explosion video is green, which is viewed across the city, and at best it is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The film has a few bright spots, namely ads for post-zombie services (including reminder service and party bus). But there is too little to value the movie. <br /> <br /> For a better zombie movie, try Hiding and Sliding. It has the same weak production value, but behind it is a lot smarter, humor and talent.
