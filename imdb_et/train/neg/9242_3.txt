What a fantastic prerequisite: a film about Berlin air transport. It should be all. Tragedy. Excitement. Comrade. Competitors. Berliner Frauleins and tough US pilots. love and tears. What we have is a film that does not have any of the above. Heino Ferch is trying to embody John Wayne, but he can't fail. She works so wood that she should break at any moment. He's trying to be a tough guy to play instead of being a tough guy! Why should Bettina Zimmermann fall in love with her character? Did they throw stones at the lake? Because he brings his coal bricks? SFX is very well done. Too much. Hundreds or so aircraft over Berlin look like an attack-fighter-squadron as organized air transport? as it really was. Interestingly, the White House, the Kremlin and General Lucius D. Clays seem to be all the same and blind. Note the same curtains, hanging the windows deep, as if the protective shield against the nuclear facilities. Why almost every scene is in the dark and dusty? By the way, GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY, comes over a little time, an uncertain, relaxing general who trusts his noble idea of ​​an airlift. He was the opposite. So you combine all these individual mistakes and the result is a movie that has no passion, no intercourse or historical accuracy. Sad, it started so promising?
