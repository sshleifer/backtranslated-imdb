I really want people to do it funny when making comedy. This is a movie that you can sit around, but nothing is special. After seeing it, you say it was fine. It was not boring to look at, but didn't make the audience laugh. Entertainment should mean you get more than o.k. story. This movie wanted to be "Tootsie" but it failed. <br /> <br /> I gave it from 10 to 1.
