I saw it two days before the official opening, and I must say that I was very disappointed. And I have to decide most of these problems under Claire Danes. Depending on what you think of the Danes, he was either terribly unsuccessful or so far off his head that he should be the worst actor for the 2007 Razzie. I think we had to understand him. Instead, it is completely unlikely. Other "big" actors are doing OK work, but certainly not the screen. Of all the "big" actors in this movie, I would say that the best work was Natasha Richardson. Streep is hardly in the picture and it only appears near that tip. <br /> <br /> There is also a terrible scenario. It goes beyond those that read lines as truly essential.
