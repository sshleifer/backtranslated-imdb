The only aspect of this film that saves it from my least favorite cellulose trash is one line spoken by an agent trying to penetrate into human eating tomatoes, dipping tomato costume: "Can anyone go through ketchup?" I strongly recommend that anyone with sleep disorders use this film as sedatives; it works better than demarol overdose.
