It is incredible that it manages to have so many levels terrible. Script, actor, leadership and choice are all terrible. Costumes, kits and pseudo-medieval tongues are also terrible. Strangely enough, I enjoyed this movie when I agreed it wasn't good. It seems a shame that people spend so much time and effort to produce something as poor as they could actually have done something about the assumption (though not very plausible!), But we treat the nausea and cheesy story of dragons and knights missing other such fantasy movies. We just hope the Lord of the Rings is a little better! Oh, and David Thewlis's haircut makes him look like He-Man. It does!
