If I had rented this DVD before Netflix, I would have a few hours back in my life. I am honestly suspicious when I see the film's director writing it. In this case, the same man was a "writer and director" - unfortunately the reference to the overall quality of this production. There were some interesting moments (for example, Judy Tenuta's scene reminded her of an early comedy from routine to Judy-Isimism), which led me to two rather than one. However, these moments were little and far away ... and I could hardly see them, because the opening order was almost incomprehensible to me, not to mention my understanding of violence. I admit that I went to see this part again to see if I had forgotten something that would help me see it all the time. No, although I at least felt these characters were important later. The technique of "Spinning Camera" was overused and essentially meaningless. I found that I was talking on the TV screen: "What ?!" or "For good faith, hold it!" Not recommended.
