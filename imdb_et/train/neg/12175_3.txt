Why watch good movies when you watch "Trancers II?" <br /> <br /> Oh, this movie is so flat. I can just imagine a picture of a L.A and a crew with a video camera, hurling impulses in stupid monster poor, long-suffering Tim Thomerson. The families of the stars really come to play the sticks, probably because Full Moon can't afford the "real" additions. Flat effects, flat sets, and scripts that are so complex, take all the nodes to unlink - it must be classic Trancers! <br /> <br /> And more ... and more ... this rules. Note that this is the same thing I say about "Trancers IV". I say this because it's true. What can win by looking at an old boy in a trench, mowing zombies, then breaking up like "Don't worry about ladies, they're biodegradable"? Well, a lot of things could be better, but anyway it is still good. <br /> <br /> My only remarkable reservation is Megan Ward, who really stinks. She is a terrible rival of Helen Hunt's character - they are both young pieces of eye candy and it would have been more effective if they actually got a little more contrast. Well, you can't get everything. At least a "long second clock" wonderful plot device is back in place and we have more Hap Ashby, the least convincing athlete in cinema history (oh, wait a moment - he has a rival David Ogden Steir's "Creator" form). <br /> <br /> I haven't seen it lately, but I seem to remember that Martine Beswick is running twice in the last battle. Hooray for poor continuity! Just one of the many highlights in this fine movie.
