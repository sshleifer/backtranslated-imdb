This movie was bad. This movie was terrible. Operation was bad. The setting was unrealistic. The story was absurd: the custom that appears once a day is set for one night. Most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. The next morning, everyone, but not a few, will be dust from the comets. People's clothes are still intact, there are still living plants, but people turned to dust. There are no bones, nothing. It's ridiculous. How can radiation burn people but leave their clothes and other biological substances healthy? <br /> <br /> Even better, the comet mutated some people with zombie meat eating monsters. Their makeup wouldn't even have frightened a newborn baby. Insane Clown Posse scares me more ... and they should look stupid. <br /> <br /> Then they were surviving. The people who were surrounded by steel when the comet was gone were zombie-dom and death. How can steel blend in the comet radiation that is supposed to burn people in their tracks? <br /> <br /> The same insult is the 60's horror music that plays a movie in the background through some or 80's hair stones that have no purpose in the movie and makes you shoot your TV. <br /> <br /> The foolish part of the movie is the characters it focuses on: two Valley Girls and Chakotay Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were completely unrealistic. Who would loot the day after the apocalypse race, where the meat would eat everywhere? The whole movie had four 5-minute horror scenes and most of them were dreams. There is a complex dialogue between these scenes that makes South Park intelligent. The silence of elementary dialogue was painful. I could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag with Cheetos. Never see this movie.
