I didn't want to see that much when I saw it. But after Mst3king from JasonX with friends, I was hoping for a similar experience here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie was taken too seriously. Do I care about Jason's problems? Sorry no. There are legion Ft13th films that cover it anyway. At the end of the day, he is another death sentence, I just don't intend to get this sympathy. but, unfortunately, they were little and far away, and at the end of the movie it had deteriorated as the famous anti-death episodes.
