The Spanish fear icon Paul Naschy celebrates this, one of his weakest werewolf movies ... but bears me for a moment. Most people are familiar with the most common television "FROZEN FROZEN" and have had many versions of home video over the years. If you want to be serious, but this is the most effective edition I've seen, it's called "WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS" and it's an unchanged and complete European version that restores a couple of annoying scenes and contains original nude frames that are missing from FURY. Naschy also plays Waldemar Daninski, returned home to Tibet to find out that he has made a werewolf, and that his wife has had a thing. She takes care of her and her lover in the form of animals, but then she becomes a sucker for a sexy woman's doctor and her female assistant. Obviously the doctor "slips" the werewolf and there is a very strange sado-masochistic love between him and his hairy, which is at least his original version of Daninsky, who is under his trance. Ultimately, we get two werewolves for one price because Daninsky fights him with a wolf! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the film is that the director (according to Naschy's claims) was often drunk and the results are indeed rather inconsistent. WOLF MAN NEEDED When copying SLEEPS, it is not that difficult to do what is happening, even though editing remains cruel to the spots. The worst thing is that Naschy's predatory werewolf is immediately inadvertently unsuitable for the last film (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, aka "FRANKENSTEIN BLOODY TERROR") and blended into it without any reasonable reason! The wolf's clothes turn white from black shirt back and forth, as well as his behavior; At one point, the wolf from FURY moves in a hypnotic transmission in a lethargy, next he runs and runs a lot of BLOODY TERROR. Really weird.
