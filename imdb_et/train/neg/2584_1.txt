So, American Pie: The Beta House is the 6th American Pie film. Although it really has nothing to do with the three original American Pie films, except some characters should be involved with the characters of the original trilogy, and Eugene Levy is (does this guy get any better concerts?). <br /> <br /> There's very little compliment to this movie. No funny jokes. Action is a painful look, especially for a "South" accent girl who sounds more like a Canadian call to a British woman claiming she is mountainous using the word "ya'll". This film makes me feel like an idiot. Why didn't I apply for a college where nobody goes to class (but everyone gets good grades), girls take their clothes open, everyone has sexual unprotected sex without the burden of babies and STIs, and you can ejaculate all the photos of the girl without her help? Indeed, this series has lowered soft pornography standards. Maybe for the next couple, they will eventually break and ask Ron Jeremy for leadership. I am sure they can simply associate with the series by removing the third uncle of your character, Stifler, or something like that.
