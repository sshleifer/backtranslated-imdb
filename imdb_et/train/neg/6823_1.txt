I should have trusted my instincts better: No expectations - no frustrations. Instead, I thought I was experiencing the same masterpiece as Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and I was terribly disappointed. In my humble opinion, Powaqqatsi is nothing less than an inexpensive attempt to succeed in his predecessor's cult and - to be artistic - to the people. Some producers seem to have collected Koyaanisqatsi residual material, threw it quickly, put everything in slow motion, and got a pop-entertain under Philip Glass's pseudonym to quickly throw some banal background music that is constantly being repeated. When Koyaanisqatsi changes entertainment quickly and slowly with an observer, Powaqqats' slow slow motion is slow (when you watch them in the quick preview mode of your VCR, you'll see what I mean). But I was most disappointed by Philip Glass's soundtrack. I couldn't - and still - can't believe that the commercially sounding New Age type drives that would have been easily compiled by Casio in the afternoon were the same composer Koyaanisqats' emotional and perfectly synchronized music is great. All in all, it is a great waste of time! My advice: Forget the trade! Check out Koyaanisqatsi again!
