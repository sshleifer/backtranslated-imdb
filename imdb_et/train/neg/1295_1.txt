this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I love Japanese movies and I think the director of the same movie, the electric dragon 80,000, is a masterpiece. I really wanted to like this movie - Asano is a terrible actor and the story was very tempting. but I did not find any such entertainment. <br /> <br /> The film takes forever to happen. and the effect that the director used - such as perpetual percussion and excessive use of slow motion - only added to my growing resentment because the plot was so unnecessarily slow and the actors were terribly over. a lot of boredom was caused by extraneous attachments, which were completely unnecessary - like an hour spent slicing down the shape of a buddha in Asano and proclaiming how he did not worship. it didn't add anything to the plot. Japanese film and I constantly checked the time. we couldn't believe that this movie was as terrible as it was. and the final was terrible. I thought the director would try to pay at least the viewer for being able to sit through it, but unfortunately I was wrong.
