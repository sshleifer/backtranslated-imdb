I'm not sure how they are related, but I'm almost certain that the remake of this movie (or the story behind it) is lost and delirious. A very similar line and even some scenes and sets seem very, very similar. Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie, so look at it anyway. <br /> <br /> It moves very slowly, but at the end of the 1960s it is a French film, that is, expected from style. I said retrospectively from the point of view of a transforming girl from one school. Editing shortcuts with current scenes is a bit confusing at first, especially since the sound of each overlay (ie listening to setbacks while being visible and vice versa). Also "girls" are a bit old to think they are in school. Finally, not a lot of character development even get you attached to the movie.
