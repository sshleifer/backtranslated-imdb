Let's do this. I really get this movie. I get what the writer / manager did. I understand that the dialogue was meant to be dry and emotional. I understand that the plot was supposed to be non-climatic and hidden. That was what the writer / director was leading. Very dry dry humor / comedy. With all this understanding, I think the film is sucked. It seemed that the writer / director was trying to create Napolean Dynamite with this movie. It had all the same features. Even the protagonist acted like Naples. But Napolean Dynamite was actually funny. Its script worked. This movie is not. It has no purpose. Well, let me reformulate it. Its only purpose is to hang Napolean Dynamite and try it out. Too bad it doesn't work.
