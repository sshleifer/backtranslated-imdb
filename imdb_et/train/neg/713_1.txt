I would like to say first of all that I felt so strongly that I started to register with IMDb specifically. And my review? It's just the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie's storyline was interesting - Nazis, hidden, timepieces, etc., but the movie image was not able to bring all these elements together correctly. Remember the South Park episode featuring the manatees who wrote Family Guy using the "idea balls"? Did these manatees also write Unholy? Like the writer, they wanted to incorporate all these different ideas, but they had no idea how to unite them all, and then less to think about doing things, Donnie included Darko-esquire in the end of the theme, formulating a chronology. <br /> <br /> I could say early that this was a bad film. The special effects were too low for the budget when they were better for the DVD. Operation was not great, but in justice I have seen worse. I praise the Nazi paintings, they were horrible, but the evil Nazi butcher was just comic. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against this movie, but frankly I'm not even in the horror genre. But this movie cannot be described as a thriller or drama. If that story was well-said, it would have been a good movie. But it's over-mortgaged. Waaaaay over hyped.
