Back in the day, I remembered seeing the stupid Nintendo Power comics that had the same artwork as this exhibition ... and then came the word that this show was coming near to my TV. I was not aesthetic, but curious ... I was curious about how bad this show was. My friends said that this exhibition had no real meaning and it was too foolish for straight people like me to enjoy (I'm actually gay) so I decided to look at the show with low expectations. <br /> <br /> EXPERIENCE !!!!!!!!!!! First I hate new characters. Tiff and Tuff are so stupid and I hate how many fanboys over Tiff, it's sad. I also hate how they made Chef Kalasaki (or whatever his name was) a good man who had a restaurant. Bad movement, 4Kids TV! Escargon is nothing more than an advisor to King Dede's loser (who sucks a lot of time in this show) and I hate the face of one company that supplies Deded with their terrible weapons to destroy Kirby. So stupid, I hate this play. Then I started Kirby hating even more because it was obvious that Nintendo was just hurt to get Kirby's popularity. Kirby never takes Mario to fight coolness and Kirby is always small, but small, small creams. NUF SAID !!!
