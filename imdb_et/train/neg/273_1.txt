The classic film is that it is aging like a fine red wine. This movie is not Cabarnet or definitely Casablanca. I agree with other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now strikes us at night and the dialogue is clever and preaching. But let's look at the outdated theme of the movie. <br /> <br /> After sixty years of history, wisdom comes. While watching the Rhine, Lillian Hellman's exhibited Bidenesque plagiarism is her "real life story" Julia "from her book" Pentimento ". One of the Republican excuses of the Western USSR makes it obvious that his theme in the game and in the film was to mix America with action to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and international communism by fascists who have just proved their military superiority in Spain. <br /> <br /> As one reviewer rightly pointed out, this American game and film, as Lillian went to his tomb for an American Communist, is not. This film crowns the unfortunate stupidity of the American left-wing intellectual elites, as now the left-wing day of the full moon in Kos and Michael Moore has brought together conspiracy theories and has once again provided relief and comfort to those who destroy America.
