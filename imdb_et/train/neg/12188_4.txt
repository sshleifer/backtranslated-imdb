Although I cannot deny that his films are often entertaining, I have always personally felt that Martin Scorsese has been overestimated in his abilities. The use of his twilight stylistics in many of his films seems to be screaming: "Look at me, am I not an imaginative director?". His best film I saw is the one with the least added prosperity, the ultimate "Raging Bull". <br /> <br /> For this relocation it seems normal. The dull form of the 1950s was so kind to disturb itself. Melodramatic close-ups with the sub-parameter of the classic "Psycho" score are more likely to provoke smiles than atmospheric terror. "Psycho" score was excellently irritating, this "respect" sounds just embarrassing and annoying. Even cast, who may be decent at times, offers hysterical performances that just scream; A remarkable exception is that Lewis is an intelligent appeal to the impressive teenage daughter of the Bowden family. <br /> <br /> The worst offender here is surprisingly De Niro. Of course, he sees the threat threaten, but as soon as he opens his mouth, then aura just drain. Now I'm not an American accent expert, I originally came from England from Manchester, but he would certainly have been able to find a more convincing lunch than that? Being a talented physical actor, he is almost a deadly mistake, but not quite. For me, as a fan of De Niro, it was amazing to me that I would rather have it turned off rather than turning off the screen. <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE SPOILERS.) - The entire top style of the movie goes ridiculously over-crowded. When will Scorses know that under-performance can sometimes cause tension as effectively as visual and sound bombardment? I also thought he was too respectful of the reputation to use the "killer-not-dead-yet" cheap trick that less talented people could use. . Scorsese and De Niro have done much more cooperation.
