This movie really makes you appreciate the fast back and forth button on the remote control. This is a subtle boredom in beautiful pictures. For once Hamilton goes relatively easy with soft focus shots. However, what I did hard to do about the film was that although Anja Schüte was about 19 years old at the time of shooting, the girls are depicted as much younger than they actually were. This whole Lolita thing, especially when an older man is involved, leaves me quite calm. The heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area to make her younger than she is. Come on, sex is a great time - with the consent of adults. The other thing I found strange was that neither Beartil nor Schütte had a naked scene in the film, not at least the right one.
