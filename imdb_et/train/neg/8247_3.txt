Another British romantic comedy that the audience around the world seems to be frightening. This weak effort is an inadvertent parody of the genre - all the classic cliched scenes are ridiculously complicated from misunderstandings to riding after leaving trains to declare their love. Characters are one-dimensional cartoons, with the exception of Love-Hewitt, who is able to bring the film together. When the film progresses, things are out of control in the credibility department; our benevolent suspension of beliefs will eventually come to an end. If you are looking for the experience of Bridget Jones, Notting Hill, you will not find it here.
