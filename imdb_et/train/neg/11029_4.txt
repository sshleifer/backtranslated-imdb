Anyone who visited the 1950s, 60s, and 70s must see a movie or two American International Pictures, a giant Cannon Film distributor of the 1980s. Wherever filmmakers dared, AIP would have the right to offer the latest en vogue titles - in the 50s, horror films like "Voodoo Woman" and "The Undead;" In the 1960s, Frankie Avalon-Annette's Funicello Coastal Comedies and Biker Flicks were like The Glory Stompers; In the 70s, AIP shook through the ground floor level in the trash like "Cannibal Girls" and "Sugar Hill." <br /> <br /> "Dillinger", published in 1973, is one of the biggest AIP efforts, capturing the true spirit of driving; it is one of those uneven supersaturations that satisfied the masses of entertainment, craftsmanship, and common sense. In general, Dillinger is typical for his era: entertaining and worth a few hours, but certainly not memorable. Dillinger was a serious effort and, for a brief, both active and historical fact, the "Dillinger" fair effort was a screenwriter-director John Milius ("Magnum Force"), but certainly left room for his extensive career improvement. <br /> <br /> The 109-minute "Dillinger" - epic AIP range - is followed by FBI Midwest leader Melvin Purvis, played by Academy Award Winner Ben Johnson. Purvis was a researcher looking for revenge for the four FBI agents who were killed in the 1933 Kansas City shadow that helped gangster Frank Nash get rid of the right. In general, the men who allegedly showed it to break, including the expert bank John Dillinger (Warren Oates), Pretty Boy Floyd (Steve Kanaly) and the psychopath Baby Face Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss). Dillinger eventually joined forces with Floyd and Nelson, taking Homer Van Meter (Harry Dean Stanton) and Harry Piertex (Geoffrey Lewis). He also created Billie Frechette (Michelle Phillips), a prostitute of French and Indian origin. For several months in 1934 - 4, Dillinger has basically a tracing film that Purvis's entourage wants to suppress and kill the men of J. Edgar Hoover. <br /> <br /> 'Dillinger' has a documentary feeling, listing dates and places, while Johnson delivers the open narrative to Purvis. Milius keeps an honest look at depression using authentic fashions, cars, weapons and buildings; he also sprinkles black and white photography and gangster shootouts around the film. The film is never boring, moving fast, at random, at a pace. The scenes of action are Dillinger's strength, which Fred Feitshans Jr has edited in his last professional work. Thousands of empty ammunition have to be used to make this movie, not to mention the explosives. This film is certainly not puzzled because people are dead and dropping the whole place. At the same time, violence, while free of charge, somewhat realizes that organized crime is dumped into American life. <br /> <br /> This movie, however, does not exceed its exploitation status, because there is simply no writing required. John Milius, who is somewhat overpriced as a filmmaker, puts too much emphasis on action. Action scenes (mostly blood-filled shootouts) are impressive and comparable to all of this era's major criminal films, including the 1967 Bonnie and Clyde. But we just don't know much about Dillinger and his gang members as people; The vital relationship between Dillinger and Frechette is hardly a couple of meetings at a bar during a scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes later. Melvin Purvis also seems to migrate and get out of the way, becoming a striking feature only when Milius needs a disclaimer. Too often, the film takes a film where its characters could have been studied in detail. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the main crime in the picture is the ignorance of historical fact. While many say that "Dillinger" is just a movie, movies like the one that create fables and make them permanent. Those who know the history of gangsters point out that John Dillinger was not the last of his ring because the Milius scenario and documentary style of the film encourage us to believe. In fact, Dillinger died before Baby Face Nelson and Homer Van Meter; it was also said that he did not carry the gun at his death night or with Billie Frechette. Although these inaccuracies can create a great drama, there is no reason why Milius would not have been able to survive the facts and write a great story around them. <br /> <br /> Warren Oates's Dillinger performance is pretty good, although he sometimes seems convincing. Oates is humorous and beautifully depicts how Dillinger consumed his press with a larger than life image; but we never feel the threat he used during his lifetime. Ben Johnson gives life to Purvis, suave, but rather flat. Michelle Phillips brings emotions to Billie Frechette's character, and it's really too bad that Milius's scenario didn't clarify her relationship with Dillinger. We never learn what drew his cold blood killer into a stereotype that is a lightweight girl who is at risk for men. The roles supporting Kanaly, Dreyfuss, Stanton, Lewis, and briefly appearing in Cloris Leachman are acceptable to such talents. <br /> <br /> In the 1970s, exploiting Dillinger has been devastated by retail prices. That's exactly where I picked up the MGM DVD for $ 4.99. The film is nicely featured on the widescreen (black for driving choices) with subtitles in French and Spanish. Dillinger's theater trailer is delivered as a single. Mostly forgotten, except for gangster fans and car drivers, the film does not require much more for additional materials. It's definitely worth it for fans of the genre. <br /> <br /> ** out of 4 <br /> <br /> Roving Reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr
