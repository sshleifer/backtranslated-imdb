It can be seen in many different ways. This movie sucks, good or just weird. The third one obviously explains this movie. It has strange themes and just a strange plot. So who else, but not Christopher Walken, would play it, no matter how bad, average or even good it is. <br /> <br /> Actress was what to expect from Ben Stiller. Jack Black I've always loved you know what you're sending out of him, but it's not bad. Christopher Walken is always on the wall. She's always enjoyable to watch, no matter how bad the film is. Comedy wise is somewhat funny. This means, of course, that it has its moments (albeit very few), but it can be up here and there, which makes me feel that the film is just laughing, but of course not a good way. <br /> <br /> Leadership was also average. Barry Levinson is a somewhat overrated director and actually didn't do a good job here. This movie seemed to have many more options and it didn't do that. It was only a very medium to make this movie and it didn't work much. <br /> <br /> Writing is the key to good comedy. This probably means that writing here failed. At best it is below average. Given that it has no moments, it was not too terrible. However, there is never anything to say about the film. <br /> <br /> If not for Christopher Walken and this is a silly ridiculous end, I would have given him a lower rating. He is always characteristic of his films. It's just a strange, strange character-containing movie that doesn't really go anywhere. Not terribly terrible, but I wouldn't recommend it because it's a very forgotten movie.
