I'm Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my dad. First of all, I want to say that the story of this movie and the creation of the Amber Alert system are good. But the film itself was badly done and the action was terrible. The biggest problem I had with the film was the other half with Nichole Timmon and Father Glenn Park. The events surrounding this story were not entirely correct. My father was suffering from psychological disturbances at that time and accepted Nicho with no intention of harming him at all. She loved her like a daughter and was under the mentality that she saved her from some kind of damage or neglect that she probably believed she had come from a mother who hadn't turned her over for more than three years, which my father cared for. and summed up that his mother would be silly. The film depicted my father so that he intended to harm him in any way to shape or form. The funny thing is that Nichole had spent several nights sometimes with his parents, while Sharon would have worked or did what he did. The reason my father was originally believed to be violent was because he had items that could be thought of as a weapon for his truck. My father was a landscape designer. The items they regarded as weapons were landscaping tools that he kept in his work. My recommendation is to take this film with a salt blade, it is a good story and based on real events, but the details of the movie (at least Nichole Timmons - part of Glenn Park) are largely inaccurate and represent the director's failure to discover the story by telling the story. The funny thing is that if the director had interviewed some of Sharon's friends who knew the situation, they would have said exactly what I've posted here.
