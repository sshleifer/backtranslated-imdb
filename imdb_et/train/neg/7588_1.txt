Warning for potential viewers: If you are looking for an adaptation of the classic "Most Dangerous Game", look elsewhere. "Seven Wives to Satan" <br /> <br /> only deals superficially with the original work, using the name of Zaroff and having the character of murder people mentioned. <br /> <br /> Some of them may think of some of the following as spoilers. Or not. <br /> <br /> Boris Zaroffi is played by a writer / director Michel Lemoine. When his ancestors hunted men because they were the only crop that was really difficult, the victims of Boris are usually in a situation where they can't defend themselves. The film comes from a scene to a scene where there is almost no clarity. It seems that the director has unsettled and left the viewer suffocatingly boring film. Some individual scenes are somewhat interesting (for example, the sequence of torture shelves), but if the unit does not reflect the film. Viewers who are more interested in <br /> <br /> interesting and semi-attractive actors dressed in different stages can watch the movie. Most likely find that their time is better to use when viewing Mentos ads. <br /> <br /> The side note contained DVDs with fair information about movie history. Obviously, it was banned for several years in his mother tongue in France, which pretty much destroyed any widespread distribution.
