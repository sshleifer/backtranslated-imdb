This movie sucks from beginning to (especially) end. You probably don't go worse, operating, dealing, photography, camera work, etc. It's all bad, very, very bad. <br /> <br /> But this makes it a "big" look, giving you more than enough good laugh. The worse the better! <br /> <br /> I really have no idea what ever these people thought about making this movie. Serious viking movie? The story is ridiculous, it is rather a hidden comedy, like a mafia, also meaningless, but fucking funny. <br /> <br /> And look at the very end of the movie ... gossip.
