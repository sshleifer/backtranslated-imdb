Sly Stallone is hardly the best actor in the world, but compared to her brother Frank ... give these awards now! Mullet haired, mups Frank seems to think that every part he plays requires him to play the role of American / Italian Wise-guy refugee "Godfather." Please, someone makes him an actor "he can refuse!" This movie just smells like a spot, even if it is terrible, Frank still steals the inconvenience. All people compensate for their lack of talent by punishing their ranks and throwing their hands, hugging wildly in the style that went back in silence with the silent movie. <br /> <br /> The plot there is no point in landing meteors and all female female nymphs, but because it is a 15-film certificate, it just means that they dress in their underwear and make the sweat sound like dogs with heat. Eventually, I'm not sure if I lost the will to live long before the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid it as a plague and see the Deep Impact meteor for a reasonable movie that hits the ground. <br /> <br /> NB! Queue: If one female pulls her underwear down, she has her pantyhose / panties under the garter / garter belt, it has arrows over the cord so women can go to the toilet. Maybe a trivial point, but it shows how ugly this movie is when they don't even get that right!
