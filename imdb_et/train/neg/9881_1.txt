Bo Derek's debut film was invisible for eight years? and so it should stay! John Derek was a competent actor, but as a director he is practically an erotic movie Ed Wood? not that it is especially clear given that Bo (atypically athletic dark hair) was only 16 years old when making a movie! John also wrote and photographed it; the latter brings some proper material about the setting of the Greek island against which it is being told? but drawing is pure and the dialogue is cruel! <br /> <br /> The male leader, Peter Hooten, has played with Bo's family: they grew up with a brother and sister, but now their teenagers have discovered they are related to each other (but, as I said, do not expect sexual fireworks!). However, the worst thing is that the protagonists worship everyone through a film that is not only stupid but irritating their reluctance? Hooten wants the distant fishing community to become a modernized seaside resort, and expects the cruise ship to be visible (of course, in the finals); Derek is even nuttier ?? She craves a great antique bathroom! For the record, the couple are married at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Also, non-events are attended by female mayor and photographer lothario who want to make Boist out (and of course, jealous of Hooten's anger). From time to time, without a very good reason, we even take extracts from the screenings of old Hollywood classics in a free movie house, where the whole city puts together (the list of titles shown is MORE [1931])! At the end of the day, although Bo's na√Øve collection is undoubtedly charming, it is not enough to compensate for the overweight and amateurism of the film.
