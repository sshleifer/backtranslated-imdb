After reading the new comment I had to write a review of this movie, saying it was Sidney Poitier's best film. Poitier had just come back over a decade of film making, and she's clearly crazy here. 11 of his films are mentioned in Wikipedia and they do not contain it. 5 of his films are again on the list of AFI's top 100 inspirational films. Berenger and Poitier, the Rube and the City began to hit a dangerous psychopath before crossing the border with Canada. Some comedy attempts in this movie have clearly failed, and Berenger and Poitier's gluing was remarkable and uncomfortable (it wasn't helped by a totally scary script). Kirstie Alley (hostage) was underused and almost ignored when she was on the screen. Some attempts to do a test are done, for example, if you are going to try and guess which of the 5 men on the fishing trip is a murderer (all of them are sticks). I understand this is the whole complaint for most fans. I thought it was and I didn't really want to. <br /> <br /> If you're a Berenger fan, see Sniper (1993), you'll even see that Billy Zane sees his stuff. That's much better. All in all, I'd give Kill a 3/10. It's not bold and for me it's just too easy.
