One of my sister friends gave me this game and it's too fucking hard! It carries the look of a children's game, but you have to learn how to make tons of difficult moves that require your hands to be spun in all kinds of awkward positions, and you have to look for seemingly endless levels of 100 notes, fix your "score"! You also need to find those mysteriously hidden puzzles that require you to make them almost impossible! AND I AM ONLY THREE RELATED !!!!! Maybe, if you don't have a life, they can stay home all the time if you enjoy it, but otherwise keep it! AND NOT FOR SENDING RECOMMENDED CITIZENS - INCREASE BY THEIR HEIGHT!
