So I had low expectations for starting this movie, but it didn't even match those. although some funny parts, even one or two laugh out loud, fell into the terribly short film. the funniest jokes were unexpected and very fast, leaving us sitting there "WTF just happened?" in addition, there were some jokes that just moved on and on. the part where he fell down the mountain was awake. there was also no editing really. there were some bad scene transitions, but it seems to be a style today. It made me laugh, but I wouldn't look at it again, and I'm very glad to wait for it to be rented. give him a chance, you can enjoy it, but don't believe you are a 40 year old virgin or superbad.
