Certainly, this funny guy, Eddie Murphy, has fewer movies about this stupidity kidnapped by a mysterious child, three hundred-year-old dragons and "selected". <br /> <br /> Murphy is "selected". it shows that he is the "best man in the world". The lost and lost child finder turns to a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis) who tells her that she is "chosen" and that her destiny is to find and save the "Golden Child". Because when a child dies, compassion dies with him because he is the bearer of compassion. <br /> <br /> If all of this hocus pocus garbage hasn't ruined it now for you, then it's definitely a movie to begin with. Suffice it to say that the plot is terrible and destroys the whole movie. This is another tool for Murphy's egoistic sense of humor (comedy is not such a great idea for you), the film does not work on many levels. Even Charles Dance, as evil Sardo Numspa, can't do much in court. Very silly and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
