I get a little tired of people who use God's name to abuse to maintain their great views of the world. Well, I do not leave the idea of ​​Armageddon or the advent of anti-Christ, I disagree with the idea that only certain people who live a really good life (they seem to be mostly white Christian children) go to heaven, the rest of us will suffer in a thousand decades of the Earth, just because we weren't good enough. God can be a judge, but I don't think He is going to measure every level of goodness. Give credit to the creator.
