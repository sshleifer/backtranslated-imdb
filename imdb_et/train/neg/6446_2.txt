Western society is fed by the idea that India is a poor country. Such films make these beliefs stronger. Such illustrations make it more difficult for Indians to accept abroad. It was agreed that India is poor and homeless, but why educated people are not represented, if not successful people. <br /> <br /> I totally hated a movie depicting Patrick Swayet as the second mother of Teressa. In my opinion, this film has shown India in a very bad light that gives false perceptions. It is unfair to discuss only one aspect of society. Exactly why people ask me, "When we go to India, can we hire an elephant directly to the airport so we don't have to walk down the road that is full of slag and snakes?" <br /> <br /> Those who want another opinion about contemporary Indian society should look at "Monsoon Wedding."
