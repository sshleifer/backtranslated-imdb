About 4 years ago, this film liked. I look at it over and over again. But now ... I don't. In fact, I think this film would have been great for Mystery Science Theater 3000. It has many commentary-hard actors (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg) and a pretty cheesy plot. My favorite thing is when Culkin rides his bike and gets over the gang and the gang member says, "Hey, Tyler! Where to go? MOON?" See also the classic line, "Do you feel your toes?" <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is better than "Good Son".
