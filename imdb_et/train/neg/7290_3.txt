What a long, drawn, pointless film. I'm sure this film is historically admirable, but entertainment doesn't make that grade. Ralph Fiennes has been in some fantastic films, the English Patient, Schindler's list, but that was hopeless. It doesn't seem to go anywhere, at the beginning his character was so low and it was a surprise that he was amazed that his "sister" would never be interested. Don't worry about renting this movie, buy a copy of English.
