DEATHSTALKER is perfect for B-fantasy film fans; this barely 80-minute filmmaking feature that hecklers can ask - non-existent drawing, terrible action (except for the dirty sounding old lady), ridiculous scripting and script editing, and low-cost basement settings. There are no pleasant or interesting characters (especially lead in some way unattractive) and the participants who have gathered do nothing higher than the F-Class material. If this is not enough, how would the lack of a good plot (which this film has nothing to do) make DEATHSTALKER qualify as a big turkey? I was also offended that women in this film barely serve any purpose other than (1) to be topless and / or little clad; 2) rape; 3) have sex with the hero; 4) all of the above. In addition, the background music is ugly; bizarre electronic noise confusion, cheesy chorus bursts and disgraceful orchestral cacophony. Ear anesthesia and eye numbness, packed with a member to keep one interested, is DEATHSTALKER probably best suited for people who are looking for something to laugh (and believe me, there are many). Otherwise, I would not recommend this 100th class CONAN who would like to be at least someone.
