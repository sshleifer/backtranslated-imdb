The story is absurd and flat, as well as sucking performances and dialogue, it's hard to keep your eyes open. I suggest you get a caffeine friend to wake you up a couple of Gore effects on time. Why are they bringing Alcatraz? In this case, swallowing becomes more and more difficult. Everywhere, I was wondering who the purpose of this movie was? Chall full of lame subplots (like Cannibalism US Army-Captain) It's low quality in every aspect.BTW this movie is forbidden in Germany !!
