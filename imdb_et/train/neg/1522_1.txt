You should know that I am a person who even looks at the worst of the end of the movies, often out of curiosity. I even looked at Leprechaun until I gave my temptation to tear my eyes and hit them. You should also know that this movie was in my VCR less than half an hour before I made a leap for the desperate stop button and interrupted the rental store to put me and as far as possible.
