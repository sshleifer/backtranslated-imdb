I lied to a bed where there was really a cold or flu or whatever. I think maybe I'd kill some of the horror movies that my mother bought me a little while ago. I wish I didn't choose this movie! After I looked at it, I felt still ill and wanted to throw. Afterwords (if I got better) I did some research on Dennis L.Rader and I noticed that there was nothing like Dennis in the movie. I hope nobody will ever watch this movie, but if they ever eat or feel how I felt after I first looked at it. I think you would have a better time for Santa 3. Looking at at least this movie on this site for better reviews.
