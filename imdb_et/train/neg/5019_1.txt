This movie was a waste of time, even rented on DVD. If ultra-fast camera shots get faster, we could also pay $ 20 to get into a washing machine, get a popcorn and watch a dryer spin. Jet Li is so much better. One can only hope that he will never work in the near future to make a new clich√© film like The One. <br /> <br /> If one movie is to be avoided, it is one.
