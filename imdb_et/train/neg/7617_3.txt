This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but Hostel is definitely much worse. This movie is funny and ridiculous as scary. I laughed most of the time when I looked at it. Low quality effects (if you look at it, you understand what I'm talking about and how it is low), the bad actors (I hear them for the first time) and it looks like it has been shot by an amateur camera (so it looks more like a TV show than film). But at least I have had the patience to finish it. Like comedies? Look out. Want horror? Go look at Ju-Oni: The Grudge or another good horror movie. <br /> <br /> When I talk about Diablo's legend, I don't even know if I can classify it for Horror's genre. Just some crap with a small budget. <br /> <br /> I appreciate it in 3 out of 10
