Things I learned from "List". <br /> <br /> A decent operator, a hot girl who can act and Malcom McDowell could not stop this movie from sucking. <br /> <br /> Blockbuster won t give you your money back. <br /> <br /> Even if he reads the script and says "Ugh! Really?!", Malcom McDowell still tries. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington desperately needs to play. <br /> <br /> Hire a writer. <br /> <br /> Jesus hates me too and punishes me to pay $ 5.50 for this movie. <br /> <br /> Movie, you don't end up. Just leave everything inexplicable unresolved to make the audience sleep before the end. Genius. <br /> <br /> Every casual landlord can cure death simply by drawing a cross on the window. So you can make friends. <br /> <br /> Your servant can sing you back. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington still needs action. <br /> <br /> Your roommate hates you and jokes when you bring this movie home. <br /> <br /> Excuses are not accepted.
