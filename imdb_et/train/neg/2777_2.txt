Unfortunately, this has been shown in Star Movies in Thailand in recent weeks. It's a complete garbage. As another member said, this film is a good example of "how not to act". I haven't seen the film behave badly for so long. Actors (can you call them "actresses?") Are absolutely flat and deliver their lines to the dead dog's passion. I would say that in order to really understand how bad it is, you should see a movie ... but it would be like torture. <br /> <br /> I pretend the leading lady offers her lines and the rest of their accents (fake or infertile) are just as terrible. Another actress with a fake British accent was pretty, yes, but the good lord was her terrible terrible. Mix it up with (absent) acting and you have a disaster. She shouldn't have said anything and I could have received her as a beautiful girl. We just got a scene where the lady of the leading lady says, "Really for me?" after him forced to cry. It's ridiculous. No, really, I just laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> Sets and art directors offer some savings on film. Some sets are colored and some scenes are pretty nice (minus actors). <br /> <br /> The lady of the old magic drink? What ?! The second member mentioned the "contemporary" love song in the film. Absolutely unsuitable for a period of about 500 years ago. <br /> <br /> I understand that the film was considered a big budget during Thai production. I would be seriously upset when I was the producer of this movie. Just going to show that money may not necessarily make a good (or even mediocre) movie. <br /> <br /> I'd give the king one out of ten players, but costumes and kits will keep the movie in that rating. 2 out of 10.
