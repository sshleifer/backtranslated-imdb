A cat with a cat is just a face film. Mike Myers, who is a cashier at Kass, is not quite funny and Mike Myers couldn't be worse. This is his worst film he has ever had. The exhibition and the story were just terrible. I mean, how can they make Dr. Seus' most loved stories into a movie and be one of the worst films of all time and such disappointment. I wouldn't have seen this worse movie, maybe Baby Genius. But this movie is just so bad that I don't even describe how badly they did it. Bo Welch should be fired or the writer should. <br /> <br /> Hebrew Views: 0/10 No Stars F
