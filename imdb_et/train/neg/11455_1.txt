First of all, to give you an idea of ​​your taste in the movies ... <br /> <br /> 2007 I enjoyed comedy: Superbad, Knock, Hot Fuzz, Glamor <br /> <br /> Comedy 2007 I Hated: Evan Almighty, Brothers Solomon , good luck Chuck <br /> <br /> I should have followed my first instinct and turned off the "Hot Rod" after getting a 20-minute mark. I knew that this film would never make me laugh. The script is absolutely brutal - I have no idea how this monster in IMDb 6 managed. Anyone who is over 10 years old who enjoys it must have a mental defect. <br /> <br /> It won't go any closer to Will Farrell and it's clear that Andy Samberg won't get any more than a 5 to 10-minute vision on YouTube or SNL. I don't know how they attacked Ian McShane and Isla Fisher in making this movie ... they have to be in debt or something. I came to know that it would be a stupid movie, but I thought it would be at least funny. I didn't speak so much that I smiled. <br /> <br /> I usually don't comment on IMDb movies, but it was so terrible that I just had to warn people. It's only the fourth movie I've seen that I've felt compelled to rate 1/10.
