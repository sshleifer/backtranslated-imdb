Honestly, before I watched this movie, I had heard that many people said this film was shameful. I didn't think Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey had taken roles in this movie and looked at it myself. Probably they were right. I was really disappointed and thought all the time during the film - why I watched this movie in hell. <br /> <br /> Of course, I didn't expect much from Justin because he didn't really belong to a movie / theater business. What about Morgan and Kevin? I couldn't ask myself why they were participating in Edison. Frankly, their roles are quite stupid. <br /> <br /> Well, you might think that if the players suck, I should pay more attention to the story. It's really a story that is the core of the film, but the guys ... trust me ... it's not the movie you want to give. Imagine that a smart assistant (Justin Timberlake) wrote a story against the system while learning how to become a "true" journalist from his boss (Morgan Freeman). All this was supported by an agent who still has a fair place (LL Cool J) and a brilliant researcher (Kevin Spacey). Finally, they won the story of a happy ending of the system. <br /> <br /> Jeez, I couldn't even continue. Recalling the film makes me sick. My advisors, don't look at it! Please save your money and time for another movie.
