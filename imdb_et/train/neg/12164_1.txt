this movie is not good. The first one almost suck, but it was unrealistic that it would be worth watching. It has nothing. don't show anything. There is nothing to talk about. It can almost be television, except for a little nudity and little violence. acting is not very good, nor can i start with a surprise, no surprise, no one. I think it could have been worse, though I don't see how. although it seemed much longer. this is probably a cut version of the movie. I found it at a very affordable price, but it's not worth it yet. : Unfortunate campers get big fat from me 1/10. psif you watch this movie, you are probably a boring and unhappy camper. special features
