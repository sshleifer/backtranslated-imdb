I'm sorry to appreciate the movie with many of my favorite actors, places, and genres, ie Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, D.C. and the political thriller, but The Sentinel really hits low. It's like they were in front of a great idea, signed the right choice and had great city shots and then went on a holiday that allowed the rest of the team to rest. And I wish I could blame it for another blessing from Basinger (not only do I feel he's one of Hollywood's worst actors, but I'm still steaming for more than a decade that he was the only and definitely only bad actor in the movie that beat actress Oscar 'LA Confidential.') But she wasn't the only problem. Sutherland, whom I love like Jack Bauer at '24', plays Jack again. I miss my old "Time to Kill" or "Few Good Men" days. Douglas definitely took the hiatus out of acting and called it. Plot: Somebody, a secret servant, wants the president to die and Douglas is (randomly) framed. Does anyone believe him? In fact, there is no spoiler here: as soon as they reached this sub-block, it is over before you know it. And why does anyone want the president to die? Does it have to occur in the offspring? Too many plot holes, too many doors opened and not closed, and too predictable "Sentinel" is. If you only see one movie a year, you may not know who the mole is, but anyone who is familiar with this type of film or even seen one "Law & Order" episode you know on the first frames. Was it terrible? In fact, cinematography was not good, and despite Sutherland, who plays Jack again, he still has it.
