It may or may not be the worst film ever made by Steve Martin, but it certainly wasn't his best. Obviously, he did so to control the mess. Dreck certainly does not do anything that would increase his reputation as a funny man. What he does not see is that when people go to watch Steve Martin's movie, they are waiting for entertainment, not tears. It is sad that he pulled Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman with him. I don't understand why talented people can't grab the fact that people don't want to see them in bad movies. If you call a movie comedy, it should be funny. It wasn't. Shame on the US military to allow itself to be associated with it. Full Metal Jacket had more smiles than this unfortunate excuse for "service comedy". Surely Phil Silvers runs over his grave.
