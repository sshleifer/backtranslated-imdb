There was a plot on the beast! ;) I've seen fewer films with lots (I don't want to mention Asian movies, but ...). I thought this camera was not bad for the film and the atmosphere was not too bad. Most people have no real reason and how they react to what happens. Although I think it is a lot of movies, it was naturally terrible. <br /> <br /> It only pulled out some movies for a few scenes. Action was bad, but I'm worse. The film was bad, but I'm worse. Watching this movie is an experience of low levels of boredom, laughter, death, sadism, hornines, and entertainment. <br /> <br /> I gave it 3/10 because it can be entertaining if you don't expect a good movie and you are in the right mood.
