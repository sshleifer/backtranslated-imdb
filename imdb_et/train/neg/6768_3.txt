Herbie, a Volkswagen who thinks like a man, is back, now led by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman hoping to become a NASCAR champion. The only thing standing in front of him is the current champion Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), who is doing something to stop them. <br /> <br /> The original love error was not so good. Even as a child, I remember that I don't like it very much. However, I had hope for a sequel. I mean, the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it a pretty fun movie. Unfortunately, Herbie is not better than before. The film is shamefully weak for people over the age of 12. It probably attracts children, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I know it's a children's film and everything, but they could have made the movie a little more interesting. There were very few smiles and it was boring close. Most actors also seemed dead in their roles. Lindsay Lohan was fine when Maggie Peyton. He usually gives better results like Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave everyone the best result. He was a very bad man, although he didn't have much work to do. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really there and they don't do anything special. <br /> <br /> Angela Robinson manages and does a good job. He tries to keep the movie interesting, but he works with a weak script. The scenario was written by Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant and would it be a surprise to you that they are also responsible for the taxi and the acquaintance? These two make light films, but they can't really make the stories interesting or enjoyable. It is not entirely their fault, but hopefully they will try harder the next time. Finally, Herbie is a safe, predictable family film that you should look at when you are a child. All others are better left out. Rating 4/10
