Somewhere on this site, somebody wrote that to get the best version of Jane Austen's work, they just read them. I agree with that. But we love the adaptations of the great literature, and the strike of current writers reminds us that without good writers, the participants will find it difficult to bring their role to life. The current version of Jane Austen's PERSUASION shows what happens if you don't have a good basis for well-written customization. This version is not comparable to the 1995 version of Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which worked well and retained the essence of the era and the constraints of the characters (except for the odd parade and kissing in the street scene in Bath). The 2007 version shows Anne, who seems to be angry. The other characters were not very advanced, which is a crime, considering how Austen could paint such marvelous signs with carefully selected underestimations. Effective queues of events in the novel were completely beaten, and Mrs. Smith, Anne's bed-cover and impoverished schoolmate went around in Bath - throwing away because many characters seemed to be. Captain of character and intelligence Wentworth, which caused Anne's love first, did not seem to have been written for Rupert Penry-Jones' Wentworth. Ciaran Hinds had more substance and was able to look as much as P-J was able to do with his own images. All in all, the 2007 version was disappointing. It seems that the novel is reduced to a hand-twisted, costume-worthy melodrama. If they wanted to bring our contemporary emotional extravaganza to Austen, they would have to do what they do with Shakespeare's customization: adapt it to the present. At least "Bride & Prejudice" was taken out of historical and location-based settings and was fun to watch, as was "Clueless". It wasn't PERSUASION, but they didn't know what else to name it.
