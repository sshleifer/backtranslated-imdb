It is rare that I feel the need to write an overview of this site, but this film is very worthy of its poor creation and the tilting of this product. <br /> <br /> I felt a separate attempt by some filmmakers for the Palestinian family as a nervous and unreliable show. We hear that they speak of the sadness they feel about oppression, but the film is struck and placed so that we feel that the politically accentuated population is the Jewish people of Israel. We do not see evidence that is parallel to the Palestinian teenage position. We only hear from other Palestinian prisoners. I understand that there are restrictions, but the political nature of the restrictions is meant to prevent peace. <br /> <br /> I came out of the movie that the victim's mother was selfish in her grief and with a completely closed mind thanks to the side of her fence. He didn't want to see the bomber's parents injured, and his angry and closed mindset caused the final meeting to be controlled. In my opinion, it is more realistic to see that Israel's thinking is the cause of the problem; ignored claims of understanding and freedom, ignored requests for recognition of the process of land acquisition by the Jewish population. admirable documentary, but because of the lack of impartiality, it all seems to be exploitative. Also, in the absence of bad changes, lack of background and, finally, lack of Palestinian representation. Ultimately, this is a poor documentary and a poor film. I admit that this is partly a result of the political situation, but I am obliged to notice the weaknesses in the directions, irrespective of the sad and sad issue.
