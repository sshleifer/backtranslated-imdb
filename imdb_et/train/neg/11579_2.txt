I have to admit that I don't remember a lot of characters or a story, although I'm not sure there was one, I was so upset that I was a little harder to focus on. How can you name "Tulsa Keys" and then film it in Texas? The lush wilderness surrounding the Arlington (I think it was a place) does not resemble in any way the green hills surrounding Tulsa and the famous Tulle would be a much livelier neighborhood. Obviously no one has ever been to Tulsa in the film or they would have realized how something they didn't like in the movie. Wouldn't anyone have seen at least Rumblefish or The Outsiders? I know it sounds picky, but I can't help. I watched it because I love James Spader and I find Eric Stotz interesting. But even these two intriguing actors were unable to enliven this tendency and thinking about independent people who are NOT COMING! I'm sorry it couldn't be more expensive for the Oklahoma movie. What if Toronto lives "live and die in LA"? Is that wonder? Well so do it.
