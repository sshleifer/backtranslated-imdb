Isabel Allende's magical, lyrical novel of about three generations of aristocratic South American families has been violated. The film's despising oaf, which resulted - mainly thanks to the great pain of the Anglo actors who could not completely prevent the Latin mellifluo and Scandinavian leading hands of the Allende characters - was so uncomfortable in my skin that I came back to the theater a second time to be sure that I didn't miss anything important that could change my mind. To my disappointment I had nothing left. Among Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave, none of them could get rid of the trap set by Bille August. All of them saw it rigidly and left as if they were trying so little to make them worse for remarkable periods. (Yes, the film was an art directed one inch away from his life.) Curious that the production designer was allowed to place KFC products in a prominent scene that took place around the 1970s - before KFC emerged. Then it was known for its original name: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Even forgiving that Kentucky Fried Chicken was on the ground in military dictatorship in South America in 1970? American fast food chains did not hit South America until the early 1980s. The "House of Spirits" should have been the 1993 film festival. Since it was both club-based and slavishly loyal to her vague idea of ​​what the novel represented, Miramax was supposed to market this art as a film. As a result, it was not an event or an art. And for that, Isabel Allende would have had to pay for rape.
