Don't let the room deceive you - this was a funny movie. The problem - it shouldn't have been comedy. The story puts you well to the end that never comes. Worse still, the setting MUST never be explained. You leave the theater, asking, "Is that?" I appreciate it 2 just because there were some short promise moments, but the finish leaves you completely flat. Nicholas Cage did such a good job as expected, but he had very little work. Everything has odd and interesting turns that had nothing to do with the film. Before you waste money, let this video come out.
