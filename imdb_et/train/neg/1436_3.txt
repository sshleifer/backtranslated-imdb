Heldeke. Some of the best British TV talents did this series, so I can only assume they worked under unbelievable time pressure and had to live the first keys to many scenes. <br /> <br /> There are some scary scenes in this Highland mystery (mostly as a "monster" attacking and we see it from his perspective), but I'm afraid I found most of the story inadvertently funny! Just like a moment when a hero discovers a broken body on a golf course: Oh look, there's a hand ... oh, and there's another hand ... hmm it's a little puzzling ... <br /> For many years The fans of British cult television programs have made a campaign to publish this series on VHS or DVD, but the BBC always said no. Now I think I can understand why!
