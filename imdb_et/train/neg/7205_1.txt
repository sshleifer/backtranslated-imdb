If you like to see what needs to be started as a 2-hour movie that is unrelated, you love this movie. Otherwise, you just want to think about how they could easily translate such a movie into a large screen rather than an inspector gadget. <br /> <br /> Movie previews showed a lot of scenes that were not in the movie and the movie doesn't make sense on some scenes. Although the film is a little less than an hour and a half, I can only think of one truly memorable moment and that is just before or during the credit. <br /> <br />
