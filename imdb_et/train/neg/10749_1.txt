This movie was probably the worst film I've ever seen. Here are the things that will immediately jump to me: 1. Forests were mostly lined with trees and a brush in Los Angeles. Not scary. News flash, when movies in the Southern California area, is a big bear just an hour away. They actually have trees. <br /> <br /> 2. Writing was undoubtedly the worst dialogue I've ever experienced. All the possible features of the film were irregular, cliche, or just stupid. For example, the name of the camp is "camp blood" (lame), the name of the clown is "killer clown" (lame). What is the Clown Forest anyway? Was it the only mask they found? 3. Last but definitely the least action. The absolutely worst group of actors and actors ever assembled. Virtual nerve regions and poor-acting virtual cornucopia. The worst thing was when he accidentally returned this fat foreign girl back to get the photo naked. This is a really long scene and I think he was supposed to be sexy, but he wasn't. It was also one of the few pleasant movie elements for me, whether it should be "sporty". For example, if she is bored in the film, she grabs a few stones and starts to warp with them. Later he should run for a clown and his very "girl like" is immediately clear that he is very athletic. Oh and the girl who played Kat, the good Lord will end the song. The song you sang about credits makes me want to kill myself. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you see this movie, I would recommend at least looking at the special features. The Jackass group, who made this film, tells us that it would be an original story. In fact, one of the girls actually says she lets some of her friends read the scenario and none of them could predict the end. Obviously he hangs out with special kids.
