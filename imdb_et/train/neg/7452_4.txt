It seemed to me that this film seemed to be on my face. The main problem for me was pouring Glover as a serial breaker. I don't know if it will grow out of type selection or just about its behavior, but I doubt Glover could ever portray a convincing criminal. He is a good man, and it is always evident in his performances. Other than that, the movie is the story of the killer of your mill serum. Something very innovative.
