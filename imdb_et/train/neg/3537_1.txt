It was a convincing world that it didn't exist ... <br /> <br /> This is a line that many people probably remember. This is, of course, suspects about Kaiser's gold .. I mean Sose .. <br /> <br /> I got one more: -The trick that the director ever pulled was trying to really convince him This film has one of the saddest parts of making a movie I've seen for a long time. It starts so well with really fantastic cinematography, a great show and a very smart assumption. But unfortunately, the only way this film moves is in self-destruction. And no stroke, but small small wrist breaks. <br /> <br /> Don't pay attention to the comments here that wonder how they found a way to explain it. I would have enough brain in my brain to be able to obviously explain the existence of humanity. I've seen and read about a dozen different ways people explained the story. And they vary the story that is completely put on someone's head, playing chess with themselves, a criminal way to play their enemies thanks to chess games. <br /> <br /> And it's all fun. At the same time, this painful donation is that there is something terribly wrong with this story. And besides, there is in any case a funny score for movies and books like "Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, Ordinary suspects, Snatch, Magnolia and Shachnovelle. And we're not here to borrow it, it's a blatant robbery." <br /> <br /> What's wrong with this movie here is that the story revolves like a drunken bump at speed, along with a short attraction after the film has so many revolutions that it can never be solved, so if it were a cocktail then you should be drinking Nothing has ever been explained, and when you finally understand what you think it is, it will pull one more. <br /> <br /> somewhere must have thought it was fantastic to make a movie about it anyway, being following David Lynch or something. <br /> <br /> could just be a pearl be, has become a piece of art, pseudo-intellectuals food Sunday afternoon Debate clubs. <br /> <br /> Keep your breath and stomach away, avoid at all costs!
