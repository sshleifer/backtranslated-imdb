Alicia Silverstone (pre- "Clueless") plays today's criminals who are trying to solve a local girl's cruel slaughter. Pat Verducci wrote and directed this B-flick, which is not very well done, but is surprisingly serious in its leading character. Silverstone is an attractive and successful, interesting young woman here, despite the painful damage of the picture. Supportive casting (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not a bad thing, although the latest law violence is overboard. Not just a fun camp event, but nothing extraordinary to remember. * 1/2 from ****
