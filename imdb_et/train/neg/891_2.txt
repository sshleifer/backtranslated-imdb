Having loved "Paris, Je T'aime," I waited very much for this movie and admit that I went with great expectations, but for many reasons I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although I did not expect the transformation of "Paris" in New York, I was expecting the same structure. I liked the breakdown of neighborhoods for "Paris". You have the style and story of each director they wanted to say. In "NY" there are no clear stories in different places of the movie, the characters of different stories travel with each other, which made me confused about who I watch and what exactly is happening. The control unit switch was also obvious but confusing because there was no current. <br /> <br /> Another thing I loved about the Paris movie was that different things loved. It wasn't all romantic. There was love, endless love, lonely, middle-aged woman who loves love, etc. between parents and their children, so many layers of love between people were studied. "NY" seemed just nervous, surprising sexuality. There were some redeemable shorts (an older couple who spent their life together, Julie Christie's short), but generally did not give me any emotion. I didn't combine any such characters as "Paris". I remember watching Paris and deep sorrow, loneliness, longing, hopefulness, wonder ... it was just so much soul. For me, there was no soul in the NY movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, if I had gone without the threat of "Paris" at the back of my brain for comparison, this movie could have been more favorable, but when I was "Paris, Je T'aime "With my own title, I was very disappointed.
