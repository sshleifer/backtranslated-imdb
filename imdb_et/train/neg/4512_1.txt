Having lived in Japan for several years, this film does not reflect Japanese culture and is not even close to explaining what Geisha is. Unfortunately, there is a great opportunity to bring Japanese culture closer to the wider western audience and to help show the country where Zen, Samurai, the Kyoto geisha world comes from. Some of the most terrible moments of the film are when Americans are shown around Japan. Geisha's dances were not authentic. Chinese music was used too much. A small but important detail: the correct use of incense sticks was not visible anywhere. Sakura scenes were almost obscenely kitschy! Interestingly, some Chinese actors were quite convincing about Japanese people.
