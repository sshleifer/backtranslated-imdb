There's so little about this fantastic Anne Rice book that there's no point here. Some characters - intense and surprising characters - do not do it at all and those who do so drink so much that they do not exist. Where is the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where's the thing between Marcel and Julia? Why does Dolly Rose appear at all because her story has never been explained? Where is Marie's Rape and Redemption, whose biggest attribute (and decline) is that she is capable of white - and her marriage with Richard? Why is the movie ending with Marcel beating his father? We learn something beyond Aglae that she is a woman who hates her husband; why have you not explained this hatred? <br /> <br /> There is no performance better than mediocre, although this is probably due to the fear script. The best thing is that Richard plays the actor, but Richard is not enough on the screen to save the movie. The worst thing is Jasmine Guy like Dolly Rose, though again this is an actress who has nothing to do with what she's been working hard on. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's just terrible. I thought it would be impossible for any Anne Rice book exchange film to be worse than EXIT EDEN, but ALL SUCCESS FEAST makes this a mess of critical hit. How is it that Rice is such a bitch that she promises her best work to be such a junk on the screen?
