I thought it was a sort of sequel, and it's meant to be the original in 1983. But the sequel doesn't take the original plot and destroys it. <br /> <br /> I actually had very little expectations of this movie, but I just waste 95 minutes of life. There's no relationship - I really feel clairvoyant, poor in performance, and so full of technical mistakes, so I just couldn't believe it as a computer. They have tried to mix it up with general war films and 24 hours. But it is not even worth a small budget TV movie. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie, it's a waste of time. Instead, get the original. The subject is still valid. Don't force the machine a lot. Functioning and plot is much more exciting and convincing.
