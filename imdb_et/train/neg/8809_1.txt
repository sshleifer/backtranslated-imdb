A number of women who cannot sit, talk, smoke in a pot. They have another woman in the wheelchair, which they hide because they are deformed, and sometimes they kill one to feed that human being, which looks like a ham bought in a shop and dressed with a few plastic fingers. We don't see they kill anyone, maybe there is a body on the floor covered with a bloody leaf. That's why I can no longer eat spam for a long time. Just the idea of ​​a child's spam cover is enough to create the same narcoleptic suitability that is sought through the entire film. Occasionally, a scene has been randomly entered from a man who is "hunting" them by torture when he worships the chair in his cellar. Why he captured this man and how he is connected to the sofa beds has never been explained. There are also scenes from some "supernatural" boys who speak out. He puts the blood and strikes the wall, but who he is or is not wrong with him is neither explained nor even related. <br /> <br /> There is no action, no special effects, no story. If you want to look at some boring person to talk thoroughly about anything sitting and eating ham and smoking, then this is 90 minutes, because, except for the scene where one chick takes some of the corner of the street and the above-mentioned random scenes, absolutely NO happens. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot that you could see that they were moving to a new apartment by moving some things, including a deformed sister. This is one of the few times they don't sit on the couch or bed.
