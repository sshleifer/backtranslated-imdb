Wow, it's ironic, because this film has gone through some time. I think someone else should review it a few days ago. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I just watched this movie just because it has Nick Stahl. br /> <br /> The film was ridiculous. The characters drove me to INSANE, they were SO Clich√© and STEREOTYPED. This film had some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard. It was too much plot twists too. <br /> <br /> The movie has another scene worth seeing, the scene: "Warm Heart, Cold Weapon", where Nick Stahl kills a terrible girl in the shower. (Well, actually, they were all unpleasant.) But his acting in this scene was great. Look at her face, it reminded me of American Psychot (good film). The scene is worth seeing, but it's not worth watching the rest of the movie, do yourself a favor and don't look at it.
