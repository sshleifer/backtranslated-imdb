SPOILERS (IF NOT MOVIE IN THE FIRST MINUTES OF THE PROTOCOL) <br /> <br /> Robin Williams is actually quite good at being a friendly, lonely, emotionally haunting loser Sy. He makes a very human, even sympathetic psycho, and really disappears into a character - it is not small for such a recognizable performer. <br /> <br /> Too bad that the rest of the movie is such waste. Supporting performances (and performers) would not look like a soft core of pornos (it doesn't help for every character, but Sy is made of 100% cardboard). Sometimes the leader seems to be trying to strain the tension: we already know from the first moments a) that Sy is a complete job, b) that he will survive, and c) that the police will put them to an end. So all we have been thinking is hows and whys and the answers given are not so interesting. The husband puts his wife on expensive flavors, although he seems to spend his entire leisure time at a local discount. About two-thirds of the way, Sy does something so irrevocably foolish that it makes one wonder how much he really takes care of his big vengeance plan. And the final explanation of the clich√© from his psychosis, directly from "Peeping Tom", is a terrible copying. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is absolutely the worst. It is neither overwritten nor uncomfortable or unbelievable nor bad in any other way that could be considered fun, even for lovers of bad movies. Instead, each line is purely, gently functional - just as the director staged copies of the newspaper and said, "Hey, I need a working script - in an hour." It made me want to yell, honestly. and although it is certainly unpleasant, it is never very scary. Sy fetishism makes you uncomfortable from time to time, but it is not enough in itself to do a movie. Ultimately, it all falls apart from Robin Williams, the lack of craft. 3 out of 10
