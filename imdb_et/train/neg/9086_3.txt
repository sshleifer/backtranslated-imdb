I was aware of Rohmer's admiration for the later works he considered to be great cynics, and that ordinary spectators, generally considered to be artistic failures (such as Renoir's or Chaplin's latest films, yes, the "political des auteurs" are also on the dark side). But "Les amours d'Astrée et de Céladon", as Rohmer himself wanted, what could be his last film to preserve the tradition of the great directors who made the last senile film, by adjusting Urfé "L'astrée" with ridiculous aesthetic codes just witch out like Rosselin's latest movie parody (what he did for television from Descartes or Marx's life). <br /> <br /> In his "Perceval" version, Rohmer refused to film real landscapes to transform what might be medieval The director apparently changed his thoughts when the XVII century was involved, and the filmmakers dressed like the peasants of the 16th century, surrounded by their own modern trees and landscapes, but everything seems more ridiculous than Luchin and its magic. it is not that the story itself is stupid, but the way Rohmer interferes with the artefacts of naturalism is so childish and amateur that it will quickly change unintentionally na bold (and I am not even talking about actresses' annoying pronunciation, annoying and sad humorist events) Rodolphe Pauly, a ridiculous soft erotic tone, poor musical tents or strange charm trasvestisment!). <br /> <br /> The radical aesthetics of the film will eventually change the fun that interferes with the soft-erotic film made for TV with theological training discussions (sic!). At the beginning of the film, Rohmer teaches us that the original French region of the story is insecure because of its modernity, and therefore it had to be filmed in "L'Astrée". But I am sure that the film would have been more modern and interesting if Rohmer was still recording the same story in a modern area with the same narrative codes and artistic decisions. This film may be of interest to some historians, but most cinephiles can laugh at the last and sad Rohmer movie.
