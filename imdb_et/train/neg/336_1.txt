Why is it that when a star reaches the top of the starset, they destroy all the good work by making a bad movie? Burt Reynolds reached the top, then began to make terrible Hal Needham cars. Arnold Schwarzenegger became Hollywood's hottest property to invite himself to the hero of the most recent acts. And here's the dirty Eddie Murphy's memory cards out of the trading venues and 48 hours of this "family" adventure clamp, which is an incredibly annoying, childish and generally terrible plague with the chance to see Charlotte Lewis big big breasts in a tight blouse. the most attractive aspect of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The story is pure fear. It concerns the social worker Murphy, who is contacted by a mysterious type, and said he was a chosen person. You chose what you hear. His job is to rescue a Tibetan boy with mystical abilities from a demon race who wants to rule the world. Like the main demon, the stylish actor Charles Dance in the film looks terribly embarrassing, but hey, I'm sure he was well-paid for sacrificing his talents. Of all Murphy's films, this is the worst. I have read some comments that show that it is nice to see Murphy in an atypical role, not in a formal film, and although both points are loosely true, it is not a forgiving fact that the film - although it may be atypical and informal - is the absolute burden of garbage. <br /> <br />
