So the great rewriting of history continues in Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> It was pointless ridiculous garbage. <br /> <br /> He strikes me that this amazing amount of money can be spent to produce the most experienced, inadequate, inaccurate film I've ever seen. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage's short flirting with serious behavior seems to be over. I can only assume that leaving Las Vegas was in trouble in the otherwise terrible films of Lithia. <br /> <br /> Diane Kruger proves that her performance Trojan was not a fluke, she really can't act. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel should shame himself for working for such a momentum. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for those who are recovering from recent lobotomy or people who think America has invented the world.
