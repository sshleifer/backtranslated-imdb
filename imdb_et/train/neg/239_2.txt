I'm not saying this movie was bad, but it wasn't good. I was expecting something good, but I think Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than that. It was completely old-fashioned. At every stage of this movie, I was hoping for some twist and what would I get? The girl burns and wins the aunt's love. Despite being busy, they have to get permission for every little move. They are so tough even after so many meetings. I waited for aunt to have a lot of brutal. Everything she did was crazy about the crib. Hey, we have kids, but we don't always look at them and tears in our eyes. This movie is a dream. Happy family, one cruel woman, good laws, and a man who loves him to die. In HAHK, Anupam Kher was the father of the poor bride and now it is the opposite. And I knew Mohnish Behl would be in that movie. Anyway I believe I wasted my time. I'll give him 2/10.
