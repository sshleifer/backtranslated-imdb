Okay, first, Seagall's voice is dubbed as 50% of the movie ... Why? Because the script and story were apparently rewritten because they were at the time of shooting, and they need to change their dialogue story for consistency because they have multiple versions. From the very beginning, you just scratch your head because overdubs are not only distracting, but they don't make any sense. This means that the story is still sucked and doesn't make sense at all. When I got to the end, I was just in my head, because the film was so pointless and the end didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Avoid like a plague. This film made me stop watching Seagale watching videos because they were getting worse and worse.
