First of all, let me start with the quotation my friend said while watching this movie: "This whole movie was supposed to be daring. You know, like," DUDE, I got that you can't make an eternal movie "". With this film, they have made good efforts to achieve this title. Impacts are, of course, bad. The plot / dialogue is similar to each of the B-horror films made with the stolen bit collage. The participants I expect should be in college. But some of its parts (especially in the beginning) seem to be in college or high school. It's not logical. The scarecrow who is going to kill people is not the least enjoyable. (SPOILER: At the end, when they sing Lester's name and appear again, the black boy and scarecrow are laughing, apparently outside what they had on their last scene, and in the cheesy dialogue.)
