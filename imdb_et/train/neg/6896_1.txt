Unfortunately, IMDb does not allow me to judge judges below 1. What a shame. This terrible movie is so bad that I actually turned the thing off before the end turned off. The script had some bright moments, but management, editing, acting, sound quality, and especially time transmission were so frightening that judges were totally intolerable. <br /> <br /> The judges were promoted as a modern day comic book-style western, but in fact there was nothing like that. Most like the dog on the bottom of your shoe. You can try to pretend it's okay, but it just keeps on smelling. <br /> <br /> Why video stores think that such a mess is a constant loophole sound and worse than a high school drama class action is beyond me. We rent movies to see something better than on television. But judges are worse than the most pathetic SciFi Channel original. I'm going to claim my money back from Hollywood video.
