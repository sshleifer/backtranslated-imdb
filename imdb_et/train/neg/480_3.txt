2 Star Kay Francis - She's Great! And he doesn't deserve that terrible little thing that Warner Bros was doing! <br /> <br /> The bilateral assumption that this film is based is extreme and incredible. Kay is a small town woman and mother who wants something bigger: she wants to be an actor. When a big actor arrives at the city and asks Kay to talk to her hotel about the possibilities, Kay tells her husband she's going to the movies. Mom's boy who makes a mistake in his ear, that Kay is not true and he's looking for him. He thinks he is a hotel actor (they speak only!) And he slips into a boy who falls over the echo, lands in the pond (lake?) And dies. Now there are two incredible spaces on which the rest of the movie is based: <br /> <br /> 1) The judge tells the jury that if it is established that the man died * before his head water went to find the first the degree of murder was guilty. (I think the bow, which is the best man for the noise, reads the most for murder or murder 2, not for the first murder. Give me a break! So he can be sent to prison every time.) Whatever.) 2) The hub's lawyer says after conviction and convicting Kay that it's all his fault. His reasoning is that if he hadn't gone over the actress's room, his wife wouldn't have to go back to him and the guy and kill him. He tells him he's guilty, not his wife, and he nods and agrees. What. The. Hell?!?!?! The rest of the film has been Kay's attempt to gain fame and money to get her husband out of prison and the right lie she did, causing her to kill the actor's dude first. <br /> <br /> I can't even go ahead with this review. The film was just too painful. Four years earlier, in code pre-days, you would never have played Kay with such a wimp! However, in the real fashion of Kay Francis, he did his best to believe that this woman was a plausible character. I give him much appreciation for trying to breathe this ungrateful role. This character was a long way from Kay Francis's forerunners and the real life of Kay Francis. <br /> <br /> Clear the way! There are many better Kay Francis vehicles out there! (From personal experience I can highly recommend Mary Stevens, MD and Jewel Robbery; the good is Dr. Monica and One Way Passage. I'm sure other big Kay flicks are, but I only mention the ones I am you have seen and recommend.)
