I've never seen anything as terrible as this movie for a while. The film was a boring, long and terrible plot. Special effects suck like hell - it's like watching a movie in 1999. It's one and a half hours of your waste. Matthew Settle's performance was pretty bad. I saw him in the Brothers band who played the story. T Actually, it is not at all bad. But in this film, his acting was not convincing enough, it was quite bad and there were no chemistry between the rest of the team. Plus, her eyes seem to be empty as she doesn't recognize it. It really surprised me because he was good in the brand band. <br /> <br /> Anyway, don't bother to watch this movie. This is a big big waste of time. Even if you had to kill one or two hours, get something other than watching the movie. Trust me, you regret it!
