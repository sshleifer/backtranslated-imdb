Although not offensive, the 1967 version of "Paul's Dangers" is certainly moral. The title may lead you to look out for Pearl White (original Pauline in the 1914 series of 20 episodes), but it would be better than the 1947 version of Betty Hutton starring. This 1967 version is like the weakest of Casino Royale and Elvis. The worst thing is not a combination of them, but rather anyone who hits each other so that the thing goes back and forth between the two styles. <br /> <br /> What is unity in production is the pairing between Pamela Austin (Pauline) and Pat Boone (George Steadman), both lacking even the most basic operational skills (imagine Mandy Moore playing with Dan Quayle). <br /> <br /> Austin will later play Evil Roy Slade against John Aston, where the differences between talents are actually painful. In the mid-60s, she was a Dodge Rebellion girl because she was in a series of dangerous situations - imagine Sandra Dee's dark blue jumping board. When the car manufacturer's advertising agency replaced her with a Dodge Fever girl, someone got her to play her. <br /> <br /> What the story here is, Pauline starts to grow up at Baskerville's Foundling Home, led by an actor who played Mrs Chatsworth Osborne Srd "Dobie Gillis". George loves him (Pauline-not Mrs Osborne) and sabotages the many opportunities she has to accept. George leaves for his fortune, and 19-year-old Pauline gets the young oil's rich Middle East prince to work. When he tries to add an attractive blonde to his harem, he runs away and runs the risk. These include African Pygmies, 99-year-old millionaires who want to freeze her until her one-year-old grandson is old enough for marriage, the film industry, and the Russian space program. <br /> <br /> All of this is meant to be silly and charming, but only managed by a silly part. Some effort is required to simulate camera depression (which speeds up the operation) to watch a quiet movie. Unfortunately, everything else (film stock, production planning, editing) is depressing in the 1960s. Nothing here even approaches the Pearl White images attached to a log that moves in the direction of a buzz-saw or is linked to a line waiting for an approaching train. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
