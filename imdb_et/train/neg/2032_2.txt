I gave this two stars an excellent DV picture clarity that gives my character a cold and dark sterility. It was generous, I know. <br /> <br /> This movie does not work on all accounts. I can't recommend it because it's neither poetic nor blunt. Not dramatic or stopping. Not controversial or usual. It's just a wretched trash that a horror or fan can't suggest in good faith. <br /> <br /> Don't look at whoever you are. . Please just stay away from this terrible product. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
