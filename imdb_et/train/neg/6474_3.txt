It was the first sequel I saw (after the return of Jafari) and I thought honestly before looking at it being close to the original. I was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The story was basically the first script to have a few extra characters and the situation turned around. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody, who is not happy with life in the country. She wants to get a mermaid. But Ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her and when Melody discovers she is upset and angry. Then he decides to escape and becomes a mermaid. So she's happy to swim, and Ariel tries to find her as a mermaid. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't sound too bad, but the clich√©s and repetitions of the first movie are just too obvious. And adding the fact that Melody is generally very annoying and the film becomes almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> There's also a whole load of other new characters-Tip and Dash are two of them. They are not too bad when the characters themselves-just try not to think of Timon or Pumbaa! Songs also leave much to be desired, they simply do not have the same magical energy as the original songs. The animation did not obviously have a full range of work that would have shifted in parts, and there is not much imagination for the characters' movements. <br /> <br /> Another tip - try to forget Ariel's original sign while watching this movie. A beautiful, rebellious, curious teenager is "all grown up" for a blissful, boring woman and mother, and her trademark red hair is all related. It is much better to see if you have never seen the original - you have nothing to compare. <br /> <br /> All in all, it would have been worse - it is not as bad as certain other sequences, like Cinderella II. But it's not in the same league as the original. But this is for your collection, if anything else, but if Disney goes like this, they will lose all the older fans.
