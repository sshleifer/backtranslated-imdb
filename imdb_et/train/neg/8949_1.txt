A couple of weeks ago, I read a classical George Orwell novel in 1984. I was fascinated by it and thought it was one of the best books I recently read. So when I rented a DVD, I was interested to see how this adaptation was measured. Unfortunately, the film did not even come to the creation of the atmosphere or the masterpiece of Orwell's creation of characters in his book. The director seems to think that anyone who watches the movie has read the book because he does not try to show why the characters are acting and how they do it. The main actor, John Hurt, is the whole journey and almost to the end. We will never know what he or she is living in, or why his love relationship is forbidden or what the political atmosphere is and why the main character wants a rebellion. This book cannot be fairly done in the form of a film without explaining the political system that oppresses the proper narrative and the characters, and the fact that they are missing is the greatest drawback of this film. In addition, John Hurt was a terrible election, looking at Winston, aged over 15, who he was supposed to portray. However, the rest of the cast is more well-chosen. It's just too bad if they were put into this terribly custom movie with the wrong guiding factor. -Brian O.
