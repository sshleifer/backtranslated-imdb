I don't know how this movie received so many positive comments on this site! I'm a big fan-fan and I am familiar with the story of Showtime's original movie, which has been bastarded incredibly, but even if I wasn't, bad action, VERY bad casting (Sean Astin as brilliant, sporty and individual), Harrison? The man is absolutely general! Someone pointed out how cute this Maculay Culkin line was. If you read this and thought it was a pure comic book (unfortunately it was the most fun part of the movie), maybe you like this movie. But if you're a fan of Vonneguti or aren't completely crazy, you can't see it. Please.
