I have absolutely no knowledge of the author Phillipa Pearce or his novels, and if TOM's MIDNIGHT GARDEN is typical of his work, I would probably have had little interest in his books as a child. When I was a child, I really had no interest in litreture if he had no soldiers fighting against the monsters with a large body weight. middle-class children, because much of the story revolves around the main story of Tom Long who moves to the house without the garden, suddenly discovering the metaphysical. Making your own garden was certainly not something that was not in the 1950s for working class people, so I think there's some kind of political class there. There's also a romance involving a young girl named Hattie, but again are cynical kids loved by stories? Perhaps the worst criticism is that there is very little excitement or adventure in the narrative <br /> <br /> This is a children's film that looks like this source. It's unpleasant, but I'm surprised by the high rating of IMDB voters. I don't know how many of them would have given her so many highlights if they were 10 years old, who just saw the TRAILER LORD trilogy?
