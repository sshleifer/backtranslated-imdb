The transformation of Alexandre Time from The Hills Have Eyes was one of the brightest spots in 2006. Not only was this a classic horror movie, but also a pretty fucking good one. So, almost a year later, this reflection is treated for its reprocessing. While the original scripter Wes Craven is back with the manufacturer and collaboration scripts, this movie just doesn't rise to the level of the original and remake. A group of military practitioners stop in the wilderness to check out some scientists and find themselves in the first movie (at least those that remain plus some new movies). Here's a lot of gore. What disturbs me about this film is the complete lack of character. The viewer doesn't give the damn thing that happens to one of these people because we haven't got them. Even the mutants had the last character and this time something. Gore is meaningless for gore. There must be a reason for this to be interesting. Something that happens here is not interesting. And what has lately been filming with rape scenes? Here we get one more real reason. Hopefully this is one of those mountains that will not be visited again.
