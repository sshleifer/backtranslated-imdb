Being a fan of Billy Bob Thornton and his variety of skills, I noticed this movie and I was surprised to hear it. <br /> <br /> I traveled as usual as well as the period when it was filmed in 2000 and when it hit the theater more than 2-1 / 2 years later (the passing of time is the first idea that everything was not well done in production) related). <br /> <br /> Now, Patrick Swayze can't work on sour apples, but Thornton has more than enough power to make up for the difference between them. And Charlize Theron is someone who would be happy to see, even if it showed that he was looking at the color dry. <br /> <br /> Being curious, I checked the production information for this site. It opened the weekend with $ 600 per screen and just over $ 400 after its month's theater run in 2002. The total gross was $ 261K, which I doubted to cover the cast and team hotel and food weekly location. <br /> <br /> The story is quite benign, and even using a renowned Reno location is as dull as the rest of the games. <br /> <br /> This is something like several SNL bits all together, none is too big and the overall presentation is even worse. <br /> <br /> No matter what the cost of this production was, it had to be significant - even if everyone worked for less than normal fees - so one thing that made this barely acceptable was the quality of filming and Billy Bob's presence (though understandably somewhat laconic, compared to his usual work. <br /> <br /> Think of the three great, completely different characters he described as "Sling Blade", "Bandits" and "Bad Santa", and you know he understood it work wa below standard, long before viewers had the opportunity to confirm it.One letter to him, even here, and one because production was better than say, typical "lifetime" flick.
