Angry Red Planet (Quickie Review) <br /> <br /> Like the "Man on Planet X", this is a strange scientific literature that has been killed in an era when fantasy and science fiction was the same thing. This means that we have some very ridiculous special effects and crippling pseudosciences that disguise as science fiction. And yes, this is another "classic" that has been released in a high-quality broadcast with sharp image and sharp sound - Midnite movies. Oh, this is definitely the time when our space team is on Mars. (What, you thought, "Angry Red Planet" referred to Neptune?) Before that, there are some fairly poor space teams entering the spacecraft, where they smoke and drag around a sexist chauvinist that targets "hairy wife" member. team. It would be somewhat offensive by today's standards if it wasn't so damn funny. But Mars is the real reason why we look at this thing. The film is generally black and white, but Mars, well Mars screams bloody red. It's filmed in this bizarre red plastic glow, giving the angry red planet a pretty interesting look of redness. It's really prominent, as well as (ha ha) alien viewers feel. Best of all is "ratbatspidercrab". You think it's a joke? They call it in the movie! It is a giant chimera (a small doll) that combines the characteristics of rats, bats, spiders and crabs. It is limited to all puppies and scares t * t of our "heroic team". There are other strange and ill-conceived aliens, but it takes a cake. Finally, after their harrowing experience on Mars, the sexist team puts its "ship" back and returns to any planet they came from. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone. Science fiction film parades and curiosity seekers and some general film enthusiasts. Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans have a day out on this day (if they never showed it). <br /> <br /> 2/10 Modern score, 6/10 Nostalgia score, 4/10 overall. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
