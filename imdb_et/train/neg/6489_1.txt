What seemed like a good prerequisite for the film ... unfortunately it doesn't reach almost every level. At the beginning of the movie it is very difficult to follow that I actually fought with the desire to turn it off the biggest problem from the visual point of view. This is the fact that the camera's work is just up, with so many "arty" splits and semi-subconscious cuts in the whole movie that pulls you into the overall story. In fact, it is trying to dive you and stop it for an endless end now, but the movie has just so many semi-created characters and not an appropriate script that leaves you frustrated and confused about why they tried to go that deep.
