Anyone who has seen a Tammuz child eater knows that it's a director who can do better. We hope it wasn't too much in the hand pot (Telefone someone?) And that was another feature for jitter. The characters are one-dimensional and usable. However, the terrain is terrible and quietly provides the Pacific Northwest. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is great. Shot is almost completely out, the pictures are crisp and beautiful. You can clean almost the leaves of the wind from the wind. <br /> <br /> Technically, this movie is as sound as it comes from - just no heart.
