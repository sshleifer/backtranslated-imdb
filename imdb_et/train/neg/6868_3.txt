Of course, if an Orthodox woman who lives in Boro Park, I'm a little biased about this movie. But it seemed that Boaz Yakini's only goal in making the film was Orthodox bashing. Our wigs, unpretentious clothing and separate seating are already quite a simple target. Yakin never did it over the surface. The result is a film that has more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia she loves more than G or their parents. Then he deliberately understands his father's command not to swim because of his bad health. 2. Sonia turns to her son's bris. Why would Monsee's hash such a strong reaction? It is hard to believe that he never participated before. Let's be honest that even the Reform Jews today have bris milah ceremonies. 3. Did Mendel rise during his chosson classes? He should satisfy his wife's passions in bed and refrain from kissing her on the street. Especially in the middle of the most active street in Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel had to be married for more than a year now and she noticed that they were not meant for each other? A small understanding of marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first boy whom her parents put. Nor does he leave the community if the marriage does not work. 5. When Sonia really wanted to enter the jewelry industry, she didn't have to go through her particular brother. There are Orthodox female doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Sonia turned out to be rather sympathetic. Instead of checking his life, he sat back and waited for things to happen and then complained that he didn't like the result. It is not in its environment; it is a stereotyping. Frankly, I think he got what he deserved.
