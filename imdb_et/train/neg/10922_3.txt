Worse than given rating. This is a typical SciFi movie today: a badly dreaded action, a poorly written script, and a dirty direction. From the scene where DeMille bursts to the end, this movie is terrible. At first, this film features Moses (which was Charlton Heston's DeMille movie), Pharoah (Yul Brynner) and Nefretir (Anne Baxtor) looking at a boy who bursts in the sand box. The signs that had to represent the three above-mentioned icons were terrible and had to resemble the people they "supposedly" had to be. The fact that it is in a desert away from civilization is fun when someone is hurt and they all scream for an ambulance. It is obvious from the scene that there is no ambulance in the desert. I was very disappointed that Morena Baccarin decided to make such a low quality film.
