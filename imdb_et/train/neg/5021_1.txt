This is one of the worst films I've seen for a long time. The story was boring, the dialogue was cruel and a hammy acting. I'm not sure if this movie was the result of the film school's homework, but it certainly did. It is not even particularly successful in its central sense that it tries to appear as one of the constant keys. Horizontal camera pans are cheap and unigiginal ways to hide cuts.
