I was fascinated when the movie was really bad. Did the viewer learn something or think about something? What was pumpkin? Did I have to impress the motel's frames? Is it important that there are some garbage bags on the roof of the hotel? Why does the narrator fail with the people he interviewed (it is so obvious that he made some really informative parts of the interviews to get rid of the mockery). The best part of the film was an interview with a film professor who tells us how bad this film is before it ends. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised. I believe that the creator is struggling for intellectual change or trying to impress the intellectual community.
