I'm afraid I didn't like this movie very much. In addition to some saving scars, there is nothing to write home. <br /> <br /> J-horror has boomed over the last five or six years, but films themselves have been more than one copy of past successes and carbon copies. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> It's basically a supernatural movie. The beginnings are promising when scenes of murmur are cast, where the dead girl is sewn together with the eyes, but soon after they open. But after that, this flick is downhill. <br /> <br /> To be kind, I start with things I like about Gawi. On the plus side, the visual throw and the film type are perfect. For those who love their horror films, there are some nicely filled (no pun intended) murder pictures. We also get some good intercourse / kits. <br /> <br /> However, there are also many drawbacks ... <br /> <br /> First and foremost, my big complaint about this movie is that the plot leaves and jumps from time to time and with alarming intensity. Normally, this is not a problem for me, but here, where students see exactly the same, no matter what age, I am confused more than once. <br /> <br /> Performances are fine, I think (a little hard to say if you don't know the language), but it seems a little stiff. And for the horror movie, I don't think it would be scary enough. After a while I was really bored. <br /> <br /> I was a fan of giallo movies, I was expecting quite a lot of "Nightmare" but unfortunately I was quite disappointed.
