Why show that millions of us watched and loved children and made fun of it? They ask why Hollywood doesn't make the money he used before. Because they put the garbage and pay huge amounts to the actors to be garbage men, and ask us to pay $ 10 to see their garbage. The TV show was what was good, bad situations where good IL boys came on. It wasn't gone with the wind, but it was fun. This movie is garbage! Hollywood can't bring out anything original to take something good and destroy $ $ $ $. I only hope that this film will make 10x less than what to do. The only ones to have fun with this mess are the men who were headed by General Lee. Audience is a victim. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it, look at the TV show instead. They are still 20 years later.
