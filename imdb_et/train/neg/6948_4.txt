An interesting idea (four Afro-American women who broke down the society's launcher, taking revenge on bank robbery) has ruined the ghastly slow direction and fascinating script (by Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanieri) by Gary Gray, full of involuntary funny moments. Gray, Bufford, and Lanier prefer to show that women in cities struggling to stay on the surface, rather than staying on the surface, give them sharp comments to despise their unsuspecting audiences with the high concepts of an operative tragedy. This is the worst melodrama. Gray has his actors on every tired line and John Carter's lazy editing refuses to disassemble by choosing to keep his camera in the embarrassed face of performers. And they are confused: although actors such as Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have some raw materials (Queen Latifah is the fourth and as an actor she is a great rapper), they need more and more than Gray. as a result, they come out in front of the camera and uncomfortable. Be clear.
