Everything you really need about this movie comes after opening, where the man gets into the lake and eats. Then they start running the title credits. in capital letters, just after "Film". IF YOU! I was worried that I was accidentally tuned to "Slugs: The Musical" or "Slugs: The Game Show". Anyway, the film worsens from there to kill-fest. You see that the boy has cut his hand because he was in his horticultural hollow, two men attacked in sexual intercourse, and the girl who fell behind him in the underground passage kills the killer slaves. This is a pretty silly movie that belongs to the "so bad-it-good" category. It's also so bad on such a terrible film that you're shocked to learn it in 1988 (I think it was 1974). I am very surprised that he has got as high a score as here, as most people here do not give this type of love to love. But if you want a movie that is trying to be scary but gets ridiculous, it's one of your main candidates.
