It is a remark that one of the heroines was raped by "drunken robbers" of Russian soldiers, which is completely wrong. This movie shouldn't be shown just because. <br /> <br /> Also, someone says the KGB accused "Jews, Gypsies, etc." of being "worse than the Nazis". The KGB was looking for so-called Zionist agents who (the KGB believed) were imperialist agents. It is completely different from the Jews than the entire nation, as the Nazis did. The Roma were never accused. The KGB was a political tool and was used politically but internationally. The communists did not really distinguish between nations. <br /> <br /> The whole movie smells like fake. The main hero does not speak Russian, the Berlin characters contain typographical errors, the general KGB looks completely fake. Some of the so-called "Russian proverbs" are fully compiled and the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Not recommended to watch - this movie is full of false and fake things. Go to "Good Shepherd" instead.
