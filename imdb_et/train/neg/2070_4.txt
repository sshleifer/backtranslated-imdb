After too many bad memories I took this episode every time it appeared in the 2nd season. I recently looked at it again to remind you why. I've always considered it the worst ST: TNG episode (except for the "Shades of Gray", which hardly counts as an episode at all). <br /> <br /> I listen to a tricky dialogue and thinking script written by the author Writing 101: "SHOW, DO NOT TELL!" Deanna Troi's announcement and all the other constantly burning reminders of what is charming, dangerous about the rogue Okona, Guinea's explanation of how funny her droid joke is (this is not) to who cares about conflict resolution. This is not a point on the plot that has not been highlighted and tripled for our construction, and there is no plausible moment. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is a too puppy dog ​​who is the center of plot machinations. On the other hand, one of John Barrowman (Jack Harkness, "Doctor Who") could not write this role. <br /> <br /> (By the way, datum points) Although I think Joe Piscopo ended up funny for decades ago, he and Brent Spiner had nothing to do here, even though the Jerry Lewis bit was funny.) <br /> <br /> good day, you can think of it as a charming little respect for the episode of a smaller original series. I'd rather leave "Time Squared" or "Q Who."
