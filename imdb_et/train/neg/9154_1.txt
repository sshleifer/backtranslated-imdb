THE. WORST. FILM. EVER. MADE. <br /> <br /> After this supposedly gay movie, I suspect that someone rounded the brain that was damaged by the semi-dark neo-Nazi, and had to make him the worst gay movie ever. . I had to stop the movie and call a friend to go over there, so I had someone to beat when I stopped the movie from shock, disbelief and resentment in such a simple stupidity. <br /> <br /> A terrible writing and action on everyone and an illogical and stupid plot, its just a badly made movie. A dog with a handycam attached to the tail could have been better off. <br /> <br /> Seriously, after reading some of the movie's positive reviews, I suspect that the writer must have half a dozen IMDb accounts. Anyone who says this movie is even traceable if something other than a joke is a liar or is paid heavily to say it.
