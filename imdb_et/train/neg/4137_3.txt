I have a high level of tolerance for the ear, so I waited for it. It is not disappointed. Apparently, Sheridan Le Fanu's classic Carmilla is based on her father and daughter who hunt a female vampire, who fortunately travels with them. Then we have Santa Claus (or General, as he likes to be here) who runs over random zombies. Did I mention there was a zombie outbreak? The dead are alive, but nobody seems too concerned. We have a construction worker with zombies, soldier zombies and even St.Trin's schoolgirl zombies. Probably Santa Claus is looking for his daughter who has become a vampire. Wait for the vampires to be missing, the girl in the shelter and Carmilla is her sister or is she? Zombies are back and Santa is crazy. Lesbian sex, I like vampires and I like zombies, but I like especially lesbian sex. Nothing like some simulated cunnilinguses for the juices to flow. When do we see vampires against zombies? Is he a vampire or is he mad? Or both? Is Carmilla a hot sexy lesbian vampire or sister? More cunnilingus, you can never have enough cunnilingus. Here are the St.Trinus zombies. Chainsaw Time! More lesbian sex then zombies kill and eat vampires. I think zombies won or did they? Fuck? Who needs a plot if you have lesbian vampires and schoolgirl zombies? And cunnilingus?
