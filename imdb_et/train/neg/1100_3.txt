Since most of the reviews of this film have been reviewed a decade ago, I would like to add another, B-17 bombardment of the film from Germany, film scenes for Oskar Werner Hauptmann (captain), Wust character and his assistant when he comes to Hitler Fuehrer Bunker. inside, these bunker workers can be introduced, the movie is then cut into one of the many conference centers where Albin Skoda gives a decent impression from Adolf Hitler that his official is "Ultimate" Victory, when Werner's character is shown slowly to realize that bunkers are in the fantasy world - some the non-bunker events are depicted, the most remarkable of which is the subway system flood to avoid Russia's advancement through them and the minor Alamplot, which includes the Flak's young man and his family's difficulties in survival - this film suffers from a number of inaccuracies in the German film made only 10 years after W W2 should not be involved; the actor carrying the Goebbels (Willy Krause) has the same form as Hitler, including the hand-eagle - Goebbels wore a brown Nazi party uniform - the SS soldier wear a German army camouflage, Hitler's well-documented scene that gave the Iron Cross a show that for Hitler's young boys this has happened in the bunker (it was done outside the yard), and finally, Hitler's suicide weapon is clearly shown as the Belgian browning model 1922-most accounts agree that it was Walther's PPK part that seems to be near the end of the movie drunk dance Scenes seem to be inaccurate, this picture is shown as a cabaret skit, a drunken injured soldier (his hand splitting) manic biting music, when a sister makes a combined striptease / belly dance, all candlelight ... it's really embarrassing to see - the most incredible is when Werner Captain Wust becomes the only public of Skoda Hitler, Hitler is shown as Werner's character will start questioning him, then Hitler's start shouts, bringing in an SS defender who dies on the back of Werner's character, where this shot is made, which is not a real historical account -Werner character is then pulled to death in the front, while Hitler's end is dead ends, Hitler's goodbye is shown to his staff, but suicide is off the screen, the last of the movie shows Hitler's funeral on the face of a slow-dead Oskar Oskar Werner / Hauptmann Wust-this film is allegorical than historical and anyone who is interested in it would be better to watch the latest films like the 1973 "Hitler: The Last 10 Days" or the German "Downfall" (Der Untergang), if they want a more realistic account of this dramatic story, are based on these last two films on the first person witness account, "Hitler: The Last 10 Days ". g compiled by Gerhard Boldt as an official of Fuehrer Bunker's staff, and a hit made by Hitler's secretary's memoir, "Let Let's Acte" screen is taken from the book "Ten Days to Death" by Michael Musmann, a judge at the American Nuremberg War Crimes, which is more than a summary of the events (many obvious). - It is surprising that Hugh Trevor Roper's "Hitler's Last Day" has never been made for film.
