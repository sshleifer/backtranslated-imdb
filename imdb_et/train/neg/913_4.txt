Now, OK. What was funny in the first movie? I know people with funny accents, people who get into the water, stupid boat runs and funny comments between two teams. In this film, they have turned the accent to maximum, not good. Many people get into the water due to uncertain reasons, not good. Boatcrash, check. Funny comments between the two teams, they tried but couldn't. Also, there are too many people in this movie they watch. This film should be about what is happening in the water, not the land. I am sorry to say that there are too many possibilities between funny parts and movie sponsors. Not good. All in all, I give him four out of ten because it has some funny parts.
