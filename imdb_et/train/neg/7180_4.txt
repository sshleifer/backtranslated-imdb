This is a bigger than usual budgeted film for genre manager Honda (with obviously more sophisticated sets)? although the special effects still have such a characteristic joy (witnessed by giant bats and rodents). He also uses a surprising number of American actors: Joseph Cotten, who plays a visionary scientist, looks light and weak (but then his character should be 204 years old), Safe Richard Jaeck is a photographer's hero, as the main villains, we get Cesar Romero and Patricia Medina (both basically campy). As I have often said, I grew up watching Italian-language English movies, but listening to Hollywood actors in Japanese is another thing! <br /> <br /> LATITUDE ZERO seems to be a minor version of the typical Jules Verne adventure and is quite fun in this regard; Indeed, it is better than Honda's low eyebrow variations in the monster-attack formula, as this is of course a peculiar charm. The plot includes the robbery of the famous scientist Romero? he intended to create himself underwater, a technologically advanced city developed by Cotten (which employs the world's main senses). We are being treated with stupid battles between rivals, but the most fun scenes are definitely an attack on Romero's cave ?? In fact, Cotten, who makes fur and worships men in rubber costumes (through flames and his heavily emitted laser), will certainly be the lowest of his acting career; another parent cast, Romero, is more of his element? After all, he had been in the Joker BATMAN TV series and in the 1960s movie! Cotten has a weakly covered blonde doctor in his team, assisted by tough Asia; By contrast, Romero is next to the Oriental femme fatale? but who reaches his efforts for the crude product (the girl's brain is finally transplanted into a hybrid of a lion and a condor, which is one of the most phonetic obvious beings you have ever seen!). Apparently this day's set of 2-tile discs from Media Blasters today!
