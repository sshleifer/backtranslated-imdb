Yes, I get to Pasolini and his milieu, but at the same time I feel his "decameron" is largely overpriced and more than a bit annoying. Overestimated, because the supposed "realism" he introduces (crowd grinding, crumbling architecture, etc.) is led by an absurd and even funny way that the characters behave. In order to achieve a realistic goal, Pasolini used many non-actors, but their deer headlamps stare and painfully uncomfortable line deliveries give all the frightening and inconsistent feel. And frankly, many people with no teeth, vaguely minded people are painful to look at. <br /> <br /> Pasolini's "Decameron" is disruptive (at least for me) due to random and widespread homosexual content. Not because I am proud or homophobic (I am not), but because the emphasis Pasolini has on homoerotic images and situations contradicts the neo-realism he otherwise lives in, so it comes out as free and forced. . You can almost hear that he says, "Ooh - I have to fuck a cute, naked boy in this scene!" Sometimes it seems that Pasolini tries to play a homosexual corner in order to sneak his nose in critics and other times because he enjoys this aspect himself, no matter what his audience might prefer. <br /> <br /> Of 9 or 10 different stories in Pasolian Decameron, I was hit by Pasolini as a storyteller, not a neo-realism aspect. He seems to be boring every story, so he wraps them quite convincingly and with little conviction. Even Pasolini's last line of dialogue in a movie that some people seem to be tiny ("Why make a work of art dreaming about it so much sweeter?") - To me, it just makes me wonder why Pasolin would be bothered to make a movie if he felt that way? In my opinion, Fellini's "Satyricon" is a much better film (and more homosexual content). It is also full of strange looking people and absurd situations, but it succeeds because of its pace, direction and strong storytelling, while "decameron" fails because of the same elements.
