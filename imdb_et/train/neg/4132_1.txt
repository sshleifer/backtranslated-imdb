The cinema feature of the early 21st century allows different evil beings and bad guys against each other. We haven't seen a thing like Godzilla v King Kong and the like. It always sounds good on paper when you are splashing and in the blur of good things that you have an inspired idea and you will see the whole game before the Beethoven symphonies. Then you come to write it. Big ideas like all vampires are women. Ergo hot, seductive deadly, but as I want to die. And all the zombies are men. well what men are like women right after they are sold or cheated? So it all looks good until it really happens. Then the abscess begins to enter. Most have a fight. Nothing will happen. Another fight. Philosophical sheet music and cod. We have found Eureka how to win. Great fight again and again. Sounds good, isn't it? If it was an indie company, it would be nice. But it is Hollywood with eyes eyes: shiny, not fans' desire. Everything could have been soaked beautifully.
