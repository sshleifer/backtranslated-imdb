the only enjoyable thing about this highly flattering movie is the "think" of its location. What the Toronto landmark stands for is an American / international location. <br /> <br /> Who knew anti-Christ would be Russian? probably he can't be an american because we need a day to save the day - oh buck ... you tell us the whole truth ... you show us the light ... and make the building be these nasty anti-christers your way. <br /> <br /> Five golden raspberries. Faith is not enough to hope that they will not do the other! We don't have to pray.
