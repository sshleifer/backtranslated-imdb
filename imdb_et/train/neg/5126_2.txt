I rented this movie because I hoped it would be one that the whole family would enjoy. Although the film is family-friendly, my family did not enjoy it because it gives the wrong view to God. If you hear God and follow Him, you will not be guaranteed success. Your football team won't always win. You don't get magically better grades. Infertility has not always improved. You can't always raise. Sometimes you are stuck with an old car. <br /> <br /> God does not exist with every whim. Rather, we were created to glorify Him. Sometimes we glorify Him most when things seem to us to be bad. Christ is to live; Dying is a benefit.
