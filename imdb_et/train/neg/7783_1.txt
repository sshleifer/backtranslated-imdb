Hey HULU.com is playing Elvira's late night horror performance on his site and this movie is called Monsteroid, fun to see how Elvira comments on this Crappy movie. Anyway, this film has very little value to see if the bad 70s were bad effects of Bad Effects, Bad Dialog, just making a bad movie. Avoid this if you don't want to laugh at it. If you're in HULU, check out the other movies that are on them right now, there are 10 episodes, and some are pretty decent movies with good plots and productions that you can watch in 480p if you have the right speed.
