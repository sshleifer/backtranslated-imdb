Last night I got this movie from FX and when I was there, it happened to me that it could be the worst movie. Bad behavior, bad cinematography, bad sound, absolutely unbelievable struggle sequences, stupid characters. All these made it the most ridiculously bad movie I've ever seen. It was so bad I had it amazing because it doesn't mean some kind of half-competence that I had to watch ... and they did a step!
