CARRY ON MATRON was released in 1972 and it turns out that the series has come to a natural end, with the best entries like CLEO, UP KYBER and SCREAMING, which have been in the mid-60s until the end. <br /> <br /> It's not that bad that we saw it all before a thin plot (a bunch of spivs trying to get into the hospital to steal the offer of contraceptive pills they're going to sell to third countries) surrounded by gags. a little fun but complicated in nature. I think this is a problem that is - gags are not all that entertain the intricate character that is starting to show its age. Did we need another movie that uses a woman dressed to control the plot? Perhaps the worst criticism I can make is that I saw CARRY ON MATRON this afternoon, less than twelve hours ago and I have a problem when I try to remember a very funny line. This is a serious problem for comedy
