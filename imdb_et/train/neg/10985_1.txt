I don't know what Margaret Atwood was thinking of to give this film the same name as her book. I've always been a big fan of The Robber Bride and I was so excited to learn that there was a movie in the work. I know that translating a book's movie is not perfect, but that movie was the worst. The names of the women are correct and some of the feedback is correct, but it concerns it. I feel like I lost a good part of my time trying to do it through this movie. It should have been a mini series to tell the story of how it was written. -Louise Parker. I just want them to have a better manuscript because it wasn't at all related to the book at all.
