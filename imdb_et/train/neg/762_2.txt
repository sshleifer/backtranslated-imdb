Loyalty to Peter Falk is all that kept me from providing the terrible picture (1) he served. (That is why loyalty to Mr Falk was what kept me from watching the movie from head to tail.) Even if you gave all the outstanding mistakes, it was just a TV "Columbo movie ever. I'm glad you watched it on TV for free; hated that they would have cut down on the printed matter.
