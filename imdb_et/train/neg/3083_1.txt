... Bad is deliberately bad ... <br /> <br /> This little pearl was shot directly on the big screen of MST3k. Although it is obvious that the film is not being taken seriously (hopefully their goal, anyway ...), the film is still bad. Hell, this makes Leprechaun In Space a big budget ... <br /> <br /> In short: Color my muscle car plum painted!
