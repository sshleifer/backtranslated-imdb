If you don't know where many conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas about UN, Israel, and international relations come from, look, this is not a supernatural Hollywood film based on a somewhat biblical passage. This film was made by Cloud Ten Pictures, which had a political and religious agenda. As a film, the end result sometimes looks more like the clips of a television program (with family prayers and the breaking of light through church windows when the harps are playing). <br /> <br /> For mainstream viewers, this may be hard to believe, but many people believe this stuff literally, as shown in the movie. And this may make the film important. You probably won't find a significant number of strange views of your fellow citizens. So, if you look at it, look at it as a social / cultural document. If you have any media experience at all, you do not have to be warned about the uncomfortable attempts of film propaganda and manipulation.
