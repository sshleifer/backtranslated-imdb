Tobe Hooper has made great movies so I was sure it couldn't be BAD. I did not read the comments and did not try to watch this inadvertently humorous movie. Sometimes it made me laugh, sometimes I almost fell asleep, sometimes I put myself on almost a CRY for the Cooper. <br /> <br /> I appreciated it 3/10 because his 1990 "horror" -movie and many interesting or funny things happened there. Throughout the film, I thought of something like "they just can't add more stuff to this movie ..." but they did it. <br /> <br /> Some say it's a kind of Firestarter clone, but it's not really. It is based on this idea, but it is all. It is a combination of horror, comedy, strange religion / god things, funny gore, simple effects, drama, terrible action, incredible script ... and more. <br /> <br /> Spoilers * The story is: The government is trying to create a final weapon that uses nuclear power or something and does not work, during the process a child is born to 2 subjects. When a mother sings for a child after birth, both her husband and wife are burning and this is SPONTANEOUS. The government is burying the whole thing and leaving this child to live with other people and ... then after x years this child has grown up and understands that he was born for a reason and who can burn things with his brain. Then all the incredible dirty things that actually explain something, and .. Well, when the government realizes that it is now capable of putting this fire to work, they take it to a normal hospital where they have some kind of kernel that they're going to use with this man could kill him, they can't shoot him! .. and argh, I think it's enough to say, I promise that there are 100 more strange things in this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, if you want a good laugh, look at it. Gosh.
