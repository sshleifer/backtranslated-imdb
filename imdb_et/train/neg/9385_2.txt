The IMDb's "Trivia" page says filmmakers protested because the studio created this film to "simplify the plot". If so, this effort was a complete failure, as it is one of the most inconsistent stories I've ever seen in the film - I wouldn't want to see it before the plot was "simplified". It is sad to see Warren with so little character that even if he can't do something wrong. It is interesting to see Caron in his 70's instead of his Hollywood glamor and staff, but it is sad to see him unhappy through his own-producer-spouse. Later he joined the director and marries instead - whoever notices, never ever directed, but did strictly 1. or 2. A.D. That should tell you enough. <br /> <br /> I call it "interesting" because I have the automatic sensitivity of American films of this era, and this role adds Oates to the otherwise fantastic 1971 - Lane Blacktop, a hired hand. But "the detective of the 1940s as the outflow of water from the 1970s to L.A." The theme that is the only thing the film really has to say is sold too hard. A similar topic will be dealt with much more effectively two years later in Altman's The Long Goodbye. And when Oates played the dead guy dead, three years later, he gave his final appearance to Brend Me, Alfredo Garcia's leader. If you haven't seen them, don't waste your time with it!
