What is the idea of ​​watching such a movie? It is painfully and embarrassingly bad, not even in a way that allows you to joke. <br /> <br /> Movies like "The Little Man" push me. They represent the most disposable film. This film was made for 18-24 year olds whom the studio hoped to come out of, and see it on the opening night before the word fell out, how bad it was, so the movie could quickly get back to a hundred other filmmakers with great ideas, not probably made their films because the resources were in the hope of this vomiting. <br /> <br /> Rating: F
