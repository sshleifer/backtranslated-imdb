Come to Tina Fey, you can do it better. As soon as the movie started, I knew how it ended. Of course it was funny. Even laugh out loud. But there is not enough laugh to record this movie. I don't recommend buying it. I recommend renting it the most, but that's all. Baby Mama has some funny scenes, but it's predictable and has no heart-warming end he's trying. <br /> <br /> Tina Fey and Amy Poalher made a good team. Mean Girls is one of my favorite films. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher did such a great job and did it well. But that's not the best. The baby's mother was a great supportive cast. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver, and Steve Martin add a lot of pain. <br /> <br /> Another pregnancy film has hit the cinema world. After a lot of knocking, Juno sees Baby Mama as very average in comparison. Knocked and Juno is fun, warm-hearted and have ends that leave a smile on your face. The baby's mother's end was uncomfortable and boring. <br /> <br /> The baby's mother wasn't the best comedy of the year and she wasn't trying to be. I recommend this, but don't expect it to be completely fun. Wait for the average comedy that doesn't give a great emotional end to what it is trying to do. I Give Baby Mama ..... <br /> <br /> 4/10
