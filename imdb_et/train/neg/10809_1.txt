This is the worst film I've ever seen. I watched this movie with friends and after 40 minutes we had enough. The plot was bad and there was no pleasant character. I became more static looking more entertaining. I gave this movie 1 just because the scale didn't turn into negative numbers. Avoid this movie at all costs.
