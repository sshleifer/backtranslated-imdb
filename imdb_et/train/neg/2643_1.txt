The lack of a better definition makes the film terrible. Where I Start ...... <br /> <br /> Cinemaphotography - It was perhaps the worst thing I saw this year. It seemed that the camera was thrown from the camera into a male camera. Maybe they had only one camera. This gives you the feeling that you are volleyball. <br /> <br /> There are a number of scenes that are randomly thrown and have no consistency at all. When they did the "split screen", it was absurd. Everything was shaken in the apartment, it seemed ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Color tones were far away. These people must learn to balance the camera. This "film" is badly done and badly done. <br /> <br /> Plot - You have to be fun. If I was an SS agent, I would complain to the manufacturers. It looked like Marks Brothers radio and weapons. Sutherland was in his "24" mode - I see it for free. Eva Longoria would have been a little less and showed much more. Like bimbo, he wasn't much. <br /> <br /> I didn't see a real plot except for Douglas, who appeared to be the president's spouse. He never said why mercenaries tried to die. I'm just not seeing the President of the United States in a useful tunnel of his life, like a rat maze. p-1-e-a-s. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is dead. This movie is proof. I like the "big screen". It is because I was a child. Much more such films and I finish. What is the Hollywood thing that made so many chicks, forget how to make a real movie? When I own a theater, I'm gonna play old films. Real actors, good story - and good Cinemaphotography. <br /> <br /> This movie is a dog. Don't waste your time or money. I rate this movie to zero! Douglas is not suitable for this role. I can look at her age, but she just has to take it away.
