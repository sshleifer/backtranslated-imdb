Jean-Marc Barr (Being Light, Big Blue, Dogville) has directed and interpreted this strange film, which is the second part of a trilogy. I may be wrong, but I don't think this film is part of Dogma '95 Manifesto, although it looks really out. I'm not quite sure about this movie. All participants are good. They are giving good results, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. The story is somehow interesting. But I don't know there is something like that I don't like. Sex scenes are too long. It's going to be an interesting work of art in erotic crap that I don't know exactly. Of course, this is not a bad movie, but I don't recommend people seeing it and I'm not telling them they don't look. Just do as you like. If you are curious and open, give it a try.
