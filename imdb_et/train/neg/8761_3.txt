My girlfriend has a habit of going to Blockbuster and choosing movies that nobody has ever heard of. True, sometimes it has brought some fun discoveries. Often it is best to say that they are definitely an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> He brought home "Tips from Caterpillar." He was excited because, according to the box, it was funny. For us, it is fortunate that box propaganda never lies. <br /> <br /> This movie was patience. This is one of those films where, if you are not a pretentious and low-profile person who likes to watch movies, you hate every movie's character. Up to one nice character. Which leading annoying pretentious character is in love and acts so that everyone in the real world would drive away. <br /> <br /> PERFECT SPOILERS HERE TO BE <br /> <br /> So a bunch of emotionally coiled, stuck, pretentious artists swear by love and succeed in their careers. Then they meet a nice, intelligent, emotionally mature and loving (almost perfect man). Then we look at the woman, the annoying pretentious artist (in her 30s?), When she falls in love. So she tries to escape from a nice, intelligent, emotionally mature man and stay married to a man with whom she has been a very, but empty sex. He is rude to the man and does everything in his power to take him away. In the real world, he would have been quite successful. I definitely wanted to escape from him and I wasn't even with him! <br /> <br /> While it's nice that the man "fought for his love", I didn't want him to get him. (Not even my girlfriend) She doesn't deserve her. And why did I think the director thought the "almost perfect man" should be punished if he had to win a relationship with him? When the artist asked the "almost perfect man" to leave, we shouted that he would leave. The film has a problem when the movie's heroine is so annoying, childish and stupid that you want him to fail. <br /> <br /> In addition, let me say that Andy Dick made me laugh a few times even though his character was also a reluctance. In other letters, they worked well, morally bankrupt and annoying signs. <br /> <br /> This is a comedy and I can say I smiled a few times in the movie. Unfortunately, not a lot of laughs happened in the last 10 minutes. But by the time I smiled at them, I had prayed that the film would end for too long. I needed these coat characters out of my life. <br /> <br /> If you want to see people you hate to fight against people they don't deserve, it's a movie for you.
