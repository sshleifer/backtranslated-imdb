All X-Men movies were great. And I mean to all of them, including the old hate X-Men 3. They were solid characters (Magneto and Xavier were the best in my opinion) and a good story. <br /> <br /> I was all excited when I heard the movie production, and my expectations grew bigger and bigger until I saw the movie. I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best movie is The Fountain, though you don't know about this movie when they're talking about an actor) and it's not the one that screws up the movie. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is afflicted by a lot of meaningless characters that don't add anything to a plot (such as Blob or Gambit) that was thrown into it, so fans would believe that filmmakers had to read the original comics. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of XMen, I've read a lot, a lot of their stories, and this movie didn't respect them. Missing. Not even consistency. It does not respect the relationship between the Weapon X project and Wolverine and Sabretooth or Emma Fros, the stupid motivation is a common fool and is seen in millions of films: Revenge for the Death of a Beloved Person. <br /> <br /> Oh. What I was expecting was the whole dear movie was a moment similar to Wolverine, as he is in school at X2, when Stryker's men come and he alone destroys enemy troops, but hey, it's Fox, it's a family, it's Fox, you does not see explicit violence the most violent and frightening hero of Marvel. <br /> <br /> Besides, I had the constant dejá vù of this movie because Wolverine's origins have already been explained in X2, we already know how he got his adamantum skeleton, so it doesn't make sense to make a movie we already know. <br /> <br /> I personally believe that wolverine is one of the few characters that does not require a strong story because the mystery is a character of nature. Do we really want to know how Joker got his scars?
