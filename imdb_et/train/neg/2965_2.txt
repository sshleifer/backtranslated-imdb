This movie was kind of interesting ... I had to look at it about the college class in India, but in conclusion, this movie says this movie is about one thing if it doesn't contain much detailed information about these details. The conclusion is not true until it ends when they tried to link all the elements. However, the Gore factor is great. Even at the very beginning you want to look at it because gore is quite intense. Watch this movie only if you want to see some cool gore, because the plot is thin and makes you sad that you are wasting time listening to this time. I've seen rumors on other websites that are about this movie based on real events, but you don't get any information about it on the web ... so basically this movie was a waste of viewing time.
