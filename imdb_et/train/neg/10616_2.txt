Dire. Just terrible. The script is animated, painful, and the story just drags. This is undoubtedly a Sally Potter and a small otherwise party. It wouldn't be so bad, but he's a film director, writer and star, and that's just self-esteem. I found that I didn't care about the evolving romance between the two main characters, and the end didn't come too fast. It has two redemption functions. First, many pictures are pretty pretty, especially in Paris, and they look rather black and white. Secondly, whether you're a tango fan or not, music is great, great (unless Sally starts singing). Watch this movie at your own risk or if you want to laugh unintentionally. I'm sure it will turn to someone. It must be statistically.
