I have no idea what the idiots gave this movie to the Palm D'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival because it was cruel! I just looked at the whole thing just because I couldn't believe someone was making such a worthless movie. There is nothing interesting about the plot, the characters are not deep and there is no attempt to give some atmosphere to music or sound effects. Also, if you decide to give up this two-hour life by watching this movie, be sure to bring something to catch up, because cinematography is just someone running around with the camcorder for half a time, which you can't even see on the main topics. This style has been used more successfully in films like "Blair Witch" because it skips. There's no plot or stop at Rosetta that this style would borrow. I should have felt better when it came 2 o'clock in the morning when it was terrible.
