Bounce !!! I got this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it. I was disappointed when I found out he was at the end of two short scenes. Apart from that, I was basically hit all the time back and forth. Some teenagers go to Romania with their father and can bite the wolf and become a full-fledged werewolf. He kills his father and friends. About 30 years ago, but he did not move a bit and enrolled in high school. There he meets a shy teacher whom he finally bites and has children with him. This movie was sucked and I don't recommend it to anyone. Read war and peace instead. Only Mrs Hartman did an excellent job. Get to know a very young Bob Saget!
