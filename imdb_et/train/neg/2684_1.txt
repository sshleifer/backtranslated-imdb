I found a movie for offensive Americans who lost someone in the tower, generally for the American people. Assuming that it is a terrible respect for the facts, every leader happened that every leader uses polemaking with old facts (not related to a terrorist attack) or to criticize American political behavior or to compare different political situations as they have their own country with nothing to do, or to share with 11th of September cruelty. Woe to them.
