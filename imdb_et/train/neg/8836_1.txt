This is not an art, it's a suburban, politically correct propaganda! Jindabyne's political intolerance is beyond unforgivable ... it does not see people as individuals, but rather as members of categories. <br /> <br /> This is the most patronizing offensive Australian movie I ever remember (and it is over) against pretty strong competition!). The message film, every tired subject loved by the trendy left, is: aborigines are victims; white men are violent or alcoholic; White women are not so bad - especially if they are lesbians - but they are probably depressive. <br /> <br /> The four men who are fishing will find the body of the killed woman (aboriginal, of course) and leave it on the river for several days as they catch the plant. This is a strange decision that has been made almost without discussion as if men were animals. One person who briefly demorits is good ... we know it because he lives with a bisexual woman - he loves to keep his baby a lot - and eventually moves into a fashionable shore location (away from all those living bushes)). <br /> <br /> This is a movie made by these trendy urbanists living in front of the Australian landscape and the evil redneck inside them. It's ignorance of the life of the country almost as shocking as its contempt. The film captures a long distance view of the bush, supported by predictions, mysterious music. After all, it is very clear that the only home aborigines are in this landscape. Finally, this is an unreliable scene of monochrome reconciliation. <br /> <br /> In Jindabyne, rural life will be a little bit less than the story of indirectly exalting the values ​​of an enlightened left city. people live with other Australians. <br /> <br /> This movie was not made by real-life people, funded by the government film fund Corporation. This is a product of an artistic set, a breathless breath populated by beautiful people, for whom the overwhelming financial support supports these patronizing offensive projects (separated from real life as possible), rather than popular films that people want to see. It doesn't matter if the movie is smelly, they still get a reward. <br /> <br /> Get rid of the waste of time, avoid it like a plague. More filmed in social commentary than real entertainment, this movie deserves pan!
