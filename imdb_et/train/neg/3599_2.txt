Umm .. I was quite surprised that nobody really gave this movie a high place. <br /> <br /> Facing ... Tori's spelling is not a great actor .. and this film proves his talent. "The plot was weak ... I bet the dork that came with this concept was a perverse peep If this film has a good thing, I would say it is a daughter of Tommy Chong, precisely because she is her daughter ... and then it is that a soap-opera-ish man who is good is doing it a little more attractive but no longer helps with its dramatic abilities. * Why does IMDb require at least 10 lines? How many other ways can you say "This movie sucks"?
