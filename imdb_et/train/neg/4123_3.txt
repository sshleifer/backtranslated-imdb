Although the beginning shows that all the quiet west coast is this stupid and superficial war version much worse than its much better modern. It depicts the funnest war that was once fought, the first year and a half dedicated to romance and good times. <br /> <br /> When we finally see some battle, is it flat: an enemy plane flying over? Shoot it down (at one end). Sniper Tree? Kill him before he fires. Enemy soldiers in the woods? Don't worry, they're happy to give you over. Ho-hum. <br /> <br /> Bad, marketable, predictable ... <br /> <br />
