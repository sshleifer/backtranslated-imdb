This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars I've spent for a very long time. If you knew how often I went to the movies you would probably say, it's hard to imagine, but never less, it's true! After seeing the trailer of the movie, I knew I had to see it! If you are a fan of horror, mystery and intercourse, why not? The trailer is nothing more than interesting and exciting; Unfortunately, this movie is not one of them. <br /> <br /> From cinema to script, this movie is completely flop. If you read this, you are planning to go to a movie that is waiting for some excitement, understanding, action, horror or something other than wasting hours and forty-five minutes, I'm afraid you're frustrated. > <br /> "Why is it so bad," you can ask yourself. Let me tell you. The film was neither mysterious nor suspicious. Nothing about the film gave me the "edge", the scared or the curious. The script was the most ridiculous. There were many times in the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous that I started writing it as a comic weapon in just a few seconds that it wasn't. Operation was absolutely terrible. I like Nicholas Cage, but it was gone. Without exception, the performance of each of these films was incredibly below average. The cinema was terrible, no break or mystery. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie miles away. <br /> <br /> I am not usually a very tough critic. Frankly, when I go to see the comedy I want to laugh at and when I see my mystery / holy / horror, I just want to be surprised. This film was boring, badly behaved, poorly written and overwhelming. Do yourself a favor and go for something else.
