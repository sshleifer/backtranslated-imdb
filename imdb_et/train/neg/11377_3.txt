Okay. starters, the taxi driver is amazing. it is not a taxi driver or amazing. what is it bad. but I thought it was a bad joke, which means it has some redeeming qualities. like dialog ... wow. there were almost no plots, the characters were all stupid and the film was preaching. there were some places where I thought the film would dive into a taxi driver type violence that would have hit the message much harder at the end of the movie. I can't even believe that 20 people have seen such a movie. Yes, it is worth checking out if you are real bored and want to reaffirm that everyone can make a movie or at least try it out.
