"ASTONISHING" Hitting the front of the LA Times DVD box. They must have referred to the fact that such an excusable piece was ever released. The film revolves around a number of girls who have a disease that forces them to become cannibals and murder innocent people to live. The skin's skin reflects the whole movie, we also see broken legs, heads, etc. that are about as convincing as the Halloween Fuzzy Felt set. There's a lot of talk about b * ll **, a little bit of human cuisine and some strange zombie hunter who puts the sufferers of this disease in their closet, sitting on a chair before they break their head. Bits ... <br /> <br /> Get the picture. Given that the exhibited talent is not at all displayed, and gore is ridiculously unrealistic, what is the point of this whole place? Again, looking at the video box, the man in charge is the "underground cult leader". Would it be like those strange religious cultures where they wash the brain to think in one way, clearly the opposite? Because that's the only possible reason I think somebody gets stolen from this tax debt. Then he compares the same point with Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and George Romero. HAHAHAHAHA oh stop it. Now you're just silly. <br /> <br /> Do you like this movie? Are you offended by the aforementioned opinion? If so, you must be a member of this cult. Will they pay your salary? Do they see other family members? Will they force you to watch Andrew Parkinson's movies until you think he is the best director from A.Hitchcock? Don't say ... it sounds like a special brewing for Panorama. And say hello to the LA critic when you return to your colony? 0/10
