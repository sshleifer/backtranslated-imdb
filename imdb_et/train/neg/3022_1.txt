I was very excited about this movie when I saw the previews. I usually see a preview of this preview and buy the movie directly. Something told me that ... you know it first. I'm glad I did. Keira Knightley destroyed all future films for me. 2. In the Pirates movie, when he came out, I went to see it. I only saw Domino Harvey and I hated him more for that. I think it was related to her hair and had to cut Domino briefly. <br /> <br /> Domino Who? Who is Domino Harvey? I still don't really know. I don't know who he was in real life or who he was in this movie. I didn't care about her character, and even Keira, who got partially naked, didn't make it worth the movie. The direction was definitely missing. Writing was small and low. Editing was terrible. I don't mind this style as its bad overuse. There's a place there. A good example of dirty, MTV styles, color editing (not sure if there is an official name) would be Fight Club; just over my head. Even the country's enemy had a semi-similar editing style in some parts. It was used tastefully and was not used as a crunch. I mean, it's the same guy who led Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott give me your time. <br /> <br /> I understand there are many people in this movie. I think the idea that you fully love or hate this movie is a fair assessment. Frankly, I hate it.
