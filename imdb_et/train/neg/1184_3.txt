this film had a pretty sounding plot, but the pasta was very slow ... indeed very slow. even if someone thinks it's a cult classic, I think it's much better to watch movies of that time. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is not great, but not the worst. sounds are OK. Lighting OK. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than a film student. <br /> <br /> The movie does not contain music and horses have sex t make it good. and the woman who masturbated on the edge of the bed was a fool. <br /> <br /> There is no winning, skipping this boring boredom. I'm worse about believing me, but it's just a waste of time and I don't get good comments here. especially high ratings ...
