The first one was the best. Another sucked because the dialogue was terrible. Although the story was not so bad (in fact, all the story lines are good and bad). Throughout the movie, I released a few times. I know Jackie Chan is a great martial arts experience, but not a good actor at Rush Hour. 2. Chris Tucker wasn't good either. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, a few lines, terrible action (but it's based on his script). All the characters were not so good. But some of the things I like about Rush Hour 2 are always action and less sex scenes. I know Jackie Chan is not doing the things that are good for him.
