I put this movie in a hotel room to attract my children in the morning when we went home because I had packed all my toys. (Toddlers don't want to look at "Regis and KAthie Lee" or "The View".) My four-year-old found one scene funny, but told me the rest was "too silly." It's four years old, people. Anyone who is over nine years old wants to kill their television rather than let it play. <br /> <br /> Because this movie is bad, there was little mistake in the Holocaust. There are no words about how ridiculous and totally terrible this "movie" really is. Action is bad, the plot is stupid and the script is pathetic. Since it should be a comedy, the fact that you can't even laugh at the movie's mischief makes it even worse. Bronson "Balki" Pinchot is the worst with some strange accents (Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun as far as I could say), but all characters are terrible. I haven't looked at the real Laurel and Hardy movie age, but I know they were supposed to be better than that. What is the point of destroying the classic comic duo with ... it? <br /> <br /> Lower line: Derivative. Avoid having any Bronson Pinchot fetish at all costs. 2/10
