Dynasty revisited in Hawaii ... With all the clich√©s, very predictable, unrealistic and sometimes even stupid. If you have nothing better to do, it offers 40 minutes of simple, modest entertainment, an endless look at large men's and women's muscles, and great photography from the spectacular Hawaiian landscape. On the other hand, if you are looking for something more, leave it away ... <br /> <br /> Oh, and by the way, if you've ever worked in a hotel or know something about it, you have two options: 1. You feel bad about each every two minutes if it shows that the show is presenting Hotel Business, or 2. Look at it as a science fiction, as I did, lie down, relax and laugh at it!
