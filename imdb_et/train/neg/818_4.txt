This film is remarkable for three reasons. <br /> <br /> First of all, with the success of the two "Superman" series, this small budget feature was released to theaters, celebrating George Reeves and Phyllis Coates. original performances such as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the hole is reused in the series. Outside Silby, the six-mile deep oil penetrates well into the hollow ground, allowing mole-men to enter. Forget about other holes (those that are on the plot). Secondly, unlike most of the SF's fifty-year penetration films, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) role in accepting and fulfilling tolerance and differences against a post-segregated vigilant mobile. There is no "light medication" here! Clark Kent, aware and confident, takes control of the whole situation ("I'm working on it!"), Even helping the hospital dress to remove the Mole-ball from the ball! As a Superman, he is weaker than Clark feisty towards Lewis, but there is also a voice of reason and tolerance when he runs against vigilants like "Nazi storm groups". Thirdly, you will notice that the transition from Fleisher-like animation on animated Superman flight to two series has been made to "live action" in "Superman Adventures".
