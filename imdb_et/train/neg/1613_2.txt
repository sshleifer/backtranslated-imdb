Now that Che (2008) has finished a relatively short Australian cinematographer (extremely limited release: 1 screen in Sydney, after 6 weeks), I can get into both "Movie" hosts for Stilt Soderberg's task. > <br /> Watching a film director is usually peaceful about changing his style / subject, but Soderberg's latest stinker, The Girlfriend Experience (2009), didn't have a story, so narrative (and editing) suddenly seems to be Soder's main challenge. Strange, after 20 years in business. He was probably never good at the story, just hiding it well in the "nervous" project. <br /> <br /> None of this frees him from the current, almost devilish failure. As David Stratton warns, "the two parts of Che do not (even) heal". <br /> <br /> The epic biopsy only in the name, Che (2008) doesn't qualify as a feature film! Certainly not on this foot because only this history's imperfect resolution is that the Soderbergh 4.5-hour generation is just nowhere. <br /> <br /> Even Margaret Pomeranz, the more forgiving Australian films, Duo noted Soderberg's recurring waste (HD digital recording): "You're in the woods ... you're in the woods ... you're in the woods ...". I am also surprised that Soderbergh did not give us another 2.5 hours of what was there somewhere between his existing two parts, because he was still out of the big Che's revolutionary life! <br /> <br /> For an important but notorious historical biopsy, Soderbergh, if not deliberately insults, alienates his audience, never offering most of Che's story; <br /> <br /> 2. Introducing unreasonable movie lengths with mere repetition; <br /> <br /> 3. Ignoring both the real retrospective and the event narrative; <br /> <br /> 4. barely developing an idea or character; <br /> <br /> 5. remain claustrophobic episodic; <br /> <br /> Ignoring the proper context of Scene 6 - Whatever we can, breaks in disturbing times; <br /> <br /> 7. linguistically removing all audiences (even Spanish-speaking people confuse English-speaking exhibits); and <br /> <br /> 8. Unintentionally one of the dimensions of your main theme. Why, at this late stage? The T-shirt franchise has been a success! <br /> <br /> The sense of claustrophobia is certainly thanks to Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen, which is based only on Guevara's memories. So, as a poor student who has assigned only one of the texts he has appointed to perform his task, Soderbergh's product is extremely limited from the perspective. <br /> <br /> Audiences are held captive in the same limited knowledge, landscapes, and circumstances as "revolutionary", but it does not cause our compassion. Instead of dreaming about us, "Ah, Soderbergh is trying to hobble his audience just like Latino peasants". But these are the same illiterate Latino peasants who sold a good doctor to their enemies. Why does Soderbergh feel the need to equate them and keep us equally spiritually imprisoned? Such an audience must be expedient. Part2 is more chronological than Part 1, but it is literally due to the lack of curves of the shrubs, the prospects of misery and variety or character. DelToro's Che has no chance to grow as a person when he is fighting for educating his criminals. The only letup is humor when Che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant "revolutionary", some of whom are not violently local peasants or food. We certainly do not get any idea of ​​what caused the conditions, nor any strategic analysis of their guerrilla rebels, as it was. Part2's tortured backplane is still scary episodic: again, there is nothing telegraphic or contextualized. Thus, even Fidel Castro's (Demián Bichir) scenes are unexpected and disturbing. All selected events have been minimally and centrally depicted, with Part1 interviews being replaced by time-shift meetings between corrupt President of Bolivia (Joaquim de Almeida) and US government officials, allowing CIA intervention (!). <br /> <br /> The rest of the Part2 "forests" and the blue 24-hour filter filter the audience just as they look at the exits. <br /> <br /> Perhaps DelToro was too concerned about the disappointment of many non-Americans when they never got the real and thoughtful history that Che uses in their country. If foreign governments still do not give their people free press - for whatever reason - then one can see how a popular American indie producer can attract not so well-read ("I may not be able to read or write, but I'm not illiterate ! ”- cf. Inspector (1949) for their local cinemas: The obvious neglect and great simplifications of the film strongly suggest that it is only aimed at understanding less well-informed WHO STILL SPEAK LITTLE English. and have criticized the corresponding social issues - to learn the lessons of history as they should. <br /> <br /> These perceptions are just what societies still need - and not just the rest of the illiterate latinos in Central and South America - but that's it What Che (2008) can't do for his job Soderbergh strikes his lead because he is a narrative weak. See Benicio DelToro deliberately chose Soderberg for this project if he knew it. It has been 44 years, and I was very pleased about the Guevara retrospect: this is what I was going to look at for this film, but the director steals us foolishly. <br /> <br /> David Stratton, writing in Australian (03-October 2009), noted that although Part1 was "uneven," Part2 "goes down there quickly", charting Che's final campaign in Bolivia in an embarrassing "," which ... feels almost unbearably slow and marketable. "Che: Guerilla or Part2 is definitely not a Bolivia travel description, which is a picture of sadness and atavism. dramatic - but tragic - capture and execution of the subject of the film. <br /> <br /> The rest of this infinite cinema blood is simply distracting, annoying misery - harshly, for Soderbergh movie, to be avoided at all costs. even know the substance that is strange about this topic (2/10)
