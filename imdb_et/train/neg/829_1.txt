I heard about this movie and knew it wasn't really good. But I started watching the movie (on my movie channel) and I was interested. It can be a really big, dark black satire in the contemporary morals of the media. Small competitions for each competitor were good. It creates something I would not want to miss. But if the so-called show starts everything becomes incredible, cheap and quite silly. Here is where the writer should have added something that would make people think. But instead, it's packed and assuming people are stupid. <br /> <br /> The end is so bad that I give it to 1. Even if the movie starts with promising.
