Well, I have to say that this movie was so bad that I would have walked out if I didn't have to look at it. And if the worst part is, I wanted to see it so badly that I drove all over the city, I paid twice $ 10 for parking because the list of newspapers was wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the man he always does - the only time I saw him was someone else in the movie with John Travolt. Anyway, the plot has a potential - it sounded very good in the preview, but it is full of completely ridiculous, predictable, weak plot turning points. And I was hoping it would be one of the Christmas movies where Christmas DIDN doesn't have to be rescued, and that Santa didn't need a substitute game, but speed. I'm sure this movie would be great for young children, but it's so lively for adults that it's a chore.
