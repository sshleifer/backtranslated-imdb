I stopped with BB and started watching 4 zombies over the weekend. Now, I understand that the effects are cheesy, acting on sub-par, and the set is suspect. So I don't expect much. But it should have at least a story. Stories don't cost anything except time ..... apparently they didn't have any time. <br /> <br /> "Zombie Nation" had 5 zombies that appeared at the end of the movie to all seemed like a new wave whore. The movie never shows a zombie image on the front. It was absolutely embarrassing to look and he had nothing to offer to the genre. <br /> <br /> Operating time is only 81 minutes, but it looked like 2 hours. According to my wife (who could hear the movie because she was in another room on the computer), it sounded like a zombie porn .... which, if you think, sounds harsh ..... but it wasn't even that good. <br /> <br /> The only suggestion I can make is that the writer tried to do too many things and ended up inconsistent. <br /> <br /> It was finally a free rental and I still feel. I rated it out of 10 out of 10 because IMDb doesn't allow me to use a decimal point.
