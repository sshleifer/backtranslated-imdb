... but it makes you think we had something first! This movie is as bad as any horrible horror of today. The man is going around with the ladies with half-plates, trying to decide which one to kill so he can give his girlfriend a new body. One scene involves the person hitting the circle and putting the whole set over three minutes, covering everything that has to be over ten gallon of blood. The film also attempts to create the feeling that what a man does with his girlfriend is wrong and against nature, but the film is so badly made that the audience cannot make any sense of shock or resentment. This movie can't even get in the dark and embarrassingly embarrassing of its title directly - start-ups say "The brain that won't die", but the final credits list it as "The Head that won't die".
