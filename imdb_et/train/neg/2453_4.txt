Perhaps I have rated this movie higher before Peter Jackson's trilogy came out, but their two side-by-side sightings are simply unparalleled. The pace of this movie is rushing, many important scenes in the book are omitted and the character is scarce. Animation is a strange mix of traditional cartoon drawings and live scenes painted over what I found disturbing. And the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks down in the middle of the story and is never ready. There are some good points - the battle scenes are exciting, and the dialogue follows a lot of the book. See if you hurry and can't spend 10 hours watching a new trilogy. But if you haven't read the book, it's probably confusing because there is a lot missing from this version. 4 out of 10.
