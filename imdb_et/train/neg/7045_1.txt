It must be the worst, and I mean the worst biker movie ever made! And it says a lot, because the line of stinkers is long and smelly! <br /> <br /> Now at least we know what happened to Ginger after he was rescued from Gilligan Island! Scary looking Tina Louise (obviously afraid someone will see this confusion!) There is a stranded driver tortured by the most repressive motorcycle gang in film history. But don't worry about fans! Batman, I mean Adam West as a hick-town doctor! Pow! Crush! Boom! Saint Toledo Batman! <br /> <br /> The only good "bomb" points are some cute women, some ridiculous fighting scenes and still "sexy" Tina Louise!
