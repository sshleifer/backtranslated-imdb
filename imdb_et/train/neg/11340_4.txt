This is certainly one of the most strange films - even for Fellini. Only one more bizarre is her SATYRICON. It is a two and a half hour long strange unique world, decadence, wealth and sexual challenge. Sutherland makes curiously unforgettable Casanova and strange moves in a number of independent vignettes taken from the great lover's autobiography, letting the viewer get involved. However, the direction of art and costume design are outgoing. The Academy ignored the non-nomination of the former candidate, but did justice to the latter, giving the latter an OSCAR. It was also called (strangely) an inseparable, pointless and almost undesirable scenario. Get your finger !! The movie clip is only 150 minutes, 16 minutes shorter than the original working time. This viewer was grateful.
