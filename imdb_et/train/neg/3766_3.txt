I went to watch this movie knowing it wasn't great. but what I saw was terrible in words. I don't want to be tough, its just a movie was terrible. In general, it was bad, I mean the special effects of AWFUL, operation was not too bad, but it was neither good nor sasquatch itself was ... well, not sasquatch. I think the best sasquatch movie is Harry and Henderson. it is not violent or spooky, but it has the best sasquatch image. at least its a suit and not a half-ass cgi rip-off. see this movie only if you are desperate or appreciate someone in the movie. or watch the boondock saints, it's much better.
