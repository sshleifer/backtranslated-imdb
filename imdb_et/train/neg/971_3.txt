After reading very good comments on this movie, I thought I'd give him a watch and after a very disappointed movie, I thought I'd give him an overview. This is my first so bare with me. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to chew the genre, because it is by no means terrible or scary (except for some weak attempts to make the jump, which one worked for me.) I would say that calling this movie throws a thriller this because I wasn't particularly excited! The film is a corrupt, playful girl who glows a few times. In these times, he visits the house he has drawn, after every visit he decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively, one of these features is a sad little boy who is also ill. When he interacts with his boyfriends friends, he understands that his imaginary world is actually better than in the real world where he is. As long as he adds a house to his constantly absent father, his father turns out to be evil because of his failure, and he and the boy must flee their clutches. <br /> <br /> Think it's a slightly softer version of the nightmare on Elm Street, but it's more like a trip to the beach. <br /> <br /> Overall, my generous 3/10 will hopefully stop at least one of you watching this drab!
