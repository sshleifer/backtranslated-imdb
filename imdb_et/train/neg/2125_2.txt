If I hadn't been forced to watch it for work, I would never have done it in the first 10 minutes. And even then, I testify that I will pass through parts quickly. The '63 'film version was far better in all aspects. Yes, I have read that it is more faithful to the original game, but what a smart thing was that the writer changed the script '63! It's long-lasting, it pulls, songs that are in this version and not in the film version are boring and unimaginable. The "Kids" version of '63 'was a very funny and real classic of sarcastic parent humor. In this version, Kim is too old, Conrad is * absolutely terrible * to see (if someone hanged his shirt, I interrupted the nasty ... the director of this version has no idea what is sexy.). This Conrad can't dance, can't sing (he can't even tune in) and is just reluctant. Had Elvis Presley really been, her career would have ended before it began. As for the other actors, I waited for Alexander's toupee to fall down when he danced and Daly was completely emmen. Watch Stapleton's action in the film version to see the same role that someone who understands comic timing plays. This TV version is nothing but a waste of time.
