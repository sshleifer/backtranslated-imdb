Such storytelling is unacceptable The only reason this film is out of 10 lines out of 5 stars is because it is backed by George Lucas and its title includes "Star" and "Wars". It is an insult to offensive filmmakers and many others who have made clearly better films with a higher story, writing and acting, but did not get credit. It's travesty. <br /> <br /> First things. Story. Anakini Development? Missing. After a little make-up around the eyes and a little yelling there is no. He gets young, stupid, fucking Anakin Skywalker with Darth Vader in one shot. The only thing Darth Vader had in the original series was his intelligence, how good he was almost everything he did, planning, fighting, you called it. The only consistent thing about Anakin, which is perceived in the prequel trilogy, is his consistent stupidity. She even loses her body because she is stupid spicy. <br /> <br /> What part of Emperor Palpatine tells him that the Sith legends don't indicate that Emperor is Sith? Unacceptable! <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes used too much digital doubling. Everyone rides all over the place, like bears, in an incredible doll house. Count Dooku, Emperor Palpatine, Anakin, Obi-Wan, almost every fighter had a digital double jump of rubber. <br /> <br /> In a specific battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin, they both actually paused and parked in the middle to twist their sabers a few times, while interrupted by the customs. I understand that the struggles are choreographed, but it just got my head shaking disbelief and disgust. <br /> <br /> Writing was terrible. The whole dialogue was of very low quality. Good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman made their line in the best possible way, but it was just not enough. I can't say anything bad about this movie. Too many special effects, prints holes that are larger than the center of the universe, and absolutely no symbols. This is the biggest mistake of this movie: nothing new is offered. We all know the picture, all Lucas did that color. <br /> <br /> We knew Anakin lost his limbs. We knew Luke and Find were brother and sister, we knew Luke was Anak's son, we knew Obi-Wan and Yoda were going to exile, we knew everything. There is nothing new in this movie. When all the fans wanted it, that's fine, Lucas couldn't go wrong. <br /> <br /> But when Anakin finally turns to Darth Vader and asks for Padme and hears he's dead, he comes out of his hands uncomfortably and screams "Nooooooooooooooooooooo". This scene punished the B-movie all the time and I was half waiting for Darth Vader to go "DANGER! ROBINSON, DANGER" at any time. That's it. The B-film, embedded in a huge budget and an ultra-loyal fan base that will now do something when the first two films have pulled their standards to the depths of Earth.
