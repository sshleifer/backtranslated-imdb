Did I miss something here? This "adaptation" has everything Brookmyres' first novel. Everything except story, laughter, black humor, political intrigue, characterization, plot and some way of thinking. <br /> <br /> Spoilers; <br /> <br /> Godamnawful, from beginning to end. They looked at the plot, had a romance between Parablane and the police, and what it was, Dr Slaughter was portrayed as an bystander and who the hell was Annette Crosby? <br /> <br /> It seemed like they'd adapted for three hours, and they started to fall for less than 90 minutes. (Although 90 minutes seemed to last forever.) Please do not do it with any other Brookmyres book (especially the "Country of the Blind").
