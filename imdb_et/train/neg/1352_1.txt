Eytan Fox, generally on the apologist side of Israeli politics, has made many quite interesting films in the past, such as "Walk on Water" and just a wonderful movie "Yossi & Jagger". In The Bubble, however, he has taken this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme. <br /> <br /> Far away, this film didn't give a stand, the people looked quietly and left. I also left quietly, nervous with such a ridiculously one-sided film that interprets self-preservation as racist bullying and racist bullying (and terrorism) as justified outbursts of anger; that is, the Arabs are so bad Israeli evil that they are reacting to the constant unilateral aggression of Israel against them and that they should not be held responsible for their actions. /> This film did not pay the money I paid for the ticket (indeed I thought it was demanding) and was basically an Israeli apesting from the Palestinian movie "Paradise Now". If you want to be an anti-Israeli, look at this movie anyway, as it justifies such a belief system. The fact that this film has been made by an Israeli director and even worse, such a talented Israeli director, is a crying shame. Indeed, how Israel can be surprised when it is considered a pariah, if the Israelis themselves make such anti-Israeli propaganda, the beggar's faith. <br /> <br /> What a shameful, scary little movie!
