This 1974 Naschy trip is directed by Leon Klimovsky, and a glimpse of advertising photos and packaging can lead you to believe that this medieval romp is somewhere between "Inquisition" and "Sadomania". Unfortunately, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> This is a strictly PG thing related to tortured torture sequences, no nudity and little edge at all. Naschy (of whom I am a fan) pulls his stuff to Gilles de Lancre, "antiguo Mariscal de la Nacionalale". Unfortunately, he is more like a pantomime than anything else. With such a movie, you will feel that we have seen him (and that) all before. Therefore, only Naschy is more complete.
