... no one watches the movie. My husband and I went to see it last night. It's just a small theater, but there's usually a decent number of people. Not this time! My husband and I were the only people who watched Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why. <br /> <br /> The film was one of the worst I've ever seen. Yes, CG was good, but it was so. Functional, script and dialog, management, editing, etc. were pious! As we were alone in the room, we felt free to talk during the movie. That is, we talked about how bad it was that it reminded us of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Godzilla, mortal struggle and Lord of the Rings. It was like we thought Rita and Lord Zed were the chiefs of the Sauron army. <br /> <br /> The creatures were ridiculous. You can't just explain the dino / dragon / lizard stuffed with cannons in the legion. The Lord of the Rings has a lot of signs, but it introduces and develops them in over 3 films, not in an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Scene transitions are terrible. I didn't fall asleep during the movie, but while I was too easy, I found myself disappearing into the wells of the well. <br /> <br /> The characters were Caucasian Americans, but they spoke a nearly broken English script because of poorly written dialogs. <br /> <br /> The final scene that may have redeemed a movie's value failed. Ethan did not call when Sarah died ... although she didn't know her for a long time in her life. He didn't seem too outraged that he stayed in "Mordor" without knowing where he was or how to come back. We couldn't make God's love look where he was or how he got there, but if he's not upset, we shouldn't be. <br /> <br /> Oh, and why dress that Sarah's spirit was wearing as she borrowed from Queen Elizabeth? Another thing ... all three of the main characters of the hero were reincarnations, which were brought back to work. Sarah fulfills her mission and moves to life. Jack does that too. Then why is Ethan screwed? She's alone, without a girl, without a map / compass / helicopter to get her back. What should he do? Send Smoke Signals? And when he goes home, does he just go back to his job? He should have given the same mercy to get out of the movie of other heroes. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money on this movie. We only left to the end because we paid for it, but as soon as the credit hit, we were out of the door.
