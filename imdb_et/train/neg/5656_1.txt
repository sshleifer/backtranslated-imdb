Ziab la ta'kol al Lahem is a terrible movie. It's just a superposition of the scene without a clear connection. It is also very bad, despite the presence of a good actor like Ezzat El allayli. However, this movie is really amazing when it comes to sexuality, female emancipation, naked scenes in Arabic cinema very rare even today. I congratulate the director and the actors for their courage. We want to see this style more in Egyptian films, but with better quality. The reasons that helped me make this movie a terrible vote are not just a scenario and action, but also a lack of pressism. This movie looks like an amateur. We see a lot of errors on the screen. If you want a good Arabic movie Ziab la ta'kol al kindly not recommended. But if you want to encourage uncensored movies in all of the Arab world, check it out and do the same to your friends and family.
