You know you have problems with comedy when the only fun parts are to create pain. It is a pity that the parrot, the cat and the dog supported and not just the other way around, because the people in it were quite sad. <br /> <br /> When I was you, Paul, Eva, Lake (what the name is), Jason, & Lindsay, I would forget about this actor and I did something else, because you are all as funny as dry, and terrible actors . <br /> <br /> The main gag of the movie is one nickname, I don't have Gay, which is funny, if you didn't, you could change your mind if you had to put together three bosses, annoying and bold to say the movie is very common women. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've seen for years and hopefully never see it as halban even though I don't expect it.
