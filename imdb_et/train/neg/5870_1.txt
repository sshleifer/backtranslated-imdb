I didn't like this movie at all! First of all, I don't know why, but everyone here says that Clémence Poésy's game is great, which I think is totally wrong! He's not like Natasha: another look, another character ... What's worse, he's a very inexperienced actor and that's why he couldn't play that role! He scattered the heroine completely! It was really nasty to watch his game! I think it would be much better to give this role to a Russian actor because it would be much easier for him to understand the Russian language with the Russian soul. Unfortunately, Kutuzov seemed like a drunken man who hasn't shaved for 2 weeks and defeated the battle in which he lost his eye ... (Thanks to God, there are some actors in this movie whose game was fantastic! Alessio Boni was doing his job very well He was one of the few people who read a book that is very important to the game.) Look at the only thing I liked in this work was the beautiful views and amazing dresses! My advice is to read the book and understand the true meaning, the purpose Leo Tolstoy wrote for this masterpiece and perhaps understands the idea of ​​the entire book ... of 10
