This sci-fi adventure is not the best and not the worst. I agree with the statement that bad sci-fi is comic. The incredible pink toning and unusual special effects make it a late, late late show viewer. The planetary space explorers of Mars are fighting against strange giant ameba-like monsters and other strange creatures. Pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Les Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen are cast. Get comfortable and enjoy. Don't feel bad when you finish for a moment. I agree with adding it to the list of cult classics in order not to miss.
