I've been watching anime, but I'm not a deadly fan; and I don't read manga. I say this because many observers who are plagued by the lyrics of this film seem to have such a background. I have seen "St. John's St. John's Wort" and although it is not a masterpiece by some imagination, he made me "Shinobi", especially since everyone seems to love it. <br /> <br /> Well, I watched it in the afternoon and struggled very hard to watch. Yes, it is very beautiful - slow motion water scenes, autumn leaves on trees, even CGI eye shaking - majestic. I liked the bull, costumes, even some fighting scenes, but in general it was black as black. <br /> <br /> It seems someone took "Romeo and Julia" - the translation even mentions that they are stars crossing lovers - and threw some "X-Meni" for good action. Two characters shared Wolverine's abilities - a boy dressed in a bear costume was his claws and a gray-haired man was able to heal himself. Then you have a girl with a poison kiss - this is Poison Ivy (Batman). Why do they give these women such power? Poison girl shows her feet, then kisses you to death. Man, this is a great force for you. And another girl, she can make mistakes about this yellow dust that she rubs into her hands. The other woman, one of the baptized lovers, is a hypnotic foam. Wow. <br /> <br /> I made this movie to the end, quickly forwarding it and saw a little more tragedy than I expected. Some people compare it with the "House of Flying Hats" and "Hero". Don't make that mistake. They can share similar endings, but similar similarities end. "Shinobi" is made by amateur - other movies are experienced filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I would say avoiding this movie if you are not 12-18 years old.
