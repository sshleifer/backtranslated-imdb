I don't know about you, but what I love about Tom and Jerry's cartoons is (often violent) interaction between two characters. A mouse in Manhattan sees Jerry leaving behind Tom to have an adventure in New York and I think it will definitely suffer from the lack of a cat. <br /> <br /> As magical as Jerry's exploration, 'Big Apple may be for other R&D fans who have commented on IMDb here, I couldn't wait for this self-conscious garbage to end so I can look at my The next picture on the DVD. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only part of the episode I really enjoyed was when Jerry almost "buys a farm", hanging insecurely from the end of a broken candle, over a hundred-foot busy road.
