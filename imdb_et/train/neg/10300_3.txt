I am a fan of artificial films, but unfortunately I have to announce this movie to be pretentious. Agonizingly slow to work on non-being plot based on a promising premise, experience is, say, trying. Even after the bad movies I feel I am learning something or some aspect, but there was nothing to evaluate. The assumption was uninteresting, but the film starts and ends there. The actor was OK, though the characters were bored. In order for the protagonist to set such a cruel goal, he is very empty. Damage. I usually enjoy non-formal movies, but the absence of a formula should not be confused with zero.
