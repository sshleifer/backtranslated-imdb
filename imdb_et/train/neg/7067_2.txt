Five bus depot passengers talk to each other about their dreadful dreams when they wait. But are these nightmares more than an eye? <br /> <br /> Happy, a bad movie for one price! Each segment has the worst performance, special effects, makeup and music. And were they supposed to be scary? Hmm .. I think I've been overwhelmed during the Teletubbies episode. I swear you sit there like I was, waiting forever for tears to happen something interesting. Do not worry. It's never. In fact, I even stopped delivering ads quickly because they were much more entertaining than the main feature. AND the end is the final statement. Yes, none of this ever happened. If only the same could be said on the day I put my videotape on this cobler. 2/10
