This movie is not worthy of Omen's title. It is so bad that it has actually damaged the first three classic qualities. It should never have been done, they should change the title. <br /> <br /> They don't even write Damien Thorn's NAME correctly !!!! And there is no plug that is the most important element of all the Omen movies. Pull it out of the shelves and burn it.
