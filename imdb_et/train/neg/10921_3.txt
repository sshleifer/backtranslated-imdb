I note that I often watch bad movies, and sci-fi original movies are usually one of the best sources for finding these movies. As such, I am sure you can imagine your frustration when I saw the limbs of oblivion. Action was inaccurately sub-par, unlike a shamefully shameful screen, sci-fi is usually in stock for us. There are some suitcases that people will probably feel, even though you don't know their names from the heart. The special effects of CGI are minimal and therefore one of the biggest comedy sources in the sci-fi function. Of course, there are some funny moments, such as when a boy rubs a bulldozer, or when the main character leaves his friend's death to save the girl he is known for a few days, but in general it just does not make you laugh on the floor of the rolls, and I think it there is great disappointment. <br /> <br /> If I rate it on a 10-star scale that is specifically designed to make TV movies, I'll probably give it 4, maybe even 5. The real shame I have to wait until next sci com original film to get a good laugh, and I really hope that this film is not part of the overall quality of sci's original films.
