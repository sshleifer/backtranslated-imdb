You saw this Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Fest. <br /> <br /> What can I say? I liked it for my better assessment, but it seemed to me that the act was a bit ... weak (mostly I noticed this teenage boy's family). I mean, the script was not in the beginning of the script, but the actors didn't give me any confidence in the relationship. <br /> <br /> The plot is also predictable. <br /> <br /> Not cunning, I liked it. The characters are nice and the plot is not complicated or disturbing. It's sweet, the characters care about each other, and I don't read it for fifty minutes badly spent. <br /> <br /> But I don't recommend it.
