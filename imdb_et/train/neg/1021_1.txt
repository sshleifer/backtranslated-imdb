The film started strongly, LL Cool J (Deed) as a secret police officer with partner Sgt. Lazerov (from Dylan McDermott's Practice, Maybe Failed as a Bad Dude?) Who puts robbery and murder. It refuses to kill a drug dealer, which creates a conflict with a conscientious policeman with conscience. Other big names (Freeman, Spacey, etc.) are well cast and the film has a promise. <br /> <br /> The film begins to fall as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is introduced. Taking the opportunity to make a good movie that people will probably see repeatedly, or one that teenage girls go and see once on Timberlake, I would choose the former one. Even talented actors have to work on their crafts; Timberlake is not talented and no hard work can save him. I would have thought he would put a better show, given that he has been acting talented for years. All he did in this movie was not convincing. <br /> <br /> Just because the singer sells millions of documents and sells stadiums, it does not automatically mean that they can act successfully in feature films. Even hardcore N'Sync fans can't ignore the obvious lack of talent. <br /> <br /> Next to this, there are some holes in the plot, such as Pollack's sudden sniper capability and the deadly operation of warehouse machines. This film had so many promises. Thorough disappointment.
