MST 3000 should do this movie. It's the worst film I've ever seen. First of all, you find that the shooter does not have a bank account or history in 1993 when he leaves the military and pays his rent in cash. Hell has no chance that such a person will ever be allowed to be near the president, let alone a high-level job. Also, the POTHUS security officer would not be so emotional that he would start drinking while the president was fired. This movie was sucked. I can't express the movie that this movie was. Every actor was terrible. Even a chick trailer in the park. I'm on this garbage. What a waste of time.
