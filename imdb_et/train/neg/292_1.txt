I saw it randomly, showing the cable, I wanted to like it because I thought Sandra was what I remembered. The only movement I had during the entire film was the jaw dropping stunned when the terrible movie I just suffered. <br /> <br /> A person who said this is the most funny movie of all time, mark one line, but one scene that is even worth the cry. <br /> <br /> She is a much better singer than I remember her, but I didn't want to see the cabin. <br /> <br /> I think it's a movie to try because they think they should look at it objectively.
