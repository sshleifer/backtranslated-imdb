This is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen ... Unfortunately, I'm a horror movie buffer and I rented all the horror movies when it's not done. Looking at the cell, it is said to be rated G and some languages ​​... Where was it? Is their one good death scene where you actually saw gore? I could forget that if there had been short nudity or good dialogue. There wasn't even a single line of fun or fun in this flat movie. Sometimes horror movies are fantastic because they are so stupid, but it was just sad.
