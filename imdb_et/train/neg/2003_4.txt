It would be much better to live a renaissance for all of your visual pleasures. The animation is fantastic on the big picture, yes, but the characters are cold and hollow, like the story and style of this movie. With the actual actors, the film world would probably not be so inanimate. There's a lot to admire here, but in the end I found that everything I did was admired. I didn't enjoy this movie so much, and it explains something I never saw before: that visual elements can be a positive side of a movie, but without a good story and strong stars it can all be something. I don't go so far as to say that this movie doesn't come, but sometimes it's dangerously close. I love Dark sci-fi thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City are two movies I thought were wonderful. But Blade Runner had a tragic villain and Dark City was a thought-provoking story. The Renaissance has a shadow and light, but little else. I wish I had liked this movie more, but the weak story and the empty characters stood in the way. The Renaissance was a historic and artistic color and burst of life. How ironic it is that one of the most native and inanimate movies I saw this year is from the Renaissance.
