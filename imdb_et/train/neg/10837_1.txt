I can't tell you how angry I was after watching this movie. The characters are not the least interesting and the plot does not exist. So after waiting to see how the lives of these characters influenced each other, hoping that the last 2 and a half hours had led to some important finishes that we get? Frost storm. Now, yes, I understand the references to the Bible (Exodus) and the underlying subject, but first it was absolutely no resolution and, secondly, it would have disappeared for anyone who has not read the Bible (a significant part of the population) or Charles Fort (much more). As somewhat read by a person, I thought this film was a self-conscious bad imitation of the Seinfeld episode. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. It would be better to read ... <br /> <br /> ... to be honest
