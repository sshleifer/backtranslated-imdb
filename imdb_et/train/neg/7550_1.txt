OK, so I'm an original Wicker Man fan and I don't usually like American British movies, so why did I use myself through the most painful cinema experiences? I'm not a fan of Nicolas Cage and maybe I had some kind of madness? The movie was terrible! At the beginning of the crash / fire at first, there was absolutely no relevance to the film, and the female policeman knew where Edward was going, so at the end of the two girls who visited the continent, it would not have been so. the whole thing would have been investigated. The history of the braided man was not really explored - and I think placement in America did not really help the whole pagan topic. This film was slow and contained no atmosphere or intercourse. I have to say that the best bit was right at the end when Nicolas Cage was on fire! I'm in such a desperate need to see the original again to cleanse my frustrated soul. I really can't stress if this movie is disappointing, please don't look at it when you do this: <br /> <br /> A) Don't like the British movie's B-Class b) Is the original fan C) Hate Nicolas Cage
