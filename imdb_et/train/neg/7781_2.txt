Tough boys, sexy women, a lot of swearing and the most convincing monster that rises from the depths of a contaminated lake. You think "Monster" would be fun ... but it's not really. This, however, marks Tony Eisley and John Carradine and in my book, which makes it look at least once. In an interview in 1987, "Fangorias", Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock had directed most of the film, but somehow Kenneth Hartford - who led only his children with Andrea and Glenn (depicting Andrea and Glenn names). especially the finder) - got full credit. Given the terrible end result, Strock was probably glad he wasn't credited! "Monster" has the look and feel of the mid-seventies TV movie, so I want to leave it so often in the background. As entertainment falls on its face, but as a reminder of another age and the missing film type, it is very effective. The only thing missing is chasing the car.
