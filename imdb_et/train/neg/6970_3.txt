Now this would be some sort of clich√© when I started with the title, so I'm looking forward to it. Firstly, this film made me wonder why children do stupid things like moving around in laboratories and breaking bottles. Then I realized that it was a movie with a message, this message strikes the children and such things do not happen. Things you ask? Things like a giant insect monster that grows and causes some chaos before they die in the usual "monster indirectly". Now, as promised ... The blue monkey ... it has nothing blue and no Simia. Now that I was cheating or something. The picture on the canvas had a giant mistake / crab / idiot / thing that ran some screaming sisters. This glove happened, but I wanted monkeys! having just been enjoying MOST EXTREME PRIMATE a few nights before (half drunk in Cask and Creame brand) I was in the mood for more monkey hijacks out of 80. Not really. If you like snowboard monkeys or blue things, this is not the movie for you. If you want mistakes and good reasons to hit the kids, rent it out.
