Every time blue, someone looks at me a little laterally and asks "What is SNITCH'D"? I know right now that they have barely hidden fun and horror. You see, I was a movie operator. <br /> <br /> Let me explain some points about this "interesting life experience". <br /> <br /> Originally named SNITCH'D ONE HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July 1999, the day after I offered TRIANGLE SQUARE, a very small 35 mm feature, which, like many indie characteristics of the era, was not shared despite the festival's respect ... it fell to the eternal sacrifice of SAG's fine . Infamous Experimental Function Agreement. But I'm dragging ... <br /> <br /> though I was on a roll and when James asked me to let my small gangster fold 16 mm when the budget for shooting is about $ 25,000, I don't want to break, I Take it. After all, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI ... I also believed myth at that time. <br /> <br /> Simply encrypt it as a "movie school" for many people involved. SNITCH'D was fired over two weeks in August 1999 by Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, CA. Cahill taught drama in the last high school of the city (yes, he is a drama and English teacher ... find that while watching a movie or even despite using an apostrophe in a title), so locations and cast. <Br /> <br /> The only known dramatic LA Channel 2 morning news magazine girl, Vera Jimenez, was in her casting, and Eva Longoria's debut, who had just arrived in Hollywood and wished I'd get my movie under my belt, was more influential. I have to say that his professional dedication, focus and "doing it" keep me inspired and was my stardom-yet-come shelter. <br /> <br /> SNITCH'D suffered from poor optics, low lights or electricity, multiple boom operator du jour, and unmistakably uncorrected network connections. None of them will overshadow the actual content that speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie was sold to distributors (net loss, I understand) for 2003, who had no inexplicable photos of Eva (by that time he was a rising, working name), but who managed to get a clear picture of it which seems to be an authentic Latino gangster to give SNITCH'D credibility. Since Cahill's second passion is antique book making, it seems to confirm that he believes you can actually evaluate the book with this cover ... so many have picked it up from this DVD on the sleeve. ----------------- One year later, Eva, now in the soap, and I met James one day to shoot the simple short film he had agreed, SPLIT SECOND, what I think that he never played despite the intention of the festival. <br /> <br /> Six years later, I was hired to shoot another Cahill movie JUAREZ, Mexico. Although he had developed the process; my involvement depended on casting, scenario, and team members, and the resulting film seemed really promising in the diaries because it was ... a cheap detective film surrounding the mass murder of girls in Juarez; Despite the claims here and elsewhere, the film has never appeared in any festival or place, although Cahill has repeatedly claimed that the film has a distribution and is just waiting for release that coincides with two of the same topics, ie. IN THE AREA.
