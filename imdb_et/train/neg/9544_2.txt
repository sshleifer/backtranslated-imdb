I didn't enjoy this movie. I thought the acting was not very good and the story was boring. A 20 year old computer that saves days? I thought it was a little far off, even for the movie. I couldn't figure out why they couldn't just turn it off, why not take a rapper with it. <br /> <br /> This is a shame, but after the original film of the 80s, you spent so much more than you actually did. This movie could be an old movie of the 21st century version, it wasn't. If you want to watch it, don't watch this movie! Even if the old computer hadn't saved the day, I think it would be a very exciting tie.
