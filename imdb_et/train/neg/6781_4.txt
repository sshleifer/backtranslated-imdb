Good casting (with one big exception) pushes your way through Epstein's smart light. Mansfield was never better or funny when he was here with Walston, a veteran who has decided to become a congress to get out of war. He and his friends - including the Suave Con-Artist Grant - go on holiday to San Francisco and start the city swing party at the same time, having escaped the service completely through industry-language excursions. The only thing about this movie that is not gratifying is the one-off presentation by Suzy Parker for Grant's love, which takes too much time for the movie and slows down the pace of the second half. Walston and Mansfield have good chemistry; The trick is that he is ready to love every soldier (of course, his warfare), but he is a married man who still loves his wife. They steal the movie with little effort from Grant (who is entertained here in the first part of the movie if it is not connected to his actor who is not his actor.
