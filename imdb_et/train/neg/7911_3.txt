It wasn't remarkable enough to be really terrible, it was just incredible. The story wasn't half bad, but the execution was just terrible. <br /> <br /> First of all, it moved too fast to emotionally deal with what is happening. It was just bad. The dialogue was so completely sparkling, just flat and boring. <br /> <br /> And the characters, cripes everywhere, made Deadpool boring. How the hell are you doing Deadpool forever? He wasn't even funny. He wasn't crazy. He was just a tedious man with a few swords he couldn't even use properly. <br /> <br /> Gambit was boring. And when is he in telekenisis to make the maps just floating and fly around, or super power to jump hundreds of feet? And what the hell did all the foolish helicopters go? I know we know they are mutants, but they are still in the field of physics. A circular bachelor is not a helicopter blade; What the Gambi can't do anyway. Not Deadpool, especially if you use it as a substitute for true choreography. <br /> <br /> And this movie is evidence that wireframes should only be used by combat coordinators who know WTH and know better than using it. single. shot. as a substitute for true choreography. <br /> <br /> Three of the most physical winners in the Marvel comic strip (Logan, Creed and Wilson) and some of the worst choreography I've seen in recent film memories. Just like a stunt coordinator shrugged and left it all special effects. <br /> <br /> And then you had broken out all those mutants that did nothing. Even the mutants that were shown in their cells to have power (nice to see Quicksilver nod) did everything when they came out. Only Emma-really-lame-for-this-movie-Frost and Cyclops did something. <br /> <br /> Since then was Logan so beautiful? And stupid, "The moon takes its memory away." Don't you think Xavier and X-Men would have noticed a major attack on their adamantum skull when they were X-rayed? I was sorry for Liev Schrieber's man, he brought a good Sabretooth with the script in mind. He made one of the simplest super-villains of Marvel who feel real. But he couldn't save the movie from his epic fool. <br /> <br /> Seriously, it was the "Daredevil" breastfeeding level. Decent story, good actors, totally terrible execution.
