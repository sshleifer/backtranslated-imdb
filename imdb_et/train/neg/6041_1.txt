This story of three women is a very sensitive study: Muriël (Charlotte Van Den Eynde), the youngest, Laura (Els Dottermans), about 37, and Martha (Frieda Pittors) eldest, Muriël's mother. They live together in the same building. They have different life expectations. Important Laura wants a baby. Muriël comes from the village and wants to change her life in Brussels. Martha dreams about youth when she was a young girl. In fact, nothing in this movie happens, so you expect something - in cases - that could dramatize that story. As time goes on, you will discover that director Dorothée Van Den Berghe only wants to develop the psychological portrait of three women and nothing else. This film is disappointing because you expect women to learn from their experiences that are not so that one is left blank.
