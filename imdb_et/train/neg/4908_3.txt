This film should take place in and around Seattle. Why is Porteau Cove P-R-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L Park? Provincial Parks are located in Canada, not in the United States. The inspector uses a Palm Pilot with a pencil to "read" that someone has called the bride's computer on the computer. I didn't know it was possible with a database storage device. The woman will appear without the introduction and will never be used. We are learning halfway through the film that this woman works at District Attorney's office. Then, in the repair center, the guard will actually protect Jenks through the door and keep him behind the criminal! It would never happen in a real correction. The director really confused it - it doesn't happen in real life. Operation is enough. The plot is good. Cinematography is good. However, many of the errors found during continuity resulted in 3 votes out of ten.
