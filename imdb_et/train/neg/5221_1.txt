Hi, I'm from Denmark, and one day I was with the film with friends. One brought this film to him with a "Russian terminator" and it was very terrible. After watching less than half a minute, we decided to stop at the ridiculous "highlights" or say "lowlights" in the movie. I was actually surprised when I found out that this film was produced here in my country, Denmark ... which must be the biggest mistake that this country has ever made.
