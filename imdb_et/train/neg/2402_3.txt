A rather surprising interruption from the usual trusted Larry Cohen (God Told Me Too, Q, etc.), Full Moon High is trying so hard to be funny and unsuccessful, even in the case of decent turns by Ed McMahon (!) And Kenneth Mars. Alan Arkin sees embarrassment through all his performance and son Adam just looks stupid. This makes Teen Wolf a comedy classic.
