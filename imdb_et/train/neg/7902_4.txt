Cute and playful but flat and cheap. "Munchies" is another Gremlin clone that comes out of the 80s. I'm not much of a fan of imitations. <br /> <br /> First, it was a great "Gremlins". <br /> <br /> Then the average Critters came. <br /> <br /> Let's forget that fucking "Ghoulies" is. <br /> <br /> But complete mines should go to "Hobgoblins". <br /> <br /> Is there any more ?? <br /> <br /> Now the munches should be between me and Ghoulies and Hobgoblins. In fact, I probably found more entertainment than "Ghoulies", but I preferred the darkest shade. <br /> <br /> Get-go plays its funny character (which is better for it), but that's why hammy-action (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips) gets quite frightening, so you just look at the coins that running. There's fun. Mostly light fluffy fluff, because the story mainly focuses on munches (who are either hungry, horny, and destructive) in a whole lot of anticipated comic meetings (a few moments doing) in a small desert town because a few people are chasing. It's silly but strange for entertainment. These creatures themselves look gently and badly in detail because they are the basic dolls that are looted. When their people arrive, it is that they can actually talk ... and attitude. <br /> <br /> Charlie Stratton and nervous Nadine Van der Velde (who was in Critters) were fair. Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles. Robert Picardo also appears. <br /> <br /> Entertaining entertainment.
