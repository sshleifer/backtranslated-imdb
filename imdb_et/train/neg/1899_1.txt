I watched it because I thought there were a lot of cars and cool cars. I think I was lying. This movie is very boring. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi), who sits outside the Porsche dealership to see if they have the right car. If they affirm that it is right, Kip gets a brick from the trunk and strikes it in the window, breaking it. He gets Porsche when his friend's keys are received. They start the car and start at night. They only deliver it to the store to be followed by the police. So, the whole team will ditch all the cars and go their own way. Then we get a glimpse of Raines in Memphis. He gives a small speech to a bunch of kids on the go-kart track. He then faces Atlee Jackson (Will Patton). Atlee tells Memphis that his brother Kip is in a deep groove *. Memphis is known as one of the most famous car thieves in Los Angeles. Memphis runs the junkyard and meets Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclesten). This man threatens to kill Kipi if Memphis does not produce 50 cars in 72 hours. <br /> <br /> There are some problems with this movie: <br /> <br /> 1.Story: The first 48 hours of the movie will be played by Cage and Duvall looking for a team and planning everything. The last 12 hours of the movie are waste! <br /> <br /> 2. Cars: You will see 50 when the movie advertises. So where are the other 40 cars? Why don't we see them? <br /> <br /> 3. Chase: At the end of the chase the movie was a joke. It was not at all tense. <br /> <br /> 4. Dog: In a movie, a dog eats burgers and swallows three keys. It is impossible. The keys were open. The keys would severely damage the dog's esophagus, stomach and colon. Men recommend giving the dog laxatives to help him. It does not work. The dog gets a lot of diarrhea but no keys. It was said by Jackass after Ryan Dunne detained a toy car in his rectum. Take laxatives, a lot of diarrhea but not a car. The same applies to dogs. <br /> <br /> 5. While driving: When Eleanor looks a few minutes away, Nicholas Cage desperately tries to run the car. You see a police cruiser behind him who doesn't look at his car at all. But just when Nicholas Cage starts to restart the engine, the police officer pulls his head to the right, sees the car and starts to chase him right away. It's stupid. So when he started to listen to the engine and saw the car, he knew it was the car he was looking for. How does he know it's the right car? He only sees the back of it. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is boring. No action. There are very few cars. The movie is stupid. I've never seen the original, but I'm planning on it. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie 1 star 10. Get The Fast and Furious.
