I was very disappointed with this movie. I thought "Scary Movie", though not a great movie, was very good and funny. "Scary Movie 2" on the other hand was boring, not funny, and sometimes plain stupid. <br /> <br /> The Exorcist / Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great. <br /> <br /> Now, I admit that I am at a disadvantage because I have not seen some of the films that these parodies have been different from the first where I have seen them all. But bad comedy is still a bad comedy. <br /> <br /> Something that really hurt this movie was the timing that destroyed some of what might have been a good joke. Scenes and jokes drag your way long. <br /> <br /> The same jokes happen over and over again. For example, a talking bird. Ok was the first and maybe the second time funny. But this repeats itself as disturbing. The routine between a wheelchair friend and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was fun at first, but it was repeated and stupid and even tasteless. <br /> <br /> Some jokes were repeated in the first movie. For example, "Cream" was called "Creamy" (Anna Faris) by a "peeling" funny "Scary Movie" because Cindy had given her boyfriend sex for so long that she essentially had blue balls from hell and it was funny when she peeled her ". But this time it was inappropriate and not funny. <br /> <br /> The bathroom and sexual humor were generally fun and timed for the first time. The sense of humor was superfluous in the second film, but quite unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Tori's spell was annoying and there was no place for this movie. <br /> <br /> But I enjoyed Shorty (Marlon Wayans), who I think was the funniest sign of the first movie. With her, the pot plant was one of my favorites in another movie. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, I love Wayan's family and their humor. That is why this film is so disappointing. . . they have a lot more comics than endless jokes.
