What is the creation of points that have no relevance to the original film? No point. This is why Prom Night's after-effects are so embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br /> The original film included a group of kids who hide the blind secret that eventually sent them all to kill. Can someone please explain to me what the dead prom queen-to-be rises from the grave to the steel, that it is related to the first film? Prom Night 2 had continuous plot holes that keep the audience constantly wondering how it happened and why it should happen? But in the end, I think you might call it one such movie that is so bad that you finally laugh through it.
