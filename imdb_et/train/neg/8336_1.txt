How the hell did they do that? By presenting himself as a comedy in the closet, "$" is basically two hours for people breaking fragments of sentences. Usually dependable Warren Beatty sees drunk and usually fun Goldie Hawn acts as depressed. Gert Frobe, his most famous role - Goldfinger, was infinitely admirable as his character. Not even a LSD champagne bottle guy will save this household worthless. <br /> <br /> Do I compare this movie with "Space Plan 9"? I won't do that even if someone pays me. "P9FOS" was idiotically done but ended up fun; it was idiotic and causes you to feel that your brain just melted out of your ears. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn did it when they celebrated the "shampoo", but then they celebrated the terrible "Town & Country". Maybe they shouldn't just celebrate together in the movies. All in all, I would like my skin to break if I look at it again. Maybe they should do it with Jackie Chan. Then I would pay to see it.
