I've bought a collection of 50 "Legacy of Horror" movies and do you think I'm still looking at them to find a good HORROR movie. Sometimes you will find a nice but fun movie like a devil or a devil bat, or one big Alfred Hitchcock movie (some are not horror and only there because Hitchcock has directed some horrors and tensions), but otherwise they seem to put such films as The Icelandic monster, because they cannot accept the fact that they have simply forgotten and that they should be on this issue. <br /> <br /> So we open up the idea of ​​the Westing game. A rich but cruel and abusive father, played by Carradine (one of its permanent traits) has died and left his legacy to his children and servants he still hates. Carradine gives a good result as always, but she has remained mainly in voice recording and rebound sequences, leaving us to sit through mediocre / terrible performances. The rest of the cast is either on the scenes or down. Given that it was an independent film in the 1970s, lighting and effects are quite limited. It is difficult to create a lot of tension if the viewer does not see what is happening so well in some scenes. Some participants, such as the servants Igor and Elga, are at least making an effort, and I am ashamed to admit that I still have a buggy for me, but it is a very fortunate fact that they have pulled some version of the twists otherwise quite obvious who did it, but not enough to improve movie quality. You do not want to like the characters because they are either selfish or cruel or psychotic, but it takes it to a whole new level and makes many invisible. Death scenes are pretty bad and the relationship doesn't really exist. This proves that you would probably enjoy the 20 movie packages "Chilling", which includes movies such as House's Haunted Hill, Little Shop of Horror with Jack Nicholson and Night of the Living Dead. This is best avoided.
