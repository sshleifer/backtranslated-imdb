It's a bad and bad movie. I'm a real fencer: trust me when I say that the accuracy of this movie is precisely that. This is especially true during the tiny scene of the whistle when fencers combine footwear with 80's pop. The end is predictable and the movie is a cage from start to finish. Terrible.
