One reason I remember this is that it was shown a week after Nigel Kneale's brilliant QUATERMASS series was sent. The emphasis of the trailers was that the protagonist had a broken hand that hoped that he was like Victor Caroon QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT, who was driving on the streets of London. <br /> <br /> There's no such luck, because RACING GAME is just a pretty drab thriller with a hero who has a physical disability, trying to get to the bottom of a corrupt horse racing research. I think if you are a fan of Dick Francis, you might like it, but setting it to the end of the 70s when SWEENEY had just finished and the PROFESSIONALS is still being produced, there's something about RACING GAME. One trailer was in a car that took another engine when it was on a SWEENEY trailer, which you see Jack Regan taking over and conquering the car, which was made when PROFESSIONALS made the blago take over the car and blown away the terrorists. I think this will make a summary of this series of lies
