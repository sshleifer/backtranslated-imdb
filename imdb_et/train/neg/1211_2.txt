The only redemption qualities that this film has are quite original death scenes. Other than this movie is a big DUD. We have Kim Basinger, who is tempted by the housewife slowly slipping through the local shopping center in the first 30 minutes. a movie that didn't add anything. Then the film takes a little bit of resistance because it has a confrontation with four bitches who took 2 parking spaces on the busy real eve. They start to chase him after accusing the local security guard who tried to help him. From there, this film becomes even worse. I know its the only movie and you have to go with the stream, but it's about 5 min. peastart and he can't help anyone. Instead, he travels alongside the forest to a half-built subdivision. In a typical way, he does everything he can to get his followers to follow him easily. But now he becomes a tough mofu. You get a point. Never buy or rent this movie no matter how much you want it. It's so illogical that you suspect every scene. It is embarrassing to Basinger and Craig Sheffer and the rest of the participants, as well as consumers.
