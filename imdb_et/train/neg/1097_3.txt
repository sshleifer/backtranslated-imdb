I understand that the US Army was demoralized by 1971, but this film was incredible. In Sven Hassell's novel, it had to be a training camp that was not an SS punishment battalion. A writer must be a real army hacker. The Psycho Sergeant, who beat people in the mess, belonged to the prison cell and the useless Black-Topseersant should also have been fired. These men went abroad, the host unit would certainly have wondered where all the unusable damaged recruits came and the investigation would have ended. The scene that created it completely was a power outage. Farrell, an alleged barrack lawyer, should have guided the barrel to issue an illegal order (torture authorities contrary to the Geneva Convention), a real attack on a recruited man, a sexual assault, and behavioral habits. Thank you for walking. After that, discipline stops madhouse level and the film becomes unnoticed. I don't know how it ended, I went to sleep.
