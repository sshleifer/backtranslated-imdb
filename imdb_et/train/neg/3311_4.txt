Grace's recording is definitely one of the leading "How To Destroy A Sufficient Movie In Minutes" award. Of course, if you mix a cozy Cornish village with a large number of seniors, there is a liberal dose of marijuana, a certain amount of stupidity. But the last seven minutes of the movie are completely ridiculous and not even funny. This is a real shame because this comedy has the potential to be a bit as good as the 1998 Waking Ned Devine, which also depicted a picturesque small village and its odd inhabitants who tried to pull themselves out of a difficult situation. /> Saving Grace's protagonist is middle-aged, recently widowed by Grace Trevethyn, whose spouse's bad debt legacy has forced her to become an unusual way to earn money. He helped his gardener, Matthew, with his horticultural knowledge for the profitable growth of marijuana. Unfortunately, this leads to confrontation with the local police, his wife's creditors, and the French drug baron. . . . . . . . . . who all grow greenhouse at the same time. The relationships and relationships between Grace and Matthew are well illustrated, and Brenda Blethyn gets the viewer emotionally connected with her pleasant character - you really know what she's going through. <br /> <br /> Casting small roles is great, even if some of them are quite eccentric. However, transforming Jacques's drug lord into Grace's romantic interest is highly unlikely and does not fit the film's tone. And certainly hydroponics is not a revolution in the world of cannabis? Unfortunately, the film gently changes humor for a hit and comes as a fake like marijuana plants.
