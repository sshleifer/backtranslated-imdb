The film is a young man, Michael, who cares for the elderly. One day he decides to kill some of his clients' relatives. At the same time, he decides to model his killing after the 60s Zodiac Killer. He contacts the author of the Zodiac Killer book and forms a friendship. Michael has a weapon (the apparatus is the only weapon because it seems to be in the hands of some other actors, but not as the same weapon). And he's out of a-killin. Original. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie if you want B-movies. I thought the idea of ​​the movie was good, but editing and the actor really drowned in the plot. I thought the "blood" was just too fake, in some places the lighting was terrible and the dialogue was just too standard. The movie was filmed on a video that's okay, but editing a movie for just a strange "Plan 9" scene. Not a bad movie for fans of the B-movie genre, but if you want something a little more polar, move on to something else.
