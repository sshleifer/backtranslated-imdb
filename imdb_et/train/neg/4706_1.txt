That's right, you heard that this movie is amazing ABOMINATION. First, the band that goes to hell will watch or listen to a band called "NAKED BROTHERS BAND"?!?! Not only is the name terrible, but also the musicians, they can't even play anything! The singer also sounds more like Girdy Lee than girli and even her voice is terrible! They are not only terrible musicians, they are terrible actors. Under the leadership of this leader and a thin plot, this must be the eternal film. I want this website to give you the opportunity to use 10 voices from below or below because giving 1/10 of this generation is too generous for WAY. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure you can call it a comedy movie. If you are looking for comedy with music, go to this "Weird Al" Yankovic because it does it much better than those untalented tweens.
