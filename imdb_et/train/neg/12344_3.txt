Suffering from comedy, a schema-like revue, which was originally a vehicle that featured a single radio star Jack Pearl, but is now best remembered as America's introduction to The Three Stooges. Indeed, Larry, Curly, and Moe are counted as comedians with Ted Healy, like Ted Healy and his three Stooges. Although supportive casting includes Jimmy Durant (who has completely wasted the dark material) and ZaSu Pitts, the only audience for these films today is Stooges addicts, and even they don't find much praise here. Incredibly picky and overflowing, this shows how far Hollywood had to go to reach a certain level. * 1/2 from ****
