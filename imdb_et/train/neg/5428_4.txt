Another Priyadarshan / Vohra flick to another movie that was seen in TP instead of the actual desire, the only reason I saw this movie was the fact that regular wasn't there for this movie (Akshay Paresh and many others), but needless to say that I was in this movie low expectations. <br /> <br /> I was pleased with casting in general, except Rajpal Yadav, who once again disturbs some limitation, but still some laughs, but those were not the usual original jokes, in fact this whole movie is like Playing Dhol, I mean, it takes barely a talent to make loud noises, or even play a bizarre good win dhol for a little while in it ?? This is the only one who is able to make a variety of strokes with a nice sequential race over a longer period of time, which is considered excellent. <br /> <br /> What brings us to another instrument, Dumroo hardly needs talents, has no variations, and it can be some time to be a good thing for monkeys to dance (hmm sounds like Rajpal Yadav, good analogy), but it's not a tool that attracts you for a long time or even dances like Dhol. <br /> <br /> This film was like dhol and dumroo played, sometimes Dhol sometimes played dumroo, sometimes both together, but mostly Dumroo and monkey played alone. And like every 24-year-old older than later, I missed. <br /> <br /> The movie has some good Dhol (good) moments, but after a while I heard it was annoying Dumroo (originally entertaining, then tolerated and irritating). ), the great ordinary parts really ensure that this movie is mostly suitable for some funny clip "SEA BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA" (if you haven't watched this movie, it comes in the evenings and is pretty funny <br /> <br /> This movie was in his moments, the actors did a good job, except Rajpal Yadav (who can act, I have seen him in Main Meri Patnis?), who is more annoyed than entertainment, I have said it many times and I say it again. that Sharman Josh and Tushar Kapoor have a particularly good career in front of them, especially in interstellar comedies, like the interrupted attempts to impress the girl's father, the girl tries to chew her and pull her away. <br /> <br /> this movie is a lot more mystery, that is, when the girl was, the next 45-60 minutes were more agonizing, the climax was "SO BAD ITS ALMOST GOOD CATEGORY." I thought if you had at least a pin at least somewhat try to make it tasty. <br /> <br /> The film is also extremely predictable, hardly a scene that cannot be predicted, and you may not break the spontaneous laughter bursting here, it's more like you see it coming and almost start laughing before the gag. <br /> <br /> The movie will be followed by a gradual decline in all the movies, except for odd beating, down or up, and then quickly downhill, most of the really bad scenes were at the end, one movie trying to be more than a mill comedy, including many jokes were very big recurring, recurring, last 10-15 WE ARE PREVIOUS AND FULLY SPOIL IN THIS MOVIE. <br /> <br /> I didn't find Tanushree Datt a real siren that he played, and his acting talent is a serious issue, especially if he doesn't like it, if you can't be hot and can't work, how much time you can survive . <br /> <br /> Technically, this film was also weak, constantly looking at the woman's eyes and with poor light and camera work. <br /> <br /> Songs, except for the title, were not good even if the songs played on the 2nd side could be felt collectively by the audience. <br /> <br /> In all movies that are just plain, but because of the wrong, and very low expectations. <br /> <br /> Avoiding this may not be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> And if you have to watch it on TV for free or for a very cheap matin√©e or something that needs to be when you pay for a full multiplex rate, you feel disappointed. <br /> <br /> Many old jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, last 45 minutes and last 15 minutes, especially technically bad songs. <br /> <br /> +/- s trying to be more than what it was, not the usual cast (I'm happier for that), Tanushree Datta. <br /> <br /> + s some good scenes towards start, title song, good show and casting after RY. <br /> Total 4.5 / 10 (I'm trying to be objective here, I don't like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie met my very low expectations, so I'll give it all the doubts that the movie doesn't make been more than 4)
