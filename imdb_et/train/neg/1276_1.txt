This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Let me say again: this is a one-time big movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It had all the bad ears of the bad movie: continuity errors, poor writing, bad performance, bad product value, bad music. I thought the couple pointed to horror movies. The first is that it should be tense enough to scare you. This movie gets and F belongs to this category. The other thing is that if a character dies or something bad happens, then we should take care. This movie also gets this movie. The first story, a woman cries by a wolf after she fears it will happen to her. The next story, OCD boy dies, he's not careful and tells his dead friend. Oh, and then it's a terrible, nail bite bad roommate. Come on, could you pick the topics a little more interesting and a little less common than the house alone, being anal-retentive and having a roommate? All the stories where hallucinations, virtual reality caused by the doctor, who in turn uses it, turn out. Wow, stupid. Let me explain, I enjoy watching horror movies and laughing at how bad they are. I couldn't do that. It was the ultimate pain to sit and watch. Never look at this movie. You regret it.
