I caught this movie on Sci-Fi before starting work. If you are interested in seeing Dean Cain dive and avoid at least tens of times getting into the flames, this movie is for you. If this is not your peak, I am afraid that you want YOU to be the one who is being surrounded because this movie is pretty bad. Initial action is terrible, terrible, terrible. The characters are all totally inconvenient and the dialogue is worse than your regular Z-Class Sci-Fi movie. After all, the movie began to remind me of "Hollow Man" (complete with the escape of the elevator shaft), except for the dragon, not the naked, invisible person. Unlike other similar clips, it wasn't even amazingly bad ... it was just bad.
