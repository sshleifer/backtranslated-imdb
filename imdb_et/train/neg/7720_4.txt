There are not enough gay-themed movies and there aren't enough movies out there. Everyone is a welcome addition to the genre. Although the output values ​​are high ("good looks", Matthias Freihof (Philipp) sees REAL in jeans) is bad. This is a periodic piece: under the pressure of a gay life (East Berlin, 1989), which seems 40 years behind the West. In some ways, we see our history; what could have been the gays of the 40s and 50s (this often reminded me of the last exit to Brooklyn: the book is not a film). But it is unremittingly frustrating and slow, so it created the old SCTV sending Bergman architecture. It's so slowly edited I don't know if a director just won't randomly hack. Yes, it is a miracle that it was filmed and released before the wall fell, and yes, the life behind "Curtain" was hard for gay people. A good director would have been able to show all this without surprising the audience. A good director would have noticed me as one of the great films and not a single accident.
