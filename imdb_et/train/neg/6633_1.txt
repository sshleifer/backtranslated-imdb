Where to start? How best to describe how terrible this movie is ??? Let's start with campy hick humor. It's not very funny. Add a number of musicians who suffer from the actors - the smell of meat is terrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. Bad Art Carney, who should have known this movie better. <br /> <br /> And then there is a plot. The road to life with Alice Cooper's exhibition will meet a girl whose life goal is to be Alice Cooper's group. At least they get what they want ... <br /> <br /> And when the movie is over, they can't find a more reliable last scene than well - I won't destroy it for you if you really want a movie to see. <br /> <br /> There are certain players who will let you know that this is a "B" movie or perhaps worse. Gailard Sartain is one for me - and he has a more important role to play. This is a sure sign that the film may not be very good. If anything else, the film lives on low expectations - even outweighs the inferior. <br /> <br /> Let's just say that. It's a movie that compares all the bad movies. And none of them is worse than Roadie.
