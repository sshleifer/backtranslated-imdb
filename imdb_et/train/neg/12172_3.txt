After the first Sleepaway camp attack, who thought that a franchise could be born. SC II is better from the aspect. More inspired killings and just much more fun. Although it may not be much to say (compared to the first movie), it is worth renting Sleepaway Camp II. <br /> <br /> Pros: Entertaining, not taking yourself too seriously, like SC I. Inspired killings. Cons: Crappy work and the bubbles are rich. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: 5/10 <br /> <br />
