HORRENDOUS! Avoid like plague. I'd appreciate it in the 10 worst movies ever. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. seem to have been made by daycare students ... wait, I've seen programs better than this. Opens like a soft porn show with a blurry naked woman doing a shower scene then going badly from there. Good nude scenes, but that's it. Sound and light problems were persistent throughout the film. Sometimes I swear I heard the roar of the camera's engines. YIKES! I'd like to see this story in another movie, but it's done by different people. This batch of participants and team needs more acting and film lessons. Voted 1 out of 10 people.
