How Rick Sloane was allowed to make five films is harder to believe than a cold fusion. This movie is completely criminal. Before watching the movie, I thought Manos: hands on fate were worse than I ever saw, but at least Manos is moving so slowly that you can fall asleep, saving your eyes from the pain it suffers. The biggest tragedy of this movie is that the old man who keeps Hobgoblins "locked" makes it the ultimate scene. The time to watch this movie was an absolute waste of my life.
