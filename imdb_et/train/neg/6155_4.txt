A strange mix of traditional 80's, smartassy, ​​Chevy Chase, "ten-ten-te-saan-funny-one" carnival and sick black comedy. Lightly entertaining in places, but completely tasteless. There is a ski trail that includes retrospective projects looking at the woods because of "His Majesty's Secret Service". (**)
