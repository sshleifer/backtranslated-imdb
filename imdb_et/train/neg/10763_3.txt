First, what's the movie good? Some real actors? exotic background? the fact that the actors do not laugh by acting (I would have been in their situation)? I do not know. The story is simple: The Catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who (the other abstract painter) killed his brother, the male prostitute (raped by another priest when he was young ...). I'm afraid there's nothing to learn here or to think about some serial numbers, art, or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst episode in the worst season, "profer" (serie) with alternates and incredible coincidence (Uncle is a policeman who may be a priest-child, etc., in a girl living in another victim's house, etc.).
