I can now clearly see why Robin Hood was flying fast. Its first episode is probably the worst that the BBC ever issued. The open scenes were about as intense, meaningful and intelligent as the two monkeys fighting, Robin Hood had no character and the sword fight was just ridiculous. The worst part of the episode was Robin Hood, who created a cow with a make-up at the beginning of the episode - how many people wore a pencil in the 12th century? Someone. The series may have improved considerably since then, but this first episode quickly put people's hopes down and is essentially a bunch of cr * p. The great hero of England is ashamed. <br /> <br /> "Do you promise it?" I don't want to do this if the BBC doesn't understand what a smart investment is. 3/10
