Movieography: Great, nice camera angles (I don't remember seeing the movie late, with good close-ups until this one). You could have scenes with a soft camera. NY is good in the picture. I liked the upside down, especially (different touch). <br /> <br /> Music: Not Impressive. Even after watching the movie, the songs will not remain in your mind. Maybe I waited for the same quality as "Anniyan". Disappointment. <br /> <br /> Actors: Kamal has to slowly pull out the hard core sequences. His age and belly really appear. It should also avoid close romantic sequences. It was very uncomfortable to see a mature / older star who was still trying to play like 20+ heroes scenes. Love can be expressed at any age; if we get older, you can still love it far away (without touching too many women. For example, the love of "chandrmukhis" expressed by Rajinikanthi). <br /> <br /> Jyotika just appears in the movie for the noun. Not sure why he accepted it. It's not my problem, I guess. <br /> <br /> Others have only a small presence. <br /> <br /> Direction: I was expecting Gautham to show off his second film "Kakka Kakka". He deceived me. The release of the film due to a number of problems took a long time. She slips into a scene. Even outstanding things went down from the famous director. Too many graphics. DO NOT FIND not for children (and for adults waiting for some "entertainment"). <br /> <br /> Thx
