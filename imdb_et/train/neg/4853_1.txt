I am a big fan of war films and Vietnamese Veterinary Veterinarian has experience with technical details. I worked with bombs more than once and have nothing but their respect. Other veterinarians, and especially Iraqi veterinarians, have made very good the inaccuracies of this film. The poetic license is one thing, but this film is a complete fantasy and has failed because of it. No bomb destruction unit or unit would ever endure the rogue for more than 5 minutes. Military units reward cause and discipline for a reason, it saves lives. Open scene has been particularly disturbing to me. A man with a cell phone would have come down immediately. Jumping, "Stop Choosing" is not an effective deterrent. Then it got worse. Sniper scenes were particularly threatening. As others have noted, your average EOD boy does not know he is a sniper, and think that every Arabic sniper is that good imagination really stretches. The robbery of an Arab businessman for some kind of personal revenge would not happen. Someone can shoot him, but this risk-taking is limited to movies. I could go on, but, as I said, others have spelled out in detail. This is not a good movie, and if it wins at all, it will still reflect why La La Land has been named.
