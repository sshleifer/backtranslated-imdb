After life is a miracle, I did not expect much. It is hard to believe that these films are made by the same man as Do You Remember Dolly Bell. Zavet is two hours of stupid antiques with no story. Underground's wild and rampant humor seems to be a pathetic holiday here. It seems that Kusturica has been constantly falling down because she started making comedy comedies, starting with Black Cat, the White Cat, which I thought was great but already had some disturbing signs of dementia. I liked his early films so much, so it's especially disappointing to see something like that. We hope his next is great.
