I watched this movie after it was so much effort to download it via rapidshare. And I have to say it doesn't deserve it. <br /> <br /> Parinda was such a hypothesis that I really look forward to seeing it. <br /> <br /> Parinda is one of those films that doesn't meet the standards of other good Indian filmmakers, despite having a great story. It was even more pathetic to know that the story itself was not original, it was loosely based on the classic "On the Waterfront". <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor was irritating, especially when she came from America. There was a lack of direction many times except for some intermediate scenes. <br /> <br /> Give this script to some of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhat, Sudhir Mishra and I'm 100 years old about making a movie out of it. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying Parinda was bad. It was not just good enough.
