Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea at first. The last film was a mediocre effort. Put it next to this load, it's a comedy classic. If the second part was full of dated humor and cheap pictures, it was at least funny. There is nothing funny about forced humor. Fun, training, and eyesight should of course be funny. Hitting an observer with tired jokes is not cool. The humor of this film provided for juvenile germs that laugh at something. When they took care of the high school crowd, every sense of self-esteem was thrown out of the window. Circle parades are not funny. I've been following them in comedies since 1998. They are so dated. Michael Jackson's jokes are not cool either. Worse still, two times the fun that is distributed is "performers" whose best days were never. <br /> <br /> The death of American cinema has been slow. Such films are nails that have been flushed by this coffin. What happened to humor? I haven't been laughing at the cinema for a long time. Too many bad movies rotting the brain. You want evidence? Go to your local mega-chain video rental shop and see what's on the shelves. This movie is bad. Don't believe in hype. I'd rather look at Scary Movie 2 as a continuous loop than to suffer this bad pretext for comedy ever! <br /> <br /> Definitely not recommended (if you don't have a handful of brain cells).
