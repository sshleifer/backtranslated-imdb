My mother worked with Dennis L. Raider for eleven years, not to mention a common office with her. When he announced he was a BTK, he was shocked. The whole day was just her storytelling about how she'd never seen her as Wichita Killer. I've heard that he talks to them repeatedly. I asked him a lot of things and went to all the interviews he was asked to go. I've read a whole book about Rider, Wichita is my home town, and I was surprised that such a thing could happen in Kans. <br /> <br /> On TV, there was another BTK movie not too long ago, and I thought it would have been better to portray Dennis's killings, perhaps even in some intelligent ways, of his motives. <br /> <br /> I'm very crazy about movie. It is based on my mother's portrayal of her, all her readings, and the videos I told her. <br /> <br /> First, the corners of the camera were terrible. It seemed like it would come from a home video camera. Action was terrible and I couldn't even look at it. <br /> <br /> Dennis Raider never had long hair. Dennis Raider was a "very anal man" and was "following the rules". She was not as nice as the film saw her, she was very polite and steep, business. The same applies to his killing as much as we all know. If you have seen your confession in court, you may already guess. <br /> <br /> And like an obsession with a slaughterhouse? Never. I've never read or Dennis Raider has admitted that he has a problem with animal cruelty or human injury. In fact, he practiced suffocation in cats and dogs. But through the film, he put the animals on his victim's face and acted as he took care of their welfare. Dennis Raider never killed people he knew, admitted it, but in his first killing movie he talks to the woman he knows. <br /> <br /> I don't even want to go into this movie and I'm already talking. This is not what you want to see if you are interested in the actual events of the BTK. This is not what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie. If you want half of the person who kills the scene to be porn, then that's your movie.
