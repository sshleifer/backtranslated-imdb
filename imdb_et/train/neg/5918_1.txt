Carl Panzram lived an amazing life and wrote his memoirs on paper scraps, probably the only person ever to do something unusual to him. The book "Panzram: Murder Magazine" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long, which came out a century after Panzram's death, gave the historical context a first-generation American account to go home away from home and be a cowboy, catch, throw the boy home, get away repeatedly and thrown into prison all the time, tormented and sodomized. When Panzram grew tremendously and heavily, he tried to revenge his wrongdoing when he traveled to South America, Europe and Africa and it was not important what people raped, robbed, or murdered because we are all equally worthless <br /> < br /> This film casts a hard neck on James Woods, the son of Carl Panzram, who is "drunk", too dramatic and emotional, and who never mentions the joy of sodomizing men and boys. The film does not specify anything other than the traveler and career of this world (like the abduction of former President Taffeta or the release of Oregon from prison until he gave his word back). In short, I don't think Carl would be too happy.
