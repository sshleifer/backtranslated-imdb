Aldolpho (Steve Buscemi), an aspiring filmmaker, lives in a regretted NYC apartment and relies on his mother to help rent. She has a beautiful neighbor named Angelica (Jennifer Beals), who can be married but who would love Aldolpho to celebrate her movie. When Al is unexpectedly awaiting a financial promise to finance his film from a strange man, Joe, he thinks he has done it. This means that until Joe takes Al with an adventure to steal a part of Porsche's financial support. Will the film be made before Aldolpho is a completely moral backbone? And does Angelica mark the film? This is a terrible movie, according to the viewer. The script is insecure, with a plot that runs weakly. Beals practically snarls all his lines and Buscemi, though pleasing, are unrecognized. Many original materials and unpleasant signs are many. Finally, the output values ​​are also very bad, always changing the film to another level. If you have time for your hands, it is still a good idea not to use this opportunity. But if you are preaching a punishment, go ahead and see the cunning. The smells seem beautiful.
