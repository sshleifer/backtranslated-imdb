If you are on a British film, you expect some quality. And when it comes to operation, camera work, lighting, etc .; this movie is doing business. This is done by highly skilled craftsmen. This alone can bring you a pleasant one and a half hours. But if you look at the layers of professionalism, you won't find anything. Apart from the fact that you feel good and support the liberal view of drugs, there is really nothing there. The script is mediocre, the plot is predictable and the end must be one of the eastern parts of Hollywood. All this is English to eat, it's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another "perfect". Why did they make this movie? I have no idea after making money.
