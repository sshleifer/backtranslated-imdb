Usually when I go to the local Hollywood Video I attack, I'm going to B-Horror movies. For me, the basic principles of the B-Horror film are the value of the camp, Heavy Gore, a lot of unnecessary nudity and special effects that everyone can put together with corn syrup and latex. I severely rented the fear of Cradle of Fear because I've been a fan of the band because they released the first demo in 1995. The movie started with an interesting note and when I saw Dani Filth's stomp with an extremely obvious latex mask I LAUGHED. When I saw a lesbian sex scene in the interest of a lesbian sexual scene, LAUGHEDI VERY HARDER. I spent pretty much the whole movie laughing, and when I didn't laugh, I shook my head, wondering how a multi-million dollar rock star would like to make a movie that looked like it was in the budget of several hundred dollars. It seemed to me that this film attracted "Hardcore Goth's children who think death, ruin, sex, blood, and Satan are the biggest inventions of Lava Lamps. It was really that. That movie seemed to me 80.5% of this movie What happened in this movie happened just for Satan's sake. This movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie, but in the end this "movie" really is just an extended Cradle of Filth Video.
