It has been around 14 years since Sharon Stone gave the viewers a crossing of their legs, which spun the thoughts of many people. And now, God knows why, he's in the game again. "Basic Instinct 2" is another "Basic Instinct" with sexy stone and vulnerable Michael Douglas. However, the fans of the original may not even approach it, because "Instinct 2" is a painful film because the mediocre director Michael Caton-Jones is killing the legacy of the first film. <br /> <br /> The film's graph begins when the car's explosion begins at the very beginning. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone, who is trying hard for a sexy look) is a suspect and seems to be involved in murder. A psychiatrist (terrible David Morrisey) is called to investigate him, but eventually he falls for an intimate seduction game. <br /> <br /> And there is, without further explanation, the main force that moves it into "Instinct". There's nothing much to explain and we have to sit through a slippery, class C erotic movie. Part of it is because of amateur writing, careless direction and terribly low chemistry. The film is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality (interrupting the Trojan scene so it wouldn't be appreciated by NC-17) as the first entry in the series "Instinct" is a persuasive torture. <br /> <br /> Up, all that made the original movie is not in the movie anywhere. It is really bad to do it. Sharon Stone has some highlights, but here he is extremely disgusting David Morrisey celebrates his life in the worst role and seems to never make more than two expressions in the movie - confused and anxious. "Instinct 2" is a terrible way to continue the original series that was erotic e thriller put very well. Paul Verhoeven, how I miss you .... <br /> <br /> "Basic instinct 2" never heard a good movie and it's not really. Some movies should not come out of paper and this is the feeling you look at after that. It is now much easier to understand why Douglas and David Cronenberg went out and why Sharon Stone had been waiting for a huge fee ......
