It is a really good film that lies just under the layer of layers that are on the layers of "Pagemaster" cheese. year. I remember this with hate when it first came out, but this time I found that the special effects are pretty good. The plot is just an "endless story" with a creativity-endectomy, but it's a pretty little flick for anyone just wanting a truly fantastic eye candy. Animation is amazing, and especially like the way animators allow their characters to look and act more surreally than usual. I'll give her three classes if I * had given her two (just a parody value) if I'd ever decided to watch this movie, waiting for her to absolutely get my thought.
