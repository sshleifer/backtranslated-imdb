I think this film is a tribute to the first Superman movie because it is just as heavy and painfully long as the original. to look for a smooth, brownish futuristic broad credit for the original Superman movie. <br /> <br /> Then there are some nice things. I'm Kent looking at the farm with some kind of dusk and spending a good part of his life slowly walking to some debris in the field. Then Superman jumps on her and faints. <br /> <br /> Next, we reach Lex Luthor in a scene that touches a lot of old lady close relatives when he dies. We don't see Luthor's face before the end of the scene, an early film timeline that doesn't leave hackneyed around the stone. Lex Luthor is a man who doesn't like Superman because he is not a human being. He also doesn't like people because the film sometimes has a story about Lex Luthor who is going to kill most of the Earth's population. <br /> <br /> After a while, Clark Kent will return to his old job (I forgot to mention he was on a five-year trip where nothing happened). Then he discovers that Lois Lane has an illegal boy and gets acquainted with Cyclops. It disturbs her so much that she loses control of her superpowers to such an extent that she accidentally interrupts the frame. <br /> <br /> At this point, we see that Miss Lane is on some kind of jet. space shuttle. This is an important event because it is on television. Then we learn that there are people in the control room that follows such an event. There are also people watching it on television and pilots in the booth. The film then reminds us that these people are involved, cutting most of them from the summer. <br /> <br /> Since the events that led to the inevitable disaster began to build, I apologized for soda. I accidentally went back to the wrong theater and watched this movie about Al Gore, which shows full slides. I was trying to find my way back to Superman Returns, but I was looking at the Prairie homeland I watched twice in a row. Then it was time to finish brass around. <br /> <br /> I went back to the first theater, found my place and watched to see that the upcoming Lois Lane space shuttle disaster was almost us. However, it seemed to take forever, so I lost in the theater, met a girl, married, raised my son and sent him to college. At the end of my son's medical school, I recalled that I should probably register for Superman Returns, so I apologized for myself and returned to the theater just to learn there was no need for speed. It was about half an hour before the Space Shuttle Lane went wrong. When they did, Superman saved everything that was pretty cool. <br /> <br /> And then there is a sub-block where Superman really turns horrible and starts pursuing Lois Lane and his family with his X-ray and super-hearing. Then he tries to deceive him, who seems like a good guy. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Lex Luthor has been involved in some kind of competition to show all possible common villain behavior before the end of the movie. I forgot to take my scoreboard home (they give you at one door), but I think he got a fucking one hundred percent. I hope he will win a million dollars. I think maybe the projector was broken, the film seemed like a loop for a while. I remember seeing the water grow puzzled, Superman sick, Superman heals, back to dark things, he's sick again, he's not waiting, he's fine again. bad boy moves: screaming a little with his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Then Superman died and came back to life. I thought the movie was over, so I left. <br /> <br /> Ninety years later, I felt the nursing home where I lived was feeling a little cool. I realized I left my shirt theater in the theater and I went under it. When I did, I was a little surprised that Superman Returns was not over yet. I was trying to ask some of the viewers what I miss, but most of them were just skeletons with long gray beards. <br /> <br /> I sat back in my old seat and watched the Lois Lane put her house in for a while. Then Superman showed and started quoting the beginning of the movie, and as I already saw that part, I thought it was right to leave. <br /> <br /> So this is my review of Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, if you like jokes about people who eat dogs or jokes about a dog who eats another dog, you love this movie. That's why it has two jokes.
