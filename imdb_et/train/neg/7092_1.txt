<br /> <br /> This film (not a movie that is clearly recorded inexpensively for a camcorder) can be one of the greatest cinematic stink in history. Caution: The package promotes the erotic exploration of flick as a sexual addiction. The film is not something to research and it is no longer erotic than its own warts. The script is pointless and inclined, with all plot elements acting as segway between supposed sex scenes. But even sex scenes are lame flat. Except for the first, they are about three seconds long (then again, maybe my version was cut) and comic burnt. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a decent movie, you will not want it. If you are looking for a good sex flick then you don't want it. Regardless of the purposes, wishes, or perspectives of your life, you do not want to watch this movie. How they got to Rosanna Arquette, Natashia Kinski and Ed Begly in this stink bomb is extreme.
