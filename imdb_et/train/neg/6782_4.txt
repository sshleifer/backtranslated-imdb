None of Keaton's best efforts, this was apparently a hidden attempt to revenge the family he married - Talmadges. The Polish / English barrier and a series of coincidences lead to Buster's marriage to a large Irish woman who (along with her father and brothers) treats her until they think she may be the heir of the fortune. The mistake here is wrong identities - the gags are built and the main one cannot pay. <br /> <br /> This short subway is at least two real smiles - Buster's cleverly twisting your dinner deficiency by using a calendar on the wall and the main ignorance of his family to literally bring meat to your plate. The second is a family photo, with the whole group slowly falling on the floor as the camera's tripod loses its stability. <br /> <br /> The overflow of yeast beer has been a catalyst for massive built-in series beyond gags, but stops for short (for all buildings) development. <br /> <br /> Cinema print is crisp and clear, and the score is one for piano, drums and sound effects. Not one of Buster's best efforts, but he's worth some laughter.
