Dooohhh! My Bwainn Hurrrts! Well it will definitely be after the endurance test of the movie. How did I manage to go without knocking the fast back and forth button? Maybe I don't get the film's premise ... or maybe I don't understand its alleged mystical atmosphere. In my humble opinion, even though the film has about the same mystical atmosphere as the trip to McDonalds. <br /> <br /> In addition, all characters were terrible and Tom & Jerry's comic has more character. Yaarrrghhh! Why am I doing this? why am I watching such hell? It is enough for one to escape and join a monastery or foreign legion! YAARGH !! Absolutely horrible movie in almost every respect. Moreover, it is not bad.
