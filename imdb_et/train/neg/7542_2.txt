This movie is expected to be a mysterious and serious thriller who sees a man looking for a lost girl. But after 30 minutes in the film, it becomes a funny, unrealistic story with annoying signs and random scenes. I can't imagine someone laughing when Cage accidentally gets Karate into this blonde girl, or when she "carries" that old lady. Lines, characters and action are all gone. I've always loved Nicolas Cage as an actor, but this year has made some terrible movies; it is by far the worst (yet ...). <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see an intense story thrilling thriller. If you really want to enjoy this story, go to the original. However, if you intend to watch it, be prepared to laugh at some lines and scenes, not to take them seriously; this is the only way to enjoy this movie.
