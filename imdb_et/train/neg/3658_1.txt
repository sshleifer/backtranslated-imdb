Despite the somewhat thoughtful strange scenarios and the overall value of the curiosity of the film, Wolfman Fury appears as a boring, uninteresting excursion to lycanthropy, recorded only with the static presence of the home of Perla Cristal. The rest of the players, including hammy Naschy, have a total write-off (although none of them often help with scary copying). Although the scenario has varied enough with werewolves / Frankenstein / Dr Moreau to bring out a dozen films, the plot has been so unevenly developed, so weak and dialogue so funny (at least in English) that all Hidden Interest in Market Processing will soon be canceled. <br /> <br /> The direction of Zabalza seems bleak, even amateur. His performance is clumsy and ineffective. It is not helped by Villasenor's excessive bright lighting. Even promising pictures are so inconveniently captured that some of the director's attempts to give the audience fears have been clearly shown. ridiculously crude, completely primitive special effects deserve special condemnation.
