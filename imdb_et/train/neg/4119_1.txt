I thank God for not going to the movie theater. I would be very sorry for the money I gave. I saw it on TV and I couldn't believe my eyes. I don't know if a movie can be worse. they spent millions of dollars on this film. terrible action and terrible scenario. I think other people who commented are a man working on this filmmaker;) it's a very big fiasco! can they still laugh at such a movie in 2000? embarrassing ...
