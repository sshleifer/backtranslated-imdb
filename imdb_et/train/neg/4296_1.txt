I said it was the worst gay movie I've ever seen, but I can honestly say it's the worst movie than any genre I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> You are in trouble when the film starts with a "personal note" from the director, asking the audience to "understand" the "many challenges" facing the first driver. The soundtrack is so bad in many scenes that it is almost impossible to follow the dialogue and it is from the DVD version. Bad lighting, bad sets, bad photography, bad scripting, generally bad behavior all add to this "movie" invisible. I made it through a lot of experiments after a bad end, and I immediately gave away a DVD that I bought foolishly. I am sure that the first-time director has many challenges. However, do not try to pull it down as a flat end product. I see from IMDb's details that it was not only Richard Natale's first referral, but also the only one. This is one positive thing I can say about this alleged "movie".
