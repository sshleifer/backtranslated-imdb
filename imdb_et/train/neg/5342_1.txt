Rachel, Jo, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are up here. They deserve oscar candidates for their performances. I am a big TV show fan. Their music stones and they are all so talented! I am also SARCASM !!!!!! <br /> <br /> A great exponent IF YOU S CLUB FAN IS NOT THIS !!!!! <br /> <br /> Performances are terribly weak, dialogue is terrible and jokes aren't even done properly (I'm sorry for the director). The jokes are so incredibly bad that 8 small, passionate S Club fans didn't laugh. They thought they could do better. And they did. They conquered the world. They got S Club Juniors. Paul, "fat, ugly, who started the mosh band" must thank his lucky stars he left when he did. One of the worst movies. ATTENTION TO THIS MOVIE! DO NOT ANSWER! You do not want! YOU WILL WIN! 0/10 RJT
