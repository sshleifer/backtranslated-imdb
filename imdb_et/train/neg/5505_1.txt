Shazbot, is it embarrassing. In fact, here is a list of 100, which is embarrassing: 1.) The return of Christopher Lloyd. 2.) Jeff Daniels plays essentially the same role he played in a live 101 Dalmatian remake that wasn't too juicy at first. He definitely has a funny way to promote his Purple Rose Theater ... 3.) Disnefluff. 4.) Another disappointing reminder that Wallace Shawn is for Disney, which Jet Li was for Bob Hoskins in Unleashed. 5.) The original Mars from the TV series Ray Walston played a bit in this flick (read "cameo") and died two years later from lupus. Coincidence? 6.) terrible special effects. Seriously - terrible. 7.-100.) This fucking talks, crying, by Wayne Knight ("Newman!") Gave a tedious degree. My favorite scene? HA! HA ha, ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ... Whew! ... Good. You - You're joking. Okay, let's finish this review quietly about this franchise's agonizing death and if you want, you can say a quick prayer that Disney will not forget this tragedy and do something stupid like Tim Allen, starring "Mork and Mindy" .......... ................................... ............
