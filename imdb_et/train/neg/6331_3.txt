Mr. Mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time, so I was interested in what he did with the complete creative management of the film. Unfortunately, it is unobtrusive, though not because jokes are not funny - some of them (I don't say most) are and actually did Mike good work by translating his spiritually unbalanced leveling layer into visual. The problem is that the technical quality (kits, lighting, sound, editing, you call it) is so terrible that the film is unbearable. Some clothes, called "PKO Productions", get a credit for the production, but it doesn't look at all. it seems more like Mike stole one SNL from the camera and did the whole thing in the afternoon. I understand that Mike's aim was to torture the audience, but it even deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to actually see, hear or understand what it is, what should be shocking. However, DVD is not a general waste: it includes Bill Murray's O'Donoghue jargon and SNL's three "Mike's least loved Bedtime Stories". In addition, the movie "Cat Swimming" is a great scene to watch if you want to think of someone. 3/10
