Don't understand how these animated movies come out and no matter how good (or bad) is that people love it. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my two children (5.7). They like a lot of animations (like most people who priced this movie). The theater was almost full and I was expecting the movie with its great pain. Speaking of the truth, I was bored. It was incredibly predictable and just plain. The film had a few smiles and it was. Of course, they tried to get a cheap laugh again, but just didn't work. My son almost always tells me he wants a DVD when we see an animated movie, but not on it. My daughter stayed asleep. The kids also thought the character's animation seemed strange. I haven't heard of them because I saw Polar Express, who gave my daughter a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Trust me, I'm not the one who is looking for a negative in everything. However, quality is quality and as many animated movies they throw out there are very small.
