As usual, I went to see this film for A.Rahman. Otherwise, the movie is not good. Rajni wanted to end his film career with this film if it was successful. But fortunately, or unfortunately, the movie was unsuccessful. After that, he hit with Chandramukh. Looking forward to your future in Shivaji. <br /> <br /> I've read another user's comment about Rhin. I found the user interesting from TN. Rhine is one of the actors who I think is not in her heart. He is not a method actor, like Kamal Hasan. I think we have to appreciate Rhine for her strong approach to her age. <br /> <br /> In some way, I have to fill this line with 10 lines ... so I wish u would be happy ...
