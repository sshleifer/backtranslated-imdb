If I knew that this movie was filmed amazingly and queas-inducingly in the Dogme 95 style, I would never have rented it. Nevertheless, I took drama for the sea disease and gave it down. I took very, very, very long forty minutes before giving up. It's just a boring, pretentious twaddle. <br /> <br /> The last French film I saw was "Romance", and it was also quite uncomfortable, but at least the camera was a constant and not a breath of breath. I'm confused about the continuing popularity of Dogme 95 abroad - it is catching up in America at about the same time as the next big leprosy. (This is called Dogme 95 because it is the average number of times that the cameras acted in the eye.) <br /> <br />
