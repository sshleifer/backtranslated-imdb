The best thing I can say about this film is that it was fun from time to time and that it was a good timekeeper. Unfortunately, this movie is so annoying that I wanted to capture these characters. This is such a lovely movie that hurts. I think the intentions were good, but things become terribly tiring when the dialogue is so bad. If the two lines are not on the screen together, it is not at all bad, but be afraid of those frequent moments when the loving couple begins to talk to each other.
