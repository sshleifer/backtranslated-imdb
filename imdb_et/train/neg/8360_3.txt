What's nice about this movie ??? <br /> <br /> It's colorful! <br /> <br /> This is impressive underwater photography! <br /> <br /> Against this background, the rhythmic musical score is good from time to time! <br /> <br /> So three out of 10! Sometimes music is accelerated! Especially when shark or bad move! Sometimes it slows down! It is time to express sympathy as if to pass on to the audience! <br /> <br /> When another bites dust! As "Western Spaghetti" it is much like that! <br /> <br /> It's not that Italians can't produce high quality productions! There were a number of films titled "Octopus", numbered from about 1 to 7, scanned in the 1990s on SBS TV in Australia for mafia-type conflicts! And they were great! But unfortunately you can't find it here! <br /> <br /> I assumed it was made around the 1960s! Unfortunately, it was 20 years old, as shown at the end of the funeral! <br /> <br /> Then there was a sharp sharp shark that repeatedly puts the red dust out with blue water! All in all, whether by hitting a bar room or looking at the latest sea-bloody demolitions by a relentless hungry shark, the hero looks at his glasses with little concern as if he was bored in his relentless role, as he had little evidence of plot or character development! <br /> <br /> At least the hero refers to his late wife for his late concern! But, of course, even if the music fails to raise our understanding, we have a bad voice with a bad voice, as if to beat us, that another dark act will occur! <br /> <br /> And finally, somebody thought about a twist! Just when we thought it was all predictable! But listen, people, because you can find another twist! If you look closely! To warm up your heart more or less! <br /> <br /> Follow the hero's advice and make a couple of beers! This makes your viewing "Night of Sharks" more enjoyable! <br /> <br /> Then you're ready for something like "007" to make your way to reality when it's over!
