After watching the movie, I felt the convincing need to get rid of my little disappointment. Selma Blair is a fabulous, currently undervalued actor and Max Beesley was "charming" in "Kill Me Later". The story, though not quite original, certainly showed no promise. None of this was important ... at all. <br /> <br /> I don't know what he's doing, but Dana Lustig, the director, has virtually no talent. He slowed down the footage, pulled up the recorded shots, transformed the shots, used uncomfortable corners of the camera, used tedious color filters, made zillion cuts quickly, jumped back and forth on the timeline, and shot it all with unpleasant "modern" twilight spam. I don't remember the last time I saw such incompetent work in managing a movie. His ego must be immense to capture the actors and the story and make the viewer members aware that he is headed and in the middle. It's stabbed under their throat. <br /> <br /> "Kill Me Later" is a couple of good scenes that show what could and should have been. Unfortunately, just as things started to show promise, Mrs Lustig lost her cinematic bags and again. It is a shame because Blair and Beesley had good chemistry and you can say that the film had a really good heart. 3/10
