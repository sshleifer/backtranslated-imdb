Alone in the dark, there is one BAD movie and tied to Deuce Bigalow for the worst film of the year. I wish it was all I had to say, but of course IMDb sees the number of words and all that. The low budget is like Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos. Or a huge budget deficit like Gigli, Superbabies or this guff. You see movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos happen because the director has no idea. Such films happen because the director is a stupid, money-grabing idiot who just doesn't care about his audience. has some real garbage under the belt) has created something that happens only once during the blue month. Really terrible bad movie. All this is a mess. Cheesy CGI, bad plot, crazy random camera trimming and terrible sound. Woo hoo! Look over. Give me a buddy, roll in 2006 and I must never talk about it again. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie.
