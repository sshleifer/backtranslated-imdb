.... may seem far removed .... but in fact the real story of life ... a man who was related to a woman who found where she and her new wife were, and she killed a woman, making it a murder raping. ...... <br /> <br /> In his mistake, he told everyone that he asked him to marry ... so he gave up his job in Wisconsin ... and moved to Minnesota ......... <br /> <br /> Finally, I heard he was a spiritual institution, a security prison .... <br /> <br /> he was still an "engagement ring". that he had bought himself ... and had told everyone he had bought it. <br /> <br /> Events took place in the small town of Wisconsin ,,,,,,, and the murder took place in Minnesota ...... <br /> <br /> Even in the "People" magazine ... impression story, I want to say on page 39. I remember it as I was in college at the time and my colleague met in an individual's security hospital.
