I'm honest. The only reason I watched it on TV was that it's 100 in the IMDb bottom. And right now I was wondering if the hour and a half of my life was really worth the same check on the same list. > <br /> Van Damme is Luc Deveraux, who finds himself in the battle with universal soldiers after the mainframe pulled himself to protect HAL. And yes, after all the obligatory explosions, fires and references he is standing. Along with dreadful behavior and a bit boring setup, this place in the infamous list is easy. <br /> <br /> Only for the idiots that I like to watch, and want to see this complete list. 2/10.
