Do they make movies without being naked and having sex? It came on Sunday afternoon at 3:00 and I couldn't believe what they showed. Thanks to God, my son was out or would be disappointed if he had seen soft / medium porn! Do people who make movies don't care about who is offensive or corrupt? Children could have followed the church and that's what they show? Action was good and I enjoyed the tension, but GEE! There was violence and bad guys, but it's expected on Western film. Randy Travis was very good in his role. If writers, directors and producers simply end up with so many unsolicited applications for sexual scenes. What must happen to be able to go in this direction? Where am I complaining?
