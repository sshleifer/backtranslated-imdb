What kind of documentary about a musician does not take one path by the artist himself? Unlike Ray or countless other music artists, half of the fun theater (or sofa) has big songs themselves. Here, all the tracks are covered with uninteresting characters, and these renditions don't let Cohen's slow jazz style. More often, the covers are poorly sung folk versions. Interviews are the same as or more with other musicians and figures than Cohen himself. Only rarely is Cohen reading his work (never singing) - like letters, poems, etc. The film did not hit the artist's biography or the development that had taken place over the years. Great disappointment for a big Cohen fan.
