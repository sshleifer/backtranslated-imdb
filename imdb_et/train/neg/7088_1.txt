My wife put down this cruelty, tried to turn it off after 10 minutes, but was forced to go through the whole thing. It must be hands down, the most terrible work of the movie ... <br /> <br /> There were great moments in the script, for example: <br /> <br /> Sammy - "If he gets over right now, he'll get a bonus" madam - "boner?" Sammy - "No, bonus" <br /> <br /> To sum up: A terrible script, awful action and incredibly illogical.
