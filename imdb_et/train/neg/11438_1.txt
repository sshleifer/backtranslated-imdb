If you've ever had a worse comedy than "gray things", I don't know about it. The "funny" assumption of the New York Jewish comedy is that the siblings Sam & Gray are mistaken for a couple and thus decide to have Sam with a girlfriend to find that Gray is equally minded with their target - Charlie. The revelation that Gray is secretly gay is probably just a surprise to her. There is a deeply offensive wedding queue, which is the deeply embarrassing "drunken" of Moynahan and Graham, and a play that tortures forests everywhere in Tom Cavanagh's tree. Sissy Spacek shows a complete inability to do comedy and wants it to be out of the way. Molly Shannon plays home-friend lumpen with insecurity. Only Alan Cumming appears under any credit, but is seriously underfunded and is not given anything. The entire disaster is confirmed by Graham's strange eye-running performance that culminates in the penultimate scene where he is wearing a comedy hat and coat, despite the fact that the scene is set in a lesbian bar. It is amazing that this movie has ever been released and has no redemption function and should be avoided at all costs.
