It was the worst movie I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Not only does it have almost nothing to do with other American Pie movies, the story is obvious, flat and absolutely not funny. <br /> <br /> Girls are nice, but spending their time watching cheap soft porn can be bigger than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a very bad sex advertisement made to an audience that is not older than 12. <br /> <br /> I never attended an American college, but I would seriously suspect that someone who did would really laugh at any scene. <br /> <br /> Save your time, do something else.
