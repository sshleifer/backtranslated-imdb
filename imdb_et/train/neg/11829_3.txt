I watched this movie after watching the 82-minute "Borat" and I was quite disappointed. I was a big fan of Wallace and Gromid and I went to animation films regularly. Nevertheless, I found myself going out and at one point I almost went out, but I waited for this film to get better. Never happened. <br /> <br /> Visual images are stunning and the voice is the upper limit, especially in my opinion, Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remind you a few times that the bulbous lizard was an attack. Gandalf and Magneto). The problem with this movie for me is that it is one of the animated features of the ADD set. It registers after one girl is a routine routine after a secondary suppression of a syrup-filled plot that pulls out every stop trying to convey a "significant message". It seems that for the animated category, the Oscar is a lot to feed, and given how it is judged by critics, I would not be surprised if the Academy gets it wrong and offers its hardware. But if you are looking for a nice animated function for rats, take my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
