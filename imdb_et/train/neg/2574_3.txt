I know that movies do not necessarily reflect reality, but it got to my nerves. This confirms the unknown stereotypes of "psychological trauma" and mental illness. The "Psychoma" thing has been done too many times before (and usually improved) and a large part of the rest of the plot is far removed. Action was not terrible but nothing to rob. One of the highlights: I am a long-time fan of the general hospital and it was a trip to see the former role played by GH's regular Joni. Lindstrom. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you don't forget about this fake psychoanalytic part, you have to stop the reality / judgment if you watch a lot of movies, this movie may be acceptable. If you have nothing better to do and rather low standards. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I spent my time watching it.
