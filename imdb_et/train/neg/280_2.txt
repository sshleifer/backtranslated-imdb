God, I missed my head when I looked at this pilot. I had been waiting a lot for this because I am a great fan of James Cameron (and not only because of "Titanic", I could add), and his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of quality (then again, he also wrote Strange Days lead). .). But it was unfortunate that he could not grab his attention for almost two hours. Throughout this time, it barely went beyond its two-way summary, and I would be very hard to try to find out any coherent plot from all directions that didn't go anywhere. Besides, I do not believe that acrobatics would even be beyond the usual "A-Team" episodes. As far as Alba is concerned, she is naturally proud, but the fact that she only shows the whole movie of the face (pouty and surly) puts me in her "gal wit attitude" forever. You can guess me, Mr. Cameron!
