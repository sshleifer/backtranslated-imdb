Unfortunately, one of the best efforts in the field of special effects has been made completely pointless when it was placed side by side, on a stupid and equally pointless plot and inadequate cliché. Hollow Man is a pretty useless movie. <br /> <br /> Practically everyone here has seen death - characters, ideas and sequences (especially the lift shaft!) - with the only truly intriguing element. The film is an impressive special effect. But this is just as special an effect that has been made over and over again, and also the end of the film, which is also dead. Before I looked at Hollow Man, I hoped that the subject of the invisible person, which is in itself original, would be something newer and more interesting. It is not like that. It is not long before the film becomes too familiar with the blood bath and the mass of inefficient histrionics - the mound of clichés grows so fast that it is almost impressive. <br /> <br /> In addition, Kevin Bacon does a really pointless job and his supportive majority is not trying his best. Good points can be a thoughtful Jerry Goldsmith score (but no better efforts), rather interesting use of thermal images and special effects. I was tempted to give this film ten to ten, but its impact was exerted by Hollow Man's values ​​on one notch. <br /> <br /> 4/10
