First of all, I liked this movie. It seemed to me a nice comedy with some stupid moments. Costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best! The same as the wonderful set of decorations by Robert R. Benton - this man was really a very good taste !!! But the script writers were very disappointed. The best end would be the scene on the ladder, but instead they decided that the father and his daughter should be together. Don't like the end. Dad gets his daughter's boyfriend and his ex-wife knows it and finds he's fine. It would be OK if the scriptwriters, for example, would say that the body now has a second soul, but they did not, they only left memories. The participants were good, they were really funny. Cybill Shepherd was charming, Robert Downey Jr was very funny in the dance picture :))) ... But even a few moments even break the impression of a good show. For example, Corinne Jeffries, who was played by Cybill Shepherd after his wife's death, waited for him for 23 years (that is a long time!), He was true to him, he loved someone besides him, and when he met him and met him and was just her for love, after he was with his friend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal), he just gave him a longing for so many years !!! This would be a good movie, if not finished, and some unanswered human psychology.
