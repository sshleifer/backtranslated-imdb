"You're not going to shoot those little creatures. First, they haven't done anything bad for you. Second, they may be radioactive." Ah, non-budget 50's sci-fi joy? Nevertheless, despite the odd pearls, Superman and Mole-Men are quite uninspiring, even with a lean 58-minute workout. It's cheaper (one shot of Superman flying is incredibly little animation) and pretty boring, though it's a surprisingly altruistic message? Mole-Men, slightly larger skull and fur actors who look like Mxyzptlk without a hat when the underground critters released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious but misunderstood and George Reeves Man The man is trying to prevent Jeff Corey's local small town mobile from killing them. Perhaps there is an interesting counterpoint to the day-to-day password, but its suggestion is little more than good intentions.
