This film wants to make it clear that criminals are a product of modern society. So, are thieves, rapists and murderers (the killer of this movie, Carl Panzram (James Woods), are all three and worse)? An interesting concept, but very difficult to bring to the screen in an intellectually and emotionally satisfactory way. And this is where Killer: Murder magazine is very short. Although the film tries to put Panzram's behavior in perspective, with a rebound to its violent youth and dysfunctional education, the viewer never gets the idea that Panzram is a victim rather than a culprit. Of course, the system is corrupt, with one mobile who is staying at the entire Leavenworth Prison Hospital (where most of the movie takes place), most prison guards are a sadistic bully and prison director is something of a megalomaniac despot. But why on earth does the new prisoner Henry Lesser (Robert Sean Leonard) do so to Panzram? Even after reading his terrible diaries? The film offers some explanations: The smaller witnesses Panzram are beaten by the most sadistic (and stereotypical) guard, and Panzram's intelligence has impressed (although it is not clear why Lesser thinks this man is so smart). Certainly, this compassion is not enough against a hostile person like Panzram, even though this film tends to suppress his crimes and highlights his personality? In the direction of the smaller side, Panzram is quite loyal, and the viewer has the impression that for the Lesser it weighs all the atrocities he read in Panzram's diaries. Does this man have few friends so little that he will take the value of everything that seems to him only remotely friendly? Perhaps it is a small one who is a product of modern society, rather than looking at the substance. <br /> <br /> I can advise Monster, starring Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, as a film that deals with much more integrity and scope in much of the same subject. <br /> <br /> BTW: Killer looks like on TV (not so good)
