this is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. I gave up watching it after an hour and I regretted a lot after that hour. acting is terrible and almost no plot. my guess is that somebody came to the animal in a strange shape and started to make a story around it. borrowing some ideas from movies like Resident Evil and Aliens doesn't bring such a movie. If this is Korea's best movie, I wouldn't even want to see a Korean movie trailer ... <br /> <br /> By the way, these movies are a good reason to think that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising. I think every Korean who has an Internet to play the Internet rated this movie over 8, although it has no idea what it is.
