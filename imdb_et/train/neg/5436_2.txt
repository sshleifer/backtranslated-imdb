One of my friends gave me this movie. My friend is now in a hospital where a team of doctors tries to surgically remove the DVD case from their ***. <br /> <br /> I gave up the excitement of another Michael Chabon movie. When all his novels have brought me a lot of fun and the previous scenario adjustments were great but the boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, the people who poured should be asleep at the same time. I imagine that castings went something like that. "Tell me, do you like fish?" "Yes, I enjoy the fish very much." "Filled, you're hired. You have money." <br /> <br /> If the script exists. I've read Chabon, whom I hope he went blind before he saw the dong, and he has nothing to do with his novel. I wouldn't give up on why it bothered me, but it may have something to do with listening to the 90-year-old drunken hunter with a speech disorder with better cranial seal disorder would have been treating children with one-liner these second-degree model massacres. <br /> <br /> This is the real line of the movie; "If you tell me something you've never said aloud, this moment will be unique!" Unique? Do it? Is it really? Not a plank, of course. Please give me Imodium. I have a whole **** strip. <br /> <br /> Leadership is ... well. I have nothing. Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber got the word that Grandma exploded or something. Stay in control of comedies. No ad targeting. <br /> <br /> This movie is so terrible that it left me with a head wall so hard that it returned to the Stone Age. I'll give him 2 stars because I don't want to be a man looking at a 1-star movie.
