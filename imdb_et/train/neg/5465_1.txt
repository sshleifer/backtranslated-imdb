This movie is a special place in my heart as the worst film I've ever seen. It is about as fun as hard manual work in case of hard convulsions. The film starts off badly (I'd appreciate the first few minutes of the movie 1/10) and then it gradually gets worse in a minute's time. The only way to evaluate it at all would be some sort of exhausting negative number, which grows for ninety minutes. Unfunny is not a real word, but best describes this video of humor. Somehow, the video can even make the cute, little clad women and sex grotesque and terrible. This movie is amazingly bad. I'd say it would be better to be locked with a TITANIC theme that plays over and over again, and the Buscemi character of ESCAPE from LA, which is at the ear when watching this movie. The sequels are not nearly as bad. If you need to rent a Troma movie, get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. I'd rather look back at Tony Little's info tag when I see the NUKEM HIGH CLASS again. Don't do it wrong, some criminal geniuses were terrible to make a movie, and if the film ever had awards awfully, that's the case.
