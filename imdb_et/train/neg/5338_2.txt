Elvis Presley plays a "semi-breed" Native American ("Indian"), who must protect his reservation from nasty business. Everyone likes to drink, fight and make children. Fighting, wrestling, and "pulling out" replace the stereotyped manual "How"? Although she has a make-up, it is obvious that Elvis is healthier than she used to see in the movies; maybe he was ready for his famous "comeback". It couldn't be because the script of this movie was something that was excited about it. Joan Blondell, who is trying to attract Elvis, and Burgess Meredith in "war colors" should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> The best song is "Stay Away" (actually "Green Sleeves" with different words). The most embarrassing song is Elvis's love song "Dominic". There are some surreal scenes, but it doesn't become a genre; "Hold it, Joe" can make some laugh when you're in the right "mood". <br /> <br /> Otherwise, stay away. <br /> <br /> ** Stay away, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
