If there is one thing you may think Disney is doing, their unpleasant ability to take the story and say it again and again. Even looking at Lady and Tramp II was a terrible experience. Disney will destroy one of his most fantastic classics. It was even this spaghetti meatballs scene. It's been done before! And that's what I'm saying to this excuse directly to the video (the whole concept should be banned). Everything is just the rehash of the original film and even of some of Blut's really bad films. Penguin and walrus duo (I've even forgotten my names) are just a very poor carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is the second Ursula. He even repeats almost all of his old features. The songs are pathetic, really sad. I've never heard these songs so badly before. Dialogue is cruel. It is pathetic and simplified. On the plus side they took at least some time to make the animation somewhat decent. All common characters are not as annoying as before (or maybe it's a little mermaid for fans). Back to the negative, Melody is just so painfully cute that you just vomit. I almost did. Do it for yourself and your Mermaid fan. Don't waste your money on it. True, it's not as terrible as the return of Jafari or Pocahontase II, but it's a little consolation.
