"It's as hard as to describe how as exciting it is as a relationship like drama, like all similar pornographic scenes that have been thrown like a good action, and like an opposing-opposing and putting us more like money and similar things." - Ellen , missing quotation. <br /> <br /> "Kissing like, like, mouth and things" is like the best as an artistic endeavor like never before. Looking like Ellen's furry hand and like Chris masturbating, it was the height of my years of movie watching experience and things. But before I like to break the US-20-something-air-headed record with my "like", just let me briefly list it like this visual party: <br /> <br /> 1. Chris genital deed. And not only: how did the camera (so elegantly managed by Ellen and Patrick) reward the viewer in the full screen of Chris's greasy white trash after he finished the Catholic act - it was really exciting. I can honestly say I have never seen such grace. Chris, you should make more of these scenes in your next movies, because that is what we need to continue with this brilliant, brilliant man, Lars von Trier and his "idiots 95". Fast w *** and then hairy, greasy, white belly: what else can any filmmaker ask? Needless to say, I can sit all day and watch Chris's ejaculation (despite being straight) ... Such poetry at first. Such elegance, this style. At least in total, divine inspiration went into filming this sequence - plus a definite amount of Zen philosophy. Even Barbra Streisand didn't get it any more mentally. <br /> <br /> 2. Ellen's hairy, thick hand. The close-ups of the Wobbly camera, so skilfully photographed by the director of our two photographers (I cannot emphasize it enough), Ellen and Patrick, often confused the correct identification of this sex. There were several scenes when we saw a part of the body (leg, hand or foot), but it was often a game: does this body part belong to a man or a woman? Of course, Chris and his co-artists Ellen, Patrick and whatsername complain that their bodies were ideal for generating gender confusion. Sometimes it was hard to guess whether she saw a woman or a man. Patrick is so thin and feminine in her movements, hairy and pristine, while Ellen and the other girl are so plump, their thick legs and hands. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> 3. Brilliant - especially one that is closely related to the theme of gender reassignment: so completely original and peace of mind. Ellen acts like a man, wants sex all the time, while her ex-Patrick wants to talk - like a girl. Diffusion. <br /> <br /> 4. Ellen was looking for a left-wing companion. "He must love the" Simpsons ", which are quite left." I am pleased that the makers of this film have decided to break the long tradition of offering us intelligent left-wingers. Ellen is such a refreshing and realistic change. "Like" that he and his liberal friends can express in less than 80 minutes is truly phenomenal (3,849, exact). They have managed to realistically transfer their real failure with minimal effort to the big screen and I commend them for that. <br /> <br /> 5. Shooting close-ups. A lot of things here for the foot-fetishists, which I think is a very liberal and highly commendable way of addressing sexual minorities. After all, shoemakers and suits are offered so little in today's cinema, so it's nice to see someone caring there. <br /> <br /> KOTM, or rather KLOTLMAS, offers more than an eye. It's not just a modest little movie about movies dealing with hollow relationships when they think of meaningless conversations. No, it's a lot more. It is the light that directs all the stupid creatures; the leading light that dominates the meaningless lives of the various pseudo-artistic wannabs who are out of school and is going to attack our senses in a mysterious way, hopefully playing well at other festivals such as Sundance and Cannes, allowing them to get the necessary exposure for the changes they hire later Sean Penn and George Clooney for promoting the salvation of this planet and solving all the political problems of this world. What better way to do this than pornos at first? <br /> <br /> When Chris and Ellen did the camera here, as clearly indicated in the final credit, who kept the camera when two of them were in front of it? Obviously they hired some passers-by and pulled the camera into their hands ... <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and check out my "TV & Cinema: 150 Worst Case" list for Nepotism.
