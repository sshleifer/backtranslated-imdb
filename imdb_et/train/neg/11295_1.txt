I understand that this film has been made for children and as a parent I have sat through many films that are not of particular interest, but I can constructively understand how my children accept it. Parents should ultimately encourage their children to engage in activities and watch the quality of entertainment they watch, so there should be something that wants some level of adult audience even in children's movies. Disney has always understood this, making it so difficult to understand how it would allow such a full print to be named. <br /> <br /> Technically, audio editing is terrible, and all dialogs sound dubbed and unnatural. Personally, I hate it, but it was twice as terrible as the dialogue itself seemed to have been written for a 12-year school project. "Actress" reminded me of a school game and no child actor had any choice of emotion in their voice. Fortunately, this was a very short film. <br /> <br /> Now, before I play a video game with an adult yard on a child's movie, one thing that can save even the worst children's film is a positive message. For me, it is far from necessary to decide how the message should be delivered when it is right. We will walk this film to see what messages are being delivered: <br /> <br /> If you are gone, don't worry, you will inevitably find your home. <br /> <br /> Approaching wild animals without fear. <br /> <br /> You can win any race just because you know you can. <br /> <br /> and my favorite, last-left message: <br /> <br /> It's okay to hear the authors' figures and do what you think is right.
