Okay, I've always been a Batman fan. I loved the animated series and even Batman Beyond. I even read Batman's comic now and then. So, as you can imagine, I was a little excited about this series and then I was disappointed with SEVERELY. This series is nothing. It won't even compare to the original series. It's like one long-term TOY. No depth. And what the fuck was with Joker? Who in my most humble opinion is ALL the best Batman villain of Time and they killed him. I would like to say that his design was the worst part. In fact, I would like to say that there was something creative or interesting about this series. In short (because I believe I can say so much more), I don't waste my time on this exhibition or money.
