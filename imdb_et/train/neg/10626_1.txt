this documentary is based on a sponge cake as soon as you provide real proof that the integrity is slowly dropping into a large pile, for example, Bart Sibrel claims to have multiple light sources as the shadows appear to be intersecting if it is when Apollo 11 has passed In the Allan Radiation Band, there would be no two or more shadows for each object, which they spent 30 minutes, not the 90 minutes required in the documentary, and they received a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the faster. x ray. <br /> <br /> Seriously, some of the studies are learning what really happened, not letting this documentary pile your opinion on what really happened
