Not that I was really surprised .... movies are never as good as the books they come from. I was waiting for this movie because it is one of my favorite books, although I knew it would probably suck. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. But they missed the book too much and the movie version didn't tell how terrible it really was. The end was also different. Lara Flynn Boyle looked terribly because of some very bad cosmetic surgery. Action was at best unnoticeable. Perhaps when the theater version was made, so they wouldn't need as much Lifetime's "made for TV movie" box, it would be better to flick. When you saw this movie, I encourage you to read and read the book. I doubt you are disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as I read it every time.
