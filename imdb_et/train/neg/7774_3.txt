After a good half hour I remember thinking, "Hey, this may be Bill Rebane's best achievement ever!". Opening sequences are atmospheric, there are some frightening moments right now, and our director even refers to his notorious stinker "The Giant Spider Invasion" in a playful way. The concept is stolen by William Castle's "House on Haunted Hill", which has three old and extremely boring millionaires, who lure nine losers into an isolated mansion to win $ 1,000,000 in a losing game. Of course, the participants will disappear quickly and one by one and the rest of the greedy boneheads will take too much time to understand whether the old people are sadists ... or there is another murderer among them. The film begins and ends with an odd narrator who speaks a lot of meaningless things that are not important or even interesting to the plot, but there are some nice R&D to admire in the first ten minutes and this stupid bimbo (Shelly, I believe he is invited) is Really fun to follow. After the first half of the year, a naturally unavoidable incident happens, and "Cold" becomes a textbook of Fox production, slowing down the plot, the more timeless dialogues and the lack of full excitement. There was no budget for the bloody murder sequences, but our versatile director (?) Tries to compensate for this with endless videos of disco dance girls and amateur rock band. The film also has four or even five different peaks and none of them is a bit satisfactory. Maybe it was LOTR's inspiration: a king's return? Avoid this movie, you live longer and happier.
