Have not been watching the children's films for a few years, so I stayed "here come tigers" when he first came out. (Never saw "Bad News Bears" even when I worked in the 1970s for financing "Warriors", "Man Who would Be King" and "Rocky Horror Picture Show".) Now I would like to watch old or small movies and to find people who have gone to great careers, even though they are early in the movies. In just a few minutes, I could no longer take the movie and jumped to the final credit to see if there was a young actor in this film who had gone on to bigger and better things - at least looking at his appearance would be interesting if the plot and the action didn't work. Look and see, I looked at Wes Craven's name credit as an electric cable. He had already made two or three of his early shockers, but has not yet created Freddie Krueger or made "Scream" films. Maybe he owed a favor and helped in this picture. Surprisingly, Fred J. Lincoln cast a credit for "Aesop", a movie's funny sign. F.J. Lincoln, from the 70s to a few years ago, appeared and produced adult films. He was involved in adult fraud "The Ozporns" and it is the title that is more fun than all "tigers" attempts to combine with humor. The fact that an adult actor was placed in a children's film shows how people who do this film have to sleep on the wheel.
