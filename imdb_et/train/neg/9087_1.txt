Canadians are too polite, but the audience at the Toronto Film Festival left the theater to rate this movie 0 or 1 on their ballot papers. The premise is that a contemporary filmmaker interprets the 17th century fable of the love of shepherds and shepherds placed in a distant past when Druids were spiritual leaders. Working with three epochs offers many opportunities to introduce anachronisms, including silly and impractical clothing, and a peculiar spiritual ritual that really involves bad poetry. Lovers share jealousy and rigid adherence to idiotic codes of conduct that produce cross-products and various fartic situations. The film could have been fun like a piece of Monty Python, which he remembers too closely, but Rohmer's effort is very flat. The audience laughed at the jokes of sight, but otherwise the slow pace was astonished. The end comes all in a hurry and is really terrible. It's a trivial movie and your movie's time.
