Leave it to the genius, as Spanish director director Ventura Pons, to persuade the highest companies in their country to support the film's misleading attempt. The sad state of the film industry in this country is a product that tries to make a film of such thin materials. Most of the pictures taken in Spain fall into two categories: those related to the Spanish Civil War, which love to present the history of the past, if the writers consider it appropriate. Other types of movies show the viewer a lot of free sex because "creators" have nothing to say. <br /> <br /> When the movie opens, we can look at the Family Penis when it tries to cut it off and place it in one batch. Later, Sandra shows that she has been given to the audience to admire. The story of Family Attraction in Sandra, married to a woman who seems to be happily married, is wrong from the start. <br /> <br /> Our only interest in seeing a film that has been made in the past is better picture of Mr.. Pons, "Amic / Amat", but unfortunately this is not the kind of confusion we are punishing in this venture. As far as the comments in IMDb are concerned, all the negative voices come from Spanish viewers who talk about the quantities coming from them!
