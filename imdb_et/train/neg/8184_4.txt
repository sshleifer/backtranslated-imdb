It's almost like two movies - one literate and interesting, another stupid and clich√©. It's really a shame that not all the problems were written in writing, but considering how fast most B-movies were written and produced, it's not too unusual. This is a real shame because it could have been a very good movie. <br /> <br /> First, good. The film is original and includes World War II. It is quite exciting and I liked that the leading man (Lee Bowman) passes his pace as a code breaker. In fact, the first two thirds of the film were very good. But now, for the bad, the film just went too long and lost steam for about 50 minutes. In addition, the role of Jean Rogers as a "kooky girlfriend" must be one of the worst and disturbing roles in film history! For every smart move that Bowman did, the idiot Rogers then stepped in to screw things into some sort of "comedy". If his role had been intelligently written, the overall film would be enormously improved! Instead of looking at him, it's hard to see how we actually won World War II!
