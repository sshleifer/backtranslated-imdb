Frankly speaking, my expectations for Little Bush were small. I had been waiting for a small comic book with lots of fun (but rude and overdone) Bush jokes. Apparently, I should have reduced my expectations even further. <br /> <br /> Writing was totally pathetic. In addition to Cheney-Chicken-Eating jokes and some giggly-little swipes, it was really boring and dishonest. <br /> <br /> Animation was about as complex as the Thirteen Flash project. It's a shame that they used a Macromedia product because it can do so much more. <br /> <br /> I don't like Bush so much, and I enjoy Bush's joke as much as the next man, but it was only half an hour for the President to have a few painful times. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did a lot with their Bush. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, leave "Lil 'Bush" and go buy a copy of the short comedy "It's My Bush." You thank me.
