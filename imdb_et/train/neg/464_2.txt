This movie is not funny anyway, it tries to be funny because it is a flat humor that is so dry and boring that the film is just 2 hours of torture. Throughout the film, I was thinking of one thing "when it ends". One thing you have to hand over to them is that they have very little funny moments, so I gave him 2 stars too. It is original and uses almost every old blonde joke, even those that were not funny for the first time. Basically, this is a film that reduces blondes and saves the whole blonde's joke on the repertoire. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is a blonde humor lost bad, not worth paying money to see, it's just so bad.
