... And I've never thought about getting a movie wrong 1! But this is the fairest worst film I've ever seen. My wife chose it because of casting, but the story, because the DVD box seemed pretty predictable. It is neither a mystery nor a capture of minors. It does not contain any sensuality if it is what the title might suggest to you somewhat far away. It's just a total-no. Do not waste your time or money if you do not feel that you are watching a lot of young people in an adult Gothic environment where the killer goes after them. Nothing new, interesting, worth seeing. Max Makowski makes Nick Stahl worst.
