This film was unpleasant, inconsistent and lively. It was also an extremely spiritual wisdom of women. I rented it because it was listed as a comedy (it's stretching) and because the cover said Andie McDowell was acting on this storm. He wasn't. I'm gal, I watched this movie with two men and spent one hour later shouting how bad it was. <br /> <br /> WARNING! RAMPANT SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a pretty hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes with a younger man that serious condemnation of her two jealous single girlfriends. They want her to marry an eternal age who is in love with her. But she is so pleased with her over-puppy that you are getting caught up in it, and she definitely decides to marry. But his harpy girlfriend, assisted by a fellow, sets the plot to beat our heroine, thinking that the boy is deceiving him. It works. He has a fight with him, he runs through the house and is broken by a truck (remember the title of the movie?) So now he's dead, two-thirds of the way through the movie. And while our heroine is a school principal who spends her time watching girls, she forgot to get pregnant and get pregnant. <br /> <br /> He has already interrupted his girlfriends because they were so unsupported. Alone and pathetic, he decides to get married forever. Did I mention that the bored man who loves him is a minister? He had asked him to marry a young man (nice? But his girlfriends rescued him on the altar and took him home where they didn't admit that they were mostly responsible for the love of his life. He has a baby. In the last scene, they leave their crib in their house if they they leave the porch, smoke and smoke, I'm not doing you, it's so bad I missed part of the ridiculous lesbian of the red herring and the harp.
