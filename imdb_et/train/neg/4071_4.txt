A young man kills a young woman for no reason. The man's brother has been imprisoned on charges that he was a accomplice but soon flees. After escaping, the seemingly innocent man robs the three victims and soon he will bind his girlfriend to the plot. If it is not bad enough, the situation will quickly change downwards. <br /> <br /> This film had some good aspects and many bad things. Its strongest aspect was actress actor Emily Haack. Leaving aside the fair amount of this film, he presents himself as a decent actor and a very strong character. I see no reason why he cannot accept this experience and somehow make it a career. I was convinced that he was a merciless person. <br /> <br /> The makers of this movie were also very daring and did not pull the strokes. Graphic nudity (both male and female), copropagia, and extreme anal violence are not removed. I like my horror movies to push the boundaries a bit, and it ignored them completely, rejoicing with joy at Gomorrah. Maybe it was too much, but I think they did what they were looking for. <br /> <br /> Now the negative aspects. First and foremost, this movie has a very low budget and the quality of the movie shows it. I can apologize that - the plot was decent, fine, and in some scenes, the lower quality film actually made the film more disturbing (a more realistic feeling). So, I do not pamper them with low quality equipment. What I am afraid of is the use of bad choices in frames. For no reason can I know (in addition to the explosion of the film) there are many cemeteries. I don't really know why, and I honestly said it was in that place, because it was so long and pointless. <br /> <br /> I am also against the title. The idea here was to deceive people to think that this film has any connection to the classic "I Spit on Your Grave". Now there is a line that seems to mean that the main character is the daughter of the woman in this movie. And the topics are very loosely the same (a woman with a woman's revenge). But there is no definite link and the reason why this title was chosen was that the video store customer thought they would follow. It was deceptive and dishonest. <br /> <br /> My last big complaint is that this plot is not real. Not even a little. The woman is first killed without reason. The prison refugee finds time to rob people without reason (because they blamed their girlfriend?). The same man goes from good to very evil without explanation. Likewise, a female leader (Haack) becomes a normal human to a person who is too cruel and sadistic, for no reason at all, and against people who, for the most part, meant only a little to her (for women who offer drugs for sex), but in no way deserves torture). <br /> <br /> Don't let this title fool or claim that the movie is incredibly shocking. Yes, some scenes were shocking, but the overwhelming majority of the movie is boring and makes you miss. If you see it in a video store or Netflix, continue browsing. Or rent it, and we can sit for hours and vent around. You have been warned.
