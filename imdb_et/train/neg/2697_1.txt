Based on the personal experience of Director John Singleton at the University of Southern California, higher education comes. A film that focuses on racial politics in today's colleges. <br /> <br /> There are three main characters based on their story: Malik Williams, a carefree low-skilled athlete who is an African American man. Kristin Conner, hidden soft white girl and Remy, complicated, white males. All three have been overcome by the unexpected reality that college life is not as good as it is advertised, because all three are disappointed by being ready (Malik), being naive (Kristin) and unwanted (Remy). <Br / One good thing about the film is that it shows that modern American colleges are just big in high schools. Colleges are not places to build character, develop potential, or enhance personal development, but they are institutions that collect all kinds of students with the same atmosphere. This is an experience that is usually built for the failure of most students. It would have been good if the film would build this story from this travesty as a racial policy. <br /> <br /> But it wasn't and the movies are breaking down. It turned out that Singleton had a bad experience in southern California. With this movie, he shoots all the souls. There is no need to shrink here. Singleton allows heroes and heroes of this piece to be easily seen. <br /> <br /> The black characters of the movie are considered to be quite a lot of heroes, while all the whites of the movie are considered to be bad guys. For Kristini, raped by a white student. <br /> <br /> Who understands the contradictions of this movie? Black gang members who come to help a white girl when she leads those who allegedly raped her? Simple, what do black gang members have in the university, while a lot of skin heads meet in a dark dormitory that plans violence? <br /> <br /> The performances of Omar Epps (Malik) and Kristy Swanson (Kristin) are disappointing. They seem to be the third choice for the roles they played in this movie (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore had to play Maliki and Kristin but were not available). O'Shea Jackson, or Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes, and Regina King, were all irritating in their roles. And Laurence Fishburne failed here as a professor of history. Only Michael Rappaport did it well in the film, and he thought that his character, the three main characters, had changed most in the film. <br /> <br /> John Singleton wanted to take the American college life with this film on the issue of race and inequality. And he did it very badly. It was kind of like flying with a shotgun. Life is much more complicated than it seems, and people are all alike and should know it. Higher education is proof that it did not understand it at all. Seeing the film, then and now, would interfere, deceive and torture the same public with whom he would like to speak. Not to mention that it does not reflect them at all.
