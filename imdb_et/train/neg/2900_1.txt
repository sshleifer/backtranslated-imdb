I have a 5-minute rule (sometimes I leave a 10-year path). If the movie isn't good in the first 5 or 10 minutes, it's probably never going to be better. I have not yet experienced a movie that has challenged this theory. Dan Real Real is definitely no exception. I looked at this turkey and thought; wow, it's not funny, doesn't touch, isn't sad, and I don't like any characters at all. <br /> <br /> A story about a counselor from a colleague / widow who raises three young daughters who fall in love with their brother's girlfriend. I think the label would be a "consultant columnist who could use the advice"? I do not know. The character of Dans did not hit me in any way with the qualifying person. I think it's irony? I do not know. She sees her parents, brothers, sisters, and their children looking at some kind of family life that looks very sweet, and potential feed for good comedies, a story ... no one that will ever appear. The central story is basically how he loves this woman but doesn't get him. Anyone with an impulse understands that eventually he will get it, but you will have to suffer through a painfully unsuccessful, tiny, lifelong movie network "love murderer" to reach the inevitable happy ending. <br /> <br /> is really one of the worst films I've ever seen.
