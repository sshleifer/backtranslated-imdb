This is one of the worst things I've ever seen. I love Almereyda Nadja, but it's just absolute. In addition to some interesting cinema and music for a moment, this film is just an insecure bad example and stupid material. Jared Harris is particularly bad, but no one is far from good. The plot is a joke, but not a haha. I don't even know if you can forgive movies that are bad. Please delete the last hour and a half of your life. How did this director Nadja and another girl make another planet?
