I don't see anyone who even likes Van Damne could like this movie. <br /> <br /> The film really starts with some promise. I'd say the scenes at the beginning of the movie are great. Family partner events scenes that try to save twins are a great start and this is the main story. But the movie is down there. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice if the director could have remained with the original assumption. This means that the brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills. One brother should be a martial arts skill, but another brother should be a skill in firearms. How convenient is the time when a brother who has never caught a gun before a sudden is a big sword, and a brother who has not been taught is all suddenly cracked and high-hit. br /> <br /> Plot, action, etc. are just ridiculous. My favorite scenes? How about when Van Damne is facing an AK-47 armed soldier. The soldier is about 100 meters away. Instead of catching and shooting Van Damne, he makes war crying as he uses the ax of battle and runs with him. Van Damne continues to pick up a fallen soldier gun and shoot him ... if he's still about 75 to 80 meters away. <br /> <br /> This movie is one disappointing end. Bolo Yeung is a skilled martial artist. But a good fight instead of choreography. Bolo throws barrels at Van Damne like Donkey Kong. Absolutely aggravating film with so many promises. If you're a fan of Van Damne, save time and watch Hard Target or one of his earlier films.
