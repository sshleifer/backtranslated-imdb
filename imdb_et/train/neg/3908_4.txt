There is enough power to create another galaxy, but the final product is quite controversial. The film and its messages are very noble, and I think they would agree with them the most. (Liberal good democracy, violent fascist regime is bad; open spirit, good racism, etc.). Unfortunately, we've been gripping them with their toes and have been described as much as I described them. Ultimately, we are left to look at very noble people without any drawbacks that would contradict the harshest who have no redemptive qualities. It radiates all the badly organized "pro" wrestling games. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays a patron, a man with many contradictions. Meryl Streep as her talented bride and Glenn Close as her sister in law. When the camera is with these people, the film tends to move and is quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, HOUSE is just working with too many sub-blocks, and characters appear and appear in the image as goals in the photo gallery. We don't know them, so we can't take care of them. The result is boredom. <br /> <br /> When Bille August, director and screenwriter (from Isabel Allende's book) has extended the film, or some characters have been hit, this film would have worked perfectly. In its present form, it was a nice test, with a nice message and a bit of grinding. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
