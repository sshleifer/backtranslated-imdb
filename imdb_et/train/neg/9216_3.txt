Hoo boy, this was a real trial. The DVD box has a Tom Hanks mug plastered on it and this is the only reason anyone could buy it. He looks at the box for about forty, but the movie was made in 1982, so he still has his own Bosom friends' way and of course it is about forty pounds lighter. The plot is about Dungeons and Dragons as a game played by Hanks and his three friends and Hanks thinks the whole thing is real. Chris Makepeace is the boy's giant named Jay Jay and the best thing about the movie is that he's wearing a series of funny hats. Oh, look, he has a yellow hard tuxedo! Now she's dressed like a WWI pilot! It was a really terrible movie, but badly. A large number of veterinarians usually appear as parents of children. There's Anne (I'm Honey West, fuck!) Francis and Louise Sorel, who really looks hot. Murray Hamilton, Mayor of Jaws, is ungrateful to the police. Wendy Crewson, is a love interest for Hanks and some blonde man I've never seen or ever since. Here and there are syrup music and no tension or danger or excitement. There is a monster that only Hanks can see because he is, you know, nuts. The monster is playing late, the great Kevin Peter Hall, his Predator's fame. My friend got out of MallWart from the Olympic player and suggested that I trash it without it, so of course I had to see if it was as bad as everything. It was. Last night I watched Apollo 13, so after that this film was a little shock. Do yourself a favor and leave it in the trash. Oh, yes, after Hanks jumped from almost one of the World Trade Center towers because of his displeasure, he goes home to recover and visit his friends. Hanks's mother, drunk at Vera Miles, says she's coming in nicely, but when they go out on the lake, she's mader than ever before. End
