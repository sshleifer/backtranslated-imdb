Must agree with another reviewer. It must be a WORST movie, not to mention the West I've ever seen. A terrible act, a dialogue that was unimaginable and pathetic (not to mention a completely unsuitable supposedly in the 1800s), and oh, did I mention a battery that was visibly visible behind one character? I was waiting for the boom mike to fall into the middle of the scene. And the end? The least I can say is that it was in line with the rest of the movie ... totally terrible. And yes, it contained all the clicks of the book from a slow walk along the empty dust road to a ridiculous "remember when" shot stops at the death of the main game. Fortunately, I saw it free on TV. Don't waste your time.
