With 2 days of Valley I think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Just one long line of Tarantino robberies that arose after Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere created by the film is amusing in the first five minutes, but then the filmmakers make an unacceptable mistake by allowing unnecessary and grotesque violence to "hip". You better skip it.
