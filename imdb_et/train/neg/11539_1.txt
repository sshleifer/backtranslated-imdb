It's the biggest crust I've seen for a long time. The last time I hated so much movie was "28 days later" and "Magnolia". Except for some really sick and twisted sex / rape scenes, this film has absolutely no sense, Gillian Anderson frees himself on the road and the sentence of every dialogue that must use the F word at least a few times. It's very cheap and it's a very low budget. My friend and I finished the movie in about half an hour. We were trying to give him a chance, but nothing saves that crudi. DON'T SEE IT!
