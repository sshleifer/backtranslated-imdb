Tromaville High has become an immoral unclean result of the accidental release of toxic waste from a nearby nuclear power plant. <br /> <br /> Unlimited chaos filled with absurd violence and raw behavior. Rather terrible, apparently intent on the film's confusion with filmmakers who cut off the needles that allow the undesirable cast government to worship. Craft was far from the list of Troma goals for this gory sleazefest. The society of honor is trousers with scary facial color and funny equipment. A German teacher who becomes a member of a "poisonous kiss" has stripes on one side of his face that really made me slip. The poisonous monster, who sent ANNOYING ticks to the end, is pretty cool. br /> <br /> The movie trash bins have all the heart.
