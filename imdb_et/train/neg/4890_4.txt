The movie Vixen (Erica Gavin), who has Mountie's wife whom she loves ... but she also loves sex! During the film he gets several men in bed - including his wife AND brother! There is also a queue for lesbians. <br /> <br /> This movie put Russ Meyer on the map and was (I believe) the first critically acclaimed X movie. It was a big hit when he came out. Unfortunately, this is not quite right. <br /> <br /> It is well targeted and Erica Gavin is just great (what happened to her) and it was very colorful ... but according to today's standards, it is very good. I'm surprised that now it's the NC-17 rating - there is no hardcore sex and it only has topless women and not men at all. It is also (unfortunately) quite boring, and adding politics at the end was confusing (and pretty stupid). It is worth trying to see what was considered very shocking in 1968. I argue that I saw a cut version (which has an R rating), but I'm here and there for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Meyer's next movie "The Valley of Dolls" is much better and very good. Instead, catch it.
