I think I get a lot of flack to hate this movie. I didn't approach it before with my generation's nervous nostalgia. But it's enough to say - St Elmo's fire was pretty dirty, even when the Brat Pack movies go. <br /> <br /> Here is another beautiful example of a secret, self-conscious neurosis that is all 80s (RENT, anyone?) The plot is almost non-existent and philosophies are the best, but the rest of the time is poorly executed. The total absence of sympathetic things does not help the situation. There was really no growth, no progress at all. Even the climatic suicide scene was effectively castrated again, refusing to die again or to reality or to death that resembles adult life. <br /> <br /> Each cookie cutter can easily see that you hate them in the best, most predictable way possible. Stalker is a slip, which is not a visible reason when it is Stalker and Andie MacDowell is proud. Jackass makes every effort to remind you constantly. A gorgeous bitch hides a truly spiritual, deep pain with a natural lifestyle. The poet's mood and mops are about 3/4 of the movie, until he can reveal (!) That he's actually full of playwrights and sunshine and umbrella. Finally, Virgo will eventually become a healthy, happy person after every Virgin's will with Jackass has one bag behind a hot roll before she pulls her into a real change (this time real). Cheating Bastard cheats until it's time to catch him. And finally, Feminist goes around the holy water with any soul that says "commitment." <br /> <br /> What brings me to my ultimate beef - what kind of super cement is holding these people together with friends? I can't imagine it's just one of them. Now think of everything created with one fool, which is concentrated in one bar. And they were so terrifying to each other in the toilets, near rape and sleeping with unirryon. The cherry was after two BFFs like the feminists, as he is, as he is, like "the umm, actually I don't want to be with someone else." Let's be friends! day, knowing that I can connect one or the other at any time, but neither of you fulfills enough commitment (NO WORD!). "And they all smiled like saying," Golly gee, I've never thought about it! What a great idea! "<br /> <br /> This is not the only thing.
