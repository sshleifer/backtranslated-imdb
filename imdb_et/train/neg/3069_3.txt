Yuck! And again I say ... YUCK! The original version of this film was a well-managed story about a man who had already died and was out of the purgatory. The original film had a lot to say and didn't say. And it was a naked chick on a motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This version strikes me with something that the manufacturer bought the rights and then gave up the interest. It seems that a group of individuals has deliberately decided to fit into it for the nineties and made the nations and sex just cute. The film does not say that the last behavior is suicide. It's about a man trying to go to the hospital to see a woman. <br /> <br /> There is no reason why this movie would be made more than angry with me ...
