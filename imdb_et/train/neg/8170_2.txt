A friend and myself went through a stage that was a few (many) years ago, choosing fiction films from a video store for evening entertainment. For some reason I bought this purchase (probably v. Cheap). <br /> <br /> The cheap synths are classic of their time and genre. There are also some very fun scenes. Among them is a scene where a man attacks and protects himself with a number of unlikely objects, it made me laugh at this time (it doesn't look backwards, but there's pretty funny there). <br /> <br /> It is also a complete mess. But it is probably worth checking out if you like movies like "Chopping Mall". Yes, I've seen it.
