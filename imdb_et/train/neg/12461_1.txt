Unlike most other comments about "Syriana" on the IMDb website, I and my family found the movie on the DVD at home completely full of time and space. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a movie based on a script that the writer is far from smart. Instead of trying out a complicated story intelligently and clearly, it was assumed that the constant throwing is mostly vague and difficult to connect with each other for 30 seconds of different lines of vignettes from ten "story" audiences made a great and clear view. No, sir, it's not. What makes it great is complete clarity, precision, plots and story - and characterization - which is at the beginning, middle and end. <br /> <br /> This cinema presentation - similar to Dim Sum's experience in the Chinese restaurant - is in the extreme sense intent and careless. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the good, Hollywood and British movie poets in the 1940s and 1950s, whose writers, director and actors knew a clear story, dictation and value for action, which meant something. <br /> <br /> This is one DVD that this family doesn't sit back on.
