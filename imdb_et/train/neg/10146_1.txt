"Fury's Flight" is shockingly awful, but the worst of all the boring Action Films - I don't expect much from Seagal, everything I'm expecting is somewhat entertaining in 90 or more minutes with somewhat meaningless action - unfortunately it doesn't even get that low expectation. Action scenes are scarce and far away, the plot (which is totally irrelevant in these films) is unnecessarily complicated and confused with the holes in the huge plot all over, the actor is really exhausting - bordering with the embarrassing Seagal and his whispering One expression that is best in terms of the 3rd reviewers - I find it hard to believe that something that is almost $ 12 million was spent on this terrible confusion when that $ 11 was not Seagale's salary - I doubt it! One moment, when Straight guys or gay girls are interested, is that the seemingly two hot chicks come to the lesbian sex scene where there are big gaps that aren't like that - a mediocre stuff that doesn't differ from many Michael Dudikoff B-Movies, which I've suffered <br /> <br /> 1/10
