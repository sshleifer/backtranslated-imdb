This movie proves that you can't judge a movie with awesome works on a DVD disc. It also shows that you should learn more about the movie (or get it at Christmas time) before you buy it. The beginning of this film seems to be somewhat promising. Well, until you match the characters. The Pumpkin Jack (old man from the street) brings to the college a book full of the witch's spell she leaves in her annual haunt house (where the film takes place). After that there are some drinking, fighting and soft core porn. Then the action of the film finally takes over an hour. <br /> <br /> In general, Hallow's End was predictable, insecure, and reminiscent of soft core porn. This movie is probably best viewed by group friends who have nothing better to do because it is a good movie. And for the first time, it is really fun for the viewers to make predictions about the order of death of people.
