Frank Sinatra was far from an ideal Western actor. He was a great actor, from here to the eternity, and the man with the golden hand is proof of this, but he had no body of the Western hero, you identified him as mayor. But he tried to do his job well at Johnny Conchos so that the fact that the film was not in the post office was not his fault. I blame it on two factors: a) The story was too unusual, especially that Sinatra behaved more than a villain than a hero in the whole movie. In a genre where people expect a particular pattern, this movie has to be very good. b) The story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that the whole city will allow Sinatra to do what he wants, but that they are afraid of his brother. Even when a man shows him a special bag that opens sideways, so that he should not pull the weapon, you wonder that if it makes him invincible, why haven't all the armed forces accepted it? I think this movie shouldn't have been taken back because every Sinatra movie is worth it, and despite its shortcomings it's still enjoyable
