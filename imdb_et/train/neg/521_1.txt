Wow! This movie is really terrible. I can't imagine how someone should have read this poorly written script and give it a green light. The second grade is evenly cast, with some really amazing productions of almost all the pains. The story is divided, fragmented, and inconsistent. Speaking, leading and predictable. No spirit, no magic, no humor. Not the least sexy. The characters remain the same as the proverb. There is also a strong misogynous flow that became increasingly difficult on the stomach as the film continued. If your driver (Carrell) is ununny and unappealing it is uphill from there. Despite being a fake tour that ends where love triumphs over desire, I missed the stomach feeling. If it goes to humor and social commentary, we are certainly condemned.
