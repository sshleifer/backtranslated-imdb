Oh, where to start. Cinematography was great. When the movie first started due to landscape scenes, I thought I had a good movie. Then appeared Cgi Bigfoot .It looked like a cartoon drawing of a lion king and king of Kong's love of the child.It completely took away the faith of credibility. obvious reason but cheesy cgi cartoon.So since then the whole movie was shot for me. The money they rinse the toilet cgi they could spend on the costume as Roger Patterson did. She was the best Bigfoot costume that no one else could match her. I'm a fan of the hardcore cheesy Bigfoot movie, and I was warned about this movie, but my compulsion is to watch this movie and I was disappointed, as previous reviews warned me. I know that after reading this review, you still say, "I have to look at Sasquatch hunters, look at the Sasquatch hunters." Then you tell me why I lost my money earned on such an agonizingly bad dull movie!
