the only thing that often collides with my head when i write this review then i can't get it and an hour and a half ago! to show that I am not just blowing air, I compare the film with other trilogy films of the cube (cube and hypercube)! The cube wasn't big but it was original and made some technical mistakes! as a sequel lost the advantage of originality, but it came out looking quite sharp and I even liked it as a cube (the story was better)! but the cube zero compared to its predecessors is not really worth sh * t! the lack of a full good fxi, a very f * ck * d up script and just plain old bad behavior doesn't fit well! For example: During the whole movie I thought it would be incredibly stupid if ... should happen and then it would happen so it is not very original! my advice: don't lose that one and a half hours i lost !!!!!!!! oh and i hope this movie crashes and burns !!!!!!!
