It's hard to believe that the movie in this book will be able to complement your horror! The plot is so natural and incredible. . . starting with the accusation of a small child to save your pain! Then we have at least six and maybe more people (including clergy) who have been involved in crime everywhere. Next, we have a woman who seems to be fairly happy with the length of the ferry over the tracks. A very unpleasant and coo coo mother, assisted, supported and supported by a politically correct group of friends! Relocation from an island off the coast of South Carolina did not help the story, although it may have helped filmmakers' budgets. The very beautiful buildings surrounding the monastery did not seem logically suitable for a small island that needed a golf trolley and such a small ferry service. Kim Basinger, who I really like, is painfully thin in this film, and her hairstyle is definitely another decade. Nor is there any chemistry between him and one male cord. I didn't really like the book that it was taken from, but I read it all. The movie I was surfing back and forth had to leave whenever the saccharin music got too much. If you don't like an incredible story, a woody, plausible / mythological / allegorical mixture, then my suggestion is to leave it out. Oh, and maybe a little career criticism, but wouldn't a caring father have a toddler with a small boat life jacket? The best part of this movie is the landscape
