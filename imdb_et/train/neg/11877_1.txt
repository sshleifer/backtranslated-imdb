I think it's almost all I have to say. I feel obliged to explain my actions. I have never seen such armature production in principle, and I mean this word in all senses. Although his physical camera is working, the boom MIC operation and other technical aspects of this film are ridiculous, unfortunately this is not the only area. Unlike some of the classic independent films that have been recorded by these scripts, it is very characteristic and schematic, but unfortunately it is a terrible script, terrible and worst, terrible annoying signs. <br /> <br /> It's a crime that there are 101 other indie films that died of silent death for every independent film that gets to the Haiku tunnel. I don't know who the Kornbluth brothers know about Sony, but this may be my only explanation of how this amateur family production ever spreads. I'm quite confused about why they chose it. <br /> <br /> The only part of this movie that prevents intrigues is its title. But its cause is even abandoned. I hope this review will save some of the people who are watching this movie title. I've seen a lot of movies during my time, and I'm very much in the cinema, but it was too much. I will never forget the "tunnel" to mark an important point in cinema life. Shame it is so low.
