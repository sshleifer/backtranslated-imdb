After watching this movie, I was so upset that I had wasted my life for 2 hours. It's 2 hours, I'll never get back. Ugh. When you run it, you might think that "Wow it's really good!" You can rest assured that first impressions mean nothing. I was so excited about this movie until it is the stupid end I've ever seen. This film is simply pathetic. The act is happier, the story is nothing more than the original, and there is nothing very unique about it, except that it is WORKABLE FILM EVER !!! DO NOT ATTENTION THIS MOVEMENT !!! WARNING! DUMBEST MOVIE EVER IS SORRY IF YOU CONTINUE TO CONTINUE 2 YOU HAVE YOU! 1/10
