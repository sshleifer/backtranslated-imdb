No one goes to the movie, like The Hills Have Eyes 2, and is waiting for Citizen Kane's second coming. The same applies to the fear of most of the low rents, especially Roger Ebert's "Dead Teenager Movies". The Hills Have Eyes 2 will definitely qualify as a dead teen movie, only here is the superficial appearance of military trainees given to teenagers. <br /> <br /> Some are asking for "it's just a movie" when the questionable fact is raised in the movie review, but I'm always sure that effective fantasy must be rooted in reality. In the mountains there are eyes 2, we have to believe that the main characters are military personnel in training, but they look and speak like high school kids who camp in the desert. Dialogue is terrible and often vulgar to overcome. Though the movies are not nearly comparable, I imagined those "soldiers" who are under attack and intimidating fear. <br /> <br /> Very few characters create a soldier after a rifle and fatigue: radio transmitters are executed as teenage phone conversations; The Colonel has the address of the private address "hey, asshole". And no one seems to have the slightest idea of ​​what to do or the structure of any command when things start to go wrong. I am thinking of James Cameron's alien soldiers, a pure fantasy film, and even how these futuristic naval soldiers behaved like real soldiers despite their fantastic situations. Fantasy that is rooted in reality. <br /> <br /> I try to start watching the movie from 5 to 10 on a scale and evaluate its strengths and weaknesses. You must allow the material for the benefits; Star Wars is not as good a film as a godfather on equal terms. But both are excellent examples of their type. <br /> <br /> In this respect, although the eyes of the mountains 2 are a terrible exercise in amateur and immature writing, it is only more modest in this respect than a typical dead teenager. From a technical point of view, it seems that the film has good product values ​​and is quite well made from this point of view. Scenes designed to shock or create urgency or transience in general. So, looking at the eyes of the mountains 2 can indeed be worse than death, there are definitely much worse in fear of circulating in circulation. <br /> <br /> It's worth looking at those who enjoy this type of stuff without the usual fanboy baggage, or those who don't want to think about every movie they see is the best time or worst. If you don't get "horror", especially Dead Teenager, you probably won't have a good time with that time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
