ALIEN LOVE (Because this movie is known in the UK) is a very strange film. I don't mean that it is an esoteric art house movie in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman, I mean it's a TVM with passion, sex, some very good R&D, a bad script and a very retro feeling. You can just imagine someone, like John Hughes, who drove it ten years earlier, though of course he would have cut off R&D. <br /> <br /> Back to the bad script, one of the problems is that few characters are any motivation, especially Amanda. Why does he take up Connie at the bar? So can he meet an alien? Do you see what I mean by retro? ET, SHORT CIRCUIT and a number of other films since the mid-1980s were the kind of plots most of which were more accurate and convincing than they saw here. Style continues to follow a poorly defined, convincing and illogical way. That said, I found ALIEN LOVE traceable and not just on-screen R&D. Sci-fi sex comedy is much better than FLESH GORDON and EARTH GIRLS
