"The treasure hunt trio is looking for a hidden treasure in western India. The golden lure creates tension when men go to the treasure. The deep sea divers are hoping to get off the gold, but find that greed and hatred bring murder," according to a summary of DVD sleeves. "Fishfish" is the name of their boat, not the monster. The skeleton, who gives muscle to Captain John Bromfield (Brannigan), is the side of his good treasure card. Old Victor Victor (as a professor) gives the card to the other side. First companion Lon Chaney Jr (Swede) plays fool and sexy Tessa Prendergas (like Alita) watches rum (not very well, probably). Serious editing and continuity problems represent an image that would otherwise have been received. <br /> <br /> Manfish (2/56) W. Lee Wilder ~ John Bromfield, Victor Jory, Lon Chaney Jr.
