It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I usually praise every film for some aspects of my production, but the intense irritating behavior of more than half of the characters made me harder in any part of this movie. <br /> <br /> The most common conclusion was that the building designer was guilty of collapsing the avalanche. Er ok. <br /> <br /> Skiing also does not work in an avalanche of Slavic style. Running 10 feet on some trees doesn't work. Unfortunately, it is here. As mentioned earlier, some characters are congenital and negligible foolishness. In a closed room with four years of limited oxygen, it can be said that fire is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> Anyway, about 5 minutes of the movie will redeem itself and gain some recognition. However, if you also have some intelligence, you will also find the majority of this movie that is hard to tolerate. <br /> <br /> I have the pain of not performing so many high-quality songs, but someone is paying for such things. done. <br /> <br /> Did I mention the last five minutes? Well, to give you a hook, you have to watch out for the latest fighting avalanche technique. Absolutely invaluable.
