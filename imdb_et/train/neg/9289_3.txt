For you, who was desperate to find out what happened to Twitch in the original movie, is your chance and then return to the real world. <br /> <br /> The man who hid the gold in the first film told Twitch that he was going to another prison where wrestling masters hang to watch. Twitch plans to leave prison for a month to get gold to start with his wife's life. <br /> <br /> Then something happens and somebody can shoot and the movie turns into a prison in Die Hard. But the wrestler's daughter is all caught up in it, and she pulls herself to her and Twitch's wife. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the actor is below par. ) rap music and badly edited fighting scenes. On the plus side, it has a Spaniard who ever marks a prison / action / thriller and closes that door. <br /> <br /> It's not very eventful, but at least it's safe. <br /> <br /> If you were a fan of the original, it's fine. <br /> <br /> If not, you are warned.
