I've recently watched this movie twice and I don't understand why the h * ll makers did this bunch. Yes, yes, it gives a great impression of Hitler's environment, and I think of how they played Austria at the end of the 1890s, WWI and the war period. I do not understand why they represented Hitler as a 100% pure evil, mad, unreliable, mentally unstable freak. He was a very thoughtful, loving and intelligent person, of course, having his own blind sides, no doubt about it. But why imagine him in this way in the name of heaven? All his positive aspects have been cut off from the scenario, leaving not only a very propaganda-like portrait of a man who had the greatest impact on modern civilization. Yes, he threw a devastating World War II to Germany. Yes, he was racist, and yes, he was sometimes insecure, especially at the end of the war. Everything is true. But again; why the heck are they clear to the public LIE? Alert us? <br /> <br /> I don't think this movie was a warning. The real danger of Hitler and the Nazis was that they could reach moments of serious global weakness. The fact that this evil was so recognizable that almost everyone lives in German (not to mention the Austrians and many other people) is a warning to modern civilization, NOT that Hitler was "weird". If that had been the way the makers would believe us - I would have been convinced that the German people had slowed down. A man like the one in this movie would never have been close to the party leader, not to mention ReichsKanzler. <br /> <br /> 4/10
