I don't want to go into detail, because I can't really justify much time in reviewing this movie, but I had to give an alternative opinion, hopefully helping people avoid the movie. The animation is sharp and the story changes between boring / pointless and extremely irritating. Humor was completely lost to the audience and yes - ghost in Shell fans, it is not a sci-fi or something - it's an attempt to drag comedy and humor just didn't work after the translation. It was watching a movie and a terrible way to open a film festival, especially considering how excited I was and how open I was - I didn't expect Shell to follow Ghost, but I was expecting something fun and it just didn't get it. Yaaawwnnn ... Rent a Cinema Journey instead.
