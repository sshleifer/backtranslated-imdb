As a fan of "The Sale of Fire", "Where is Poppa", "The Airplane", I saw it because it was mentioned in the context of actual comedies and satires, as mentioned above. Well, NETWORK CONCLUSION! <br /> <br /> It's not just funny, it makes you angry because it's not bad, spooky, but really bad. This is bad. The script does not contain one funny line that is more like a road when you try to attract the audience with humor. <br /> <br /> Adam Arkin's speech problem is probably one of the most disturbing things about this movie. This kind of cruelty to nature, however, does not prevent him from seeing the whole film and it is not difficult for him to look into the camera. This amateur, who is not a charisma, fits nicely with a constant continuity error and story down the story - when you find one. <br /> <br /> Ed McMahon - I had to think about Jay Leno, another late-night chat room who always refuses to call himself an actor. Well, I've seen some Leno movies and he's Laurence Olivier compared to McMahon. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Mars is good. In the few lines he has given. I'm not scared of bad comedies, so I watched and searched for all quasi-jokes every 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> The movie actually comes in a sort of comedy as Alan Arkin takes over - he's literally: starting with a 75-minute movie, he's in every scene. But it's too little, too late. <br /> <br /> When movies try to deceive you, the lack of professionalism is why you should like them because they have the right intentions that remind me of students who aren't ready for the exam. In these cases, you must remain strict and have a grade of 'F'. (But don't think I'm a teacher. This is a profession whose respect is somewhere between a politician and a child moorest). <br /> <br /> If you are actually looking for a pleasant chocolate horror / sci-fi movie that is fun to watch and include jokes try "Man with Screaming Brain" by Bruce Campbell. Or look at Sunshine / Core if you want a modern white low SciFi Schlock. They are equally funny, albeit involuntarily.
