Yes, it could have been a good movie. Love angle, (sorry for the poetic license, but not the triangle!), Interesting story, unfortunately badly said. The image is sometimes strange, sometimes OK, the image is crowded and narrow. Sound needs more attention (usually in Romanian films), light and color filters are sometimes poorly selected. The audio track is short and does not work. About acting ... sorry, but the best actor is the homeowner. Others act vaguely and can't convince the viewer. Action is poetic if it should be realistic and realistic if it should be poetic. This is a picture of the adults that the children are talking about. The error only if it is very curious.
