I have read Ben Mezrich's novel Reaper a few years ago and last night I came to this adaptation by accident. <br /> <br /> Although you have read the story for the first time, the differences between the novel and the film are human. The very important elements that made the whole thing credible are simply written or bad. <br /> <br /> If the plot sounds interesting to you, go and get a novel. Its much, much, much better. <br /> <br /> Still out of 10, because of Ben Mezrich's large main piece, it was difficult to watch.
