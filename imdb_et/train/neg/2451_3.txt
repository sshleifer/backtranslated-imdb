This movie causes more unintentional laughter than anything else I've ever seen. Really, if you are a Tolkien fan, just rent it with your friends to laugh. I'm not a million person hanging on my mistakes ... all I say is that the movie (for me) lost the main points why my favorite character Sam turned into an idiot. Shame, shame ... 3/10
