Someone needs to explain to me why every person in any way sees every film that contains the poor, which looks like a pseudo-arm. <br /> <br /> I didn't see anything real about the characters (though the actors did their best, with bad parts) or situations. Instead, I saw a forced, self-conscious effort to be "nervous", "sharp" and "down and dirty". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it takes much more than storing a camera without a rack or for a reason and without illuminating a film to achieve any of the above features. <br /> <br /> This is a sad comment about the state of the independent film that the only films in the movie have seen in the theater today are all carbon copies with bad cinematography, a non-existent camera direction and a lot of sweating that try to convey themselves as "art". "About Schmidt" get such robbers. I found them to be nervous and very medium, but compared to the current independent clones like "Raising Victor Vargas", they are completely brilliant and inspired. meant that you would probably treat a certain amount of originality and a lot of energy and care, and maybe some technical errors caused by low budgets nowadays mean that you will probably get another side number, let's-camera-about-two hours attempt to make an independent distributor lack of taste. And, of course, all that is to serve the characters and situations that are completely unrealistic and viable. <br /> <br /> Is it surprising that there are fewer and fewer surviving companies on the independent market? Not at all when you see movies like Raising Victor Vargas who don't do anything but copy the worst movies before them.
