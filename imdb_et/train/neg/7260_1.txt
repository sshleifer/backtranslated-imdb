"Urban Hell" (aka "Called Bastard"), a British / Spanish co-production, was made in Clint Eastwood's progress in the Italian trilogy "Man With No Name". Most of these films used a template to hire recognizable American actors whose career was largely down and duplicated their voices. This movie is no exception except for the fact that they also used some British actress. <br /> <br /> The plot is hard to summarize, but here it goes. The story opens with rebels or whatever is led by Robert Shaw and Marin Landau, who attack the church and kill everyone inside, including the priest. Fast forward a few years later, when the Shaw mark is disguised as a priest. The Mayor of the City (Telly Savalas) is a brutal leader who does not think about treating him fairly with his weapon. <br /> <br /> Throw a dying widow, Alvira (Stella Stevens), who is looking for her husband's killer. Add to this the fact that he is traveling around the heart, which is dead like a coffin because God knows why. After the Mayor was murdered by his henchman La Bomba (Al Lettieri), the city is invaded by the Land's colonel (Landau) in search of rebel leaders (I am sorry but the name escapes me). The Colonel takes over the city and starts bringing the citizens together to force them to show the leader's identity. <br /> <br /> Although they opened the film side by side, it's hard to say from the dialogue that Landau and Shaw's characters know each other. The blind man (Fernando Rey) claims he can identify the rebel leader by touching his face. He does this and .............................................. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the leaders regretted this movie. It's just terrible and deserves my terrible "1" rating. Shaw spends most of the movie that fixes his brand to stare at. Even Landau can't save this movie. The beautiful Mrs Stevens has also been wasted here. Having just made Peckinpah's "Cocktail Ballad" last year, I found it strange that she would appear in this confusion of the movie. In Savala he made several such pictures ("Pancho Villa" and "Horror Express" to remember) during his Kojak-period.Michael Craig is also there somewhere as a character called "Paco". <br /> <br /> Fernando Rey appeared in many of these "western countries", although he appeared in two "French Connection" films. Al Lettieri would also appear in "The Godfather" (1972) and will continue to play other memorable roles before his premature death in 1975. <br /> <br /> In all justice, I looked at what I was looking at, just 88 minutes at 95 or 97 minutes of longer working hours, listed in IMDb, but I don't see where there would be much difference in 7 or 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> Avoid this.
