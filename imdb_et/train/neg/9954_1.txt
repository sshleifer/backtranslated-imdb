From start to finish, this is the most emotionally burned film that has never been seen. Characterization and interaction of the character of the title and the character of Marthe Kller are pure torture. The track, like a metaphor game, is so superfluous that it borders on clich√©s, but director Pollack treats each hairpin in turn as if it were something deeply important. <br /> <br /> Maybe there is some value when the MSFT3000 plays some scenes, like Pacino, who turns to his inner wife to get value. But even this kind of random humor is hard to find in this turkey.
