Weaker entry into the Bulldog Drummond series with John Howard. Conventional funny torment and worship, but not a lot of land. Barrymore can do something like an inspector, exchanging disguises to track Drummond, Algyi, and Tenny's chasing a wild goose (mostly in circles; maybe the budget was tighter than usual) to save the poor Phyllis who are being imprisoned by people. you want to attract Drummond to your punishment. For them, Drummond plans to ask Phyllis to marry and Algy is worried that the child's baptism has disappeared. It's fun to see that Algy and Tenny dress up as a fisherman to join The Angler's Rest, but a little bit of it rises.
