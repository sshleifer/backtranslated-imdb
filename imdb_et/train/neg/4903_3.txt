I'm never a big branch of Taiwanese film production, not Korea, Hong Kong or even China. Strong performance quality is not clearly shown in this film. I do not consider myself a difficult audience because I'm actually a fan of indie films. But this film shows a weak plot and slow pace. I found myself missing in the middle of the plot. It certainly works better. Rainie's action is a sub-parameter when he moves, trying to be perky and cute. Although I have to admit that he is happy to watch. However, Isabella Leong plays a more appropriate role in confusion, sadness, deplorable and extremely reserved character. In general, I find this film a disappointment.
