Nicholas Walker is Paul, the local town of Reverand, married to Martha (Ally Sheedy), but there is also an ordinary woman who decides to fake her death to her current case with Veronica (Dara Tomanovich) to escape. In doing so, he still gets amnesia (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also in the hands of a crazy old coat that pins a good reverend in "misery" -types. It's sad to see pretty good cast waste. No less, John Savage as a terrifying forgotten role as an emergency investigator. The film "Black Comedy" takes BOTH elements into this movie. Although it brings the former into spades, it unfortunately contains none of the latter. In addition, you cannot emphasize any characters and therefore have no interest in them. Technically, not all the common bad film is very forgotten. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dara Tomanovich gets topless; Sally Kirkland also shows skin <br /> <br /> My class: C- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Showcase
