We gave up where George Clooney's character has extracted his fingernails. We weren't cunning - after sitting one hour later, we just knew what he felt. Say that this movie was incomprehensible, boring, despicable twaddle would over-praise it! How could people sit at the corner of this confusing, slow, depressing pseudo-movie, not to mention the Oscar? Clooney seemed sick as we knew him. What did he mean? And what about these subtitles? - Did we just have a dud DVD or was that the original movie so the phrases stayed in the middle of the air? The film was so hard that it was without it. I regret cast who probably did the best to get the material available.
