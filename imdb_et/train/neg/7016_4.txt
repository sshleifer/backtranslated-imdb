54 is a movie from a club with the title of the 70's. Here is a classic beautiful bartender. Sexy women. High power owner. Party. When everyone grabs the chaos, and the bartender (played by Phillipe) seems to be the toughest. <br /> <br /> I am as blunt and honest as possible, while avoiding any direct unfair or false comments (like "ok" film). I really find this a totally terrible movie that is praised by it. Every time I sit to watch Salma Hayek's movie, I always look forward to seeing my beauty, which is quickly expressed at the same time with high performance, but the reality always reminds me of how talented it is. I really mean what she has ever left, except her huge board dance "From Dusk Till Dawn" ...? The same applies to Ryan Phillippe, another poor actor who does not display anything but his good looks and unpleasantly boring facade, otherwise known as "acting." Mike Myers, it's not as bad as these 2, he's giving at least something to Film. 54 club co-founder. The type most people watch, hate (i.e., well done work), puts him in a somewhat convincing result that gave me a rare joy. But unfortunately, it is not enough to save the movie from its baseless and flat. Most of the "bad" bad movies I find something to take from the film, but that's not really. Neve Campbell is not too bad, but she is just "there." The story is boring, it seems the writer was more bent on making this style and decorating film and forgot to add something else. Any meaning. Every class. Anyway. Because, like most ornaments, they are just hollow, pointless objects that are just beautiful, much like the foundation of this catastrophic film. <br /> <br /> Indeed, for an hour and a half, I could have spent better doing something much more exciting, such as talking to a 90-year-old relative.
