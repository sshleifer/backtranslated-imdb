There is no sympathetic character in this film. Is it a lawyer Kenneth Branagh plays that we should pull it? Well, let's see - we learn that he's a sleazebag protector who gets criminals out of technical things. He treats his coworkers as a flock, involves them in his personal crisis (in the process of killing one of them), threatens the safety of his children, threatens his former wife's new boyfriend, tries to strengthen the police and school administrators - and all that? Because he thought of him LITTLE HEAD! I really pulled my father and his gang to beat out a lawyer and beat him in the swamp ... it would have done a much more satisfying end.
