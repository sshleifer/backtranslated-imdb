Now, the truth, its very weak style - for Walt Disney movie it's all garbage. When the robinson appears, you film all over the place, I was shocked at how bad it was. It's like "alice in Wonderland" gone wrong!. They seem to have been a short idea of ​​what some somewhat mad garbage would try to try and give up - and they won't. After that I sat there who wanted to end. My younger brother lost interest in the mix and the story. The characters are weak and after the robinsons appear, this end doesn't interest you, you just want to end the movie. Forget about this movie and forget about it soon. If you have free time, don't waste it.
