OK is OK. The script is sometimes uncomfortable and it takes time to find a movie mindset. I found myself waiting. Shehan is a bit of a war race. I think we didn't have to notice it ... we did. In this house, you did nothing more than kill forty-five minutes. Shower ... what? What was that? Literally I have a client, "Ok, you can use our shower." Yawn. Angles are trying hard. There were a number of forests there, maybe the reasons for it were straight through, then it was deep and the animals were dying. Finally, this terrible proportions of the movie are boring.
