After Scooby-Doo's success, they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their show. But unfortunately, they added a new character that broke the success of Scooby-Doo forever. They invented a new exhibition called Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. It was Scrappy-Doo, which made it show a complete failure, probably for both adults and children. Scrappy was a stupid brave puppy who always saw someone beat up. Scooby and Shaggy were scared of fear and they tried to stop him. Scooby-Doo does not need a little annoying bastard puppy grandchild. If they wanted Scooby-Doo to be more successful, they would have had to kill Scrappy or never think about it. It was just poor, maybe your kids prefer it!
