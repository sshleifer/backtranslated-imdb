Under the dense green glop of computer graphics, Ichikawa Somegoro's dazzling art and skill dazzled. Unfortunately, it disappeared everywhere. The old Edo scenes with a cuddly ride to Sumida, practicing and acting in Nakamura-zas were all exciting and interesting, bringing you back to an interesting and rich era. The action at the Kabuki stage, where Somegoro stands out and excites, was more enriching than any of the following absurd high-eyed eyes. Skill, energy in the audience, the colors of the kits were much more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over the plot and performance. What a wasted opportunity! One of the best Kabuki actors lives and disappears in dreck.
