So don't even think about renting it out of stores because it's one of the hell of a bad movie. You think JJ Abraham had written this movie. Basically, the rat is rinsed off the toilet and must somehow go back. Fully dreaded "Shrek" fans can enjoy, but "Wallace & Gromid" fans are probably frightened. Also, why didn't they do it in plasticine or clay? I mean, CGI animation? For AARDMAN !! It is clear that Aardman was lazy when they allowed Dreamworks to do the whole thing. Wrong, wrong, FALSE !!! Almost every character is terrible, except for the freaky konnamees who are just the right movie villain. But everything else about the movie is DULL, DULL, DULL !!! I almost slept with boredom watching this movie. No, wait, I actually forget to sleep, watching this movie. It's just terrible. But fortunately this is not as bad as "Shrek".
