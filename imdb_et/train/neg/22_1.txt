I saw this DVD in my friends' house and thought it was a Turkish movie with some of Hollywood's not very big names. I'm interested in giving him a picture later. It was hard to experience the experiences that believe me. Then, after finally seeing the roll of credit, "We Turks really suck in making a Hollywood-style movie. It's an insult that is hostage to the movie genre .. ‚Äùbut wait! I checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, it wasn't a Turkish movie; on the contrary, it was literally taken in the United States by an American director and a team! It made me think again - How can you convince names such as Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vossloo on earth? probably with money. That kept me thinking. How can you raise so much money to offer them and supposedly international pain? Then all my meditation paid off and I came to find the answer. Taking the cheapest equipment and crew you can find. And if you still have trouble adjusting your budget, then: by writing and directing the movie you're trying to produce, or vice versa, I don't have any information about it. So it's not a bad movie because everyone is so eager to present. It makes you think - even in the case of meditating - and there are many movies that don't even give it what it would affect. at least makes you think; It makes you think .. It leaves you with disbelief .. and then makes you wonder again.
