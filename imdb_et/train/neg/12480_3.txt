... Or more specifically, so bad that you have your life time to laugh your ass when you look at it! James Sbardellati's 1983 "Deathstalker" is definitely one of the most terrifying productions that Sword & Sorcery's sub-genre has brought, but it's a lot of fun. Action is terrible, the plot is clean, and the effects and photography cannot be more amateurish. But it is bad action, cheesy effect and a lot of mistakes that make this movie so much fun. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS AHEAD - <br /> <br /> Deathstalker (Rick Hill) is a very strong and skilled warrior. One day, a good witch instructs her to combine three powers of chaos and creation, a sword, an amulet, and a gray to release the country from its cruel ruler, the evil king, and the witch Munkar. Getting a sword is quite easy, but the amulet and gray are in Munkar's possession. Fortunately, the evil king has organized a tournament where the most experienced warriors in the county fight each other until they die. The winner then takes the royal seat. Of course, the king does not want to take his place, so he has planned to kill the winner (not just organizing the tournament). Deathstalker is not only about getting three creative powers, but also to save the old, good king's proud daughter (Barbi Benton) from the evil Munkar claws. Luckily, he doesn't get to the tournament forever because he has been allowed to have a gorgeous female warrior, Kaira (Lana Clarkson) ... <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of great, incredibly stupid and funny scenes. Some of my favorite scenes are: <br /> <br /> - Deathstalker casts his sword with a bad boy. But the head that falls off is not the man. The falling head is a red goat, while the man pushed by Deathstalker was dark hair and was not a beard. <br /> <br /> - When introducing the character of a female warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson), she is first seen in black clothing, hiding her face and body. Deathstalker travel companion Oghris (Richard Brooker) struggles with him and during his sword his rope (under which he is, of course, topless) wins his breasts. His breasts are the first thing we see for Lana Clarkson, even before her face. <br /> <br /> - The last warrior Deathstalker has to fight in the tournament, the giant man with the man and his head. Evil Munkar has a ugly little creature that is locked in the breast. He feeds this little creature with the eyes and fingers of man. <br /> <br /> There are many other unintentionally funny, fun and wonderful scenes. Action is terrible, but Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson are eye candy, and while I described this film "unintentionally funny", I sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were fully aware of how the film was crazy. Observers have a fair amount of fun and a lot of nudity. "Deathstalker" is an incredibly terrible movie, but I highly recommend it. People with a sense of humor have a life time!
