If at least cruelty and drowned deaths were a story to justify their involvement, the script was simply incomprehensible and just stupid. <br /> <br /> It didn't go anywhere, the story was not readable. It was just a bunch of drawn nonsense sniffing scenes and really a silly ending that touched like to say. "At the end, * your anger and my little defenders would be pleased to see my garbage." <br /> <br /> I don't get this, a disguised murderer who has never been imprisoned, a prison rape scene that was supposed to be the guards who rape the foolish deformed serum killer and kill him and nothing else? there is no explanation, no punishment, really weak main police officer who was an actor like Pare who did not try to leave his police officers killed, tortured a child, a woman and a dog, and sent them to you watching the video. <br /> <br /> Colleagues who, for some unknown reason, themselves (individually) in the darkness looked at their farmhouse at night as a bunch of badly written teen characters that were killed one time like a bunch of idiots and no other policeman listens to them in the darkness of death one after another and just drive around for no reason until everyone is killed in turn. <br /> <br /> He had reminded me that there was no reason at first or no terrible scary snapshots of real life, whether he was looking to masturbate, was he a comedy ... what was that? Boll just thought he was throwing an animal to lovers .. whatever. <br /> <br /> Believe in Pare, psycho do a word to let your family go if he kills himself ... more gullible, a stupider cop you never saw in the movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know why I'm not trying to hate my works completely. I'm trying to find no reason to explain horror writer's art, but this stuff ... pure mess. <br /> <br /> Boll what are you doing? I hope you think this out because I know a lot more about people who can't dream of getting their movies over and over again to get their movies. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Boll really the best "Post" challenge, it was really fine.
