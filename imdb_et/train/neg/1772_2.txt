"Sleepwalkers" is the first film written by Stephen King. With that in mind, and with the excellent Santo & Johnny song they used for the film, you would expect an odd and ultimately perfect viewing experience. Unfortunately, this is not what you get. The thing is that they might have made it a good movie. At first it is intriguing what this small town's spooky atmosphere does. But something strange happens in about 20 minutes of the movie. The movie becomes funny for no apparent reason! From that moment on, the entire atmosphere of "Sleepwalkers" has been destroyed. For those who have seen it, who can ever forget the old old Johnny shout "COP KABOB !!" after putting the pen in that policeman's ear?!? But don't get me wrong, humor has no quality. I just rented it again to see if mabye was wrong for the first time since the original plot sounded, but I was right. The man that wastes. I can't believe they got that Santo & Johnny songs. I gave it 2.
