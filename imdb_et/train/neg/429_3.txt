I was tempted to see this movie in my partition, but in the end it is all. It plays much more than a tragedy in Greece as a modern thriller in metropolitan corruption. This is the biggest mistake of its predictability and total lack of space. We know who the bad guys are from the beginning and just follow when they fall like a domino. The film on the credit card does not hold free violence and sex, but has forgotten to replace good, pure romance or excitement in other ways. The taste of a decaffeinated food basket with a good taste. "Q&A", which also takes place in New York, is a much better alternative, as is "LA Confidential".
