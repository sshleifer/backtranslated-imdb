The British legacy industry is out of control. There's nothing wrong with filming classic novels, but why do they have to be filmed by talented nobles? This film hangs the guts of Orwell's heavy novel, making it a harmless, fluffy romantic comedy. "Aspidistra" may not be Orwell's best work, but someone who reads it can not forget its excellent image of poverty. Orwell emphasizes not only cold and hunger, but humiliation. In the novel, London is a dark, gray, cold, heartless city, and Comstock prays that this bomber will explode. However, this film breaks something that can in some way disrupt, and instead creates a joyful nostalgic journey to the charming 1930s London, where everything is illuminated with golden sunlight shafts, and even Lambeth's slums are picturesque and full of freshly cleaned births and happy prostitutes. Comstock's poems of sharp winds that sweep over the trash can seem totally inappropriate in this chocolate box world. The worst thing is the relentless bonhomie of the script, the ancient jokes and the dirty dialogue. It's so depressing because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock and the movie is full of great actors. But that's not all. This movie made me so angry! British literary history is proud of its richness, complexity and power. And what do we do with it? We use strange donkeys to make it a soft-centered, anodic priest to people who want to feel "getting some culture" when they drink their Horlicks and quietly poke.
