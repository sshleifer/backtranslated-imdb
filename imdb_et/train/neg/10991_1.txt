My brother is an avid DVD collector. He took a look at the cover (two models for toilets) and had to add it to his collection. I stayed with him to see what would probably be the sharpest film (I use the term loosely). I didn't dare to come across my brother's eyes, but he's sure he's gonna have to staple his stapled fist. The biggest name of the film is Michael Clark Duncan, who appears in one scene, which the "filmmaker" decided to show every movie (about four in total) in the whole movie. In fact, this movie follows this game. The fact that the DVD contained the deleted material was a shock. (I went to bed without it). Not surprisingly, I found this disc without a case behind the TV about a week later.
