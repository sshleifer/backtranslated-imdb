The 1937 "Stella Dallas" with Barbara Stanwyck is not exactly outdated - how anyone thought that the story's updated version would work now is a real understanding. Maybe they thought the cheerful, cheerfully cheerful Bette Midler could do something about it, but this wretched script wins her. On the plot, a female bartender who has a child out of wedlock and years later, giving a young girl a child to a wealthy father, so she has a better better life, can not escape from tiny, old-fashioned stairways and sentiments. Midler works best with a film director who can control his excess, but it doesn't happen here; Stephen Collins is confident as a man who changes his life, but Trini Alvarado is well-run as a Midler daughter. It was called "the image of a woman", uneasy, but it does not move to the gathering because it remains too loyal for the beginning of the 1930s. * 1/2 from ****
