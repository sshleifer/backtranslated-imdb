I've seen many good Korean movies, including thrillers and darker record movies, but it sucks. The director seems to be a sadist who happened to have someone spamming. The film has no entertaining value and is not even a thriller. I can't believe anyone did really make such a movie. While acting is OK, the story and the feeling that it is leaving is terrible. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I won't see this director's movies. There is no sense of film making and disappointment at thriller moments. All this shows scenes where the psychopath wastes the rolls with scenes that are poorly photographed and shows more blood and violent thinking that makes it exciting. A very disappointing movie and I strongly recommend skipping all such films.
