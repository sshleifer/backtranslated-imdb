In the 1970s, when I first saw it, I was in high school. Then it was cool. Now, as an adult, I look back at him and I say to myself. What was so funny? It has moments, but they are little and far away. It's so dated that jokes don't stand up anymore. Show it to a younger crowd and they're completely gone. If you like this type of humor, you may want to stay with the Kentucky Fried Movie or Amazon women. The vision of the tunnel and the Groove tube are too dated for today's viewing.
