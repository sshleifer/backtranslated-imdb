Wendigost learned for the first time several years ago in Alvin Schwartz's "Scary Stories" book: according to this story, Wendigo - after calling his name on the wind - pulls you along and then pulls you into the sky and grinds you. Although this seems a rather odd idea, Schwartz's story turned into a rather unified idea. <br /> <br /> There is no "Wendigo" movie. Basically it consists of every horror clich√©: the family moves into a new house and the strange things happen, anyone who hurts them asks for it and it was better for everyone to listen to the old Indian boy. I've seen this stuff so many times that I no longer want to read. <br /> <br /> Anyway, avoid it. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey on "Malcolm Center") have done much better.
