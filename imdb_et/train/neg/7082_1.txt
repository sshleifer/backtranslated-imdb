Ok, I wrote a wretched review of b / c that the movie is terrible. As I expected a review (for Derrida) to search, I decided to look at the old comments of this terrible movie. See all the positive comments. They all, I say all, come from an author who has not rated any other film than that. Crimminy! and wait until you look at the "rosebud" review. <br /> <br /> Check out the other movies that Rosebud reviewed and suggested brilliant recommendations. Oh, shoot !, these are the only films of two writers and directors. Holy Wipers Batman. <br /> <br /> Joe, Tony, you miracles like writers and tony, you couldn't get out of the bad script. You have no jobs! <br /> <br /> MOVIE WITH A NECESSARY REVIEW FOR BASIC REVIEW!
