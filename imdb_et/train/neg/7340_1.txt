Impressed! This is the worst SRK movie and one of the worst Bollywood movies I've ever seen! I didn't like the novel, but this movie made it worse! Very bad music, even worse actors (except, of course, SRK, though even he can't save the movie) and doesn't make much sense. The director does everything seems very confusing, God knows why ... Maybe it's because he's trying to make it all very surreal and yet reliable. Well, he doesn't run either. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a few hours to get rid of, don't look at this movie, please! (Say it for your well-being!) Continue searching, you will find something to watch!
