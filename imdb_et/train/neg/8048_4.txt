Suppose you've been on an abandoned island in the last ten years. Hasn't heard of Scream and left when Halloween part 1 stepped into the cinema. Then this film would have been an amazing and brand new vision of the horror scene. <br /> <br /> Today, there are 2.7 ratings in IMDb and it doesn't deserve this low recognition. Slashing all the way, like "I know what you did", and who-is-it, that when you reach the end convinced me of who and why. <br /> <br /> There is no big surprise, just a nice flick to watch the cola, popcorn and don't want to get a heavy plot, deep characters. If the rental of videos is not in the title, you can take it without risk, but do not wait for the masterpiece. I've seen much worse.
