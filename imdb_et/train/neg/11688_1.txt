My wife and we found this movie very happy. While the plot keeps you interested and busy thinking what's going on when you leave the theater, there are just too many open ends that don't make sense. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Christopher Plummer, NY's enormously wealthy leader, is a terrible hidden secret. Thanks to World War II, which hides the Nazi and Jewish looting, he keeps evidence (including diamonds and documents with the Nazi Swastika) in his bank safe. Why? If he wants it never to be disclosed, why did he not burn or destroy the documents years ago? And diamonds? Obviously he does not need them - why do they keep them rather than take them? How did bank robbers know their secret? How did they know from scratch in this highly secure storage box # 232? Ace Detective Denzel Washington also discovers bank notes that show SD Boxes 231 and 233, but not # 232. Curious. He carefully took some time to make embarrassing records to discover this curious thing. Everywhere, dealing with the situation of a red hot hostage and bank robbers who threaten to fill them instantly. Wow! Let's talk about the super powers of the detective. <br /> <br /> Bank robbers unleash the currency in millions of dollars they have opened. They only take the contents of SD Box 232, seemingly extortioning the bank's president. It breaks the logical explanation of the rational experiment of what the film represents as criminals or for its drivers with less brain. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster, who uses his political ties with the mayor of NYC, is authorized to enter the bank under the control of bank robbers, where there are many hostages. He offers the bank a transaction for the robber to buy back the documents he now has, but he is not interested. What is his thing (if it is?). <br /> <br /> My wife was offended by all the players' arrogance, Christopher Plummer (president of the bank), Denzel Washington (ace detective), and Jodie Foster, broke a troubled shooter for high-performance problems. <br /> <br /> The latest Jodie Foster movie I saw, "Plan of the Plan", was also full of holes that didn't make sense at all. I thought I liked Jodie Foster, but I probably avoided my future movies. <br /> <br /> My problem now is that I rarely convince my wife to go to movies. I can not agree with him on this issue ... "MONEY POLICY AND TIMES". Be careful. Well designed film, fine actors, sadness script writing.
