Wow, how bad it gets. It was seriously bad. Not gore - which was mostly ridiculous CGI - acted, in the atmosphere and in the direction. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible - the character's main character was a complete joke. Within a few nights after pursuing Vinnie Jones, she becomes a "girlfriend" to cry with her girlfriend. Are all New York City photographers childish, desirable and weak? The development of his character had no justification or any point - and eventually you will laugh out loud to a completely predictable and completely absurd twist that his character takes. <br /> <br /> The gory moments were clearly weak, with a low self-esteem attempt to jump into a modern MTV-style wagon - all cgi, blood, but no real emotion. These parts were unintentionally funny - and disturbed their self-consciousness - nervous corners of the camera, and so on. <br /> <br /> In general, this film effects the blowing of another potential idea. What could have been in the atmosphere (until the fools at the end of the monsters) have been destroyed in favor of looking at me for heart-conscious leadership. This film was not made and the audience - it was made to CV - was a deeply selfish motive.
