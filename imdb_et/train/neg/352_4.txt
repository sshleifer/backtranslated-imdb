It seems that cast should provide at least a medium movie. And so I sat incredibly for 102 minutes. Alongside Ed Harris, no one seems to have the skills to act. Even Sean Connery, whom I usually worship, must be out of the Case Case while filming. Never during the film could an actor convince me. <br /> <br /> It made this movie cheap and unreal. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit. It's exciting and the plot is unexpected. <br /> <br /> In summary, watch this movie only if you have nothing else to do with it.
