Director Fred Schepisi (Roxanne) directs this well-intentioned but inferior comedy about Albert Einstein (Matthau), who tries to catch his scientific brother-in-law (Ryan) with the usual boy Tim Robbins so he can relax and enjoy life in the 1950s. In order for Ryan to please Robbins, Einstein tries to get Robbins out like a great scientist. The idea is cute, but the film falls into smooth situations and silly dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan and the terrible supportive casting do their best to keep it silly on the surface of comedy but unable to save the movie. It is unfortunate that so many talent went to produce such a poor film. I wouldn't recommend anyone when they are Meg Ryan's big fans.
