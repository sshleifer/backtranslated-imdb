Unlike many, I do not find the presumption or topic of this exhibition the least offensive. However, this is a completely different matter. Like many B-minus movies, all decent gags seem to be hooked into trailers. For most of the 22-minute minutes, we suddenly sit up with any real humor. Or at least something that would keep one of the fidgeting from distant or reading carpets. With a few exceptions, it is terrible; The comic survival and gesturing of some cast members may be well suited to late night, but not to primeime sitcom (even Canada). Despite the true initial cultural perspective, I can't help but I think it is mainly the CBC's wrong to corner the success of the gas. Unfortunately, they got a tone and script for prairies - totally wrong. The ultimate insult is that they probably couldn't afford to place a real small town (Why? Are they so hard to find in Saskatchewan?) Did they think that the downtown centers of Regina would be disappointed? As a proud Canadian, I hope that this thing will soon be over and that the rest of the world that CBC publishers have created will soon forget its colossal embarrassment.
