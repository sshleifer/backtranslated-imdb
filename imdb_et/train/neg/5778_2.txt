Okay, so I'm dead to see this movie. The one who is in the movie "Who is who" is in a terrifying landscape, is well versed, my friend leased it, brought it over and started watching it. It should be a comedy .... I couldn't even NEVER, up to the 40-minute mark. <br /> <br /> Is it related to the budget? Not at all, there are movies out there that cost CLOSED NOT NONE, and they are amazing (for me anyway). Even while watching this movie, I could not understand the similarities (ie STEALING) with a low budget indie movie titled "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE", reading my review of it (this DESTROYS this movie BTW). <Br /> <br /> This movie ... he had the potential he actually did. It was "star power", a stolen plot (allows you to shoot the movie behind the scenes ... IE ... "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE" .... seriously, it frustrates me more and more what I think) ... it would be been funny. Much, many jokes go flat. Action is right for what it is. But it pulled forward, was not funny and the plot was completely stolen. <br /> <br /> I give it two because it was not SOOO TRANSLATION, but that is the only reason.
