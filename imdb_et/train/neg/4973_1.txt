I paused for five minutes when Beowulf was given a double-shaped automatic crossbar with its sights. Not only are the intersections with telescopic sights, but Beowulf won Grendel hand in hand. Also, the terrible wood-based and eternal darkness that captured all Sci-Fi original films did not drive. Taking just a few minutes before I felt my bile rising and I decided to love Lucy again, it's really all I have to say. But you can just understand that it's a TV movie and skip it. <br /> <br /> Travesty.
