Who's right to make this movie so stupid? <br /> <br /> Security Guard Accidental Killing ... Characters that are so two-dimensional that two years old could have painted drawn ... and better ... <br /> <br /> The Red Death Tool? Please .... <br /> <br /> Hypothermic weak shocks ... <br /> <br /> Hell action ... <br /> <br /> Stylistically, this movie swaps between teen comedy, thriller, voyeurism and ... female ... (Uhm) Rambo? <br /> <br /> Unbelievable and offensive to some thinking. Don't look, walk away, it's more terrible than you can imagine ... <br /> <br /> And besides, it tries to be a tree when it is violently violent ... <br /> Mrs Montford : Shoot 'Em Up was fun and funny, it's just pathetic and terrible. Good luck next time. :-(
