killing this movie is, among other things, his self-awareness. Here is a short list: 1. Unfair behavior. when beaten came and injected their brand into "peculiar, superfluous" behavior / humor, it was welcomed fresh. it was over 4 decades ago. over. <br /> <br /> 2. Wrong complexity. Crowding out the base, quasi-sociological politics is hard to do the work of a comic. ask woody allen. <br /> <br /> 3. Postmodern "I am in this fake world hard and yes, I feel like myself" snake eating myself - it is used as an exhibition with another movie's own animal! "- it's kind of restored. <br /> <br /> 4. smarmy, smug drollness. <br /> <br /> 5. amateur writing, acting, direction ... never seen student movies? own victim, only thing what can i say positive is that he has at least a separate feeling and sheesh, now i get hold of a reflexive thing he considers valuable. br /> <br /> but ... what, finally, it just rings like hollow like every other pretentious piece - hey, never see woody allen shots for bergman, ie: "Interiors" ??? well, it just does it more amateurly.
