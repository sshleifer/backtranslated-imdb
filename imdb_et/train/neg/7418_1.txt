Oh god, that's a terrible and terrible movie. It is meant to comment on the state of society, it is simply a reflection of the worst reality TV. The interstitials administered by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most disgusting part that is written in a tone that can be meant to be reflexive and understandable. Rather, these moments are remembered because they talk to the camera through a dialogue written by someone who has a love for an offensive and outgoing call that pulls the "meaning" of the film under the viewer's throat. <br /> <br /> A point for future filmmakers: long and quiet scenes are not equal to art. Neither extreme angles nor logic that go to the absurd point. <br /> <br /> If anyone is interested in watching this movie, please don't. Seriously. Please. You have better things.
