Visual stunning? Certainly. I've seen some movies look good for some time. Sky Captain and World of Tomorrow use striking cinematography, computer graphics and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar, but something completely fresh. The period seems to be the beginning of the 1930s or 40s. The film speaks recently of the New York attacks by mechanized armies that steal some unexplained reasons for generators and the like. It also coincides with the mysterious disappearance of the relevant scientific heritage. Who can stop them and save the world? Alright, it doesn't take a leap of faith to find out it's Sky Captain himself, who is always hot for his leading reporter girlfriend, and in his wings his reliable, thoroughly competent sidekick. Which Sky Captain is in the atmosphere and in graphics, there is no way of narrating and characterizing. The plot of this movie is ridiculous. Nonetheless, the film has a sequential feeling, which is the film series of the past year. They had pretty long stories and bad behavior, but none of them, and I didn't think of any of them, wasn't the movie and the big names. Two academic prize-winning speakers and Jude Law could hold on to the film, but one might think, but Sky Captain falls unhappy. Despite the fantastic dark look I found that I want the movie to end and I can go on with my life. I had little interest in the story that was of little interest. I didn't care about any glib images at all. Paltrow was just terrible. Jolie was a joke whose role was virtually non-existent. The law cannot transfer the tradition of a single liner to its limited shoulders. I mean, let's face it, it's not Will Smith, Mel Gibson or even Wesley Snipes. The sad thing about Sky Captain, at least for me, was that he had so much promise that was so little. I missed the movie for ten minutes, waiting for something that interests me, and it never came.
