If you read my review of SyFy's "Dinoshark", you know that I appreciate the low-budget script that these TV movies can offer. They're stupid ... they're stupid ... but they're still pretty fun, so bad. So, still tasting pleasant (and suggesting) indisputably "Dinoshark", I sat down to watch "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy", the original SyFy text about half-man, half of Hammerhead's monster who terrorizes people on the island. What's the SyFy Channel's definite fire recipe for creating and casting the features of B-movie creatures, including William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how could it go wrong? Well, to my surprise, it actually leaves the mark not ... not much, but enough to not recommend it to me. Why? First of all, the monster of this title, the terrible hammerhead human hybrid, on the back of the faux army tangles, has really become the film's main cable. While the hammerhead rack up the body number, it (or it or whatever you call the thing) arrives only before someone gets munched onto and leaves immediately after. The rest of the film is a filler that puts our heroes against the above-mentioned soldiers. It is not just as convincing for me as watching the walking hammer heads eat people! <br /> <br /> Please read the full review of your blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
