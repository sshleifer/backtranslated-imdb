Rentis had a movie about Blockbuster last night and it was the first I watched (it was late on Saturday night, "a horror movie correction") ... <br /> <br /> Wow, it was terrible, almost embarrassingly so ... stupid slasher -The type of story I really thought about movies like Scream had finished; amateur artists who offer a clich√© and an uncertain dialogue that is hard to believe were actually printed and read from the page; and gore scenes that aren't exciting (especially when they're in a movie that is badly written). <br /> <br /> But I've always believed that no movie is 100% percent worthless. Here are some good things I can say about this confusion: <br /> <br /> # 1 Bobbie Phillips: I love this actor. He is the only cast member to display any acting talent. The only reason I took this rental option was that his name was on the front cover. He recognizes his presence in this dreck with professionalism, although he sometimes sees confusion that he is acting in such a moral story. <br /> </p> If there were still polished house theaters all over the country, and they also used such nonsense as the third film on a triple bill that had some prestigious thriller film that was finally on the back of the road. Unfortunately, in this direct-video era, most of the viewers have to endure these calculations alone, without having the social experience of taking part in the audience and throwing the screen as the film is so terrible. What brings - <br /> <br /> # 3 Porn Stars are trying to act! This usually means that they actually speak of a line that should develop the lecture (except "ooh yeah baby" or "harder!"). And proudly, they all offer the expertise to look stupid when trying to act. I would leave Ginger Lynn Allen out of this group if her character wasn't supposed to be an Irish mother, and she sometimes tries to emphasize what just keeps her smiles. <br /> <br /> Pleasant to look for positive positives in all experiences, and that's what I took about it.
