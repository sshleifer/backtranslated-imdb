This movie should be named for the new genre: Complete Mess! This movie is sometimes a perfect waste of time, except for a few couples and one or two gore scenes. Calling it "Campy" doesn't even lose it. "Campy" means that this movie was not fun. You spend the first half of the film thinking: "It feels better, right?". In justice, this will finally be when he finally explained who the "brother / sister" team is and what they want, but then you no longer have to take care of it because you have spent the whole movie thinking about exactly what Mr Onorati and Mrs. Pacula did, to notice someone who is stuck in such a terrible movie.
