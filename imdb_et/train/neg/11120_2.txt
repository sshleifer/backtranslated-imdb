You know that the movie is bad if its rising is seen in a short "Jeopardy!" The moment. <br /> <br /> The white men's sadest thing that can't be jumped is that it had tremendous potential. For several years, I lived in an area like this film; Racial tensions were high and basketball meant everyone. A movie about this "basketball culture" member could have been very interesting, but the white men 's centrally acting and bad script couldn't do anything. <br /> <br /> The sequence of movie events is cyclic. First, Billy wins or loses money playing basketball. He then returns with his girlfriend to his home and salons; and the process is repeated. Most stories gather at some climax, but the "vision" I saw was another repeat in this repeat (this is "Billy wins or loses money by playing basketball"). <br /> <br /> To make the plot develop, some dilemma needs to be resolved; and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is interesting. Obviously, white men's writers cannot forget this rule because the plot can be summed up as "Billy has to pay the bills." I appreciated the speed of other sports movies, but - I'm sorry - it was just terrible. I could have been less caring for Billy getting money for renting his apartment. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, the white men jump on a successful movie. Obviously, some adamantial sports fans leave terrible writing for some scenes where they have basketball. Others, I'm sure, were big names who played a leading role. That leaves me in doubt when the cast is completely replaced by previously unknown actors, and the basketball theme was replaced by lacrosse, would anyone watch this movie? I really don't believe. <br /> <br /> I give ten stars to this movie; the extra star is "Jeopardy!" a scene that kept me awake for a few minutes. Thank you, Trebek.
