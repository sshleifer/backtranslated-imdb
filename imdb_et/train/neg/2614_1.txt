Advancing to Disney's 1996 live-action remake of 101 Dalmations. Cruella deVil (Glenn Close) is released from prison after being "treated" by her psychologist Dr. Pavlov (ugh!) For obsession. But "cure" is broken when Cruella hears Big Ben and goes back to the mad endeavor to make her perfect coat of leather. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad on many levels, starting with the "Thanksgiving Family Lock", which aims to suck out every last existing dime from the Disney marketing machine. Glenn Close over-over-over-over-acting like Cruella. All she had to do in this movie - lame script, endless makeup, baking in baking - I hope they gave her a very big salary. <br /> <br /> (Talking about where in the world you will find the fur industry, the bakery of the Rube Goldberg assembly line and the candlelight restaurant located in the same building as you are at the top of the movie.) Of course, the real stars of the movie should be dogs. They act as the "Macaulay Culkin", pulling all the fools of "Home Alone" ghosts on the villain. (Biting them on your feet, running over your hands with luggage trolleys, spraying them with icing, etc. Etc., Ad nauseum.) I have to admit that the dogs were relatively good actors - much better than Gerard Depardieu's waste of the film as the French fur industry completely disappeared. Two human "dog students" who have rebuilt the previous film, but with different players, are completely bored. If they have an Italian restaurant spaghetti dinner, the movie will be cut back and forth between two lovers and their dogs, watching "Lady and Tramp" dinner. I thought to myself, "Please, don't go there!" I was half waiting for people to make a satire of "Lady and Tramp" in the dinner scene - as Charlie Sheen did "Hot Shots: Part Deux" - making "spaghetti direction" by pushing meatball with her nose, etc. <br /> <br /> Don't let me get into the annoying parrot with Eric Idle's voice. <br /> <br /> Costumes were nominated for the Oscar and costumes in the movie * are good. But they're the only good thing in the movie. The rest of it is an intolerable staircase.
