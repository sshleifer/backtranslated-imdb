This film is massively boring and pretentious. There is only one good moment when sailors shave Mrs. Barney (think less purple dinosaur with less pretense) brow. The music is endlessly funny - it's sad that Bjork, someone with so much inner beauty, has been despised in his art. The Road Service Pomp is a beautiful ritual that looks like coats of arms. mythology and culture in this film are not respected, they are raised. Not only the Japanese culture, but the other filmmaker ... (stay tuned) The perfect "art imitates life" moment - the ship's crew finds a huge piece of t * t. What is the audience in the theater? There are some kits that are very well prepared and without heart. Then prepare the spoilers - I'll tell you about MR BARNEY. <br /> <br /> The Emperor has no clothes! Mr Barney! I have seen Jodorowski St. MOUNTAIN. And your thin, fake BS veil has been canceled. You have stolen your pictures of your style and your entire CATALOG of this person. Now that HOLY MOUNTAIN has been released, we hope that the powers of the world's art councils will remain yours! Poor Jodorowsky-lost financial struggle with a Beatles lawyer when he is making films for Lennon / McCartney. And BTW, while Jodorowsky is Beatle-YOU are MONKEES! Cheap thin breathless lovers only enjoyed the lightweight kitchy college refreshers. And BTW I am a filmmaker. If you are interested in making a reality film - I am legally fighting you in the ring protecting Jodorowsky, protecting you directly from theft.
