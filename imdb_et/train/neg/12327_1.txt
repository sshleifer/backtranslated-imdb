The previous reviewer said the film wasn't that bad. What?!?!?! The film respects the child's embarrassment. Oh, but Sylvia Kristel was naked, so let's give her 10 out of 10. Why not complete 10? Because filmography was "embarrassing," the look of the child's shock was "unreal" and the fat friend was "irritating." In the review, the reviewer does not express any displeasure about the fact that in 1981 American film scenes appeared on children who had grown up with sex with a woman. I happened to get this steaming bread when I was in a hotel with Showtime. Even if a fat friend had caused a storm and deserved Oskar, I would still be one star of the movie. It is particularly ridiculous that the TV Howard Hessman appeared in the movie at the same time as the WKRP. But don't take my word!
