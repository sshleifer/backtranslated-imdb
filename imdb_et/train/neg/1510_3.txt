Reasons to watch this strike ... err ... respect for the big movie Se7en: - It's on when your channel is surfing and there's nothing else. - Someone pays you for watching it. <br /> <br /> Make Se7en a favorite and pop on DVD, rent it, download it to iTunes or put it on your Netflix and leave Flock completely. Flock is the same story with some change. What's more, editing simply interferes with Se7en and gets you the story several times. The worst thing is probably flying in the wilderness against helicopter images, the sounds of people talking over the radio, unless it does not have police helicopters running overhead. tap. If you want to be nice, you can call it a movie, go ahead, but in both cases, look at Se7en.
