Good Earth follows the life of a slave girl and a poor farmer in China. The film is based on Pearl S. Buck's novel. The story is great, but I hated that they decided to lead Anglo. Walter Connolly is a ridiculous farmer's father. He is such a heavy American accent, as well as most of the leading actors that I could not listen to him. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that Hollywood could not get away from his racist convictions in Asia. To take Angos and see them like Chinese is similar to Anglos, placing a shoe polishes their face to play African-Americans.
