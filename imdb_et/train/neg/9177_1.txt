The House of Death was the worst film I've ever seen, a pathetic "matrix" of 360 camera angle test and cheese that I fell asleep. I don't think the director and the director could decide if it is rain or not, because there would be no rain on one side of the boat, not the other. I would appreciate this movie from 10 out of 10 (10 is the best, 1 is the worst). Also, the jump scenes in the movie game were really annoying, it makes you wonder if they were just making up for losing time. I ask someone who reads it, NOT THIS. It's not worth the time.
