It was 1 am in the morning and I had nothing else to do. Don't understand me ... please. <br /> <br /> We are back in Spanish settlements from time to time. The group has reached the island. It won't take too long before they come across a big "reptile" that hits their horse. Soon they will remain in the hands of the indigenous people and they will have to kill the "gods of reptiles" to gain freedom. CG sucks; it reminds me of the CG of the early console video games. Meetings were flat. The only positive thing I have to say was that the housewife ran in silent clothing. Otherwise, it's just in the middle.
