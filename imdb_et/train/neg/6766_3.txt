You've probably heard this phrase when it comes to this movie? "Herbie: Fully loaded with nonsense" and yes it's true. This movie is really terrible and completely flat. <br /> <br /> This was the second worst film ever made by Lindsey since the admission of Teenage Drama Queen. The only good thing about this movie seems to be over the talent that is far better than the film's million times and the only selling point of the film. I don't see how an honorable actor like Matt Dillon could be part of this movie, does he read this terrible scenario before he logs in? <br /> <br /> What I didn't like about this movie is also the basis for Herbie's surreal and fantasy like exceptional ability and climbing on the wall and going faster than a racing car after it's just a Beatle. I know it's a child's movie, but they've gone overboard and it's just more stupid than entertaining. Little realism is needed and the story is too predictable. <br /> <br /> Final words: If children are not really 5 to 12 years old, I doubt anyone could enjoy this useless movie. What a waste of my money. I feel deceived. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 (Rating: F)
