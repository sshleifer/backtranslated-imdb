Surely the worst film I've ever seen ... Does anyone tell me where I would be laughing? There is no idea or shadow of the idea. Three leading actors are pesticides, especially from Sicily (I think it is Aldo), who doesn't make Sicilian !!! Not to mention the dreamy addition of Dracula ... just another expedient from the worst cabaret tradition to make this "film" a little longer. Massiron and Littizzetto do what they can, but this so-called movie was too hard to save. I would have given this "0" / 10 but the lowest mark was 1/10 and so I had to overestimate it with one character.
