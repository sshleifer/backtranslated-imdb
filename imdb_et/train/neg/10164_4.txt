I just saw it at the Venice Film Festival and can't decide that. We never allowed any character to get close enough. Perhaps it was that we were all in our own "bubble", but these people did not force me to worry or shock their different destinies. After a few hours of working, the characters were not very well developed. A lot of time was devoted to factory equipment (forklift trucks, conveyor belts, shovels); and the surprisingly vivid eyes of the slightly horrible baby dolls that most of the creatures created for the living entity were somehow more interesting than the living people. An interesting experiment, but it never came together.
