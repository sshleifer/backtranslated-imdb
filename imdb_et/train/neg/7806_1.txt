Poor Michael Madsen; he must know for himself that people have learned about this terrible flick. I really don't think of anything worse than I've ever seen except for amateur porn. It's so bad and everything here; wood-working, bad scripts, dirty moral end, you hate it and that's in the movie. <br /> <br /> My question is, "Who the fuck did $ $ this dog doo piece? Could have seen Michael's sister in Virginia's naked scene, but I don't think it even smells like this smell ... > <br /> For a cool boy who has made some exception films, I want to know what a ugly church sponsored this crapola piece.
