Die for (1989) was another d.t.v. a feature that made the ad nasuem cable appearing in the early 90s. The only thing that was noticed about this feature was the last movie Duane Jones. Of course there is no reason to watch this vampire flick if you don't like dragging a pseudo chick as a horror movie. The tired vampire longs for love and looks for it in the back of L.A. Does he succeed or does Vlad start to beat again, as he has in the last century? <br /> <br /> This movie must be great because a couple of sequences soon followed. They are so bad that it looks like a classic. I know it's a movie about vampires, but filmmakers could get used to lighting. <br /> <br /> I didn't like it because I didn't like it. <br /> <br /> nuff said?
