Well, first off, if you look at a zombie rebellion, like some living dead nights (1968) type of film, forget about it. It refers to "zombies" in a more psychological sense, where the term only refers to someone who does not control his will, but who instead has to follow the will of the other. "Zombies" here, as little as they are in the movie, are largely metaphors for the state or institution in general, as in the war. It's pretty stretchy to call it a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The film was set during World War I. The "French Cambodian" contingent had heard strange stories of zombies - allegedly Angkor Wat was built by zombies - and there are tales of zombie armies just to overcome enemies. Armand Louque (Dean Jagger) brings back the priest who allegedly knows the secret of zombification, but he doesn't speak. So Louque and the international military contingent lead Angkor Wat to an archaeological expedition aimed at detecting the secret of zombie and destroying the information before zombies have the chance to exclude the "white race". <br /> <br /> One of the strange things about the Zombie Rebellion is that it seems that the writer / director Victor Halperin decided to change his game plan when shooting the script. The film begins as it explores the zombie / military metaphor and perhaps even the adventure elements, but after about 15 minutes it changes the move and the story of the love triangle changes. <br /> <br /> Halperin will withhold subtitle power and power (and Nietzsche's power to power). The film is interesting at this level, but the script and editing are very dirty. This is another older film for which I would not be surprised if there is no film material, especially since some scenes even dazzle or intersect when the character dials. <br /> <br /> The imagined romantic story in the middle of Halperin is trying to refer to a zombie thread, but little zombie material makes much sense. Louque discovers the secret of zombification, but that doesn't mean much to the viewer. The mechanics of Zombie material are vague and confusing? Even from the 1932 film, Halperin uses the Bela Lugos googly eye sketch for the White Zombie, but never explains what to do with it. The plot has big gaps, including the story of love. Promising, interesting early rolls of characters will disappear for a long time. One potential villain will be destroyed unpleasantly before he starts to do a lot. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of old, crazy B-movies, the zombie rebellion can be seen at least once - action is not so bad, and if you have a good imagination, you can put together an interesting story in your mind to fill any gaps. But this is the second time I saw this movie, the first one was only five years ago and I could hardly remember it - so it's not memorable.
