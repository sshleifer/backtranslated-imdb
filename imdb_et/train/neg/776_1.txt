I remember seeing this comic when I was 6 or 7 years old. My grandfather took this video in the mall for free. I remember it was really wonderful. The plot didn't make sense. I hated the fox, who became a friend of Casper. He was so stupid! Casper shouted his head when he couldn't find a friend. So what? Get over it! The only good part, and I don't want to sound like that, was when the fox got off and died at the end. I laughed at my head, because this cartoon sucked so much. The bad news is that the fox will recover and become a ghost. I wish he was dead. I think I even gave this video to someone because I hated it. No wonder they offered it in the mall for free. If you have a child, don't let them look at it. They probably agree with me that it sucks.
