It's just a great story of Edwin Torres. This movie does not follow the style of the book. And there are so many contradictions between the original film and the fact that you have to think about whether the screenwriter had seen the first movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino (original and still best Carlito) gets out of jail at the start of the start. Carlito leaves here in his wife's paradise. <br /> <br /> What happened to Gaili in Lorain, Ohio? She is not mentioned in this regard and Carlito leaves and is expected to marry another girl. <br /> <br /> Where is Kleinfeld? I think he was in the first book. <br /> <br /> I also like how Mr Guzman plays a completely different character in this movie. He was back in Pachanga in Pacino's days. Now he is Nacho Reyes, a Cuban killer. I remember that Nacho Reyes had a much bigger role in the book. <br /> <br /> It has been a while since I read the book, but where did Sean Combi's character come from? I also think that this film obviously pulls over the racial tensions that Torres wrote in Harlem. And the mob doesn't get the treatment they did in the book. They're also wiped out in this movie. But magically the Pleasant Avenue bunch is for another movie about. <br /> <br /> The book spoke of a great story. This film could have been a great story. It's just a big disappointment. Read the book. This is a better use of your time.
