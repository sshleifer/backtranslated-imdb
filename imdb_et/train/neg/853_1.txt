Ok, honestly I don't see why everyone thinks it's so big. It's not really. There were two good things that came out of this movie. 2. Danny's performance, he was good. No one else, he was pretty stupid. And what did Stanley Kubrick think of creating Shelly Wendy? He was so bad. He looked the same way every time he scared. The problem with this movie was the end. I would have honored it more if Kubrick had finished it differently. And the whole movie was just stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better. So look at the movie reading the book and you're a lot better. 3/10.
