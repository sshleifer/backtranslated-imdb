The most striking of this 1920s Berlin semi-musical set is the wonderful cinematography and editing. In these departments, it is at the top of First National. The story is easy and similar to Miller's two other films (SUNNY, SALLY), where a working girl is a rich boy with family condemnation, complications, and final. All four musical numbers are stapled at the beginning of the film and we go for a long stretch without musical buoyancy. Miller sings a part of me thinking about BABY and repeats YOUR YOU. It has also never been blue and is not your first one. <br /> <br /> Miller is very interesting and delightful here, reminding both Irene Dunne and her way. He's not as dumb as he is in his forte. SALLY remains his best film because it is the second and rather poor SUNNY, which is very low. His life was tragically shortened with sinus infection before the day when hospitals and antibiotics prevented such tragedies. You should visit these films to see Ziegfeld's twentieth anniversary.
