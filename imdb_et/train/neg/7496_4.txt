It is difficult to word with almost what I have in this film. But I try: <br /> <br /> Every other word was explosive, sexual scenes were uncomfortable, drugs were rampant, and stereotypes were beyond normal, if not Italian Americans offended. I'm not saying that it was terrible because Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, Espisito et al. al, worked fine. But ... almost every sign of the movie I despised. Not because Vanities fire I didn't like every screen sign.
