It's probably not at the bottom of the medium-sized barrel of Slasher movies, but it's definitely a fucking bad movie. <br /> <br /> The vacation spot assumed it was interesting, but after the first scene, the movie shows it is bad production values ​​and a stupid sample. I mean, the sub-genre was at the moment invisible to teenagers with no visible reasons, but it took it too far. There is no unity of events or anything else to add. <br /> <br /> Clichés are more than boring, drilling is minimal and so mystery. <br /> <br /> This is a rather mediocre entry that should not be mortgaged even if it has a label on the video. <br /> <br /> I am really disappointed with this overpriced trash.
