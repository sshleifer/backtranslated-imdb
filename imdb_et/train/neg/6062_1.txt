Wow. The only people who look at it positively are Carpenter's apologists. I know a lot about them. Men who look at John Carpenter squatting in celluloid and pushing the film and proclaiming it as a horror champion. This "film" is perfect. It looks and sounds like porn (good lord, sound is terrible ...) and has sub-par porn action that's shocking, because usually Ron Perlman is really a very good actor. I have a honest idea of ​​what Carpenter was thinking about doing. Probably "beans, beans, beans .." until someone feeds and rolls him into the day ... They're not talking about abortion debate if they could have been a very interesting central topic (how religious anti-religious abortionists feel when it's fucking child?), but they decided that Ron Perlman and his terrible kids were killing a lot of people and were terribly cast doctors trying to calm the hysterically bad pregnant girl. No man from this episode or what you should pass away impatiently. It's just terrible. Like, Plan 9 Outerspace is terrible. Like, good god, someone would turn it off before I get into the terrible soil. Try to watch it and The Thing on the same day and implements it.
