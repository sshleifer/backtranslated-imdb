When I look for new cars, I expect boats not to be shown. When I drink the Coke of the fountain, I should assume that the drink contains coke. When I look at a film that beautifies myself with the name of a great scientist, I hope it is somehow relevant to that person or his work. It could have been people who discussed my grannys diary. The material in question is only relevant because they are insecure in the unknown. I fell asleep when I first tried it, and the second time I stopped watching it. <br /> <br /> I love science and documentaries. I'd rather look at these recent blockages. But is it far from worthy of your time? Avoid at all costs.
