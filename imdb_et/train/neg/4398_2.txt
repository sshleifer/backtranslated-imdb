Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors I've been evaluating throughout my career, and that was the only reason to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is completely regrettable! These two great actors are humiliating as much as they make an outrageous, unimaginable, and kitchi (not that it is bad in itself) sketches that should laugh at people but can't do it. The only reason I think is that the director was their friend and they decided to support their movie starring - I don't think anything else because this movie is so cheap! Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Cusack have not been disappointed ever since. I recommend that you avoid this movie if you do not want your opinion on the two participants to be compromised.
