Sometimes the film is so terrible that it affects your morale. You really start asking yourself what our society means, the standard is so terribly low? Can they honestly assume that we are carrying a lot of clich√©s and are still entertaining? conflict and resolution in movies. The character needs a weapon. Gets a gun. You can't do this because he has a gun. Leads your weapon first. OH MY GOD What are we doing? He has a gun! She waves it around, acting more maliciously than real people ever do. He pushes it to someone's face for 90 minutes, screaming questions. A hallmark of each conclusion is the comforting sound of police weapons. <br /> <br /> It's a real challenge to make this tired, attacked formula formula again; the film must be very smart and well executed. It's not either. It has no life or personality and it sucks those components into YOU. it makes you feel WORKING to live your time and space. Really who needs it? So yes, I say this: I think it may be the worst movie I've ever seen. Anyone involved in killing this mediocre soul must be openly embarrassed for the merits they have done for all of us.
