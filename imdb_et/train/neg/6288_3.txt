Having read a lot of comments here, I am surprised that no one has admitted it essentially as the 1960 Twilight Zone episode "Mirror Image", which is marked by Vera Miles. Rod Serling did a much better job to create an effective spooky story in 24 minutes when Sean Ellis made his tedious jab for 88 minutes. A short piece can be an effective mysterious and inexplicable end, but the film should contain a little more substance and the story should be reasonable. Unfortunately, two things have disappeared from "The Broken" in terms of content and thought. Yes, it has a few moments, but it is not enough to justify your time. Some additional observations: although this is clearly a modern story, there is no mobile phone in one movie character! And while a car accident is an event that gets a story, there is never any reference to an insurance company, another person driving a car, or a police who should have reported. My advice: skip this drilling and check the original!
