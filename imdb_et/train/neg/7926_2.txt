The initial exploitation of the classic - albeit somewhat somewhat pleasant from a somewhat pleasant level - for some boys who carry cats with a human animal that eat monsters because the cat food they produce is being re-made with humans is added to the scifi elements. Cats don't get enough and when the meat is finely ground, the cats turn to their owners. Badly assembled on almost all levels, this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that had been in the movie houses in the early 1970s, updating alien cats and dogs in competitions that fought for supremacy. Director Ted Mikel is hacking, but it is such a pleasant person (I generally like a boy thanks to his smile, which causes interviews and a commentary) that you can pretty much apologize for the rubbish that he usually found out. Mikels wanted to make movies and he didn't care how they came out as long as he produced something. More power for her, but I wish she wouldn't get us on her home videos
