Just like the title of WWE's New Year Revolution 2006, the title of the last year was the Disposal House. However, the difference between the past years and the game of the present years was the value of entertainment. In fact, only three people came out of the WWE Championship in Albany's Pepsi Arena in New York. These men were the current champion John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. Vinnie Mac had no belt in any way; Carlito or Chris Masters. And Kane? Kane held the WWE Championship in June 1998 and it was just one night. It was obvious that he was not going to be. The match of the last few years was an exciting thing with the six best WWEs. The year 2006 was a predictable and disappointing thing, but still it was a good night night. <br /> <br /> The only evening surprise came after the clock was at the main event. Vince McMahon himself walked and demanded that they lift the chamber. Then it was announced that Edge was putting his money in the bank championship right there and there. John Cena could not prepare and simply abandon the victory of the training chamber. John Cena was unable to win and won the title after WWE's one of the most entertaining heels. It was the only entertaining act that happened all night. <br /> <br /> The sub map, like last year, was really terrible. The triple H and the Great Exhibition slipped into a festival that tried to stay away from me. HHH won the win, but it was never in doubt? Any pay-per-view that has both Jerry Lawler and Viscera wrestling with the same card will never have any chance of success. The King created Helms (who writes it?) And Big Vis tasted a shattered Shelton against Benjamin with little help from his mother. <br /> <br /> WWE women also had a quick night. There was an ordinary Diva nonsense with a Bra and Panties Gauntlet game that won the Ashley and Female Championship was also on the line. During the game I thought I would have brewed until WrestleMania 22 Mickie James challenged Trish Stratus with a good game. Trish won the competition, but it was obvious that it would continue in the near future. <br /> <br /> The competition for opening the evening was soon WWE Champion Edge, Intercontinental Champion, Ric Flair. It could have been better, but it was a frustrated and bloody Flair that was retained after the disqualification ended. Edge was probably bigger to fry fish. <br /> <br /> So the New Year's Revolution opened the 2006 pay calendar catastrophically. The only good thing about this is to know that the only way for WWE is. They won't get much worse.
