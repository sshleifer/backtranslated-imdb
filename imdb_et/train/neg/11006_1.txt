This film, among other things, marks the offer of "SlapChop" Vince (who also wrote, edited and instructed) and Joey Buttafuocot - not exactly the names that shout "quality". And with a resurrecting sketch like "Supermodels that take the dump" (that's exactly what it looks like), a boy who robs a sperm bank ("Rhymer"), a necrophilia rotting body, hopes of black markets (where is the man who bundles it, what should be out of the jar), a lot and lots of gay jokes, skits about giant fallos, superhero and forced abortions. Skits are painfully uneven (like "Batman and Rhymer"), the actor is not good enough to be an amateur and the film is crude ... and stupid. I really believe that a group of 8-year-olds could just have made a movie with the same budget. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this movie brought a "Slap Shot" Vince case against Scientologists. Frankly, I don't know who to root in this case! Apparently he claimed that Scientologists somehow destroyed his reputation and dropped his film. It doesn't matter that the movie is a rejection junk from beginning to end and 99% failed (in comparison, Ebola is funny) ... and these are the most pleasant things I can say about the movie. <br /> <br /> So that IS Bobby Lee (from "Mad TV") wears a diaper and participates in a stupid fake porn movie. It is amazing that his career could overcome it.
