I found that darkness is too DARK. It was a kind of cool idea and some ambitious ideas, not bad action scenes and some splashy moments that made you go to UGH! BUT, it was under-confused. You don't really know what's going on in the dark scenes, and the movie that's shot on the Super 8 Film has all the nasty grains you can handle. Like Nathan Schiff's films, it's just too much. It seems that director Leif Jonker wants to make the original text, but he does not have the know-how to do it. The camera is never in the right place, the lack of fundamentals such as how to record simple dialogue scenes and how to enlighten the movie. Actors are all quite uneven and teeth. But despite these negative factors, the music is good, the gore is many and ranges from foolish pain to really good devices. Is it classic as it says? Is it worth two praise? NO. But this is a good first sample. Now that these guys stop behind this movie (what I understand here, the only thing they've ever finished), they'll try for a while and try again, they can do better.
