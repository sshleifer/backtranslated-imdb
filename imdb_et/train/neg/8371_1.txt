I think it's pretty safe to say it's still the worst movie when I saw a trailer on TV, knew from the first one that it would be a piece **** and it would be better to avoid it, but it would be better to avoid it, but I somehow I found it in the eyes of friends, I went to the cinema with a little expectation, but hoped that a few cheap smiles would keep me awake during this movie. The so-called "jokes" in this film bring a face to the face, mostly made up of people who face faces and balls, the baby looks strange and acts like horny gangsta and typical racing jokes that we so often see in today's garbage comedies. The film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe, but also predictable and boring. The characters are extremely annoying and strongly stereotyped. I never want to see this **** movie again, rather I would take the ball on my feet than I would have encountered this fucking strain again. If someone I see says they liked it, I physically hit them
