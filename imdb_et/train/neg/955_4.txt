I don't think any Hollywood history player lasted as long as David Niven gave most of the weak films he had to wear due to his incredible charm. He could act, got an Oscar, but most of the material he did was as light as one layer of two-ply paper. <br /> <br /> Happy Go Lovely is an example. It's musical, and you usually remember Vera-Ellen's dance. You have to remember that they are in a Scottish costume because the movie is in Edinburgh during the festival. But if you can recall this single song, you must have a photo memory. <br /> <br /> The plot is light. Vera-Ellen is an American leader in music, probably coming out of the city in Edinburgh. He starts in the choir and runs after one day. He gets the King of a millionaire greeting card. Everyone assumes he is the main pressure of a millionaire. The doors open as they never opened before. <br /> <br /> Millionaire is David Niven and he goes with it and with different situations caused by an error. Cesar Romero has good moments as an insane producer of this music. <br /> <br /> Finally, though, Happy Go Lovely is a light and harmless fluff that David Niven did so much and became so tired.
