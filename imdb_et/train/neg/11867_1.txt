I didn't think it was possible, but I found the film worse than "Body Melt". This movie is really very bad! And even worse, his second Australian film ... <br /> <br /> Hitting what looks like VHS and terrible 80s rock music, it just gets worse and worse, it's hard to believe seeing how bad the start is (skinned man who hangs up with white tomato sauce, sprays the room where anyone is?). And why are their accents changing? The bad New York draw, prissy English, then the pure Aussie! And it happens all the pain! <br /> <br /> This movie also claims to have won some film festivals (I believe it was the Utah Film Festival). It must be wrong, because nobody would call it something in their right mind (perhaps golden rasberries, but I think it is too bad for it). <br /> <br /> Come on guys! This movie must be number 1 under 100! It must be ten times as bad as these films already exist. <br /> <br /> Well done for the "movie" makers of this trash to prove that there are no movies ..... 0/10
