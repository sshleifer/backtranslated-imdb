Have you ever seen a movie that consists entirely of long frames? No? Me neither. Well, I have finally seen "spring in my hometown" and I have to admit, now I know why people don't. The technique is certain, but it is certainly not mature for public consumption. The technique is very flawed simply because the viewer has no emotional connection with the characters and maybe it can be the intention of the whole director. I don't know, I can't read the thoughts and I don't know enough about the Director General. <br /> <br /> But one thing about this movie that is painfully obvious is its ridiculous anti-American feelings. As an American, I am well aware of my country's participation in the Korean War, and I am very aware that we were not always angels, but I am sorry when I take this man's version of how things happened. According to the blind fools, the Americans were not just the roots of war, but the cause of the war, and we destroyed almost one country. Whatever, mister director. And I think you would make this movie in COMMUNIST in Korea if we didn't intervene, right? Talk about forgetting your history. It is almost like doing Nazi "good boys", while Allied forces become "bad". This film is both historically naive and so factually inaccurate that it is almost embarrassing to look. For a person who comes from a country that owes American intervention because of his existence, he is sure he is both high and powerful and judicial.
