I saw her movie at Ann Arbor's film festival. I'm a student of film at the University of Michigan, so I know something or two about the film. And Crispin Glover's film is outrageous. He basically uses the spiritually challenged. Shirly Temple is not only anti-Christ (which I admit it is a little funny), which mentally mentions the challenges of killing one another, but is obsessed with killing snails. Crispin also plays the idea of ​​being in love with one of his actors who are like everyone, mentally challenged. PETA and human rights should be the whole thing. This is not a "counter culture", as Crispin has said at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, its use.
