When I watch the movies, I'd stay up and watch it or if I didn't like it, I'd go to bed, but it was a mess, I really got up and went out! Together, I hated it. Nor would they have taken Brendan Frasier away, he was much better. It wasn't as good as I had expected, given that I really liked George from Jungle 1, and the graphics were not as good as the first, such as the bird, and when he fell into the tree. I hope its director draws attention and the next movie he is doing has to think again ... terrible! I would like to give Urs to a well-done job because he made the film valuable (until I went out) ... generally I give this film two out of 10
