I like B-movies ... I know what B movies should represent. But it's just terrible. I'm surprised that he got such a decent overall score. The only redeeming qualities of this flick are (mostly) marginal sprays. Don't get me wrong, gore is rich in this flick - but few effects really come out of me (like the anal "probe" ... it was great!). <br /> <br /> I believe this movie was filmed on a camcorder. Have you rented at least Betacam, I have seen porn with better product value (and better performance). <br /> <br /> Acting - Sucking! But not Tromas or Full Moon. <br /> <br /> Story - Made! But that's what you get from such movies. Very loose! <br /> <br /> Sets and accessories - suck! My 16-year-old brother makes our house more difficult for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Copying and Dialing - Sucking! A terrible voice action (I shouldn't even call it) and every second word is "S ** t" or "F ** k". <br /> <br /> There are many good classic and class B horrors / splatter slips there and they are not that hard to follow. Do yourself a favor if you don't waste time on this mess!
