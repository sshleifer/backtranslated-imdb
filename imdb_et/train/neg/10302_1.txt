Since "Rugrats" fell into a mediocre and really terrible two years in the last three or four years, from the category of a series category, probably the Klasky-Csupo tyrants should give up their ideas. After dragging all the characters, adding new stupiders, replacing some voices (though I like Nancy Cartwright, she's not Chucky Finster!) And she has no sense of continuity (for example, in the Kimi episode I looked the other day, Tommy and Chucky got a new puppy, but the episode, above these dogs never appear), you think the creators could show grace. But don't say. <br /> <br /> Everything I say about this special place is that it sucks! Although not as terrible as Kimi's episodes, everyone is even a stupider when they were, including grandfather (my God! He was the best character of the show before, but he has no real purpose now). The ending is unnecessarily fluffy and the only thing that is different from this and other embarrassing new episodes ('98 -'01) is that children can communicate with adults. What a lot of fun! <br /> <br /> "Rugrats All Growed Up" does not mean any stars. Klasky-Csupo, please IMPORT this exhibition before it gets worse.
