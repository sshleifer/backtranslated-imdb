Blame the executive producer Wes Craven and donors Weinsteins for this big budget attack: "Dracula" thrash-metal upgrading with Bram Stoker's forced verbal stunning (who probably wouldn't want that name in this case) and anything else for us except the Slasher-style jolts and gore. Christopher Plummer sees the modern thing as the successor to Van Helsing, but the real thing - like Van Helsing. He keeps himself on the drum of Count Dracula, which has been thrown out of his karst after he has been stolen from the Van Helsinki deposit and New Orleans. That's just what New Orleans needs in the 21st century! A movie that is well-produced but without one original idea (except for multiple racial victims) is both reluctant and lazy, and after about an hour it will recur. * from ****
