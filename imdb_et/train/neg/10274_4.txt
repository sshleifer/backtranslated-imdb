In Texas, seven friends' bars meet to celebrate Halloween before going to the party. Meanwhile, they call the American Nightmare Pirate Radio fun and recognize their inner fear. The serum killer who listens to their confessions makes their nightmares true, killing each of them sadistically. "American Nightmare" is a weird low budget movie with a terrible start: without any explanation, a woman kills two pairs of isolated camping sites, as it would be on Friday, day 13. Then the story goes to a bar where seven friends celebrate Halloween. From that moment on, the story has great potential and the unknown pain has very reasonable performance, which also has some beautiful breasts and naked bodies, as is usually the case with this type of C production. The end of the scenario does not give any explanation for the instinct and motives of killing Jane Toppan, giving the feeling that the budget ended before the shooting was finished. With a better start and conclusion, this strange story would be a good low budget movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Agonia" ("Agony")
