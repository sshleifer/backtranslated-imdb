can't see it. it was one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. It's hard to be a Mormon, sometimes when there's such movies. what a sad view of the life of Mormon. I can tell you if you saw this movie, that it is not the same for all of the similar queens. if it were, I don't think I'd have done it. it's too bad that most of the Mormon movies are made from a group of geeks who have nothing better to do. acting was so bad that my wife and I hardly went through it. I think it could be said that he has all the B-movie characters. or are C movies? anyway ... i thought this film was sucked and filled with cheese. I want some Mormons to start producing high quality movies.
