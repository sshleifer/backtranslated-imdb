This movie was pretty bad. Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel, so I'm watching all the original movies. I really don't know if this movie can be called an original. Launching a zoo / theme park on a distant island sounds pretty familiar. What it was, oh yes, Jurassic Park. But this is instead Sabertooth tigers. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a stereotyped college child on an island that makes some treasure hunt. One of them comes to death with a rather terrifying death, some of the worst special effects I've seen. The blood seemed to be like ketchup. There is also a scientist who wants people to have as many teeth as possible. Three of them have already escaped and are going to eat tourists or people invited to the island to see the first hand of the tigers. Again sounds like Jurassic Park. Probably the coolest thing was the 1000-liter sword-tooth that climbed around its forelegs, killing a mad scientist's tooth shape that somehow shrinks and goes through the boys' neck. Funniest death I've seen on television. <br /> <br /> Actress is very exciting, special effects are terrible. CG tigers got away from the clay models and even some sounds were off. For example, if one of the college students tries to escape, he uses a break in the door, the ax goes into the door, and after about 2 seconds you hear the sound. This movie was pretty bad. But the deaths of the cheese were pretty funny.
