the film seemed like a film that was one of the specials of the school, only a lower budget and lower all else. I think it was supposed to be some kind of inspiring film, but it didn't work for me. because preachy.it has very bright tones of Flash dance, but what? There's no excitement in this movie. Dialogue is natural and deadly. acting was less than a star, although it has a lot to do with the actors (or not in this case) to work with it as a bad choice of songs, with really bad songs. all involved. they are all talented, but this movie can't be said. Of course this is my opinion, but I have to give Flying AKA Dream to believe 1/10
