I saw this movie a few months ago in a city that appeared in the movie Greendale, the only reason I saw it. The other local who was there was sending me an e-mail notification about repeated display because the first was sold out and people were turned away. His editorial comment on his front is a good summary: "Yuk." <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of Neil Young or live near Greenda (if you know the real name), skip this movie. This is usually the ego-trip of film mode. It has no noticeable plot, music is just OK, and too many lyrics are incomprehensible, making it impossible to see what small shrimp can be. <br /> <br /> I don't have to do a spoiler warning because I don't give surprises. <br /> <br /> I'd give it 1.5 / 10, but that's just the fun value to see in movies. It wasn't worth $ 6. I could rent a camcorder and drive around to "Greendale" and make a better movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a * good * environmental report, without a plot, go to rent Koyaanisqatsi.
