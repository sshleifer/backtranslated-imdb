I was surprised when I saw this movie. I heard it was the best film of the novel. How disappointed I was. <br /> <br /> What a real Jane Austen fan will appreciate is a mystery to me. The authors of the scenarios have decided to remain with ridiculous humor, which is embarrassing at the best times, but also destroys the hours of the period. As for cast: Gwyneth Paltrow makes a rather low hero (but then any "hot" American star would be questionable on this issue). /> I couldn't say anything good about this movie. It seems to me one of the few who doesn't appreciate it, but if you want my advice, look at Kate Beckinsale starring in television production - believe me, it's much better than this superficial trash.
