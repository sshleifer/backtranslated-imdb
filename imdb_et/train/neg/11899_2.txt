Robert Forster, usually a very strong character actor, has been lost at this sea as a family member of New York looking for revenge from the sons who murdered his son and attacked his wife's home. A scary theme used to fight "Death Wish" in the vein. In these relaxing procedures, it is not difficult to punish: the dialogue is full of strikers, crime statistics are irrevocably dated and supportive characters are ridiculously overwritten (especially a despicable judge who allows the accused murderer to walk straight out of the courtroom). Low rent production is despicable in its justice, especially since violence has only increased in our cities. * from ****
