This movie fails on every level. I have an idea, we'll take all the people involved in this movie and send them to the hot zone in the Middle East. Perhaps, if we are happy, they will all be shot and killed and we will never have to waste our time. Did I mention that I've never been so bitter about my life in a pile of cinema? My God, I don't think of anything I've ever seen. I'd rather look 25 times in a row at Ishtar than sit down for 10 minutes in this apology for apologizing. If I ever met someone who was involved in this film, I spit on my face and then beat them for nothing. That's my two cents.
