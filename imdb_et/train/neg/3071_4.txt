I found that the characters are mediocre and the story is interesting. I never considered this book (luckily) to read, or it would have been a painful experience. I got free tickets for the preview, but it was still not worth my time or my friend's. I don't think this story is worth it. It's like saying that old people have a past before old (funny). The lives of the main characters were painful to look at, one generation was no better than the next to avoid foolish mistakes. However, I think the actors did the best for the flat story. I've always been a great fan of Ellen Burstyn. I am writing this review against the positive reviews that unfortunately convinced me to try this movie.
