Let me start by saying that I am a great fantasy fan. But this movie is not for me. Many far-reaching arguments try to support the claim of the film that dragons have ever existed. The film mentions the links between different stories from different countries, but it is unable to explore them in more depth, which could have given the film credibility. The film uses (nice!) CGI to tell us about the fantasy story of a young dragon. It's combined with the popular TV show-CSI-style flash forward to look like something scientific, which is definitely not the case. In many cases, the arguments / hints are far removed. In some cases, dragons were used to show hints or flew, or the firing was simply invalid. To see this, I get cramped in my toes. Even the fantasy film needs some reality in it, but it doesn't have it. Bottom Line: This is a pretentious fantasy-CSI documentary that's not worth watching.
