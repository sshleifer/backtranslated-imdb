Fighting scenes play like a slow motion Jackie Chan and the spiritual events are pathetic (the worst red: "Guess what? This time I heard you were coming"). The stars are inappropriate for a couple: Brandon Lee, despite the terrible line he has to say, actually shows traces of charisma and screen charm - things that Dolph Lundgren is completely free of (at least in this movie). Note to the director: Please leave in the future any kind of love scenes, especially if the main actor does not nudge and you have to rely on the body twice. (* 1/2)
