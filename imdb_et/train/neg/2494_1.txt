What a joke. I look at it on Channel 1 and I think looking at color drying is much more fun. What happened to Caspar Van Dien, who got this spam. Terrible action, very boring plot and terrible direction. It's so terrible, it's funny. This requires it to be full of tension, but it is more comedy. If you want to see a terrible, ridiculous script writing and the right plot, check out this movie. If I were Van Dien, I would not only ask my 10% of my agent, but would burn the bastard of the process. What a turkey. It doesn't even fit MST 3K !! It would be a good movie to treat you with insomnia. Especially I love the part where Van Dien is thrown overboard and then comes down after just a few minutes! I can only imagine that it was written by unrelated writers who used the writer's strike. What a terrible movie !!!
