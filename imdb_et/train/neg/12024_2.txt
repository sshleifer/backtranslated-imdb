A rather embarrassing mess I have seen for a long time. The plot was full of irrelevance and the actor was the worst I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> To make it worse, camera shots were used that made me feel bad, random music was terrible, and drowned in dialogue (maybe not bad) and San Francisco images seemed to be stolen directly from the city tourist ad video . <br /> <br /> Oh, and the mandatory sex scene wasn't even halfway well. Please choose the right lighting next time.
