The last Tarzan movie starring Johnny Weissmuller (looking surprisingly outdated for "Tarzan and the hunter of a year") is bad, despite all the trivia that can be added to make it better. It is obvious that RKO tried to say goodbye to Weissmuller by photographing the beautiful landscape of Mexico City, its top star (Andrea Palma) and several award-winning operators Gabriel Figueroa, who made the prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkin. score. Although it may be cheaper to film overseas, it seems more expensive than any other RKO film in the series, taking advantage of Acapulco's beaches and real pyramids like Aquatania, and impressive interior design for all of Balu's temple-related scenes. Kurt Neumann should have taken the lead over Robert Florey, who will give him a very slow pace. Neumann had done a good job of "Tarzan and Amazon", "Tarzan and Leopard's wife" and "Tarzan and hunter" and ended his career in classical "The Fly" a year before his death; Florey became a TV director after a remarkable film career. When Weissmuller looks tired, the Chimp playing chimp is not as good as the others, but the worst character is Benji, an unpleasant postman who sings terrible songs (with Caribbean air at a place that should be Africa and shoot in Mexico!) Bored and undoubtedly tasty , it was sad to say goodbye to Weissmuller Tarzan.
