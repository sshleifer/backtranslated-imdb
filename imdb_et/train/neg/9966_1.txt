Although I never want to be a person who denies the personal taste of another; if you like something, it's good. But this movie was terrible and there is no way around it. I don't like Ani Difranco too much, but she's a great guitarist and songwriter. But I can't admit that this film has some redemption qualities. Many people think that this is the exact picture of the issues facing high school students. Maybe, but everything is depicted too far. It seems that "naked weapon" - esque type comedy has been caught, but timing is off; there is too much room between each participant as if they were laughing (there was nothing). Who wrote the script was all over. They tried to concentrate one film on so many controversial issues that almost never developed any of them (especially the girl who was taught by the teacher). I didn't laugh at all this movie. I was too offended by this sense of humor and satire to do something but rolled my eyes on the screen.
