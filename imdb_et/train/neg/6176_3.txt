I'm not a big fan of Stooges, but my history is interesting. I've recently tried to look out for every Stooge, but seeing Joe's shorts doesn't seem easy; this is the only one I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Some say that Joe's short pants are not really Joe's fault, and I suspect that is the case. Joe as a performer is not the worst of it. What most disturbs me is in the second comment: Beating other boys against a third violates the comedy-team / Stooges ethos. Maybe Joe's styles were perceived as responsible, because they didn't really match - though there were no real camera conflicts between him and others - and that was their way to work around it. <br /> <br And what's the short pants with this and some other Stooges? There is certainly a lack of creativity there; was this the thing the pants market caused or caused?
