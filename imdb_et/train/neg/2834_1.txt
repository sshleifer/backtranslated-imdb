I have now watched all four Bo Derek's vehicles led by his wife John; everything is, of course, very terrible, but it is definitely mines. A normal sparse plot, bad scripting? of course by the President? and acting, not to mention that he stares at the seemingly nasty nudity, he loses much of his older wife Anthony Quin (he admits suicide of his shotgun, saying he always admired Hemingway !!) but who still appears and talks to him. In fact, he wants to come back to another, younger body, but actually does it only in the last scene! Derek is cute as always and playing naive (!)? especially in the confused middle, which he hired by the killer in the spa. Here, too, Quinn is usually bigger in life (read: hammy), but it easily forms the lowest; besides, it works behind the shiny plastic for most of its duration (probably suggesting it has some discomfort)! His "replacement" is obviously a beautiful style with no talent or even personality. Also featured are Hollywood veterans Don Murray (Quinn's best friend and Bo business consultant) and Julie Newmar (Quinn's oversight in English)? plus the surprising fire of billionaire Donald Trump (who probably needed it on his resume)! It goes without saying that John Derek was his filmmaker that the final credits are full of useless (and brilliant) gratitude to many borrowed people and that GHOSTS cannot do it in the 1990 Razzie Awards!
