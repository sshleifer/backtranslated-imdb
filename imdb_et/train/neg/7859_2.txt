My God. This movie was terrible. I can't complain too much about it. I went to see that it just came out. That was enough. It is funny that the most disgusting part of the film was at the very beginning, where a woman is forced to give birth to a terribly mutated baby. <br /> <br /> I also think it's funny that the most remarkable actor in the movie was a Spanish soldier who was the next Friday supporting actor. Everyone made a terrible job in the film. It was some of the worst things I've ever seen. I also expected it to be much more terrible than the first one. It wasn't. I was expecting it to be more frightening because it is a sequel and the aftermath of horror films is usually much less successful than their predecessors. I was expecting it to be much tougher, because gore and violence usually sell a horror movie these days (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, Dead Silence), but it wasn't nearly as hard as the first, which was one more disappointment. <br /> <br /> The first mutants were annoying, but the filmmakers were trying hard to make them horrible that they were completely fun. <br /> <br /> I also hated the whole concept of a female soldier's son clip on a camera phone saying, "I love you, Mommy" FOUR TIME. It was foolish to show it first, because they just tried to make us feel worse for a vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers, and it was even more stupid to try to feel that he even felt TREATED three times without reason. This movie was a joke.
