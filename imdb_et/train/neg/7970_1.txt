Whether you want to spend nearly 2 hours of your life watching it depends on how you like your horror movies. If you like them to be fucking, they're hysterical, look out. Jigsaw is undoubtedly the worst film I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen "Long Time Dead"), and I say it as a fan of the low budget horror / gore genre and I've seen a good picture to compare it.

If you find it cheap to rent, be sure to check if you are involved - shame on you. : o) IMDb needs 0/10 sequences for this movie;
