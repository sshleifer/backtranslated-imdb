PLEASE TAKE MINUTE to read my full review. I HAVE AN EXPOSURE TO FILM - ONLY USING DVD FORMS. <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> I really wanted to give this movie even two stars. I mean, how could it be just 1 out of 10!?! <br /> <br /> Here's an epic film that adapts Tolstoy's novel "War and Peace" to the scene of a historically accurate battle, by the Red Army and extremely loyal; is what you saw. <br /> <br /> The problem is that you don't see this movie - somewhere I know. <br /> <br /> I try to see the RusCiCo DVD version - it is widely regarded as the best version because it is a letterbox and restores scenes from other DVD editions. <br /> <br /> But this is one of the worst movies I've ever put on DVDs. The picture is muddy and inconsistent, often strobing. This is almost acceptable when you reach the maximum level of your brightness, color and picture level .... but the problem does not end. <br /> <br /> Sound is also inconsistent, partly partially wrong, virtually unheard of in others. <br /> <br /> And as with languages, this is a huge problem for English speakers - there are some good actors in the duplicate selection and some really terrible individuals whose performance charts and parts of the movie aren't duplicated at all, slipping back into Russian and even French by chance. <br /> <br /> The selection of subtitles is not much better. Subtitles do not appear under the image, but to the right - hide some of the beauty (or left) in the landscape. Moreover, the subtitles are often a weak translation (it is a shame that the script barely takes Tolstoy's actual words so close) and the subtitles also appear partially out. <br /> <br /> So, even if you turn off the maximum color, brightness and picture settings, and you increase the volume and dubbed * and * in English, you still get a movie that is annoying to watch and listen. <br /> <br /> Can I overcome this content? Maybe it would have been possible, but seven hours, who can keep it that long? <br /> <br /> Maybe one day, someone will come to it and restore it - and maybe I'll see the masterpiece - but now, I just can't give more than one star of what I've only been able to about 12%.
