Unfortunately, realism is boring. This movie, I thought it would never end, would have been better if all the characters were dolled in the first five minutes. Where's Blade when you need him? While frustrating as COMBAT SHOCK, REQUIEM FOR DREAM and as horrible as BOISE MOI, DEAD CREATURES is almost as entertaining as any of the above dark films. Although free cannibalism could make wannabe Jeffery Dalmer a bit faster, it wasn't nearly as interesting as RAVENOUS. Really, I found it as interesting as late night and as exciting as a trip to the dentist. If you have strong masochistic qualities, it may not be the opposite of anyone else. I was really surprised that this was not done by the people of Brain Damage because it was the quality of dead creatures.
