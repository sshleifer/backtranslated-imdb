OH MY GOD. WORKING SH * IT'S THAT - this is the main idea that came in my mind right after watching the movie. And I really don't understand anyone with the opposite myth. Although perhaps the idea was good, but the effect was unhappy. In particular, the role of Graham means. What was it ??? In my opinion, it has destroyed all the positive intentions of producers. This character was played in an influential and annoying way. Every time he feels, he reminds you that you are watching a movie and destroying the spirit of the moment, then the whole movie, because the most time you see is his foolish faces with more foolish attempts to create emotions. TERRIBLE, don't waste your time.
