This joyful merging of New Age descent and gently bad film making may not "open" you, borrow one movie from your favorites, but it may leave jaws and your stomach laughing or retreating. According to James Redfield's most sold book, the first (by himself) published in 1993, this kitsch bible talks about the spiritual awakening of an American history teacher (Matthew Settle) who travels into deeper, darker, phoniest Peru and sniffs the air or anything else illegal. Namely, what he discovers is schlock Shangri La, who is populated by smiling zombies, who may be nuts or simply healable, perhaps because they are often accompanied by panpipe blooms and occasionally screaming from the sky. Although there has been much talk of "energy", the quality is clearly lacking in the pattern of numbers by Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow, all now firmly in the camp pantheon. For those who care, the plot includes military personnel, terrorists, and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni gave the wrong direction, while Mr Redfield, Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon are writing the script. In short, the worst film that can be seen in watching movies for 40 years.
