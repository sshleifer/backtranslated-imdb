Well, what can you say about Barbara's adaptation to Cartland? <br /> <br /> It has some amazing actors (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer), but they are clearly sums of money. <br /> <br /> Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland epic - Anthony with Hugh Grant (who looks inappropriately embarrassed) and Gilbert Helena with Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see the "observable" adaptation of Cartland, Bonham Carter is the one you need to go ("Heart Disease" - which title !!). Gilbert is a weak link in this, but Bonham Carter is nicely beautiful and of course he can actually act, and the rest plays with languages ​​that are firmly on the cheeks (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)
