At first, the story is interesting: slavery (late) in the 20th century from West Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem is that he deliberately directs two directors Richard Fleisher's favorite enemies: Arabs and Germans. In order to believe that very Arab men can travel freely and catch easily, in West Africa, black people are as incredible as "roots" with slaves. Obviously, both transactions are run by local residents and involve more complex networks. Arab countries are accomplices in the slave trade of today's children and sex, but Israel is one of the worst offenders, according to Amnesty International. Why only draw attention to the Arabs and then choose the only European buyer of German? The Jewish director is an obvious bias and hatred of these people. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is above average, especially with Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr Linderby) is always good.
