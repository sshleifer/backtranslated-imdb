This movie is a terrible distortion of lies and exaggeration that has been put together by the most disgraceful redeemers to ever work in a TV movie. The story is wrong and complete wrong. There is nothing in this film that would accurately depict Senator McCarthy. It's just a horrible scam and it amazes me that anyone involved in this production got another job in the industry. The Marxist-Leninists, who wrote this trash, did it to attack a man who has received history and their fear that someone would dare to destroy Communism. Unfortunately, these communist nuts were taken over by Ronald Reagan, where McCarthy left and they could not stop him, thus ending the Soviet Union and its cohorts. <br /> <br /> Never, watch this movie if you are looking for the truth about Senator McCarthy. Learn about Ann Coulter's "Treason" book for a better view of McCarthy so far. <br /> <br /> It also helps you read about what happened to Senator McCarthy by reading http: // www. thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
