The Evil breed is a very strange slip that is unfortunately not good. The beginning of the film seems to be promising, but in general it is a disaster. The dialogue is pretty bad, but not as bad as the actor. Operation is cruel and intolerable. Characters offer terrible features, and even if it is useful, this method doesn't work because characters are annoying. Some killers are innovative, but they took too long. we get the first death (except at the beginning) and then almost every other character smokes in the next five minutes. Video then became kind of foolish with ridiculous characters, unrealistic karate like fights and a scene where a man gets his guts pulled out * sscrack.None it's funny it's just ridiculous. The film becomes ultra gory and ultra meaningless. Most characters have clich√© even slasher standards and are as strong as, but ter left counter for 5 days. Evil Breed is not even ridiculously bad, so it won't fail it main task. Watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Just Before Dawn, or Watch No Evil for the actual slasher.
