Maybe there was no DVD menu option for PLOT: ON OFF. It is clear that the default is off. When the final credits started to roll, I couldn't believe it. Like our poor but beautiful protagonists, I felt I was using, dirty, cheap .... <br /> <br /> The characters were drawn with a very wide impact and the writer's contempt for the wealthy Thatchers was all visible. I consider myself a "Roosevelt Democrat" but I would appreciate a bit thinner. <br /> <br /> Of course, the problem may be with me. I see many others seem to have some meaning or message in this picture. Unfortunately, not. <br /> <br /> The only thing that continued to give me "1" was a nice landscape, a human being and a plant.
