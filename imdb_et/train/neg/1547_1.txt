I can name a lot of funny movies. There are comedies that are funny and are. Some movies, such as Gymkata, are trying to be serious but fun. Ladies Man is a film that desperately tries to be funny, but may not be less fun than it was about a boy who got a lot of chicks in the middle of the wreckage of a nuclear block. It's anti-funny. <br /> <br /> I don't think I laughed harder than this movie. It's just weird. It's boring, stupid, ugly, annoying, desperate bad, but not funny. I am not particularly interested in Tim Meadows or the nature of SNL, but I was expecting this better. <br /> <br /> The film lacks logic or common sense. It's like a script writer had a bag over his head while writing a bag and he couldn't see what keys he hit. They talk about the "origins" of Ladies Man, but do not contain the motivation to act against her strange charm, as it is still seventies. The film tries to bring humor out of a man who seems to be comfortable with porn right after he tried to hang himself. This is comedy? I like to consider myself a rather keen sense of humor (spending a lot of time writing comedy), but maybe I'm not bright enough for this movie. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans, as funny as Tucker is about Mary, is terribly bad here. I asked my head to stick. <br /> <br /> Finally, I was despised in my chair, squeezing my breath, and if the film went on, it would probably have been suicide. This movie may not be as bad as Battlefield Earth, but it is the first movie I've seen to be close by. <br /> <br />
