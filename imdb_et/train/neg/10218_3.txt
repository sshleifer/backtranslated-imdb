** Spoilers included ** <br /> <br /> I heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending was particularly terrible. What I did not expect was a complete change of about twenty minutes to go. A typical cowboy / indian western coast begins to fall sharply on a very boring romantic "comedy" of Honus (Peter Strauss's title soldier Blue) and Cresta (Candice Bergen), fleeing from the Cheyenne cavalry attack. Most of the film then focuses on these two inappropriate people, so romantic comedy. Donald Pleasance then rises and robs them both for no apparent reason. Then they flee and both turn to the (separate) cavalry base on the eve of the Cheyenne base attack. When Cresta used to be one of Cheyenne's leaders, he escapes and joins the cavalry base. So far as usual. Then comes the end. After they last for an hour for badly acting clich√©s, they don't get together, the film then turns into an upper exploitation, including decapitation and the child's head-off. Similarities can be drawn with a wild bunch of movies at this point, but the wild bunch retained the same tone and did not use extreme free violence. Sometimes Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry's last summer, which also changed the end of the shock. I didn't hate Soldier Blue and didn't find the end to be particularly troublesome, but I just found it to be a pretty boring and unnecessarily violent ending. If you want to see a movie where the killing of the innocent is really disturbing, I would recommend Elem Klimov Come and See.
