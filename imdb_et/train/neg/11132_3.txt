A documentary, like any filmmaker, must convey a convincing story. Does Pascoe fail in this quest, hacking some of Chomsky's wisdom cuts by visiting Hamilton's McMaster University. Video clips are recorded amateurly and on video. Pascoe's only effort to unite the fragments is regularly throwing a vague title on the screen: "9-11", "activism", "truth". <br /> <br /> Lame. Compare this documentary with "The Corporation" or "The War of War" that create narrative drawing material from interviews, film footage, and filmed footage. Ultimately, everyone gives a desperate and understandable message that is deliberately and intelligently. <br /> <br /> The only movie-saving prizes are Chomsky's historic dogma disruptions and the fact that driving time is only 74 minutes. One of the most interesting parts was Chomsky's record of his national radio experience. He describes the conservative media as opposing views, while the liberal dogma of NPR hinders the interviewees and dramatically restricts his promised messages. Another media outlet is skeptical. <br /> <br /> This documentary is only for Noam Chomsky graduates.
