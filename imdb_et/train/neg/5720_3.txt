Some gorehound friends suggested "Live Feed" for me, and basically I can't really complain, because the movie definitely gives a lot of gross and buckets full of slease, but this is not a very good movie. More than the obviously astonishing trend of the ultimate astonishing cinema, the so-called torture porn, Ryan Nicholson tries to cross all the other films in this sub-class (and includes the role models "Hostel" and "Saw") of his sick and twisted make-up effects and thoroughly naked naked co-authors, tried and lived their lives. There is no real plot to describe. Twenty-five friends in Asia five times totally pointless. One of them has Asian roots, but not because I really don't know why they decided to travel there instead of Cancun. They are obviously not interested in continental culture and even cause a passionate scene when they know the local meat shop in the market. The quintet then dives into a gentle nightlife, and one of them accidentally puts the offender on the line. Just apologizing is not enough, because the gangster follows them in the adult theater and is gradually subjected to torture. One girl has silenced her breast and another bad tail is a poisonous snake pushed under her throat; yikes. "Live Feed" is surprisingly boring, despite all the bloodshed and amateur production values ​​it is quite difficult to forget, even if you are used to seeing such an independent fan-boy in the trash. The fat tree on the cover, the oriental S & M actress, is quite cool and he is the most talented of the whole horse as he keeps his mouth closed all the time. I would not recommend this dirty ball, but hey, if you like hard and outrageous metamorphosis, tortured torture and dull losers, go straight ahead and see!
