I read the comments that this is China's best film. Perhaps, if the only Chinese films that have been seen did not include dialogue, long-drawn-out foam and silence, and hacking editing, then you are on the ground. <br /> <br /> A complex story? Hardly. Try minors and amateurs. Fine moods and haunting memories? Hardly. Try bored and boring. <br /> <br /> It was terrible. I couldn't wait until it ended. Especially when the best lines of the movie consist of "How are you? I'm fine. Are you sure? Yes." Wow! What a character. I think the constant cigarette smoking had to talk about them. <br /> <br /> Like a big fan of big Chinese, Japanese, and Korean films, I was disappointed with it. Even Zhang's "Road Home", which sentimentally blessed, was better than that.
