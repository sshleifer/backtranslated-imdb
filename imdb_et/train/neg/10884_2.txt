In fact, these young people were so unpleasant that I couldn't wait to kill everyone killed, and that included Clarissa (Joanna Canton) because I thought she was the most annoying in the cluster. <br /> <br /> But I knew it was going to get confused with the opening process when Christine opened the girl and the nuns playing Leslie Gore in the background. Even though the dentures saw the fake and "blood" seemed suspiciously like a Hawaii punch, though later he took a red-day-glo look to match those foolish Halloween makeups were all wearing. I'm sure all the GOTH mores will appreciate this bull because it turns to this bunch. It certainly didn't like me. Blah ... <br /> <br /> And not even my favorite horror babe, Adrienne Barbeau, will not save this stupid teen horror flick herself. She still looks hot. I'm glad she's taking care of herself because we can't see her too much today. <br /> <br /> But this is a step forward for Dante Tomasell's nervous HORROR (2002), because it is a somewhat uniform plot, so I'll give it so much. This and a little Boston Terrier, named Boozer, will bring it out. I like what Boozer does to Clarissa. It was the only good scene in a otherwise silly movie. <br /> <br /> Lion Gate Movies must be desperate when they pick it up. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
