This film was on the novel's channel and I thought it could be an amazing 80-year-old movie that would be enjoyable on some level, so my brother and I watched it. Boy wondered. The boy gets the girl's correction, her * dream * girl (probably the difference, and I'm surprised she realized she was her dream girl - she was beaten with her over 30 meters away. I think it's just going to show the power of dream girls ), the boy arrives to disguise the woman to be a dream-girl (creative in the sense that it is a far-reaching plan, but un-creative in the sense that there are probably better solutions that could be thought), inconvenient situations, the answer (all it seems to be happening in the late afternoon - whether the location was somehow responsible for this bizarre lighting, or if the participants had to wait until they came out of their day-to-day jobs to come out, suspect the latter). Very clumsy, very pathetic. It's almost never even fun * random *, so there's nothing to redeem. If you don't want to see Chad Lowe's earlier days before he finally got his piece of pie with his role as a HIV-positive gay guy in the series "Life Goes On" or Gail O'Grady, who was in NYPD Blue and probably came to Dennis Franz's buttocks watch. But these are unlikely motives - I would say that "a systematic deviation of the senses" would be a legitimate goal. I'm surprised to see it all. I think it's such a thing that you see yourself halfway through * because of a sick, self-flagged internal problem, and you think you can stop it so you can tell your friends and family that you've actually sat through such a dreadful movie, accidentally, that gives you some sympathy for the questioning of your mental health. Can you challenge?
