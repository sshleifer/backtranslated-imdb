Some comparisons have been made with this film and The The Last Detail, but Chasers is more fragrant than the Interstate Road West in Texas. And like landscapes in the desert, there is nothing to distinguish, not even the fact that two naval escorts transport a female prisoner. No one casts out too well; with this flat script that is not surprising. Dennis Hopper, director, does not give much space to it if he ever writes a memoir, I don't think so.
