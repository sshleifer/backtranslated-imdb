I have recently worked in the Lugos collection and I was just a few days ago burnt in a combination of Lugos and Boris Karloff in The Black Cat. "Raven". Alas, it just didn't work for me and at the end of the movie I was quite disappointed. <br /> <br /> During the first three quarters of this movie, I thought the story was not a real relationship. Lugosi did a good job of keeping things together somewhat mad Vollins, a surgical gene that falls in love with a young woman (Irene Ware) whom she treats after a car accident, but who doesn't get her - partly because she is already busy and partly because his father (Samuel S. Hinds) disagrees. To deal with this situation, he supports Edmond Bateman (Boris Karloff) - a terribly ugly man who wants Vollins to be more acceptable to him. However, besides the results of Lugos I found little interest in maintaining my interests. Then suddenly, in the last fifteen minutes, the film is moving completely. Suddenly, it becomes quite tense, but I thought that Lugosi's performance was broken, largely because the film tried to make him mad - and there are differences. He plays the "mad" role very well controlled and controlled, but bad. "Insane" is more out of control and I didn't think Lugosi was doing it well. At one point, he offers some manic laughter that is simply fake. Meanwhile, Karloff was a huge disappointment. He didn't grab me at all. After leaving, he has to be lulled at Lugos, that - in the movie they are celebrating - Karloff gets the highest billing, although "The Raven" is clearly Lugosi, the leading player. Surely, this is a hint of how Universal has added its two big scary characters - inexplicably - because I've always thought that Lugosi is the best of the two. <br /> <br /> In any case, Edgar Allen Poe's story "Raven" has nothing to do with it - except that Vollins is a fan of Poe, who is trying to restore some of the torture methods from Northwest of Poe. Generally disappointing. 4/10.
