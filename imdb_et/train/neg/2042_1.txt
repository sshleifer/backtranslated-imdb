Zodiac Killer. 1 out of 10 Not really the worst. David Hess (the last house on the left? There is no seventies ??? Rent it really good) is the worst horse (pretty tough competition, but he's amazingly divine-terrible). you will find a home user with such inconvenient camera presence. The film really pulls the stunning painful stops during the screen. <br /> <br /> Not that the film has redemptive qualities for Mr. Hess. It's filmed with a home video camera and beautiful things that are pretty old, with the added boom. There is no mail production. Come there to have some shovelware that a five year old computer could use to clean this image. Throw some strange imagery into the kind and start-up games of the aircraft carrier and this is one visually screwed picture. The images of Autopsia are interplayed in the way that Italian cannibal films interfere with these godly killings of real life. And the Navy's footage should be an anti-war statement (because we know that all bloody maniac have joined the Navy). What in the world is the Lion Gate to release this garbage? That's Torture Troma. The plot is about the Zodiac Killer (Last seen by Dirty Harry? Not one since 1970.? Rent it really good) Anyone can be shot in the stomach of LA and police assume Zodiac Killer is back? Uh ah. What can you expect from a movie that does not know that DSM IV is a book that is not a psychiatric disorder and where a younger killer older man relationship is similar to a congressional page and congress? Yes, according to the discounts and product values ​​of the eighties, Nambla is a sub-block. Write me a letter.
