it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I'm still not sure if it was serious or just satire. One of those films that uses every fool who can think. Arrrgh. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson was really good at that. But otherwise she was sucked. It was over a decade ago when I saw it, but it still hurts and doesn't stop in my brain. <br /> <br /> The last line of the movie is about how stupid it is. I won't destroy it for you if you want to watch this movie. But I guarantee you * nghya * a moment with little. If you have nothing better to do and you want to meet and laugh, maybe it may be worth it for you. In addition, if you are forced to go with someone you really don't like, suggest that you watch this movie together and leave you alone after that. That's the fair price I think.
