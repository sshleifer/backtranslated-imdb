I was watching this movie last night and I was a little disappointed. Many "time facts" were off. At the beginning of the film, Grandfather made a comment to his grandchild and his friends about how they felt when they were 9-11. This film was supposed to take place in 1994. One of the grandchildren's friends also suffered the Eagles Donovan McNabbi jersey. He was not yet prepared. The story was good, but the schedule facts and reality were so far from the base that this movie felt to be cheesy. My boyfriend is an avid reader of World War II books and memorials. I rented this movie, hoping it would be good. It was so. The dog was cute. But the way this film was performed gave me the pleasure of paying only $ 4 compared to the 50 I would have seen in the theater. I hope that anyone who ever reads it will understand that I do not want to be dissatisfied with those who fought against the war, but the facts and schedule should have been followed more carefully.
