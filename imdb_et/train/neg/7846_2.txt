You know, I went to see the "mountains have eyes 2" that want to like it. I really enjoyed the original and the remake was quite fun. They obviously had more money to throw away when Wes Craven made special effects for the second time. Although I still prefer the original text, the remake went well, and it was an innocent pleasure for me. Bloody, intense and great special effect. In short, a great popcorn movie for every spooky fan. <br /> <br /> What brings us to the "mountains is eyes 2". The man where I start? Because of the plot or lack of it, the paper is thin. We don't fill a new base here. The military has decided to follow the area and there are no such people. What are we doing now? Let's go to the national guard. In a true Hollywood way, we have to make them the most stupid and worst-seen soldier. Gee, I've never seen this assumption before. To summarize a long story, you have to kill the mutants one by one graphically. Once again, the special effects of Nicotero are great, but it kills whatever the graphic is boring and predictable. Honestly it seemed to me that this flick was made just to grab a fast doll. It was bloody and graphic, but I found it to be predictable, boring and not scary. For me, it would have been nice if this film contained one original way of thinking.
