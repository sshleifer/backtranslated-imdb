This is not the best movie ever made, but that's fun. The plot is flat, but the killings are not too bad. I have to be honest if you don't follow the ensembles in this movie, you won't find that movie as funny as those who do it. I knew someone who saw this film and was very disappointed by the poor quality of the movie, but you have to realize that it was done on a free time tour, playing backstage with the kids and drinking with friends. .. not done seriously. It is a ubber hair in punk and with more than 100 kills, most of which are extremely large, it's a fun movie with friends to watch, drink and enjoy!
