This tiring, brilliant Las Vegas casino hunt film is almost impossible to watch and attend. This is something you look at if you have nothing better to do. The only two decent things in this film are both related to the excellent Stella Stevens, and one spends the entire program hoping that he will drop out of one of those nervous cups he carries. Many superb shots from the mid-70s in Las Vegas (where it was still a cool place to visit) and day fashion are also good for strangling. Otherwise, one big awake. The Rhino DVD has a very good widescreen, but even under 10 bucks it's not worth it in my humble opinion.
