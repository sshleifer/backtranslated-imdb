Gung Ho was a good idea, but it's a lot to ask American viewers to understand the dynamics of American jobs and foreign competition. In this film, Japan's main player Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) goes on to convince the Japanese car company to come to America and help his dying Pennslyvania town. There will be two things for you. First, why should a Japanese company make cars to America when they do, and so well? Secondly, does anyone realize that all kinds of American companies go to third countries in the world to get their products out of American labor costs? This makes the film a premise that the world's first car maker will go to one of its best competitors (in addition to Germany) and make this plant unrealistic. Keaton was still in her comedy mode. But he gives a reliable result just as he can prove he can play a comedy drama in a matter of seconds, but still does not bother, but director Ron Howard is not able to become this TV movie anyway, because they have to give the unlikely story of Japan and America relations and problems that are not lasting. Gung Hoil is happy days and Laverne and Shirley feel that the producers of both TV shows made the film and made a TV version of the film that gives the film a light feel. American workers and feel that he and other Japanese people can learn Americans. This No.2 man Saito, who allegedly dislikes Americans, not all think so. I would have preferred all Japanese signs to be like Saito as soft goofball they would have made in Japan out. This would make the film more interesting.
