After a cave in a cave in a cave, a doctor named John Beck passes the accelerating transformation into a human bat. His wife assures him that there is nothing wrong with him, just because of rabies or anti-rabies drugs. The local policeman thinks John is responsible for several dreadful assassinations. Jerry Jameson's "Bat People" is one of the most horrible movie hell. The script is deadly boring and not gore or nudity. so nonsensical that you have to scratch your head out of all the disbelief after you suffer it. The creature design of the young Stan Winston human bat is totally pathetic and unememable.Avoid this stink like a plague from 2 to 10.
