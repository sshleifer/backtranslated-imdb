The eight Jean Rollin films I watched are also the most weird ones; The intriguing plot (as it is) seems initially too weak to maintain even its trim for 84 minutes, but it's somehow glowing to get confused when it goes! A potential female vampire (as per the title allowed) is held in captivity in a distant church and appears only on the blood of victims who are "victims" (who are probably members of the suicide club). sure where all this was led by the writer-director is finally human evil? actually an empty-face hero kinky father? ridiculously the future mutant (?!)! The odd tempo and the dreamy atmosphere (cultures to hide the features of a shady girl and the masks of animals) are, of course, characteristic of the filmmaker (at the bottom of the seabed) as well as the Euro-Cult style, as well as the nubile beauties on display. Personally, Bernard Musson (who appeared in Luis Bunuel's films for the last six days) was occasionally the most enjoyable thing to look at visually attractive but intellectually inadequate.
