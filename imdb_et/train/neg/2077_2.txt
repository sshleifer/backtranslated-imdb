It was necessary to apologize for leaving the house when drying out - left the film back and watch the paint dry. <br /> <br /> I never remember going to the movie before, but I really tried to stay. The script was not cast but just "going and going" bad - come on! Uma Thurman does this stuff? Quite effects are special. These were the older characters and actors who lived in a superficially horizontal 20-something alive - a tedious and false feeling. <br /> <br /> This review is only based on the first hour - it may be better. I just had to go home and see if the color dried the darker shade than it went.
