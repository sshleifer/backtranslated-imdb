Tashan - The title itself explains the nature of the film. <br /> <br /> This type of movie is actually made for the flop. What a shame that Yash Raj Films produces such movies is worthless as C-Class movies. Or even some C-Class movies have a better and more enjoyable story than Tashan. A lot of hyped and redundant self-proclaimed Tashan was bombarded with a box that it certainly deserved. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the worst film ever made on the honor of Yash Raj Films. How did they go to such a difficult project for the new Vijay Krishna Acharya, who has no real sense of impetus? He tried to mimic Sanjay Gadhvi's ways of loving Dhoom, but he eventually suffered. Action scenes are more than comics or cartoons that have been made to exhaust the audience. <br /> <br /> The story also loses its meaning and the substances that win the hearts of the audience gently. In most scenes, Anil Kapoor reminds me of the southern region of Tamil Rajnikant in her body language and literally. I am not a fan of Saifi or Akshay, but the Kareena Prize should have gone to Saifi's hands instead of Akshay. It was from this point of departure that I was waiting for, but ultimately I didn't want to climb the truth. Saif is the main adventure behind the adventure, while Akshay joins. In every film, the finals should be judged by the characters and prizes of the whole story, or to say that the reward should be given to the one who deserves credit. And Tashan loses this way and could not hit it unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in Akshay here to show comedy talent here, but still reminds you of your previous movies. She needs to seriously develop a new image for her fans that will impress them again and again. Between Saifi, Rassis was a great job, and now she's back in the wild with her movie. But he has been in the field of action. And last but not least, about Kareena. She looks really hot in a bikini dress, some complaining when she got too lean. But I don't believe it, but she got thin. Yes slim !!! this is a good factor for a woman who attracts larger people (or says a man). Beside them, it is nice that Saifi's son Ibrahim appears at the beginning and Saifina is the last one young. I hope he is now moving on to his career goal. <br /> <br /> Those who love this Tashan are either mentally immature or still want to return to their childhood or say they want to. in the shelter. Thumbs down debut director Vijay Krishna Acharya, who failed the project proposed by Yash Raj Films. In the future, he should test and study the script at least 5 years before going into practical directions. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I don't like to evaluate good stars for this type of junk.
