This movie is a farce! The names are seriously misinterpreted and the plot is twisted and mixed with any literary enthusiast. And they have a gall to give Beowulf a ridiculous cannon / cross-sectional weapon. Beowulf doesn't need such a weapon! In the poem he hangs Grendel's hand with his bare hands! And I can't believe the scriptwriters did it. However, the way Grendel is portrayed is impressive. This and the cast is the only positive point of this object. My English teacher goes crazy when he saw this abomination. If you are not a fan of the epic poem "Beowulf", avoid this movie at all costs. And even then I wouldn't recommend it.
