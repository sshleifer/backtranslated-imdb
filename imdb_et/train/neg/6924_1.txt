If this film was worse, it would have been led by Uwe Boll. This pointless confusion makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It has been a while since I've seen this steaming pile, but I remember that I wanted to make serious damage to all involved. How can anyone give this movie more than 1 star, amazes me with the mercy of all those who watched this view. I give him one star because the rating is not lower. All copies of this film should be burned with salt-sown soil and reserved for the most toxic waste in the landfill. No, one copy should be kept under ultra hi security and should only be shown to filmmakers not to do so.
