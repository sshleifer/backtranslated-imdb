"The Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "The Bank" was one of Charlie's 1915 Essanay films. Although these film groups are more observable than their 1914 colleagues, it seems a little below average. A horse with a janitor with a double-locked vault and a hard luck ending up with Charlie waking up from a dream where she looks like the hair of a leading woman, but that she's wrapping up the mop head she'd used in the pillows is both classic Chaplin moments. They are both ironically the beginning and the end. In the midst of a fight with a rival caretaker, a bank robbery is broken to win a girl. The mop is probably the greatest physical proportion of this film and Charlie uses it for professional impact, be it the purpose of his character or not. The mop seems to be Charlie alter-ego, doing things he wants, but not with his two hands. Interesting things, but better.
