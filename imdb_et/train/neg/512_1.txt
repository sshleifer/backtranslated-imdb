It seems to me that some of the films banned during the cinema were really very important and very good films. I would like to argue that instead of banning challenging and controversial films, censors should consider banning such bad films that they endanger your IQ and your peace of mind. If they did, one of the first hiding films would be "Stroker Ace". This movie is terrible with the capital A. It is the worst film Burt Reynolds with whom he played in his CV "Cannonball Run II", "Cop And A Half" and "Rent-A-Cop". <br /> The waxy story introduces us to successful car racing drivers, the Stroker Ace (Reynolds), who loves fast cars and fast women. He remains in a humiliating contract with Clyde Torkle (Ned Beatty). The agreement requires that he do some humiliating advertising for a new fast food restaurant chain, such as a giant chicken. Lugs (Jim Nabors), Ace's dusky palm, and Pembrook Feeney (Loni Anderson), a bimbo with a brain smaller than an ace, are in the mix. <br /> <br /> Hal The head of this low-grade garbage, Needham, used to be a stuntman and made a number of films based on his knowledge of stunts and cars / races. Some of these films were OK, such as "Hooper" and "Stunts Unlimited", but with "Stroker Ace" he gets down to his career. The characters are so stupid that you really know these players. In particular, Anderson is exhausted by such a foolish role that it makes you grind to the teeth of despair. Humor is weak and infantile, and tricks and sequences of races are remarkable. Even at the time of the closing credit (which is found in all Reynolds-Needham co-operation), it is generally uncomfortable, which gives the impression that the film may not be very fun. "Stroker Ace" is a significant sized heaser.
