Don't waste your time looking at it! If you don't want to study all this, you shouldn't make a good movie. I don't usually want to review a movie, but it's personal. I wasted valuable time that they can't give back. I feel compelled to write this report to warn others that they will not waste their time watching this mess. If this were a student project, I have to say that it is not bad, but only in the first 15 minutes ... after that it gets annoying. shouting, bad sound, bad video (a good camera man could have made it much better). and yes, what is the Blair-Witch effect? no budget? I was hoping it would get better, but that's not. Now, how the hell deserves it 4? 2 is fairer, but 1 is a waste of time! I said my peace.
