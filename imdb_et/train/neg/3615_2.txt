How have I ever seen or even heard about this junk? This is my alley's bloody duck, a ridiculous drawing and an irresistible 80's cheese atmosphere. For some reason, nobody is really interested, the elite Catholic University staff and students are busy with an unknown psychopath. A freshly recruited teacher, Julie Parker, will attend when all the people she has come across, die or behave strangely. This movie is funny bad! There is no logic or coherence, and every sign is just as meaningless for others. For example, a girl is killed and her body is destroyed in a container. Then and for some reason, the story suddenly goes on for three weeks, but the murdered girl has never been mentioned or even disappeared. Not even her boyfriend! Action is pathetic and there is not even a little nudity to enjoy. The killer's revelation is quite funny because the makers really felt convinced that it was the original twist ... It's not, boys! "Splatter University" is one of the worst horror turkeys.
