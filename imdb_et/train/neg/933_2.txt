Undeveloped / incredible story, (until I thought where it goes, I don't care anymore) bad casting (come ... William Macy as a hit man ???) bad leadership, (have you ever seen Tracey Ullman (so I had to take care of what happened to the unethical incompetent, insecure John Ritter character?) bad script ... (Really, I'm not looking for a formula script, but it was really awful) The only really good thing about it was boy. Ten rows? Isn't it OK if your comment is less than ten lines? COME - whose rules are these? Why can't I say what I have to say in less than 10 rows? Isn't that arbitrary? Why isn't OK less than 10 lines of comments?
