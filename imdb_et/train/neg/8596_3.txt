Basically, this is a bright shadow in High Fidelity, a witty and wonderfully acting film with several truly winning characters. Detective viewing is nothing like that. <br /> <br /> The video shop's geek assumption that a peculiar mysterious woman pulls out of her feet is good, but has not been fully or sufficiently researched due to a very weak script and manager failure, not to mention the lack of actual visual story style. This movie is focused on MOVIES, but it is incredibly cunning! This is the main failure right there. <br /> <br /> But the main problem is that we just don't care about the main characters because the script and the actors (Murphy and Liu) are unable to make them real or compassionate in a real way. So the movie just turns into a series of episodes involving two people who look good, not very interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, another thing: for romantic comedy? That's not funny. And romance is also not very romantic. <br /> <br /> So avoid this. Even with this 90-minute running time, it's just not worth it ...
