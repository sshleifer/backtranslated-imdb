Just a horror movie with a nice suburban family that deals with the deaths of their parents and the basement they hold on the people who take them out of the street. Of course there is more to say, but more to say. <br /> <br /> For me, it just didn't come together because it catches it in two ways, both in family drama and as a horror film. The film is trying hard to walk between the two genres, but it seems to be in the whole place because it is trying to be shocking, something it never has. It doesn't help that the final revelation is less scary, then "oh" like "Oh is that?". Perhaps, if I hadn't seen so many horror films recently, it might have been better or it just seemed because I wouldn't compare it so much. <br /> <br /> I'd take over
