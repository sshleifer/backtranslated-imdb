This is not the sound of bees, it is the effect of this extremely long, very boring, badly acting film. How did I get it in all 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep? The plot is simple ... 3 thoroughly unlikely morals talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours. And you thought Rohmer was deadly. This is even worse than possible. > I really have to be a Masoch if I can watch this whole movie without turning it off ... or killing someone.
