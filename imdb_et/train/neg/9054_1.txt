If you hate redneck accents, you hate this movie. And to make it worse, you see Patrick Swayze, who has tried to be red. I really can't emphasize the accents. I like Billy Bob Thornton, he was good at Slingblade, but he was annoying in this movie. And what is Lonnie Earl? How much movie does this movie receive? The story was stupid. I'm not usually decisive about movies, but I couldn't endure that movie. If you want a good Billy Bob Thornton movie, check out Slingblade. <br /> <br /> My mother found this movie for $ 5.95 in Wal Marti ... figures ... I think I'll pack it up and give her my grandmother a Christmas. It may just be that I can't accentuate the accents I usually accept, or I can't stand Patrick Swayzet. Maybe if Patrick Swayze didn't. I never laughed in the movie. I usually laugh at something stupid. If they had shown a break in someone's fingers, I would have laughed. people's fingers are always randomly laughing at me.
