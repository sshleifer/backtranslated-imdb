Another great conspiracy film that attempts to blame the US government and armed forces (especially armies) for every disaster that has occurred as a result of a major accident. Anyone who has ever been in the US military will see how this movie is fake. Forms, equipment, kits, and manners are all wrong. (And, of course, all senior officials are corrupt criminals or idiots.) Dirty propaganda that does not seek objectivity. Most of the theories presented have been ignored in recent years. Used by every clich√©, rumor, and Gulf city innovations - everything is presented as a gospel. (The truth is, nobody knows for sure why some GW veterinarians are sick and others are horses healthy.) PS It's not new. The war is not fun and I know Veterinarians of World War II, Korea and Vietnam, who also have serious health problems. (And the government is responsible for taking care of all of them.) Such sensational movies don't solve the problem!
