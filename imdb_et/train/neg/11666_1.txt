As gently as possible, I sincerely believe that this film is a waste of time. I didn't find this "warm, emotionally satisfying" movie that others did. I found it to be boring about the music that pulled away from the movie. The story was thin, the characters were overrun and the direction to the pedestrian. <br /> <br /> Fooey. <br /> <br /> Now I'm still writing about this movie, so I'll do a minimum of 10. There's really nothing more to say and brevity is important, but IMDb has its own minimum, so here it goes. <br /> <br /> A young zealous child finds an emerging talent, looking for time with aging, a troubled mentor despite his father's multimedia homophobia. Aging, a nervous mentor provides a lot of drink and teaches very little. there is a conflict. Although I don't think it's a spoiler, I've added a warning if someone knows a lot of information too much. <br /> <br /> Mostly I found the movie boring and terrible. A waste of my time. I do not understand honestly what seems to me to be the transcendental quality of this film. I think it's really worth it. But as Dennis Miller said earlier, "Maybe I'm wrong."
