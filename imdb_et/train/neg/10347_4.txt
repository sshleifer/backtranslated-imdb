I saw Adam for the first time with four sons and the one that hit me was that I believe the model used was Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons. They were about the same age as four movies. Warner Baxter told Adam Stoddard about the same values ​​and family traditions that you would have heard from our 26th President without the more serious aspects of TR's character. <br /> <br /> Like the TR, all of Stoddard's sons serve in World War I, but in this case the youngest loses only the eye, not killing the eye. But what if a female minx gets into this male household and upsets things? This is Susan Hayward's work here. In one of his early prominent roles, Hayward is a flirtatious immoral girl who marries one son, communicates with another and starts the third game. This is the early predecessor of such a part that later brought him into the Oscar I want to live. <br /> <br /> I think that with the same powerful decoration model as Theodore Roosevelt and Warner Baxter depicts everyone, the Father is afraid to say what is happening. Sons and their ruler Ingrid Bergman. Here's where the plot becomes a little stupid. Bergman will be introduced to us as a governor of Baxter and his wife Fay Wray. Wray dies and Baxter carries some financial reversal in business. Bergman must be let go. She goes back to France and the family arrives years ago when the children have grown up. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can't believe kids now need a governor. Hayward is quite right when he is against him that the children did not bring him back. In a normal case, Bergman would have come to life. One of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the film I have is edited. It may be the reason for many holes in the parcels. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that Ingrid and Susan couldn't make another movie in the fifties when Hayward was at his height and Bergman had just made a return. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is the main reason to see that Adam had four sons. And I'm ready to believe that a lot of Ingrid was left on the floor of the cutting room.
