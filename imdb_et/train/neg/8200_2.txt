This film couldn't decide what he wanted to be. There were a couple of sub-plots that for some time you thought these things would all come together ... but they didn't. If you want a "frozen in waste" story, stay with the 1950s version of THING (not the abomination that was rebuilt with the 20-year-old gore-o-vision). <br /> <br /> I couldn't overcome the fact that "alien" saw quite a lot of circulation from INDEPENDENCE DAY. <br /> <br /> "Minimal" kits would have been more effective if they were hired by actresses who could actually take action and prevent the desired mood. <br /> <br /> Lots of terrain chewing with little profitability.
