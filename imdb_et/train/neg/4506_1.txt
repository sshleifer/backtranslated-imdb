The American filmmakers decided to make a film they think of Japan. The characters are all badly represented, the actors aren't even Japanese, and the set is cheap, unrealistic and certainly doesn't represent Kyoto in the early 20s and 30s. Whoever reads a book will realize that script writers have not added any value to differentiate the movie script. Worse still, they even changed the original plot line with a couple. Rob Marshall uses two famous Chinese actors for his two main characters who previously joined a tiger-hidden dragon. Marshall apparently saw one Chinese film and they represent Japanese culture. Seeing these two actors together makes the films more ridiculous. Quentine Tarantino's Last Scene Kill Bill # 1 is ten times more Japanese made than this movie.
