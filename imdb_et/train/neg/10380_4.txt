I don't think anyone who is sitting at this movie is looking at something far away, like a classic ghost story, but you have to ask yourself if it's over if you ever fear. It doesn't really work at this level, but the cast tries hard and the film doesn't touch one of those happy ends. The story is from an American couple traveling to Kyoto, Japan, so Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) can write a book and bring his wife Laura (Susan George) and their daughter Amy (Amy Barrett). Their friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure), who works for an American consulate, helps them find a house to live in and he finds it haunting. About 140 years ago in the same house, the samurai found his wife cheated on him and killed both and then committed suicide. Their ghosts are still living in the house, and it will not take long before Fletcher arrives. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Sometimes ghosts live in Fletcher's bodies and they start acting like Japanese people they used to be and Laura starts flirting with Alex , which brings about. In the meantime, Ted is going to be more rigorous and after he pours Amy's throat, he asks Monk for help. Unfortunately, the ghosts receive a scene of death for Ted, Laura and Alex, as it happened 140 years earlier. <br /> <br /> This movie was directed by Kevin Connor, known as a good TV director, but he has made horror and sci-fi films before and has worked with McClure some of them. Although it is never close to a scary or evolving atmosphere, it has two things I liked. First, it does not have one of those happy passages where the couple covers after the demons are destroyed. Instead, it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone goes against the ghosts of evil. Secondly, it's poured on Susan George! I've always been his fan, although he has appeared mostly in chocolate, but his performances are always top-notch. He also usually appears naked, which he does in two different scenes, and although he has no classic qualities, he has a unique tomboy, like watching him, and this is one of the reasons he was so popular. But after appearing in such foolish movies, it was out of business or only worked randomly. It's not a bad film, but it's never convincing and watching ghosts when Monk gives exorism is practically worthy or two. The bottom line is that it is stupid and I hope George decides to continue his career.
