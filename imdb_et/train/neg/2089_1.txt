Of course I looked at BG. I loved S1, I liked Season 2, Season 3 was fine and I loved the latter. Yes, there's a spin-off show! I didn't know at all, one of my friends told me about it. I was really excited. <br /> <br /> I watched the first 3 episodes ... What a rubbish! Teenage girl drama festival. There is no science fiction ... well, barely. At the end of each episode we get a glimpse of Cylon. That is all. Who cares? Did they decide that the target group for the next exhibition is women under 18? Boring incredible stupid talking, moaning, hitting ... and some more. <br /> <br /> It's just sad that there's nothing to look at right now. Stargate destroyed, BG over ...
