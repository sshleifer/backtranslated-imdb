The final score ... who cares - this is reality. It has no love for this audience, it puts lazy TV viewers, does nothing and gets nothing out. <br /> <br /> "Joe Millionaire", an example of all these outstanding counterfeits, is an epic dimension of television disaster. This is the water line, the bottom moment, not only for Fox, but for the public viewing the public who is actually watching, and talking about it the next day. Your people should be ashamed. Because as much as Fox promotes this junk, it doesn't make money unless people follow it (and the boy was that, the Super Bowl got the finals!?). It doesn't bother you that there are many high quality exhibitions that have been written, guided, acted, and broadly caught by those that are canceled when you sit back and make it an effortless example of a cold game? <br /> <br /> I was a former Fox supporter. Those of us like me who like and looking for a high quality TV that helped Fox get married ... with children and the Simpsons. It is enough that none of these exhibitions would change the current management for 6 weeks. Gail Berman's "reign of terror", as it is often called. The network has fought on scripted television and is strangely fans. The people who helped them build up at the beginning. Not only do we now have to fight for good exhibitions, but we have to fight our network. It grabs your mind. Nothing Fox, which has been doing for the past 3 years, makes no sense. Canceling hits like "Titus", "Futurama" and "John Doe" (NBC can upgrade to "Boomtown", but Fox can't raise it badly to give the only decent show they had in the season?). And the reason they can do all this is junk's success as "Joe Millionaire". Now they can say, "We don't need your TV fans, we have a reality show". They seem to have no idea that a big audience who pulls this junk is dirty and gives up on the other that comes next. To dispose of their foundation, it eventually kills the network, as it has set back ABC. <br /> <br /> The exhibition itself is a joke. Here, we now have the premise of the classic Fox trick that allows us something different and nervous, but then gives something in no way different from the "Bachelor" or something from the big 3rd Fox. Finale and "twist" (quote / unquote) showed they had no sleeve ideas. Now we know that all these shows, no matter how different they look, will end up in the same cornball, the end of the fairy tale. We need to see a number of flat ambitious actors whose network chose millions of headlines to match their demographic parade like a high school bimbos who pretended they liked Evan Marriott because ... well, because it was a contest and you should. The Marriott itself is an amazingly dispersed Chro-magnum man who struggles to create the simplest sentences. But how do women (all who see the way on average, if it is important minus the innocent joy as such) show Joe such charming features as "Look, you're not stupid". <Br /> <br /> I thought people who watched these reality / dating / play were just lazy to change the channel, but after "Joe Millionaire" they thought they had to be mentally deficient. Come on people, have a little more pride. Get a little more of your entertainment if that's the case. <br /> <br /> Boycott FOX.
