One good thing about this movie is Lola Glaudin's ass! Sorry I'm so blunt, but that's the truth. Too bad he didn't do naked. It would at least have made this confusion acceptable. We see another chick's chest, but she's not close to Lola. And the man is Armand Assante old or what? The man looks like a mess! "Effect" is the usual B movie you expect. The story was potential. It's like they had good ideas, but they didn't know how to fill them. Cinema is just terrible. Ugly! Leadership is uninspired and the end result is a gentle thriller with flat twists and washed participants. Lola Gaudini is good as a butterfly, but not even he can save the "consequences" of the trash and not the funny trash.
