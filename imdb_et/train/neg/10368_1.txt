This "movie" is such a bad job! Nothing even seems to try and be realistic. The plot is weak, active - unhappy, actors who think about the first year of production, trying from the outset no chance to act. What a flop! What a waste of time, money and effort on all involved, including the public. Well, like any thriller, there are murders, corpses, and blood here. Imagine someone who, five minutes ago, made a murder knife and came out calm and smiling, not to mention pure as a whistle, as when a throat burst is made by a virtual agent. This murder was also supposed to happen to a small gentle woman with a strong strong man, and she cut her throat !!! Did he ask him politely to fall for him? The same stupidity is much bigger and leaves the audience wondering if it meant a joke that just turned out to be bad. Consistency is another big problem, for example: an avid hungry groom is lying in bed, waiting for his virgin bride to get out of the bath and sleep for a long time (!?!). The next scene opens when a young couple enters the reception area, asking for landscaping guidance! NO WORDS ABOUT THE LAST NIGHT ??? Such a waste of time, even to try and write about this lower-than-expected "movie."
