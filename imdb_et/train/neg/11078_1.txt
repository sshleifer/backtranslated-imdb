honestly where i can get started! It was a small budget, HORRIBLY acted as a movie, it was so cheesy that we had all laughed, how it was slowed down! the sword-fighting scenes were not even sword fighting, they played around with some plastic swords they bought on wal-mart, and all they did was moaning to try and see that they look like they are fighting !! One day my family and my family were in the mood for a really good movie, so we decided to go to the store and look for one and there was Sawtooth Iceland movie. I think it seemed so great, but when we watched it at home, I died practically after the first scene. <br /> <br /> And the movie story, story, script, etc. garbage I don't even know why the director and producer even wasted their time doing it !! But if it happens that this movie hits, don't get it !!!!!
