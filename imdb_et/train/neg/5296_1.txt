I'm not a big fan of syllables as a genre, but even with low low-budget spending standards, it's very flat. Even at nudity-and-gore levels, it's incredibly boring (both are some, but it's all sort of ... meh). It may not even leave the theater before the home video revolution (although it was; after all, * the 9th space plan played in theaters *). The whole movie has exactly one good (and competently delivered) line; I assume they stole it somewhere. <br /> <br /> Among the actors is one of the worst I've ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had a couple of competent participants and the rest tend to be ridiculous teeth that can be fun to watch. Anyway, most of his actors can read quite a bit. Here, those who do not read their rows like the Cigarette Shop Indians sound like they learned to learn phonetically. And this film has one distinction: it can be badly underdeveloped for most movies, then ridiculously redundant. <br /> <br /> (Update: I should have shown that the actor plays as an administrator he is not a tree, not that he is good, but he is definitely not wood.) <br /> <br /> Even the most the worst butterflies are usually some of the Puritan meditation about their grotesque insult, but it doesn't even seem to work on moral resentment there. <br /> <br /> And do you know the funniest things? They clearly thought they would make a sequel! <br /> <br /> It's so bad and boring that it gets exciting in a strange way. I sat through a lot of the video, wondering why anyone should do it.
