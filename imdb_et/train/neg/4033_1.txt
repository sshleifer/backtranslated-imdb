I have the pain to write such a wretched survey, but by doing this I encourage these people easily. First of all, just because the film is made on small budgets, it doesn't make it automatic or pleasant. In fact, in such a case, it is probably the only achievement of the films with a low budget, as it prevented the destruction of large sums of money on a single-footed horse. Have you ever seen comedy in theater? Have you ever heard people laugh and wonder what "me on you"? Well even those twins didn't laugh. Something went wrong with my stuff when my cat took her first bath. It's not a movie, it's kids .... not monkeys who take pictures that leave you feeling like moving to France. I have to go, there is a clown at my door .............
