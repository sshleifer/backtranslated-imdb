Proof that not all Tarantino touches gold. This is definitely plastic. It is easy to see that without Quentin's involvement it would probably have been sitting on the shelf for years, assuming that it would never have been for the first time. It's about a woman who has an enchanting death, who gets cleaned after job scenes of crime scenes, Angela Jones is not convincing in this role, William Baldwin is better than Serial Killer, who keeps Jones working! All in all, pretty bad.
