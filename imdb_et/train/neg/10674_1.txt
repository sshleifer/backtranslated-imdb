This is one of the worst films I've seen for years. Apart from Cuba and Angie, it is really embarrassing. Was Archer never a decent actor? What happened to him? Activities are decent, but completely unlikely. The set is so bad that it is worth noting. I mean, who thinks of a man even in a modern feature film. Someone should tell the artist and the DOP that you should not really see it. The end is massive disappointment - "and then they realize it's all a dream" <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money. You're better off looking at the room for 2 hours.
