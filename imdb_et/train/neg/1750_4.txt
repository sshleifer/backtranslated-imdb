Priyadarshani's HERA PHERI was a nice comedy comedy, but this movie doesn't really have a story, but it's pretty funny but illogical. In the first half, there are two funny scenes like Akshay and John call Neha for lunch and the other when Paresh enters <br /> <br /> The first half gets boring slowly, but the other half is funny, though they're not scripts <br /> < jokes are funny, though you don't know how they don't hear the voices of every person inside the room? <br /> <br /> Confusion of the peak is treated as a playful game, but it's pretty funny, but the movie ends up sharply <br /> <br /> The direction is good Music is good <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar shines eye out, which has now become her second skin, but it's her movie completely and she overshadows everyone else <br /> <br /> John stumbles across and fails in comedy Paresh Rawal is fun Rajpal is okay Girls Maybe from time to time and uncomfortable also in Nargis, Daisy and Neetu (only Neetu is now seen) is partly good, but shining too often Manoj Joshi is fine
