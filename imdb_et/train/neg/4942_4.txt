Every new fallback ad deserves at least my "3 strokes and you're out" policy. I give the comedy 3 the chance to laugh at me, ie 3 complete episodes. After episode 1, I told the TV: "Tomorrow's canceled". It was so bad. I have now followed the first four episodes of "Cavemen" and managed to smile any more. Not a titer, an offense, a quarrel, actually a face movement is not at all. I still punish myself for watching every future episode because I am convinced that I have something clear at this stage. I just don't get it, but I believe that the primary television network in the primary time must be funny; but I'm not laughing yet. There is no chance that ABC will make the least fun comedy at 20:00. I know there must be an inner joke that just doesn't move against my brain. I have read all the previous comments, I get this social aspect, but WHAT IS ANYONE? I will continue to suffer for at least 30 minutes a week until I have a light bulb moment and I will hit myself in a call called "Eureka".
