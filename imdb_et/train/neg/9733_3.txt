A pretty bad Firestarter clone that looks like a bad TV movie rather than a bad feature film. How disappointing is that it comes from Hooper and Dourif! <br /> <br /> Government employees are testing a hydrogen bomb with a human. A boy who was born for a couple of tests is running 100 degrees fever and when he is an adult, people start to spontaneously burn in their lives. He's trying to find out why. <br /> <br /> People who are completely out of fire are well done, but when they reach the point that they are otherwise well done, they have probably become dummies. When fires come out of the symbols, it seems more stupid than worrying. It is also a ridiculous fire that apparently moves through telephone lines and breaks down the receiver's ears into large jets. How should this happen, exactly? <br /> <br /> Something else that struck me as a fool about the film is when the character has vision of his late parents. Later we saw exactly the same shots of these visions in home movies.
