Yes, right. <br /> <br /> I spent the first hour waiting patiently for the movie. It was terribly boring and consisted mainly of people who accidentally ride around the mountains without being directed. Then the hero gets to the picture. Born in Asiana, but when she grew up she became white. Obviously white. He wasn't even over for Asia. He looked like Justin Timberlake. It was extremely disruptive and the story didn't contribute to the cause. Pointless sequences and flat dialogue. It's an hour and forty-five minutes and finally I tried to eat my face. I watched it because the video shop I work with always asks if this movie is good. Now I have an answer. It's doing something like this: ahem. "NO! ALL GOD IS NOT POSSIBLE! DO NOT HAND! Here I recommend another movie, maybe what's fun."
