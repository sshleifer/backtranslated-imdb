I may not have the longest attention, but this is another film I've refused, and I even bought it on a DVD because of its "classic" status. First I thought the director was playing a big joke, so I was waiting for a resolution, something to laugh at, something that keeps me interested, but that resolution never came. Rather, writing was ridiculously amateurish, the film was pulled out and scattered like someone cut into the length of the TV series feature. The Academy has had to carry drugs when they called this film at least eight oscars. <br /> <br /> I repeat again. This is another movie that I haven't been watching all the time. The first was "Exterminator". I hope this will give you an indication of how bad it really is. 1/10
