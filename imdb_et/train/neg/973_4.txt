This typically melodramatic Bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of Western critics. The script is ridiculous, the actor is up, and it looks like cheese. The only reasons for watching this soap opera are the Mangeshkar songs and the speech of the legendary Meena Kumari curtain. Looking at an actor who was ill while filming and drinking himself at the age of 40 immediately after the release of the film, it is as enchanting as watching a train break. His ex-husband Amrohi wrote and directed, but he does not have the competence to perform either task well. Bollywood has produced much better films.
