I wasn't sure what to expect from the comedy, drama, fantasy, sci-fi genre, but considering the participants, I thought I'd give it a spin. The tone of the film felt uncomfortable, passing through the patches of each genre, but never felt quite balanced, so I finally gave up on the event and focused on cinematography and individual performances, which I thought they were generally good, given the character of the story was little (not giving here). I have to say that I felt it was longer than 96 minutes of running time, not good. Finally, I was looking for closure, some satisfaction, but it didn't turn out to be a smart or brilliant piece that I was hoping for. I think Tony mistakenly thought what he did at the end of the movie gave us that ... but it was a tragic mistake to try and validate the previous 95 minutes with a poorly meaningful conclusion. Finally, I feel deceived. It would have been better for the IMO to let it stand without "stop" than a work of art ... just. Or ... I can completely miss this point :)
