I was so excited to discover that it was available! I couldn't wait to see it. What a waste of energy! This rare CD is from your favorite band found at the back of your rack in your local music store. Being a solid core, you were sure it was a valuable discovery. But when you heard it, it became clear why these dogs had never brought it to a real album. This DVD is recommended to be used only by "graduates" who must have everything Lynch has done. "Six men's illness" is visually interesting, but short and repetitive. Lynch's later work, "Grandma," is simply lacking in immature work. It's annoying and looks like a student's film. But it was 70's ... It's only interesting when you hope for a director's psychoanalysis. But briefly you will see some seeds of some of his trademark images and sounds. "The Alpahabet" is forgotten (not really! I don't remember it at all!) "Amputee" is meaningless. "Cowboy and Frenchman" is just silly. "Lumiere" is the only worthy bunch. Without dialogue, Lynch tells a disturbing story that is comparable to his best work. I had to look at it once. But it takes less than 2 minutes. It is hardly a mistake to rent or buy DVDs.
