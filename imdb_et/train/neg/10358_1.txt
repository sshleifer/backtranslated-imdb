I've read the entire book "A wrinkle" and saw this movie. The film contained all the elements of the book, but because the book was 190 pages and the film was 2 hours, the film seemed too many effects and malfunctioning. <br /> <br /> A timeless wrinkle is about a girl named Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin have a team together to find Meg's father and get out of Camazotz Island. <br /> <br /> The start of the movie is really stinky. The actor is terrible, the direction is ridiculous and so far there is no need for situations. I really crushed to see the same person Madeleine Engle, who wrote the book and created the movie, made a great book and a terrible movie. Action is worse than any direct video. Yes, I have to admit that there are cool effects. But they were all terribly and not serially done. When you read the book, the movie is broken. I would like to give it to 0, but unfortunately I can only give it to 1. A party could have been helpful.
