There are some very talented black leaders, Spike Lee, Carl Franklin, Billy Duke, Denzel, and many others who bring the film industry well. Then there are also Wayans Brothers, who at one time (15 years ago) were very funny in the TV show 'In Living Color', which, among other things, launched Jim Carrey's career. Now we have a stupidity that replaces humor and gross image (toilet humor) as a standard work procedure. People are not as stupid as those depicted in the "Little Man" they may not have. A full dental and tattoo baby is only accepted for months? The baby has five hours of shade he shaves. It is understood that the child has sexual sex with his wife, Darryl, with his spouse. Oh, yes, it's just fun. As a champion, the "Little Man" on the planet is the most stupid on Earth. He hides a stolen stone, which is only huge in a woman's wallet and then needs to be continued. Co-star Chazz Palminter, why Chazz offers the best line: "I am surrounded by moans." Based on, without credit, Chuck Jones comic, Baby Buggy Bunny. It's too stupid to be even far away. The bad thing about this movie is Damon Wayans, the second night he appeared to Jay Leno before the BAT awards, and he didn't even mention that terrible movie. When Hollywood's green lighting stops at Wayans Brothers. If they're likely to light up their white men.
