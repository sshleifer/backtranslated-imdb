Given the boundaries of this film (the whole movie on one device - a music studio - only about 5 or 6 participants in total), it should have been much better. If you have such limits when making a movie, how could lighting be so bad? And the actors were terrible, the hair below the actors, except that it was an enjoyable film, it had no content. Well he tried but really fails. <br /> <br /> It tries to be a part of itself, but the participants gave them so badly that it was just bad. And the main character Neal man, which is pathetic relaxation. It is clear that 10 people together made this "movie" and they all knew each other, and that was probably the real rock band they had, but unfortunately these people have no idea how terrible they are. It was done in 2005, but they all look so naive that they just smell before the grunge era. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I didn't pay to see it (Starz is Demand again!) The title "The Possessed", not Studio 666, doesn't matter what you do with the title, it can't. It could have been a much better-made movie - there is no excuse for making this bad movie if you have the obvious limitations that filmmakers had when they did it, working within these boundaries, you should do things that you can control and You can work in the best possible way. Instead, they thought that mediocrity would be good enough. And this music video, which was bad, helped me out quickly. <br /> <br /> So 2/10 is fair, if you're the whole b-movie crap, then I think you're going to see it.
