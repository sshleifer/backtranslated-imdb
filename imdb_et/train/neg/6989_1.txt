<br /> <br /> Worst. Movie. What ever. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of filming this remake (besides becoming a 90-minute ad for a movie soundtrack)? Zombies that * go * ??? I think the director has never looked at the original "Dead" movies that show rigor mortis from creatures that interrupt / rob their living prey. <br /> <br /> And how, exactly, did those who recently belonged to Steve leave the boat at the marina? <br /> <br /> 1/10
