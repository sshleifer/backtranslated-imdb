Republic pictures come at the end of the game "werewolf" er Werecat genre. The plot has returned to Paris after a long journey abroad, during which he developed a jungle fever during which he had power cuts. He is very praiseworthy because his novel, that the parallel is a notorious trial, is the best seller. The French Government wants to know whether it has access to secret documents that seem more likely to be killed by a "catman" officer. Doubt really rises to the writer when his fianc√© is dead. Complex issues are the return of power cuts, so the writer doesn't know if he is a killer or not. Early there are too many musical numbers and too many dead times when things are talking in the middle and later. Action is good and quite good, but there is a reason why most people I know only remember the master hat-killer, the most interesting thing about this movie. In spite of his short hours of work (just over an hour), I think the reason why this film was rarely seen on television was that after 20 minutes you start to lose it. As good as talking, I just wanted someone to do something. When it finally happened, it was too late on the end date. <br /> <br /> Go over.
