It was the worst film I've ever seen in theaters. It was just a collection of recycled material. The people who hit the head are not funny. People who are beaten are not funny. After the third time the guy went to the balls, so that even the youngest audience didn't laugh any more. It was just tired. <br /> <br /> I went with my younger sister. He laughs loudly at the mountain king, but this cinematic masterpiece eternalized him. I'm not surprised. The story is pretty flat. The dwarf thief steals a big diamond, which was certainly the simplest of Hollywood history. He then hides with his family who pretends to be a child. I know it sounds exciting, but that's the whole story. Say these two lines over 1.5 hours and get the picture. I felt like I saw it after that. I didn't expect much and I was still disappointed. I want Keenan to hire just a few decent writers to write jokes and / or his next script. It was even worse than white chicks if possible. I've seen high school play that was better and cheaper. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about this movie. I don't like my entertainment.
