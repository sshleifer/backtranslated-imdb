This is bad. A really bad and boring criminal movie that doesn't have anything ordinary in it. A series of crimes, a killer that you don't see in the whole movie, classical investigations. And also the classic story of a policeman who thinks what is going on and what no one believes, so he has to fight for himself to reveal the truth. Not too much in it. Vote: 4 out of 10.
