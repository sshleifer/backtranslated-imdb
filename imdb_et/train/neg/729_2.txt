Before seeing the exhibition, I have heard that it was great and aesthetically very interesting. What a scam, scripts are so stupid that I'm pretty sure the authors are the son and grandson of Scoobidoo writers. And what is so extreme about SFX and colors that it hurts to look, the colors are not saturated, they are over saturated, as the scripts are overwritten and the exhibitions are overpriced. This exhibition is like a bad pie where the child would only bring sugar and you might think that as these ingredients are the best, they are enough. Unfortunately, for this exhibition, the only two components of this exhibition are finally empty and lack of complete credibility.
