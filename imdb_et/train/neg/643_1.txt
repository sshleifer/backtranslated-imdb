I'm a big fan of the TV series Largo Winch. This movie was a pain for me. I had to go fast, not to fall. It was boring! How can anyone destroy this title so much? The story was the only good thing. The actors were sh.t. They can't live this role. The main actor (Tom ...) is zero. Look at the other roles of this actor. The fighting scenes were incredible boring and not traceable, but in no way did they have to follow the situation. Like other reviewers, the low budget film said with bad actors. Perhaps the next time someone else gets better from this title. French cannot do the right thing with big movies like Alien 4. It was a little brrr after Alien 1,2,3.
