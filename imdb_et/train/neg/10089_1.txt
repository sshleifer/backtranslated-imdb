German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has succeeded in tasks that many horror fans thought were impossible: he is a dazzling companion to Teuton Uwe Boll, who has ever been the director of the worst horror films. <br /> <br /> Lommel is really Ed's new millennium. This film is dirty and ridiculous as EW's worst. I'm so proud and embarrassed to say I watched this toto, bothered to see just a low bar. The answer is: underground; Stitch well in the well and buried it. <br /> <br /> Fun begins with the pain of international nobles. Only someone who lived in Los Angeles, where every car mechanic, doctor and postman is an actor waiting to be discovered, can easily figure out how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors who wanted their ridiculous dialogue with straight face. <br /> <br /> The main character, the criminal, is played by a German actress with a thick German accent. Besides the serial killer, he is also the oldest beaten cop in LA. Despite the fact that he stops the innocent female leader and takes them into custody, he pulls them into his home (which is inexplicably on the top floor of the furniture store) and does it all in the eyes of his novice partners, LAPD refuses to investigate by going so far as to physically attack his accusers In your apartment ninja style attack. <br /> <br /> Sets are extremely bad. The budget of the production designer apparently contained a color of sufficient color; it is enough to paint "Precinct 707" on the board. <br /> <br /> As the actors were apparently unpaid non-professionals - a sad choice for European emigrants (possibly they were deported when they were in their home country), bimbos, mimbos and desperate middle-aged women - and because little money was spent on kits for specials For efxs, locations, or other production values, it's just fair to mention that they made a couple of real-life police uniforms. Unfortunately, they couldn't afford a police car; uniformed policemen are traveling on the streets in shiny mercury rentals. <br /> <br /> More than half of the story focuses on the dirty acts of the German LAPD officer we talked about and the unnecessary efforts of two young men to stop him. One of these young actors is especially gracious because he is the only actor in this confusion, even in the real career of films. Others fit, rockabilly hairstyle and tortured Brando, which must be seen as appreciated. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie is where the title gets its zombie, the killer as a victim has risen after he murders a girl who had just visited a voodoo priest to protect him. Don't ask why a Romanian girl would lead voodooism when she was murdered, but agree with Lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride. Zombie girls can make their appearance. They look exactly like they did before death, maybe even more beautiful, with black glamor make-up packs that have been thoroughly cleaned around their eyes. Looking at the zombies, they don't see high-end models ready for the runway. <br /> <br /> During this movie, Lommel borrowed his acclaimed landlord, Boll, and injected high-dose cheese. trash techno soundtrack. We're talking about prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise. Stuff they could play on the Ibiza disc when Lommel was still young enough to shake her catch. <br /> <br /> Unlike other zombies, Lommel girls normally speak and work ... before zombification. It gives our author many opportunities to get us more with our golden dialogue in the shower. Yes, the golden shower is it. <br /> <br /> I'm not breaking anything by exposing the end of a blow. I can say that it fits perfectly with the rest of this masterpiece. Ed Wood's spirit lives ... or I should say his geek.
