I really have no idea how to comment on this movie. The special effects were weak, the operation was terrible, and when there was a plot, it was on the back of the box. I don't think I remember that movie is bad for a long time and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and boobs! ;) Even this will not save this movie simply as a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand (or in this case place) the camera. <br /> <br /> The overall "zombie" effect. Since apparently in this movie zombies are so common that they run over a couple here and there, and we talk about this accidentally from the petrol station (one with its own windscreen repair, but there is no indoor bathroom), the zombie movie genre is even over. Even then, a dozen zombie girls hanging on the girl's clothes don't really represent a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> Vampires: Probably all zombies are males and all vampires are women, which is OK for me. I'm not sure how the vampires are in daylight, or why / how the soldier's vampire stood in the middle of the road, still holding his gun through his heart, just waiting for the Queen Vampires to slide it all the way. The last segment of the old nun species didn't make sense, and when one hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire, "Do you think we did it right?" killing two visible heroes in the movie that put it up. <br /> <br /> Effective and special effects were also lower than ever. You can almost see that the hoses that the fake pump was pumped to the public during the rest of the zombie. Generally speaking, where did they find Kenny Rogers to look like anyway? No idea what it was like, not at all confused and in the wrong place. Just my $ 0.02.
