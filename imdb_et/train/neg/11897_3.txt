The follow-up of William Lustig to "Maniac" proves convincingly that without Tom Savin's remarkable effects and the convincing performance of Spinelli, the "maniac" would never become the cult position he did. "Vigilante" is poorly targeted, with a simple thinking script that reveals everything and is predictable at every turn, as well as the mediocre performance of all participants. Judging by the idea of ​​"deja vu", this film gave Lustig a look at "Death Wish" many times too much before he did it! (* 1/2)
