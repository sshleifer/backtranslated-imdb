This film begins with a certain promise; but I think it will be lost if the protagonist kidnaps a good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down. Because this benevolent stranger is starting to talk about his car without holding it away, it is unlikely, but that he is one of the few people in the country to help him build his family's life. The coincidence at the beginning of the writers is cautioned from using their stories. <br /> <br /> I found the best of this movie. The direction of art could have been much better than it could have been in cinematography. The exhibition was good and so was the song of Eva van der Gucht.
