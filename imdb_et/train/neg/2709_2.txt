The only way to get something out of this movie is to approach this comedy. Looking at this light, it gives. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a serious movie, look somewhere else. This film does not have any depth, and it offers a little more than a few and one-dimensional "questions", without any review. is a very bad strategy - especially if these same characters break their hackneyed forms with predictable and stereotypical ways. <br /> <br /> Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube make the movie almost traceable and Michael Rappaport is in a very good shape, but the script is so terrible and social comment is so subtle that it's hard to find something redeeming.
