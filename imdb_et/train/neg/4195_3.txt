Given the people involved, it is difficult to understand why this film should be both confusing and boring. Writer David Ward wrote two years after the amazing caption "The Sting", Jane Fonda had just won the Academy Award for Klute and Donald Sutherland had just done an excellent job in films like "Klute", "Start Revolution Without Me and" Kelly Heroes. " movie is a story of the capers, a little ghost that is planning a big ghost. At the same time the film wants to be a hip satire, several comedy drawings made by NBC TV show "Saturday Night" two years later. The bad result is that the plot makes comedy bits uncomfortable and forced and loose Combined comedy bits are destroying all the arrests that he has. It is quite a film that keeps himself confused, just like cars in the break-down cars with each other. <br /> <br /> The only real interest for me was watching Jane Fonda. Her "Iris Caine" should be the heartfelt "Klute" version of "the dramatic character of the dramatic Bree Daniels prostitute." right, Jane Fonda always pretends to be a prostitute we look at. It is just as terrible as his "Klute" performance was terrible. It would be a good lesson if actors would teach these two films to show together to show how the same actor in the same type of role can be great or pathetic. This shows that the actors are just as good as their writers and directors.
