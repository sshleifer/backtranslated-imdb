This is a very boring film. When you grew up in Vietnam, as I did, you have now seen and heard all the film material and arguments here a hundred times. But what really makes this movie boring is narration by director Carlton Sherwood. Most of the film is made with Sherwood, who speaks directly from the camera about his opinion about this controversial time in the history of our people. <br /> <br /> If you're old enough to remember Vietnam, you'll win. t find anything new. There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry or new evidence that deserves another documentary from Vietnam. Younger viewers interested in the subject should see George Butler's excellent movie Going Upriver! Stolen Honor was clearly supposed to be John Kerry's hatchet job, but it can't do that.
