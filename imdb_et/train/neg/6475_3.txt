Although I've been reviewing the movie for about two years, I remember exactly what made my opinion as low as it was. Having loved the original little mermaid and I was a child of osprey, I decided to take the time to sit down and follow the sequel. <br /> <br /> Disney, I have a little message for you. If you do not have the original director and actors, you are just looking for your ass. <br /> <br /> In the queue, our story begins with a little older Ariel and her daughter, Melody. My first big problem was that Eric and the rest of the team were singing. Yes, I understand that Disney is great with song and dance numbers, but actually made Eric his favorite prince. He was a calm, collected and real gentleman who knew how to have fun. And he was. NO. SING. <br /> <br /> And then there's a villain. Oh, how do we forget about the shadows that slip on Ursula's screen when Ariel and all over the world viewers? Unfortunately, this gene was not passed on to his seemingly useless sister, Morgan. Nothing ever happened, EVER said on the first film about Morgana; he just jumps out somewhere, trying to steal the child. Oh, how cute. A younger sister has noticed and decides after a death after a death one month old child. I like Morgana not sure and originality unknown, but very unusual. The same plan as her sister, the same mines (who by the way didn't scare anyone. I was three years old when I watched this movie and she smiled hysterically). ; I would like to see that mother is a villain. I'm sure he would have done a better job than Little Miss Tish. <br /> <br /> King Triton held no respect for what he earned on the first film, and I can't even get into Scuttle, Sebastian, and Flounder. Triton was a stern, but loving father in the first film, and in the second case it was almost like he lost his will to knock the fears of his subjects. Scuttle, once a comic relief that made everyone laugh with their "dingle-hopper" (yes, I admit it; I called it from time to time to my fork in the dingle hopper). In this movie, Scuttle is all but forgotten. A supportive sign even in the first, he added something at least to the film. He had a rich taste that others didn't, and as a result, but they all left him completely. Sebastian was still the same, but twice worse than before. Disney, don't do it. Don't even try to confuse your favorite doll. Or our favorite little fat fish that gets dad and has many very annoying kids. She's greasy, and she's blessed, and she looks like she goes straight to any other. Especially Melody, who has no depth. <br /> <br /> And one of those days, Disney, I am beating out of my life. <br /> <br /> If I don't love the originals so much.
