Wes Anderson's "Fantastic Mr Fox" has put a lot of love, unfortunately, all love itself. It has been proven that there has been a lot of time and effort to ever make a self-conscious universe, but if only the same time and effort has been put on the script to try and funny. The worry is that I think it was, and that's the best Wes Anderson could offer. <br /> <br /> Animation is good for close-ups of animals, but when the camera is farther away it becomes truly eye-catching and completely honest and looks like confused. Actually, there was nothing special about the actors, because Wes chose to choose their friends and big names for more specialized voice artists who might have made the film obviously. I'm pretty sure George Clooney's soundtrack continues in South Park, one of the ones he played with. different and usually, despite being set in England, all good animals are typical Americans playing baseball while bad guys are stereotyped English with the most offensive English accents. I can't stress how much time this movie will take. I never laughed.
