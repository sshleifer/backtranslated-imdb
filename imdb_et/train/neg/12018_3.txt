Small time hood tricks for local mob boss out a lot of money. Of course, mob boss wants his money back and doesn't care who he needs to kill it. Punks supports his friend and old mobster to help him save his life. <br /> <br /> - If it sounds ridiculous, it is. The whole idea that this Izodi-carrying dune buggy-driving punk could prevent one of Rome's most powerful troops is just stupid. His friend may be good with a gun, but he is against a trained killer group. The old mobster is little more than a comic relief and no real help when it comes to peace. There's also a sub-block about how a friend's father was killed by a mob boss many years ago, but that hasn't been done and it doesn't help the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Mister Scarface is played by Jack Palance. I think she got the name because she looks like a shaving stick on her cheek. Palance is as effective as the rest, doing what it has to pay for. <br /> <br /> - I've recently seen some pretty good Italian crime / police pictures, but Mister Scarface is not one of them. See Syndicate Sadists or Revolver instead.
