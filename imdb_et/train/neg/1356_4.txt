First and foremost, and confidently with the user who calls it, "fraud". Crispin Glover takes his film very seriously. He personally introduced the film in Chicago. She had worked in the film for years and it is the first trilogy. "What is this?" is a Crispin Glover experiment by an art film, which Herzog, Lynch and others idolize. <br /> <br /> I had heard the rumor that had heard this film year ago, "an epic porn movie with all sub-syndromes, directed by crispin glover." When it finally came out, I looked at the trailer online and read the summary and I was waiting for the mouth to whine. ... I went there to see it and it was a big disappointment. If he pulled out the dumb sh * t, such as a pot-smoking grandmother and dancing sticks, he would be left with much better but only about 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> In other words, just look at the trailer, be entertained and leave it. There are some striking images and fantastic contradictions and expressions, but the lack of it is disappointing.
