I'm not as much as Love Sick as I imagine. Finally, the film expressed the sexual relationship with Alex, who, Sandu's triangle love was full of intensity, frustration and jealousy, eventually Alex woke up and realized that they had no result and no future. <br /> Director Tudor Giurgiu was at the AMC Theater on Sunday, 08.10.2006 at 12:00 pm, with us watching the movie together. After the film, he told the audience that the purpose of creating a Romanian film expressing sexual relations was kind of complicated. don't feel the film's special impression and effect. The love process of Alexi and Kiki and Kiki and his brother Sandu was a neighborhood story that was in the neighborhood. told us how they started falling in love? Sounds like after Alex moved to Kiki's residence, two girls fall in love. It doesn't make sense at all. How would a girl love a man instead of another. Too many fragments, you need to take pictures and combine these stories in your mind. Secondly, the whole movie had no Alex and Kiki sexual intercourse scene, which I expected ??? However, it was still advisable to recommend some parts. "Ear piercing" was interesting. Alex was ready to suffer the pain of piercing the ear to evaluate Kati's love. It was a touching scene that gave you little ideas about their love. Their scene was also in the field of football, the conversation expressed its love as true and passionate.
