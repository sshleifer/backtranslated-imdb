My roommate got a soundtrack to dub, No, No, Nanette on tape, and she started listening to it all the time. After he finally washed the brain completely, I found that the songs are irresistible, especially famous, I want to be happy, but I can't be happy ... But the coarse sound line I had no idea what the film was about something. So the other day I saw a copy of it from a video store and I rented what was supposed to be the long-lost version of the movie. I thought it was amazing because the soundtrack is so cute. Unfortunately, most of the songs I loved did not see me in the video. I have never seen a musical version of 1930, but this version was a disappointment, because there was very little song and practically no dance, and besides, it was very bad and you couldn't really understand what people say a lot of time. Indeed, the only highlight of this film was the unheard of fashion of 1940. Nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that look like rabbit ears, and the Kansas Kitty has this strange badminton that she holds on her forehead and is surrounded by her. One dance series is a bit strange when Nanette does this strange ballet stuff with girls on her. In fact, another bright spot in the film was the artist Guillespe, who dreams of being a beautiful artist, but is currently condemning a banknote for girls. I like how Guillespe keeps it in the old school, and publishes Nanette when her masterpiece, which had made her career, was sold by Nanette for $ 5,250. Does he not understand that this piece was his immortality? Dirty rabbit / girl with rabbit ears with your hat. When do you learn? Why doesn't he just pencil a cigarette before the advertisers take the job off?
