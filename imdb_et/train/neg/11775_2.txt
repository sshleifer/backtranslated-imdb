Watching "Kroko" I would have liked to leave the cinema for the first time in my life for the first time. I would not like to watch this movie: apartment symbols - no development, eg. Kroko's metaphoric German problem child remains a pure metaphor without the power of positive involvement, despite the fact that many parcels are capable of doing so. Unknown participants, not an evolving plot. I think the film tried to conduct an environmental study, but it failed: the camera seemed rather shaky than motivated. Pictures were in low contrast, gray and dark - I'm sure the components didn't add a convincing impression of the social environment. Although the story had some potential, it could have made a good story.
