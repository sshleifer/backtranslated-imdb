Clich√©-Polynesian men drink, fight and make sexist, foolish and uncomfortable comments. Real Life Polynesians are much more fun than these stereotypical, cardboard characters. Supposedly, Samoana's girl did not see or act with the Samoan, but rather a shadow of a white woman who had sex with someone. What's weak, like the water story, you can't say anything about the actors - even the brightest actors can't do anything with this script. It is sad to see Polynesian actors wanting to play such a sad stereotype in a movie that has no good scene, and only two or three jokes. What is the waste of kiwi taxpayers' money, the lost opportunity to make a big film about the living community. It is better not to make movies if they are as bad and pointless as it is.
