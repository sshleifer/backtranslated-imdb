I think any novel that is so much in decline as Moby Dick will not find much of a depression audience with enough problems. But any similarity to the classic Herman Melville novel is a pure coincidence. <br /> <br /> In fact, half of the movie is the main story, as we know it, not that too much was kept for the movie. First of all, we meet Ahab Creely (who has a surname and a brother) when one lucky one is a happy soul with two legs and intentions to marry Joan Bennett, the daughter of Father Mapple. This brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is Ahab who has the best result. Barrymore hadn't learned the sound cinema well and gave out all of the silent histrionics and lullabies that would shake the rafters of every movie he played. <br /> <br /> We see Ahab's loss of his leg on the big whale of Moby Dick and I have to say that the amputation scene was pretty tough. Of course, it was all before the code. I'm still sure the 1930s were scared by the audience. <br /> <br /> After that, Ahab's whale hunt, which he thought he was stupid in the eyes of Joan Bennett, was told. It's not exactly Melville's motivation, but Moby Dick hasn't written women when he wrote it. <br /> <br /> One of the things Melville did was to invest in a Ahab ship crew with Pequode with the people. Other than Queequeg, the names of harpoon harpooners exist, but not personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs could also be Smith and Jones. <br /> <br /> I'd see the curiosity of the Moby Dick version and nothing else.
