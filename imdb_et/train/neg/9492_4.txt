One star for "plot". One star for an actor. One letter for an American who has a duplicate note. Five stars for Monica Broeke and Inge Maria Granzow who want to take off their clothes. And ten out of ten divine Emmanuelle Béart, two years before he made Manon des sources. Béart also dresses a couple of times, but even his fully dressed presence is enough to make this movie extremely observable. Watch the event where she speaks to her friend about the first three times for the girl. It is terrifying, but still more erotic than the rather ridiculously choreographed "love scenes" with Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau. By the way, cinematography is not great; Closing Credit Photos is a better sign of what David Hamilton can do.
