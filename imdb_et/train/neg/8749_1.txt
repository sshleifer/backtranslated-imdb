A terrible movie, as everyone has said. What made me laugh was the appearance of Scott McNealy's head-on, giving the prize to some murdered programmers in front of the SUN logos wall. McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, who practically defines himself as Microsoft's hatred. They have been important in filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft. So, were they foolish enough to think that this bad movie would add fuel to that fire? <br /> <br /> There is no public record I saw of involving SUN, but clearly the makers of this movie know Scott McNealy. An interesting mystery.
