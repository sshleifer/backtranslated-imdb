Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in costumes of space girls. <br /> <br /> I love 50 sci fi, i even love cheesy 50s sci fi but this movie is really bad. And not MST3K in a certain way. <br /> <br /> Almost unobtrusive, as a couple of bosses make their best "hip-cat" impression of Abott and Costello. <br /> <br /> Chessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi, like "Cat Women On The Moon", but you can't do that. This movie requires a mute button and fast back and forth function. <br /> <br /> I said I could watch Gloria and Dolores around the spaceship for about an hour or less.
