This sleek, sexy movie is a must-have. Only in several views can the uniqueness of this film really be understood. I personally enjoy the narrator's intelligent, no-touch theme, storytelling style. Introduction will take you right now and keep you at the edge of the seat. It gives an excellent overview of the world of training and allows the audience to "connect" this film with the inner horrors. The script itself holds the movie together perfectly. Not only children, but also the elderly, have a better understanding of the training and modern perceptions they have of sexual experience. It is definitely the word 'masterpiece' before it comes to its time and its embarrassment in cinematography.
