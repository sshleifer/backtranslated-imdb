This is an extremely silly and little visible film about slavery in Western India and it marks the Puddit "Seinfeld" show! Patrick Warburton made his debut in this film and is much thinner here. Oliver Reed got the best bills, but hardly any movie at all. Warburton has a white slave and it's funny to see all the young and horny women who offer her rich older men because they all want to have sex with her. Eartha Kitt plays the owner of the bordello and has so much nudity in the movie. If it is not intoxicated organs in bordellos, its young women with whom they turn. Then, of course, the slaves end with the rebels and there is a bloody standoff. There is no real political message, like the movie "Burn", but just another established plot device to move the story. Incredibly, they made a sequel and Warburton, and all the rest came back! I hope they got a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad. Nudity keeps it traceable and the lack of Warburton accents makes it ridiculous at times. Very bad movie, but I have to admit I want to see the sequel.
