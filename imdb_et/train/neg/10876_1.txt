What the fucking D-movie was? Bad behavior, bad special effects and the worst dialogues / storyline I've ever found. The only cool thing here was Coolio, who had a nice firefighter as a frightened cop. But the rest of the movie is terrible and boring. It's not so bad, you can laugh at it. Just clean. And who compares it to Evil Dead Series can also compare Tomb Raider with Indiana Jones (well, ok, at least there was Angelina Jolie Tomb Rider)! 1 out of 10
