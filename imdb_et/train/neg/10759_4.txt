Despite the great future design, smart Asimov's premise and Will Smith's dependable coolness, this film does not meet expectations. Cliches are thick and fast; (waking up from a recurring nightmare, a maverick policeman has canceled his badge to make a list more would be corrupted - you'll see the end of a mile). This movie is also linked - you never know that you have traveled everywhere; which should be a global disaster, never miss CGI Chicago. Robots themselves are good in the neighborhood, but "crowd" scenes are rather bad for Disney - CGI is over and over again. And if you can destroy robots, why do they need to inject "nanites"? You know, this is an amazing movie, when such foolish questions start to distract you before the climax. It could have been great, but it is less than the sum of its parts, mainly due to a completely predictable plot that could have come from any activity film of the last forty years.
