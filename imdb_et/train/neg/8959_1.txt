Some people may consider this movie to be a work of art - so you can express your imagination on the film to create a movie full of contradictory pain and death. Personally, I think this film is nasty, which should never be released. This film is disgusting, illogical and meaningless. Not only is it a waste of time, it will make you sick in the coming days. The horrible pictures shown in the movie not only allow you to grab the air, but they put in your mind and take time to forget. Such a shame that people are wasting their imagination in such inhumane suffering. "Kill Bill" would be another example, but at least "Kill Bill" has its purpose, meaning, climax and resolution.
