Could anyone stop John Carpenter's constant and deliberate destruction? How small can you go? This man seems to have lost all self-esteem. <br /> <br /> This episode looks like a film student has done, not even worth talking about what was bad, because it was just a boreal, guided by someone without a filmmaker or without motivation ... <br /> <br /> Mr. Carpenter, please take the rest of your self-esteem immediately and stop garbage from the bad tradition from escaping from LA to Martian spirits. <br /> <br /> Run instead.
