Not really spoilers in my opinion, but I wanted to cover myself. As an executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in a 10-item or less, deliberate indie-cognitive film, and simply be absorbed by the mentor / be-all-that-you-can. He plays an alternative universe, a half-washed version of the true Morgan Freeman, led by Elder Econovan, who is at Carson, CA in Brentwood, to study the role of his next film. Why Carson is a secret. Cal residents. He could have saved the trip and went somewhere in the San Fernando Valley and found the same elements. Paz Vega is beautiful to watch, cross between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, playing an unpleasant food checker in a big but slow local market, which is probably the main source of Moragn Freeman's research. His character is known only as "him" to refer to the way the characters live in the hands of middle people in reality - "Psst, that is", "etc." Unfortunately, I was too confused that he had all kinds of wisdom and advice in the world, but they didn't had no reliable return to his home in Brentwood, had no cash or debit card, and no wisdom to keep him with a mobile phone. If a person has such a high opinion that they believe they have the answer as he does, I have to see cash and Blackberry i showing intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve this great ego he definitely has. Nothing happens in this movie, it changed the idea of ​​adultery, but then thought it was similar to Steve Martin's Shopgirl, without sexual communication , it was self-conscious and convincing to Freeman.
