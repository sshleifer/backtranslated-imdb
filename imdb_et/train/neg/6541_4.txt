60 minutes of beautiful Christina Galbo is trying to escape from the isolated boarding house she has brought at the beginning of the film. Does he run out of fate too horrible to contemplate, a monster, a black-gloves killer, or a supernatural evil? No, he runs bundles. Over the next 40 minutes, the various numbers in the school run in the dark candlesticks and await anxiety or embarrassment, which in itself is not obviously due to the fact that such great films have been made, but when you go, you have characters that walk in corridors and stairways for better than you are Alain Resnais or better to know how to illuminate this staircase in bright apple reds and purple like Mario Bava. We know that the murderer collapses the perimeter of the school, but his body number is pathetic and the lack of and, in the absence of visceral horrors, waiting for the giallo, we do not know the meaningless secrets / inexplicable secrets that hide the order behind the facade and the divinity and righteousness that is such a film that La Residencia wants to be but doesn't know how to do it. We know that something is off because girls are missing, but we never get an unpredictable mysterious atmosphere that says "something is seriously wrong, man". When Serrador tries to comment on the sexual repression of female students, he does so quickly with hysterics and details and eyes and leaving lips, while high "this-on-shock" music dazzles in the background. There is no PICNIC meal and longing here. It is a bit clumsy and determined, without real urgency or direction. Many people are presented as suspects, but there is little reason to take care of the identity of the killer, which the characters inside the film miss. I like the first kill, a knife that hits the target, placed on the victim's attractive face as a lullaby chimes, but the rest is too insignificant for my taste. I have to say that Serrador did a lot better with children and paranoia du soleil, WHO CAN GILD KILL WILL BE?
