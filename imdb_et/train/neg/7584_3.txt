Recently I saw Broadway reviving "Blithe Spirit", starring Angela Lansbury, Rupert Everett, Christine Ebersole and Jayne Atkinson. It's a terrible production and shows what good actors can do with a game that is less than perfect. Angela Lansbury is extremely funny as Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> It was probably a mistake to look at the version of the Rex Harrison feature film. The film does not have the energy of producing a good stage or laughing. <br /> <br /> "Blithe Spirit" is probably one of the games that works better in real time, publicly filled with people who have a laugh. Participants can improvise, give their nuances and nuances the delivery of their performance and lines, and engage the audience on a personal level so that you can't access a movie house or DVD where the audience is separated. "The Fourth Wall" Story. Story: Successful writer Charles Condomine (Rex Harrison) lives with his wife Ruth (Constance Cummings) in an English country house. Charles Madame Arcati (Margaret Rutherford, who represents her role in the original London production of 1941), the local spiritual media, is inviting her next book to look for her next book to find information about her next book. Charles believes that spiritualism is disgraceful, but hopes to speed up "trade tricks". But then Madame Arcati brings back the ghost of Elvira (Kaye Hammond), Charles's first wife who died of pneumonia seven years ago. Elvira refuses to leave and develops Ruth's robbery with Charles (this is compounded by the fact that only Charles sees or hears Elvira). </p> <p> </p> </p> </p> situation. But on the screen, "Blithe Spirit" participants break through the lines as they don't know anyone is listening to them. They mumble lines designed to laugh on stage. Harrison, Cummings and even Kaye Hammond have been performing flat and lifeless. Only Margaret Rutherford seems to have kept sparks and humor like Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> The Oscar winning visual effects in the movie are unimpressive - not just today's standards, but the 1946 standards! They consist mainly of Kaye Hammond, who walked with fluorescent green equipment and makeup, being photographed in a special light to make it look like a glowing ghost. But compare Blithe Spirit's dull visual effects to the truly revolutionary effects of Disney's "Southern Song", which had been awarded the same year's prizes. In the "South", people and animated characters share the screen smoothly every minute. Compared to "lunch", the Oscar, which became "Blithe Spirit" for special effects, was completely undesirable. <br /> <br /> In any case, I can encourage you to revive Broadway with Angela Lansbury before it closes. As for Rex Harrison, skip it.
