Charles Bronson stands for the Crowe Lt police detective who declares war on a squirrel called Juan Fernandez, who kidnaps a daughter of a Japanese businessman who has sexually harassed Crowe's daughter (Amy Hathaway) in this buggy but stylishly robbed revenge thriller. Kinjite may not be for anyone who has a somewhat annoying primer, but it's well done and fun.
