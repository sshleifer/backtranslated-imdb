Dave (Devon Sawa) and his friends Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) have cheated their way through college. When the horrible Ethan (Jason Schwartzman) discovers his secret, he sends them to help Angela (James King), a beautiful, hearty student. <br /> <br /> Stupid and incompetent "comedy" -inducing as laughing. The film attempts to attract its target audience with its reluctant gags - but NOT ACTIVITIES. What's more, it is full of valuable, unpleasant signs - and Schwartzman's character is so reluctant that he's a big shutdown. The film even tries to use the 50's / 60's sex shot / actor Mamie Van Doren in the most horrifying scene. JUMP !!! <br /> <br /> Further advancement is the talent of Joe Flaherty, the actor of this complete predictability and comedy of veterans (when this guy finishes every role that accompanies and does something) All I liked was James (aka Jaime) ) King, who was very tempting - and who had served better. <br /> <br /> It doesn't get more than one in ten of me.
