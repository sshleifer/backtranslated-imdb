The author is in his "roots" in the southern tobacco industry's "discovery journey" because he believes that the (completely and wrongly forgotten) film "Bright Leaf" is his ancestor. He is not, and he actually discovers a mild interest in this absolutely foolish and self-conscious glorified home film, which is suitable for screening (director's) drunk family reunions, but certainly not for commercial or even non-commercial release. A good reminder of why most independent films can't get to the big studios - because they're boring, irrelevant and have no interest other than the director and his immediate circle. Avoid at all costs!
