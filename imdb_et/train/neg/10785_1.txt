Wow, what a great cast! Julia Roberts, John Cusack, Christopher Walken, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Hank Azaria ... What is it? Do you say the script? Now you're just greedy! Certainly, such a charismatic horse fortifies such cinematic surprises that the script is unnecessary? You would think so, but no. America's Sweethearts is one missed opportunity after another. It's like everyone waking up before each day writing / photographing / editing and though "You know what? I've been working hard recently and it's guaranteed that it will hit all those big names, right?" . ‚ÄùSo many options, but so painful to sit down. No aspect of this thing wonders. Even Julia's fat suit is flat.
