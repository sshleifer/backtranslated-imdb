A disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> The story was brought by our main character Chriss, "young", rather than squeezing individual drifting, not much. In fact, he does very little to move the narrative, so it doesn't surprise me to see that the focus moves to his relatives. It is unfortunate that Chrissy seems to be an interesting character. <br /> <br /> The story was predictable and sometimes seemed fairly worded. Now, the question is when will we see the bursting lands of Campions, Jackson, and Tamahor with compelling and cinematic tales that inspire, not entertain for two hours? <br /> <br /> Technically, this is a nasty movie.
