Like a film fan, White Noise was the ultimate disappointment because the filmmaker was pretty good at film, well-lit, good camera work, a reasonable direction. But when it came to film, it was just predictable, like all the other so-called "horror films" that the market recently flooded. Although it had a little "flour factor", the whole E.V.O (Electronic Voice Phenomena) concept didn't seem credible. This film did not explain the reasons for certain events, but went on with them. Action was far from being remembered as the main character did not feel emotions like many recent thrillers / horror films. .
