Before watching this movie, I had very low expectations and just went to see the cars. Finally I lost even for that reason. The plot is almost non-existent. Character formation is non-existent. There were so many clich√©s in the film and so much jaw dropping when I looked and thought about how to release it. If not exotic, I wouldn't even appreciate that movie. 1. The Uniform Storyline Experiment destroys the absurdity of this elite racing culture and its members. In fact, the plot of the film is so predictable and easy to understand that the average child could predict most of the story. Bad performance, bad plot, bad jokes, bad movie. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it. Instead, play Gran Turismo HD and relieve your thirst for sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste.
