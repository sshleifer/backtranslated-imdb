It's on the list of the worst movies I've ever seen at Starz on Demand. They seem to take every straight DVD crap-fest they can find and put here. <br /> <br /> Why? Who knows! Apparently, anyone with a digital camera and a catfight can come with a horror movie and put on the TV. Frankly, it seemed terrible from the moment I saw the trailer - but I gave him a real chance. <br /> <br /> I always try to open minded low budget films. Some of the best films I've ever seen were movies that worked on their small budget or, in other cases, only demanded that little budget to make it big. <br /> <br /> It's not one of those movies. > <br /> You know the plot now, I'm sure you read it. Did you hear it from Starz on demand or for some reason that you got bored of this page. It's about a pathetic and tiny girl we all introduce in an incredibly bad "heavy metal" music video in 3 minutes. Anyone who puts it together must think it was really interesting, but it really isn't. Anyway, he kills himself. Then he has someone. Then some killing begins. It is really unememable and as average and boring as possible. When the first blow in his apartment turns off, it sounds pretty serious about the popcorn opening piece. Was it the best sound effect they could come up with? I could find a better sound effect that could be used for free, without copyright on the internet ... right. now. <br /> <br /> Don't let other reviews say it's a 10-star movie. They are probably either movie distributors or maybe even worth buying a buyer who is trying to think of you with this spam. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous.
