"CIA Codename: Alexa" is the absolute terrible hang of Luc Besson's classic "La Femme Nikita" (1990). The film is basically about a woman who is being trained and trained by the CIA and is forced to do a secret mission. (Quite the same story about the structure of La Femme Nikita) Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson is perhaps the worst in cinema history. Lamas "acting" is just a bad Steven Segal. Watching Orental in this movie is an extraordinary experience. <br /> <br /> Writing and displaying in a movie is so poor as it is ridiculous. There are so many "movies" in the movie that are ridiculous: unnecessary car explosions, glass windows, terrorists, bad ponytails, and so on. The musical result is similar to David Michael Frank's "hard to kill" (1990), which promotes the theme of Steven Segal. The film has a lot of martial arts and it is pretty well done for low-budget American production. Unnecessary action and the top actor never let up, and I have to admit that I was a little entertained. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo Lamas was at the beginning of the 1990s looking like action stars, but he is definitely not a business star, so he does soap operas and doesn't act as blockers. My suggestion is to skip "CIA Codename: Alexa" and check "La Femme Nikita" instead.
