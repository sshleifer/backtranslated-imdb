I loved the first two films, but this movie was just a waste of time and money (for me and for the studio). I still wonder why they made this terrible movie. With a plastic gun and a toy car that can go to another house, the thing is ridiculous. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the first two films were so funny, but its terrorists are so stupid and not funny. Believe me, this movie is just a waste of time.
