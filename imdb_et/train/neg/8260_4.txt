First of all, I would like to point out that although I am not an expert, the way in which the trial is handled is offensive to your intelligence. Firstly, the Prosecutor's Office has never proved that "facilitated learning" actually works. It is irresponsible not to prosecute (because they can get a complaint) or to defend it. As another observer said, simplified learning turns out to be wrong. Secondly, they used Terry as a translator with a personal interest and even a testimony that is just stupid. If the court had given her a testimony in this way, they would have brought someone neutral, otherwise they would only ask for a complaint. Thirdly, this child has never been asked by the prosecutor's office about specific questions about the defendant (birthmarks, event details, etc.) and even if questions related to defense issues, as it began, were not answered. If this is not a reasonable suspicion, then I do not know what the competent lawyer would have been and the acquittal. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, it starts well when you get pressure on parenting. autism, but the study makes this movie completely incredible.
