It should be assumed that those who praised this film ("the greatest filmed opera ever", did I not read anywhere?) Do not care about opera, do not care about Wagner or care about it except for their desire to appear cultured. In depicting both Wagner's bone song and film, it is a disgraceful disaster for me, the reading of which reads from the tricky and amazing realization of the text. <br /> <br /> It is questionable that people who have ideas about what an opera (or, therefore, a Shakespeare game, especially one game) is about, should be allowed near a theater or film studio; Very fashionable, but without the smallest justification for Wagner's text, Syberberg decided that Parsifal is a "bisexual" integration, so that the title characterizes a kind of beatnik babe in the last stages, although the one who continues to sing high tenor - few when the artists are singers, and we get double a dose of Armin from Jordan, a conductor regarded as the face of Amfort (but not audible), also appears in this monstrous double exposure, such as Batonzilla or conductor Who plays Ate Monsalva while playing great Friday music - where, incidentally, the transcendental love of nature is represented by the insecurely placed, uncomfortable crocheted crocheting. lawn, practical, that disturbs me. In theater, we sometimes have to think about such shortcomings, but I can't think of why Syberberg was unable to sow lushly for Parsifal and Gurnemanz, like the sound of music for Julie Andrews. Sound is hard to tolerate, especially high voices and trumpets with a phonetic glare that adds to the tiredness of our impatience by ritual infatuation and paralytic opening. In the second review, someone mentioned Bayreuth's 1951 record and Knappertsbusch, although his pace is often very slow, what Jordan was lacking, pulsation, a sense of musical momentum and flow - and after half a century, orchestral sound in this set, modern pressing is still better than this movie.
