I've seen a lot of horror in my horror, all of which were absurdly bad, but no one gets deeper than what the trash can itself do. This film made me nervous and nervous when I watched it, because I tried to film my head. Now, after I see it, I understand what is going on and why, but the film itself is just confusing to be enjoyable when you watch it. Yes, there are scenes of habitual violence, one of the linings that show the despair of their symbols ("The road belongs to me ... ME!"), And enough nudity to "distract us" from the plot enough, but still leave this movie alone and away , like a puppy who has no longer wanted and stays in the box.
