This movie deserves more than 1. But I give him one because so many fricken fans have given it 10, which results in he gets a rating that takes it to the top ten list. Seriously, it's not as big as not so bad. It is a silly cult class with so many fears of boys when it is ridiculous. These are the types that probably still laugh with Chuck Norris and still say, "I'm rick in ja b! Tch" No matter how old or annoying it gets. I'm afraid I need to hear "I'm tired of the MFn snakes on this MFN plane," from the idiots that are now trying to be funny. Its crappy plot nonsense to act etc. Okay, love a bad movie, but you still have to admit your bad movie. <br /> <br /> Wait for the naval star John Cena to see the real movie
