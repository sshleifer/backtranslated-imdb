NATIONAL LAMPOON CLASS REUNION was a flop when it was released. It didn't stay in my metropolitan theaters for a long time. Why? Because it's BAD !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not bad good but bad really painfully uncomfortable. The total number of actors was mostly unknown and has remained unknown since turkey. <br /> <br /> The idea is really great (parody of slasher-valves), but filling is completely incomplete. Just avoid this "comedy". Your time is more expensive than spending nanosecond watching it embarrassingly wrong.
