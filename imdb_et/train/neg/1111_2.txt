The story of Johnny Rivers was the only big thing in this movie. Unfortunately, this is all positive, which I can say about this Western film. I have to write another 8 lines to post comments, but there are more than 8 lines in this western part. I'm not sure if the film was a tribute to Hopa Along or just a scam. The hero and villain of this movie were too plastic. Not at all realistic. Many of the actors supporting this movie seemed authentic, but the shooting places were a joke. The previous commentator thought this film was great, and in his comments President took a look at Bush. It was not democratic or Western. It was just a bad Western movie that was sold commercially. I don't know if it made money. Sometimes I thought I was watching a movie made by college film students. If that was the case, it was a great movie.
