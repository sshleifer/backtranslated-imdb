The concept of the legal crown of Love Crimes contributes to about 10% of the film's appeal; the remaining 90% may be due to being dirty. To say that the activities of Sean Young as a "district prosecutor" are wood, it is very difficult. With its blissful suits and redundant hair tongues, Young is doing a decent job to convince the audience of his devoted hatred for men. Why else would he ask his only friend to be a prostitute so he could arrest the police officers trying to pick them up? This anger is also the only reason why he effortlessly perverts a photographer who gives women the power of consensus and the motive of this fucking film. Watching the young from cold perfect nudity is of little interest, but the mourning by the lake is fire. Looking at his bead and rave for his own dignity and sexual frustration, Love Crimes is worth a rental fee, but it's all down and forth. Despite his desire to bring Patrick Bergin to justice, his police skills completely escape his own tired lust and passion. Patrick Bergin does enough work as a slimy sociopath; when she worked with Sleeping With Enemy, it is sure if hell can work with it. But I can hardly wonder if the noticeable energy shortage Young brings the film into conflict with its slowness. I think it is and the result is a "thriller" whose excitement is profoundly bad and yet comedic.
