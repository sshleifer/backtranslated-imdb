Just because someone is under 10 years old doesn't mean they are stupid. If your child loves this movie, you should test it better. I'm surprised how many people can participate in something that turns out to be so bad. This "film" is a digital indulgence and nothing else. Writing is terrible. I can't remember having heard such a bad dialogue. The songs are scared. Action is a sub-parity, but the participants were not given much. Who decided to work for Joey Fatone? She can't sing and she's as ugly as sin. <br /> <br /> The worst is everything. Just as the writers went out of their way to make it as stupid as possible. Large children's films have been evil, intelligent and perfect films in recent years, such as Shrek and Toy Story, Willie Wonka and The Witches, to mention two past. However, American American persistent stupidity fell more than getting into finding a Nemo (yes, that's right), a recent Charlie & Chocolate Factory and eye-catching garbage like Red Riding Hood.
