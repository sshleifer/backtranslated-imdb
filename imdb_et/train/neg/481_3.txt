Every time a film is so short-sighted that it wants to give a specific ending or a perspective that it just doesn't interfere with the actual story, it's annoying. These are the films where the end or point of view is first prepared and the story is simply grasped. For this reason, we often talk about "jumping through the hoops" when it revolves, trying to advance in vain in a logical way. <br /> <br /> The Comet Over Broadway story doesn't just jump through the hoops, it's a three-round circus. It's so ridiculous, so ill-conceived, so unpleasant, that if you are prone to speak the screen loudly, then you will continue to quite a lot before that. <br /> <br /> The central theme of this scenario cesspool is the woman's choice between family and profession. Since all this is so terribly confusing, it gets offensive to people in both opinions. So the story does not make any sense at the end, the subject becomes irrelevant, and, as is often the case with bad scenarios, the actor does nothing.
