this movie is a lot of drawbacks and that's all I saw. it is painfully long and awful. I saw the whole audience impatient and waiting for it to end. runtime is over 3 hours, which could have been edited in less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The transition between tracks is average. most people admitted they were sitting better waiting to get out. <br /> <br /> Just a funny pocket. ambitious project and below the parameter. govinda will do a fair job, anil door cheated me, rest us as expected. if u r waiting for something close to the babel or love actually then its not where close.
