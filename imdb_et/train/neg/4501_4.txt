True, Paris is a great place. Participants are good. The story is a twisted moral game. Should it be said that if you want someone bad, will everyone hurt others? With a true romance you want you to want a less clich√© than a man who is bored with his wife and is ready for his family and a woman who is OK to encourage him to do so. What if they are decent and Karen Allen shows her body? The characters are still absorbable and deplorable. Perhaps the morality of this story is "you get what you deserve". I'll give him 4, just for quick scanning potential through "male interests" bits.
