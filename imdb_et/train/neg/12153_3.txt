Feeding The masses were just another movie that was trying to make a little money from the zombie madness that goes around, mainly thanks to movies like the Land of The Dead and the Resident Evil series. <br /> <br /> It starts with a television station guarded by the army and reports that the Lazarus virus (zombies) is close to isolation, and the city may soon be doing its business again. The problem is that it is completely wrong. Zombies run tremendously and only a small percentage of people are aware. Among these are the camera man Torch (William Garberina), Sherry (Rachael Morris), the leading anchor woman (who for some reason is listed on Shellyna's website) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), their military escort. The flashlight and Sherry are against people lying, but the station is run by a secret service (or some other government agency) and they are heavily censored. <br /> <br /> This film gives the patent "Hiding the Cell" on the back: "We keep FEADING THE MASSES higher than George A. Rombero's three" dead "films". The source of this quote has lost all credibility with me. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that this movie is BAD. I don't mean bad, as I expected more (I probably was), but I mean bad that I didn't find any redeeming qualities in the movie. Working in all parts is either over or too clean. Did anyone remember their rows or do they read smart cards? I can't even think of the best part of the movie or the best actor / actor. There really wasn't one. If I had to give someone, I would say Roger, the military escort was probably the most interesting character, but it doesn't speak much. <br /> <br /> I should recommend passing this movie to the top of the box, which is pretty good (that was what originally pulled me into the movie). 3/10
