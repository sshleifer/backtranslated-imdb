This is the worst show I've seen for years. I believe it must be removed from T.V because of its slowdown. It's as stupid as I got to see it. (although I've never looked at it because it's poor poverty) \ tGoofs: When a mac says he can eat sugar, he eats sugar in another episode. Almost everyone in the world is sugar !!! In the episode "Eddie Monster", when he turns to Terrance twice for PLUS, he doesn't fall down when he falls. What a stupidity. I can't even say the word Fosters Home. I even made a song with my band about how this show has slowed down. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
