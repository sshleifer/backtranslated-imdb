I rented "New Best Friend", hoping for a movie similar to a nice teen thriller like "Gossip" and "Curve". Instead, "New Best Friend" is much more similar to "In Crowd", where there is no excitement and the actor is incredibly fake. "New Best Friend" is boring and movie events are the same. Leave this movie ... it's a waste of time.
