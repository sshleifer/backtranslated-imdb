does anyone think this exhibition actually helps some people or does it only hate people who watch it? when I have to strike through the channels and come to this show half way to look at the curious curiosity. I understand that pat Roberson is not all together. What I do not know is if his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they have a better life when they listen to what he has to say. pat Roberson has little effect. he is an old man who thinks in the old way. fear of fear no longer has the same effect as God. Now, if anyone please answer my question, I'll give the light bulbs forever.
