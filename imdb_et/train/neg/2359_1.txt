It was supposed to be the last Freddy movie (and it was over 10 years) - you think they would have tried to make a good movie. But they proved to us the worst (and it says a lot). The plot didn't make any sense (I don't remember it seriously), all the main characters were idiots (really wanted them dead) and Freddy wisecracks were even worse than usual. The only good thing from this was Johnny Depp's short (and funny) comet (the first "Nightmare" movie was his first). <br /> <br /> I also saw it in the theater at last as Freddy's childhood) was 3-D. Well - 3-D had faded faded colors and the picture went and didn't focus. The three flying skulls that were supposed to be scary (in my opinion) were the opposite of my audience. EVERYTHING was crushing a laugh. The 2-D TV is even worse on the TV. Nonsense and stupid - also very boring. Leave it out and see "Freddy vs Jason" again.
