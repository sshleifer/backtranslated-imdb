From the first moment, this "thing" is just a terrible and blurry blurry picture. Although the whole plot has all the thriller options, the story is said to be unable to buy it. There is no point in the middle of the characters in the middle of the movie. Stop reading to avoid SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> For example, Ed's idea that Edna's coffee would be prepared after taking his son's hand down his alleged experience; it's just a very stupid idea. Domino, who does not question the fragmented orders received from Claremont Williams that broke through the phone; shouldn't he have long doubt that Williams will turn them on? These FBI agents seem to see only one helicopter that they have reason to consider a capital mafia shooting. Moreover, what they do, by keeping information and leaking against Cigliutti, is very much inciting the murder; I like to say goodbye to justice when it is the way the FBI is investigating. In reality, if they acted like that, they would be confused. We see a car accident that would normally have been at least seriously injured if most passengers were not killed, but left with just a few bruises to admire them. On the contrary, the accident is immediately followed by Domino, who loves Choco, which is somehow founded by Domino from previous events, but just by the eyes. Based on Claremont Williams's phone call, I think I want to be as dramatic as shameful. This, combined with terrible, restless work, just makes a piece to hesitate to call the movie. I am sorry for the wasted efforts of the main players whose talent is questionable.
