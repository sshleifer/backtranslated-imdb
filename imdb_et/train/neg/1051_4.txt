Although Frank Loess's songs are some of the best Broadway has to offer, they are Joseph und Mankiewicz's unforgettable performance and uninspired presentation - if it is over, hardly feel you have been watching musical. Mankiewicz does not seem to know how to present Loesser's sophisticated but vocal melodies for maximum effect: for example, one of the best numbers, showing the "Adelaide Lament" exhibition, taking Adelaide's (Vivian Blaine) belt in the final sitting room; and Stubby Kaye faux-spiritual `Sit Down, You're Rockin 'Ship' is your bark sitting folding chairs when it just stands there. Mankiewicz pulls out all the fun things by letting static scenes go too long, and his dialogue (adapted from Abe Burrows's performance book) is not something his "All About Eve" films have. Part of the guilty must go to the drivers, almost everyone who is in trouble: Marlon Brando is confused about why his music is, Frank Sinatra is playing too nice a guy and he has no edge that makes him so important (songs are not tailored to his style) and Jean Simmons barely registers the possible registration of Shirley Jones. Only Blaine, like a loving showgirl Adelaide, orders our attention as a Broadway pro. The colorful artistic direction is by Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol created flashy sets.
