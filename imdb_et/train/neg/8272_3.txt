At the end of "Dragon Heat" I can think of why I was watching the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The film's premise is interesting and - as well as Maggie Q - attracted me to the film. But I was never disappointed. Writer-director Daniel Lee cannot wear a candle with John Woo, Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen. <br /> <br /> It must be one of the most irritating films I've ever seen. Lee is so visual - and I use this phrase incredibly loosely - to fill the film with totally unnecessary black-and-white photos, freezing shots, slow motion, fast motion and other visual useless. I think he did everything to compensate for the lack of style or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Action scenes are nothing special and play like some hopped-up music video more than anything else. No matter what character you have to take care of - including two supposedly professional snipers who were unable to hit the table from the inside! - who are then burdened with some of the most exciting dialogue I've seen in one of these Hong Kong actors. <br /> <br /> The plot lacks any kind of turnaround - from the initial setup all sounds predictable - and Lee feels the need to leave us back to the characters when we didn't get it for the first time. It is terribly amateur writing and making movies and wasting Sammo Hung, Michael Biehn and Maggie Q talents. Although frankly I am bothered to remember Biehn in any good films that James Cameron has not directed. <br /> <br /> If you really have a good Hong Kong actor mood, you are much better off with some clips - John Woo "The Killer" (1989) and "Hard-Boiled" (1989). 1992), Ringo Lam's "City on Fire" (1987) - which Quentin Tarantino stole "Reservoir Dogs" (1992) - or his "Point Blank" (1967) remake of "Full Contact" (1992). Or even check Yuen "so close" (2002), a very fun but unnatural popcorn. And there is always a terrible French policeman, "The Nest" (2002). <br /> <br /> True, most, if not all, are a bit over-the-top, but they were movies that are exciting, exciting and even stopping. They have characters we care about and desperate sequences of action. <br /> <br /> "Dragon Heat", on the other hand, is just terribly mediocre. The problem is that Lee hasn't made a bad action film, he's been bored.
