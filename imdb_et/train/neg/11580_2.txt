If you want to see the concept, don't look at it. Although there are elements directly from Elmore Leonard's territory, it is closer to the "dynasty" episode, as the filmmaker focuses on "character development" - ie long and eternal conversations with fools who are not involved. Some people can make interesting movies without real action (see "Exotica") but not. Avoid this, especially if you like the participants.
