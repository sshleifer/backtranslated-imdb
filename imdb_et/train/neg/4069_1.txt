Holy God! (and what comes from the atheist) is this "movie" bad! <br /> <br /> A lot has already been said (those who rated this topic 3 and below) to which I fully agree, I just want to add a few things: <br /> <br /> between the three men they had to eat their end products of the digestive tract, began to grind the ax, dragging the bones, that their balls were blown away - the former boyfriend suffers from the worst torture, as he has to listen to the endless and pointless stroke of girls on the kitchen table love). <br /> <br /> The director cut out the point and endless graveyard and the inverted scenes, our suffering would be over in 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only things that made this flick at least somewhat tolerant are Emily Haack's tits (one point). <br /> <br /> Forget about it. buy it off. don't waste your time. and your peace of mind. my brain is so cooked after I watch it. Do I feel it is imperative to look (and suffer)?
