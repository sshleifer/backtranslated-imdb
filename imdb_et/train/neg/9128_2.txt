Even if nobody knew that the sellers were badly healthy during the filming and lived before the movie was released, DR. FU MANCHU would be a painful viewing. This is said to be Sax Rohmer's famous oriental cable lamp, but there is no focus. The potential of the satirical comments of the anti-Oriental record of the Rohmer concept is ignored. Indeed, the film uses racist insults. In fact, there are hardly any jokes or gags, but mostly actors who behave idiotically and suffer harsh lines. Particularly sharp is that Sid Caesar is forced to laugh at trials and pulling out racial nerves. Most other participants also torture themselves. <br /> <br /> Then there is Peter Sellers. He plays double tasks in the dark Fu Manchus, who is trying to design a formula to restore his youth and his lousy British enemy Nayland Smith. Sellers are not one hundred percent bad; he transmits peculiar heat as Smith when he discusses his fetishist assertion on his lawn mower, and he moves too much like Manchu when he expresses his love for the English music hall entertainment. But mostly he plays both roles with tired grimacing, thus sabotaging even more comic. Particularly tormenting are the routines of sellers, where they revive their fading power with electric shocks; he seems too convincing to be funny. <br /> <br /> Some really funny features, Burt Kwouki (Cato PINK in PANTHER films), one of the Manchu minions, and Helen Mirren's fun musical numbers won't save that confusion. If someone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is considered a comic genius, they don't learn anything about DR. FU MANCHU.
