This movie is a classic mood, not the quality of film making. It is unlikely to move from unlikely to unrealistic to ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The incredible plot revolves around the attempt of two British soldiers and Hindu giants to rescue a third soldier who has hit the insurgent Indians. In a later scene, we see a complete regiment with drum and bagpipes that drive into the ambush. The British army did not order a sergeant rescue operation and if you miss it, he will not catch it with only one other soldier and an Indian servant if he has a full regiment. Indian rebels are so incredibly inaccurate that they are ridiculous ... there are hundreds, but they can't hold a prisoner or kill two rescuers. At one point, we see British soldiers throwing stones off rebels who are scattered around the mountain ... one should be an eggplant for the brain to think it would do any harm. When Cary Grant is released as a prisoner, she is on the floor looking at the water boy ... hardly the actions of the people who have been taken off. The waterboy blows bravely (which comes from somewhere) that the horn ... it does, standing on a high wall to be seen and photographed by bad guys. Trying to make more notes when he has repeatedly fired, and the bugle speech breaks down into weak aft ... instead of blowing a bugle, hiding behind the cover than someone with half the brain. This scene is dignified in comedy sketches. If they wanted to make Buster Keaton's comedy, they would have had to hire Keaton and do it better.
