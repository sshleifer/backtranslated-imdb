If someone who lived through and remembers this decade alive, if the actual 70s were half funny and (semi) normal, they would have been so much more enjoyable. The actual children of that time did not act or behave as close as the children did, so bright and normal. The young people were still under the influence of hippies and drug cultures under the 60s rebellions, that it was born, especially in the Behavioral Department, tenderness, mystery, self - justice, childhood, their unreasonable - no character shows it. <br /> <br /> somebody compared to "happy days" and I understand why: they were both sitcoms that took place 20 years before the current time they were broadcast, and they both only provide surface, piano images of real ages , not even close to its full extent, but show the obvious things - fashion, toys, music, contractions, etc. and that's it. For those too young people who remember or were not born, trust me, the 70s were not such that "Happy Days" were like the "50s" because "M * A * S * H ​​*" didn't exactly describe US Army medical base of life. Korean War, etc.
