I don't usually feel great interest in movies that I don't like to comment on, but in that case I just have to say something. This movie is terrible, illogical and stupid. There are so many mistakes in storytelling that I don't even feel obliged to work because I have time to move on from this experience. The most irritating point, however, is that no one explains the film at some point, whether the madness of Bacon's character is due to a race or physiological reaction to his condition. Effects are impressive and in the past Paul Verhoeven has done good things (cutting director Robocop on DVD is great). But this movie is stupid and generally does not go into explaining its content or technical aspect, but settles for predictable action without pleasure. <br /> <br /> In short, so many other reviews here (I wish I had read them before ...) - stay away from this movie!
