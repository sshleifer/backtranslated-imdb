Although some of the training scenes were realistic, too many of them were military instructors as former Nazi types. Obviously, the people who wrote the screen were anti-war or wrote a movie to the audience. <br /> <br /> I am a Vietnamese vet, and even during this time, military instructors who acted so some of them probably took time in the military prison. <br /> <br /> And I really loved a scene where the "hero" and his friend (both privates) sit in the captain's office, smoking cigarettes and talking, and communicating with the captain as his friend. Such a thing never happened in training or in a formal situation like the goal of the scene. <br /> <br /> Finally, I asked myself, "What was that movie?" because it seemed that it didn't look all over the place without focusing, except: "I hate all power." Thanks to God, I got it from the library and didn't pay to rent it.
