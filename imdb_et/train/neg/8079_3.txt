Another interesting assumption and some wonderful special effects that go directly to the trash can be boring. <br /> <br /> Bored of direction and performances (except for lovely Annabel Schofield, who is a cozy brunette and probably deserves better material and ever more serious Charlton Heston) earns a real stinker rating. <br /> <br /> Heston is amazing to watch his usual para and show when the movie is very bad. He even plays in a sub-plot that interests me to see how it fits into the main line of the movie. The way they ended was that they didn't. It just ends. <br /> <br /> Really. Don't waste your time on it.
