Mike Brady (Michael Garfield, who played a small part in the classical "The Warriors" class) is the first person in the community to realize that his small town has slaves of murderers. Not only any hunger, remember, but a carnivorous killer that is larger than normal mutates with knives of toxic waste (who are still moving as fast as normal hunger, which is not so scary, but I'm landing). Nobody believes him first, but they do. Oh, yeah, they do it. <br /> <br /> OK, the killer slippers are right above the psychotic gaps and right under the winters of Johnathon when Mork's child is scary. Thus, the absurdity of all this is quite clear. The flick is somewhat fun and is so bad that it is good. I appreciate that they clarified that it was slugs: film, not slugs: children's game or slugs: another white meat. Obviously, it is not worth watching more than once and forgetting it, except for a fairly hidden trivia game. Director Juan Piquer Sim√≥n is more widely known for his previous films "Pod People" (mocked by MST3K) and "Peices" (which is most likely the darkest film ever made). <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Rose Shows T&A <br /> <br /> My Class: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Accessories: Theatrical Trailer Only
