The final game started well, the least was said finally, the better. things seemed to happen to keep the plot ahead, for example, a reporter who is originally a very curious, intelligent person, half through something really stupid and completely out of character, is not the reason given to us besides the next scene would be meaningless without it. The whole story could have been talking in about 30 minutes, it would have made the central TV political drama. The bright Cuban Gooding Jr, however, is very observable and James Woods is doing an amazing job. <br /> <br /> The end game was honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen ...... and that says something I've seen in Gigli.
