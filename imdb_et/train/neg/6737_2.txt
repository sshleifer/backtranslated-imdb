If Deborah Messing was not already "Grace", it could be an acceptable film. But this is just another story of the frustrated spinster hiring a paid sender (Dermot Mulroney), he reads a magazine from the magazine article to travel to London for his sister's London wedding. How new is this plot? <br /> <br /> It is not a funny or romantic romantic wedding day that lies in the story of the bride and the best man's deceptive sex and pays for the escorts to leave Hugh as the four weddings, and surely the deadly naive groom who doesn't know his bride (Amy Adams) Sexual History. When Messing has perfected the repressed princess, 30 - a woman who has failed relationships is her neurotic and drunken yet another faux beau just repeating her TV series. If this woman is an actress, get a role that may not be highlighted again. <br /> <br /> A lot of intoxicated female ties, cricket jokes and Mulroney's towel (nice!), but the film is an obvious happy ending. Expected Messing Sequence: The Date of Divorce.
