This is my first movie review of IMDb. I was forced to register after watching this movie. I can't allow a good conscience to make this movie look like me. People must be warned! <br /> <br /> First of all, my rating is: 0 (like zero) <br /> <br /> I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weist and Christopher Walken, but I hated this movie. There is a plot, but who cares if there is no script. Dialogue is unrealistic and plain boring, situation formation, the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary, characters are atypical and uninteresting, and the story, though based on a good premise, is stupid. This movie is a piece of poo. <br /> <br /> Don't forget that wasting this movie money is not even worth your time to watch it. Please don't see it ... I ask you!
