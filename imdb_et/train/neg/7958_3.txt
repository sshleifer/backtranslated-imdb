Protégé runs linearly; do not expect quick action, nor do you find yourself eaten with breath because there are no moments of sitting-edge. <br /> <br /> Not much mood, so don't wait for it. I do not blame the actor - the example would have been the worst, if not the Wu actor, the only rescue arm of the film. And, this cute little girl too. <br /> <br /> Humor is at best weak at best, and the show must also be an anti-drug campaign using standard shock tactics (esp scenarios with Zhang) to tell us what we already know - that is, drugs break families, heroin drives you crazy, it's not so easy to wean, you get into a vicious circle. <br /> <br /> I know it may sound a little harsh, but I feel that the show is far from smooth and somewhat uneven (* SPOILER ALERT *: Take, for example, Andy Lau to the police station: what? all the tapes and evidence against you since 1997, ”and this is how he got caught. No, no chase-driving, but jump-scene, which damaged Wu's role as a secret.) I suspect that the lack of creativity is due to the fact that it is finally the production of the Singapore-based production company Mediacorp Raintree.
