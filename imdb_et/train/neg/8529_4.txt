Which MOBM boy thought it would be a good idea to place a plaque on Clark Gable's Salvation Army employee role? Ironically, another beautiful future star, Cary Grant, also played the Salvation Army Man just two years later with a highly rated SHE DONE HIM WRONG. I think it is quite easy to see the stupidity of these roles in retrospect, but I still don't know if the WHO thought the Salvation Army boys were "hot" and could look at these shameful men and see them as a realistic representation of the parts they played. A long time ago, I worked for the Salvation Army (American Volunteers) sister organization, and I never saw any female men there (and it contains me unfortunately). Maybe I should have worked with the Salvation Army! <br /> <br /> So for the most curious, it's a good movie to take care of, but for everyone else, it's a bad writing, a sloppy dialogue and annoying moralization that makes a very slow movie.
