Russian film "4" follows three (not four) strangers who meet in one night at a local bar. One of them is a musician, a seller of frozen meat and one professional girl. <br /> <br /> "4", I collect, is meant to present the Soviet Russia's positive life and hopelessness. make stories to make their life more interesting than they really are), but the film is so inconsistent and boring that I seriously doubt that many people can sit through it. The film seems to suggest that the shady Russian government is behind the scenes of certain shady acts - running secret cloning equipment, selling decades of frozen meat, etc. - but the film is both formless and incomprehensible that I doubt anyone can understand what anyone really is here must. <br /> <br /> In spite of proper action and some initiating scenes, "4" is a two-hour endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs.
