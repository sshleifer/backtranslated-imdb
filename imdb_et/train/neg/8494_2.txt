Waiting for a combination of sci-fi and time films from Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, computer history, etc., I was disappointed with the blend of pseudo-science and real and fabulous history of this film. It gives the impression that his writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) does not have a real understanding of the mathematics, technology or history of the film, but instead works on a fuzzy artistic impression. This is a painful place for me because I have long been irritated by the tendency of art to astonish and terribly misuse science terms and ideas, such as: Emmy Coer: "The Waves of Information are Half-Time", Ada: "I'm not sure half the life It's better than not life at all. "<br /> <br /> This film makes it worse than entertaining - it provides information. The only redemption value I can imagine is that it can attract the viewer to a topic that is so badly distorted. I think it is more likely to promote superstitious science and technology that has somehow evolved as indistinguishable from magic.
