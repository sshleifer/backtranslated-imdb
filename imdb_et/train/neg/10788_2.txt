And I mean ultra light. This movie has four giant stars, about three and a half jokes and something more distant. bits, most are not very funny. Nor does it work as a novel. How about a romantic comedy? Not in your life. Most of the dialogue is too flat to be complicated, less fun. <br /> <br /> What really is ashamed is not a prerequisite at all. This film could have been so much more, especially in recent years, focusing on some fictional ways of promoting movies, with the false critics of the critics. The film reveals a jet of journalism - all these costs are paid to journalists who almost always write beautiful comments. But instead of exploring what should have been the mother code of jokes, he devotes everything to this territory for about three minutes and moves on to the flat romance of the film. <br /> <br /> The same character with Catherine Zeta-Jones - a scary, self-focused movie star. Zeta-Jones does a good job with what he has given, but has been given practically nothing. It's all homogenized junk that looks very pale compared to some of the things we've heard of stars over the years. John Cusack and Billy Crystal celebrate this dead ship that sucks like "The Love Boat". In fact, as the old joke goes, they should forget and film the script. This would probably be a better story. So, go ahead and tell us the filmmakers what you have in the stars that appeared to them?
