I can not understand for my life why someone does such a movie. The plot is tired, active is tense, language is constantly insecure and at times it seemed that "F" overuse seemed to be a lack of dialogue, "throw another pair" F ", the American public wants to hear. and it seemed part of it. Forget it c__p, rent "Shrek" and enjoy a laugh.
