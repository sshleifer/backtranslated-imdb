It reminded SOO a lot of Michael Winner's "dirty weekend" with this dreadful English budget. <br /> <br /> First of all, I have to say I'm a fan of both exploitation and a serious movie. I appreciate, say, "Demented" is its meaningless and "Last House on the Left" because it is shameless brutality. And all the numerous inventive and more brutal Italian spin-offs. <br /> <br /> It was, however, pointless. Like the British Budget Director, I thought "let's be a reorganization" when I dare not bury this grave when fears have returned to the hostel in fashion. <br /> <br /> The whole thing just doesn't hang or is a point. What is the daughter of the rapists? Why trouble a man as a security camera expert? Crappy.
