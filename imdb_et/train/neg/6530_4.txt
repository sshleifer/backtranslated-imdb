Before we reach the Red Planet, we have an entertaining romantic patter between Mohr and scientist Nora Hayden; resident doofus Jack Kruschen; and Les Tremayne's vision as another scientist who sports a billy goat beard. Mars' external surfaces have fake backgrounds and shades that vary from red to pink? - The Cinemagic process mentioned in the ads. Real cool monsters include a giant amoeba, a three-eyed insect creature, an oversized Venus Fly-Trap, and an unforgettable rat / bat / spider. The whole weird adventure reminds the survivor of Hayden's hypnotic drugs. ANGRY RED PLANET is known to have a fairly cult and probably started receiving most of its admirers during the psychedelic sixties.
