"Washington Square" is a flat, filthy novel by Henry James. Indeed, the novel is very good, but far from the level of James masterpieces. Moreover, it seems that this simple, eventless story is not suitable for making it into a movie (although William Wyler and his "The Heiress" gave a beautiful novel version in 1949. In the novel, Catherine Heroine is shy, not very attractive and somewhat cumbersome, but she is still a sound, intelligent young woman and she is not as naive as it may seem. Three-quarters of the film seems to be Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a mentally slow, poor affair. The story has been added by two vulgar scenes, the first, when Catherine has a nervous child, is worried about her vesica, another scene when we see a kind of outdoor brothel in the background uds take their customers behind tents, etc. Nothing can be contrary to the spirit and artistic ideals of Henry James. It is notorious that the writer was extremely decent and weak even for the Victorian era. I don't believe anyone to find any thickness in the thousands of pages of James' enormous literary production. I was really particularly annoying about these two scenes. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know the director needs reasonable freedom in adjusting the novel screen. But if the director completely ignores or misunderstands the author's art (here, Henry James), I don't see his work being used to make a bad film. <br /> <br /> Action is enough for the film: poor and flat, despite the talents of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. "Washington Square" is definitely an unwanted movie.
