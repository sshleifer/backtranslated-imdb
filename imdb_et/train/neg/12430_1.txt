Home Alone 3 is one of my least favorite films. It is a crop cream or s *** if they tend to be more cynical because it is located there (or below) things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it might even be worse than the two because these two, at least impressively, made me laugh at their stupidity. It just made me constantly painful and hit when credit started. No other film has made the pain painful. Now, let me note exactly why this movie is so incredibly cruel. <br /> <br /> First, the plot is ridiculous. It rotates with a chip on the remote control (?!), Which is misplaced and how these terrorists want it. Dumb stuff. <br /> <br /> The action that is taking place is similar to the other two home zones, boobytraps and everything, but watching these boobytrape performs is instead of being funny, incredibly unpleasant to look at. I wasn't laughing (or even so much smile) when I teased and hoped the terrorists would laugh. The bird, rather than providing comic relief, was unpleasant and annoying. By acting like a lot of names, it extends from the poor to the fear. There's no good work here. Alex D.Linz is absolutely unlikely and uncomfortable as a child, while terrorists are acting (and deciding on their credit, searching) because they are quickly taken out of the street ... and well, that's it. <br /> <br /> I see some people saying, "Man, it's kids. Don't do that, man." Well MAN, kids can like it, but they get much better. See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before you consider it. Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (which suck - see these reviews more) are better! So, in short, it is a ruthlessly cruel movie. It was clearly recycled for money because it broke the first two; the only thing is that it also offends the first two. No person, child or otherwise should find any reason for Home alone 3. Ever. That's bad. <br /> <br /> Stars
