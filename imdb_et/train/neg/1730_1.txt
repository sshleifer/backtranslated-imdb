First of all, I would like to point out that I only know the exhibition because my younger sister always monitors it. I find it the most annoying on TVs. Something fun is not funny and canned laughter is unbearable. The exhibition would work much better than filming in front of a live audience. So laughter would look just like the show is unusual. But I appreciate the talents of the young cast actors. But it's sick to think that they will look back at the show in the future and see how bad their first TV show was. Show links well with CBBC performers' general distracting voices and styles. Why do today's young people have to shout so much that it is outside of me. That is all.
