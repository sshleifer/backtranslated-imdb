... this guy doesn't move Bard badly. It's still a terrible minimalist production, Hamlet's Dutch uncle is inexplicably spoken by the Spaniards (be it Ricardo Montalban or not) and Maximilian Schell is moving like never before. Most of the dialogue makes it a failure and the fact that the MST3K version is required to repeatedly emphasize that calls are long * duh * doesn't hit me incredibly humorous. For the most part, it is just a bad act.
