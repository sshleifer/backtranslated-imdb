There is no dignified scene. <br /> <br /> Amy Adams is always the worst performer. Proof that you can start anywhere. The boy who plays Sebastian also sucks. He doesn't even look at Ryan Phillipe. More like Joshua Jackson. The other two girls are also terrible. <br /> <br /> Then the dialogue is nasty. <br /> <br /> Sebastian (about three): If you can't hit them ... <br /> <br /> Virgin Girl: Who says you can't win? <br /> <br /> Lame. <br /> <br /> The end is in conflict with the entire original plot. The first film clearly states that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons why Sebastian wanted Kathryn to be so bad, besides being played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, was that she was "the only girl she couldn't and killed". He was a bully who likes him. The fact that he never gave it to him increased his wish. Then it means P.O.S.s that he can have him with the girl's side. What? And we don't even see sex. This means that it is not only stupid, pointless and contradictory, but also worthless. And first, Kathryn pushes Sebastian back because he fell in love, making him loser. Even if he won the bet, he broke his chances. Then he loses that stool and falls in love. So he does not screw the "losers" but the complete losers? Another thing: it is said that Sebastian is never in love, so what do you call Virgin Girl? <br /> <br /> Finally, it turned out that the virgin girl is suddenly a lover of dirty dun dun dun and, as I said, they go to the flat offscreen threesome. Stupid. <br /> <br /> There are several other plot contradictions. Did the writer even see the first movie? 5-year-olds can mark their stuff out. <br /> <br /> After the thirties, Sebastian is a sexy virgin who injures her innocent thoughts behind the limousine, while Kathryn and Virgin Girl turned to the evil Lesbian Lame Sudden plot Twist sits in front, listens and smiles into the camera. <br /> <br /> Finally ... <br /> <br /> When Sebastian became the first ass hole, it was an interesting film. I think all of Sebastian's bad work was three with two hot girls. Interesting.
