The original film, Man From Snowy River, is one of the best I've seen, almost perfect. Lady and Tramp Story in Two Minds - Rich Girl / Poor Boy and Ability vs. However, not only is the shameless attempt to use the good name of the original, but also the ridiculous, overwhelmed Disneyfied confusion that is best summarized as "Rambo responds to a black slave." Without black-headed charm. The young hero comes back in 3 years' absence and suddenly he is on Superman horses; in the original, good films he was real and plausible, but unfortunately he reduced it as another caricature. I have barely been so disappointed in the film and sometimes it made me quite angry - they barely missed clich√©s. Manipulation of the Brazilian audience - do studio managers think that everything you have with a horse-loving audience is quite horses in front of them to make them happy? The film's mess.
