This is the worst film I've seen for years! It starts with ridicoule and continues in the same way. When something happens in this movie and it is worse. The end raises it a bit and saves the movie from the entire flop. Mark Wahlberg is a bad movie bad actor. Sorry Tim Burton Batman was good, but it sucks.
