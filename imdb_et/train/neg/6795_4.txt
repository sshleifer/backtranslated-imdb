Comeback begins to look for promising, cruel deaths on the scene with a killer. The mask is also pretty cool and looks almost identical to the 1990's "Granny". Since then, the movie is mostly boring. We get some more deaths that are good again, but they are not enough. The reason why death is so good is that they are tired and bloody. The story behind the movie is actually quite interesting and would have worked very well if it wasn't that boring mostly. <br /> <br /> I would avoid it if you are not a hard collector - here's not enough to make it a medium slip.
