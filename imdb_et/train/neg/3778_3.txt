Decent animation and some realistic character development keep this animated horse at least from DreamWorks ... but it is somewhat slow and the story is a bit stupid. It is interesting to see the roles of typical cowboys and India, but here it just seems to be a political correctness than a decision of the right style. GRADE: C
