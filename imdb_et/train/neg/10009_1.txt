This movie is one huge load. Paul Schrader loses his bad scenario completely. And his leadership is just as comic as he can be without actually being insomnia during the process. But the worst thing is Woody Harrelson, whom I usually like when he is properly cast. He plays a "walker", a homosexual man in D.C., who plays a social companion for the eternal women of the Washington elite. He couldn't have been one-dimensional if he had cut it out of the magazine and jumped over the popcorn around the camera. His "southern accent" is that the "off rack" version, which decrescendos from start to finish, every line he delivers, just like the southern heat and humidity will still drain every energy ounce. It's monotonous. But he is not the worst accent in the film. His "boyfriend", played by Moritz Bleibtreau, tries to influence some Mid East accent that is so clumsy that he can barely give him the bad traits he has written. She is not capable of r riding despite the fact that in real life she is German and speaks several languages ​​- one of them is Italian! This is a good reason why no one else thinks? <br /> <br /> This movie is bad from start to finish from story, scenario, leadership, camera performance to performance. The only acceptable moments in this film were three supporting actors: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three succeeded through this film for their dignity. In fact, all three are excellent, despite the trap of a really bad movie. Unfortunately, nobody could ever be good enough to end this endless series of mistakes. If you like these three actors, check out something else. This movie is not worth your time.
