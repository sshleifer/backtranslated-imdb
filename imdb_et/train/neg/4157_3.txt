The above seemed to be a much more appropriate title if I and my suicidal subjugations decided to look at this modern bull's masterpiece <br /> <br /> Erotic, scary, intense, well-thought out, these are all things that this movie is not about > <br /> However, it is incredibly funny, the slow sound effect and poor duplication add to it one of the greatest comedies I've seen in recent years. And this movie does not even try to be funny and it is one of the great achievements of films, it becomes a comedy even without having to entertain. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, the old man who looks amazingly pleasing Santa Claus is going around the zombies and breaking the vampires into the ground. It made me not to believe in the title of the movies when it was vampires vs. zombies, why didn't the vampires and zombies win? Oh, whatever, besides renting, there were more mistakes than the title. It's like that; There has been a virus in America, creating zombie-like creatures that move a lot like your average tourist. And there are only four zombies in the movie. Another problem besides one store is abandoned everywhere. You will surely see some zombies roaming in the forest or in the background. In fact, I believe they traveled around the forest over and over again because they didn't have a big budget to film in a wider area, or if the director didn't want to shoot their valuable time differently in the woods where he had to sit with a trailer that pulled out such trivial questions . <br /> <br /> In fact, the director was so much fun that he didn't have enough time to hire. big enough or even editor. And so he told the eight cast members to dress like different people, and try not to act remarkably, while I assume he changed his name and randomly snippeted on film rolls "editing is not hard work anyway?" The only reason why this "movie" found our bag was that we somehow got confused with Freddy and Jason, strange how these things happen, it's not. And the only way we did that, though, at night was the fascination of gas masks and their application to our skull to prevent this nausea mess. Oh yes, we created it at the end, but I'm sure it will do a lot if it has lost its common sense ...
