What is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> It starts well in the title order, but it's as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> Film is something that rats become monsters and go to lethal laughter. Action is not so poor, but the script is pointless and the film is not even scary despite atmospheric music. <br /> <br /> It is really amazing that a group of bunches of bags and thought bags would be a good movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie. This is a trash, and I invite you not to go out of your life! One in ten.
