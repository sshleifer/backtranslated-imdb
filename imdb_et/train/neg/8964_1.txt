Those who know the two previous Cube movies know a lot about what they can expect: a small group of people trapped in heaps of trapped rooms, paranoia, bad behavior. It is a little different. Approximately half of the film takes place outside the cube, where we look at people watching the cube (or at least five). <br /> <br /> I think Cube Zero wants to explain what to do with the cube, but you can't really know much more than what was dealt with in the first two films. Of course, there's a sort of explanation, but it looks pretty flat compared to the first movie's recommendation. <br /> <br /> Cube Zero looks quite cheap (as well as its predecessors) and the fact that it shows more than just a few empty spaces just for that feeling. I lost quite firmly saying that there is no risk that any participant will win the prizes in the near future. They have brought back the traps of the cube 1 (that is, they are almost the same as a little shame). <br /> <br /> I know many people will appreciate this movie and its links first, but I just feel that it's a totally unnecessary contribution to a franchise that wasn't that big a start.
