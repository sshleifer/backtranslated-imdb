TYSON <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Wonderful - albeit fairly fair - counting the life and times of the champion boxer Mike Tyson. Given his conviction for rape, the film is cautious not to be portrayed as a hero or as a snare, but to paint warts and everything to his fame, success to pressure, and people who have made their destiny good or bad. Restricting time constraints, the script pulls through relevant details, in the short term, during important events that culminate in Tyson's (temporary) decline in 1995. Beginners will enlighten the chronology, while boxing fans will be entertaining on the direct line-to-material approach of director Uli Edel. He depicts Tyson's life as a circus, in which he finally erred due to the circumstances of his error. In fact, the script leaves the poison most of Tyson's former wife, Robin Givens, who characterizes him as an ungrateful gold digger who exploited his naivety. Production values ​​are evenly strong and excellent: Michael Jai White makes the title character fairly; George C. Scott plays Tyson's mentor Cus D'Amatot through tooth teeth; and Paul Winfield was born to play Don King!
