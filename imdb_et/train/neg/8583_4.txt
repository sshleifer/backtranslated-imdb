The Americans are paying attention to the fruit and if nothing happens in the typical commercial area, we lose interest very quickly. <br /> <br /> I discovered an exciting fact about this movie: someone has to paint high voltage utility poles and do it according to schedule! And don't think they really want to do something else (the viewer has similar feelings). <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, when I was bored watching late night and decided to actually watch this movie, I found the characters interesting and very interesting. <br /> <br /> I just don't watch this much late night TV, so I can't recommend this movie if the drying of color isn't your idea of ​​the exciting two hours of your life.
