NOTE TO ALL DIRECTORS: Long is not necessarily good. This movie is incredibly long. But not good. Scenes were pulled out, so, how, too, too long. Sex scenes were unnecessary and often too long. The movie was edited for up to 2 hours and it would have been exceptional for 10 minutes, but it was so boring that I only get it from 2 out of 10. It is less than average. <br /> <br /> Some of these marathons also have other problems. <br /> <br /> 1) Ralph Fiennes plays all genealogy. The grandfather, who played the grandfather, sees nothing like him, but grandfather, father and son (who gives us a constant unnecessary voice) are all Ralph Fiennes, who has different facial hair and the same basic bullhead personality. No one seems to see every child look like the last clone, even though their images are reviewed every step of the way. It is small, but if the film hadn't been 3 weeks long, it wouldn't be so annoying. 2) The fact that news was not spoken from Germany even for the longest time Jews rounded up and sent out are ridiculous. Some words would have been given to them and the idea of ​​trying to drive would probably have been discussed. Uncle France would definitely have sent a warning to try and leave. 3) The love stories of this movie are totally wrong. You spend forever saying this to us and the development of relations between the main characters is extremely short. Suddenly ... people are in love and almost instantly ... married. Then there are kids. Then we draw things for 6 centuries and forget about developing relationships. It wouldn't be so much stuck in a 2-hour movie, but the time we didn't give us was given. <br /> <br /> 4) The end was just bad. I don't want to spoil it, but you don't like it if you're not sadistic. <br /> <br /> The director / writer should be tortured to watch this bloated garbage a week, I mean endless loop, oop they are the same thing. I don't know if Robert Redford did anything for this movie, I think I think Istvan Szabo must model his leading career after him. Long-drawn film that completely destroys the substances in the film. A short description of the "Horse Whisper" and the sunshine. <br /> <br /> Sunshine, the perfect title. When you look at the sun, it may well be very dark after leaving.
