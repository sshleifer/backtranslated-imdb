After watching this MST3K episode, I have to think about how many movies this film is lending. It seems to combine Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice and at least several other elements. At one point, I really waited for Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. I don't know if the director has a clue how many holes are on the plot. like the fact that although gas is not available, it is abundant in abandoned gas stations and stations are close enough to keep the F1 racing car all over the country.
