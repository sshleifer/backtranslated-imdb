Last weekend, I bought this "zombie movie" from a litter bin and looked at it with my friends, thinking it was a "dead land" budget line. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> They seem to have spent much of their budget on cover art, which is very misleading for fans of the zombie genre. <br /> <br /> We looked at the point where zombie chicks come alive and get into the car with some yuppies who are in the middle of a mobile phone somewhere. They are actually talking to a man before one of the girls kills him; but when they started driving, I couldn't stop my unbelief. Some people think this is "so bad, it's good", they're liars. I didn't finish the movie, but one of the other comments says that they actually become police officers at the end of the movie, so I'm glad that they haven't been watching it all the time. <br /> <br /> It's even worse than "Zombiez" DON'T SEE!
