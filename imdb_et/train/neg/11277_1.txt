There is no doubt that this film is impressive, but unfortunately it does not help with the big deviations of the film. I never understand why directors are asking actors / actors not to use their accents when it is obvious to anyone they can't convince. Fiennes just can't get Irish and Fitzgerald is not much better in Russian. If the voice is wrong, no matter how good the character is, it is never convincing. As for the bigger problem ... was there ...? I think there was some kind of story, but it was so full of holes that I just couldn't wait until the movie ended ... it was ridiculous. Save your life for 90 minutes and don't watch this movie!
