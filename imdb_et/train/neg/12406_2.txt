Treasure Island DVD should be viewed in every movie production! This is a textbook example of how not to film. Watching a movie and then listening to the writer's / director's comments shows graphically the big difference between the characters and what he / she sends to their audience about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I think movies are communication tools, and communication isn't complete if the audience doesn't know what the hell's director is talking about. The director's appeal is to make the film void of Hollywood conventions. Among these conventions, unfortunately, is the consistency of the concept and clarity of the concept. The director himself understands that the audience often does not understand the points he has deliberately prevented from "Hollywood cliché". But he never seems to understand that clichés exist for a reason. These are a brief summary of the quick and clear transmission of complex ideas. They are good to avoid, but they need to be replaced by another way of communicating the same idea, not simply eliminated. The film is based on an intriguing opportunity that is abundant. The two dolls are designed to make the identity and background of an unidentified body used in a misinformation mission at the end of World War II. Soon, everyone will begin to embody their personal fantasies and their invention will become more and more real. Someone who is less disappointed with the traditional "Hollywood Convention" of storytelling can create a great movie with this idea. This movie is definitely not! Dolls do everything they can to ensure the continuity of their characters, but they are too often scanned and confused. Especially I am more and more impressed with Gonzo, who plays the living body. In many muppet films, he stands out as a very charismatic sleep.
