This ridiculous film offers a standard "hippie mentality" of 1970 with a nut shell and drills us in this process. Its endeavor is to rationalize the marriages of innocent women, young, innocent and older. A naive young hippie, played by a waif (Kay Lenz) grip, rises and lies to all the wrong guys, and then one day he meets a ridiculous (Holden) who is already in old age, drinking water and acting as an actor and he decides he is with him in love. If you think this is superficial, the whole movie will cover such scenes. She says how much she "loves" her and she just met her, wearing thin and really fast. I couldn't laugh at the whole movie. It is obvious that he just uses him as a meal ticket, but the director is immature to think that we are buying that really is love. The nasty one, where these two are naked and having sex, I had to send it quickly because it helped me almost vomit. The 70-year-long music offering is also spreading through the film. Avoid it if you can. Grade D.
