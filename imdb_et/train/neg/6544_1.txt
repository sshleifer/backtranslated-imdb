I paid one dollar for this DVD and I felt it first, but then I started to think about it and I would be grateful. I've found a holy grail that is a real bad cinema. If you think that the dramatic shots of the empty stadium will succeed with the monologue of Evel's inconvenient camera address, wait until the credit on the back of the driver opens. The script seems to be pasted with press cut and ESL textbooks. But ... I just can't believe how bad George Hamilton is. It seems he has absolutely no relation to what he says, the only inner monologue I can detect is "gosh I bet they think I'm cute. It's epiphany! I know now how bad it is."
