The gospel of Lou was a great disappointment for me. I received an email from the theater showing that it was an excellent and inspiring film. It was neither big nor inspiring. The film was pretty beautiful for the whole movie. Many scenes were flashes made in a way that they could not tell from time to time what they were. Votes were often distorted for some reason. Many of the people in the movie were also far removed. The relationship he has with his former and son has never been made clear. The whole film also has one direction, and then suddenly BAM, he is a healthy and inspiring person. The whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the bad things in life, so he lives his life as he lives, but when he changes, he doesn't leave the box, teaches others how to box. Thumbs down.
