It is not even worth it to destroy this sticky spoiler "Annie". The characters seem almost weakened by a poorly written story and they are a low-quality production feeling. It was very clear to the television, but when I found it on my television, I would slip it straight. The children in the film do a decent job, but the adults are incredibly active, so the movie really can't pull you in. This film did not receive music / dance numbers that were brilliant and truly enlightened. all love. Johnson, because Annie is at times tedious and overworked. You can't convince yourself she is really Annie. The differences in the appearance of the character irritated me throughout the film. Sad to say that this sequel was the entire flop.
