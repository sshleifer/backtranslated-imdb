As with most Ben Affleck films, the comedy is dry and the story is predictable. This is where you want to name this story. Many points remained unrelated if there was no point at all. I want to thank the director for not explaining the points better. I say this because it would mean that torture would last longer. As far as all Ben Affleck's failures are concerned, this is no exception and it will only survive by other participants. Even then, most of the action worked and it was not plausible. Driving along the memory lane with actors I haven't seen over the years wasn't worth the price. Everyone thought that it had to be said that they quickly joined the "has-been" lines. My choice was to wait until my car was fixed or watch this movie. I made the wrong decision. All in all, I'd give him one laugh ... mainly because it's all I got out of it.
