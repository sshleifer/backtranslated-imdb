Because some people, like me, want to know everything about the movie, even if they plan to see it, including the end. Anyway, here's the end when I remember it, because I couldn't be more than 8 years old when I saw this first and only time on television. But I'll tell you that it frightened a little boy that I was, and I thought about it after a few days, and that's still in my mind to this day, although some details are a bit vague. Abe Vigoda was in this movie? I can't remember that! I didn't even remember that Barnabus was in this movie and I loved the dark shadows. So, finally, chairman (Belinda Montgomery?) Has attracted a judge (Joseph Cotton, I think, although I remember it, because he is an old family doctor or something instead of a judge; see how memory disappears?) For a wedding that reminds that it is some kind of cave? Maybe I'm wrong; and Shelley Winters laughs, and the judge is in the corner and the corner of the camera is looking at him, and he casts his back and has the goat legs and he says he is actually his father, the devil and he has played directly into his (satanic cult) hands the "mortal" man with whom he is in love (I think it is Robert Foxworth) is also one who Satan wants to marry him. With yellow eyes and yes, they will definitely show Robert Foxworth and his eyes shining yellow. There are many close-ups in the last few minutes of the movie. Everyone laughs and rejoices, except Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy, and crying or screaming or something, and that's the end. Bad guys win.
