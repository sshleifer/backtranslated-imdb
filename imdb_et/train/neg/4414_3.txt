Christopher Durang must be a memorable, memorable nun because he just can't let go of this concept. The game, "Sister Mary Ignatius explains all this for you," was presented - at least in Hollywood - with exactly the same tone as Diane Keaton's lecture notes here. Sister Mary was an exaggeration, a snowman, a pleasant satire calmly confident, a doctrine, and a very decisive nun - and as Lynn Redgrave played, she was fun. But the film requires that we take this exaggeration seriously - while, as mentioned, maintaining the same tone "explains all this" scenes. Both approaches are head-to-head, and over the last twenty minutes the film goes off the rail, falls to the throat and explodes. There are no survivors. It could have worked if the scenes of the four former student scenes and their meeting with Sister Mary were the same as Sister Mary scenes. Or if sister Mary scenes are more realistically presented. So just don't work at all.
