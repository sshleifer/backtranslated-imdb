I think the actress career of Micheal Ironsides has to be over when she has to celebrate such a small tear. Certainly, he could waste more of this garbage if it was wasted during his garbage. <br /> <br /> This movie can be a lot better if it has a good budget, but it shows the movie repeatedly. The ancestor has one scene that looks outside the railway station, and I bet it was. <br /> <br /> There is one scene that made this movie a 3 and it shows a spaceship that lands and takes over the lake, surrounded by forests. It was well done, but the rest of the movie, forget it. <br /> <br /> There is another scene that looks like an engineering factory that I bet and doesn't look like an outpost This movie is stupid, it has a serious low budget, no sense, and God is helping Micheal Ironsides.
