Almost every movie detail in this movie is illogical and unlikely. It does not reflect the true human story that is dead and boring. It's a Hollywood parody, with trumpet music bits that remind you of Denzel Washington's movie, strange camera techniques and focus, racist stereotypes, absolutely unnecessary and comic shots, and the famous people's gesture in the clothing catalog. It's done to satisfy many zombies, whose meaning in life is due to the look of the names of celebrities. The only good thing in the film is the ultimate credit and the funky song. I feel like an idiot to see it, save yourself.
