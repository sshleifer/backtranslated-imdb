This movie wasn't just bad - it was terrible. After I looked at it, I felt I had to go out to get away. For older couples, "gag" is going on, it's not funny, but it's nasty. The monster was cool, but that's all. Consistency errors alone are angry - at least I was. Editing is really bad. <br /> <br /> Almost anything else you could do would be better than watching this movie. Even if your circle of friends is in "bad movies", it's unanimous, I couldn't even laugh at it. You have been warned.
