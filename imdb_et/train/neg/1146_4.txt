This movie definitely proves that good Americans can make very good propaganda. No questions are asked, no comment is made on abuse of power or police attacks, when James Stewart is always confident and convincing, all Dillinger stories solve more or less in column 5. June Allyson as his usual love interest keeps family values ​​and E.J. Hoover is an executive producer. And children or guilty bystanders will never be harmed by professionals. Do not talk about civil rights, which are never broken, or homes that are never invaded. And if the FBI service were not enough, Steward would also give his son a life in the World War II. Perfectly done if you don't know better.
