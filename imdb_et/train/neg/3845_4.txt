Although Bette Davis did a great job for Mildred, I felt the film was not the best I saw. At the end of the movie, I felt there was something missing. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis did a perfect job and made me hate and hurt all the time. Leslie Howard made very good love, like Philip Carey, and I wanted her all over the film so I love such a terrible dame. This is such a sad thing when he finds himself in love with a bad seed. And especially if it's someone like Philp Carey, a sensitive person, though pathetic. <br /> <br /> Ultimately it was what came out, not a plot. The final scene was particularly good, but I don't have to give it. While others may find this movie good, I was the one who found it. I should recommend this movie to those who like bad seed so they can see what happens to them when they are in love with this terrible man.
