This Hamlet made one of the most boring MST3000 episodes. I'm not a fan of Shakespeare, but I don't think he ever intended to be his slow pace and drab. It is also one of the most difficult films because there is so much Hamlet. As I said, though, it's pretty boring. It's black and white, the pace is slow and there is minimal landscape. Participants will also be duplicated so that it does not help. This is one MST 3000 that I can't watch in one session, because the way Hamlet plays it says that its lines can make someone fall asleep.
