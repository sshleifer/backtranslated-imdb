I decided to watch this series after I saw this endless ad on the BBC before it started. I looked at it despite the fact that I do not like the hypocritical things Alan Hollinghurst writes about (to his fans, but I think we have the emperor's new clothes). I admit that the actor is great, it has come down nicely and I am happy to do it - but - I found that the story is extremely thin and after watching all three episodes I feel very dissatisfied with the very empty production. The "explicit" gay sex that the media has dragged is all done on TV - many times - so I'm not afraid of something very shocking. Complete signs for product values, but few for nature / content.
