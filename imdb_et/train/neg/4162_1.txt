If you really enjoyed the 2002 Resident Evil movie, you should just see it, not after 2 hours if you never get back. I can't believe anyone has commented that this movie is just a cheap RE. First, the "special" command power is a unique protection for a computer with an AI and a holographic projection. And this "Hive" rip off has several traps that will inevitably kill one team member at a time. The code names even have a male reference that was in the RE dialogue. Despite the fact that there are no zombies, "Rook", the film's genesis, is a kind of biological creature, a very belt that hints at necrotic tissue and has many cyber components, such as RE supermutant. So, Mr Richard Taylor's request for credit for this story. <br /> <br /> They are not obviously the same movies, but the writer got the idea of ​​looking at Resident Evil, which I think.
