Well ... trembling I did, the original started in 1990 and found that the movie can be viewed. however, they did shocks II and III. Trust me, these movies began to descend immediately after they first, I mean, ass blows? Now, God alone is able to answer the question "why do they make another movie about diving in the garbage?" Tremore IV can't be considered a bad movie, it can't even be considered a bad movie because it lives more than that. When I tried to sit down, I noticed that my eyes began to bleed, and I was hoping that a little girl would climb through the TV and kill me. did they really think that dressing people in other movies as if we were from the wild west would make the film (with exactly the same events) better? Frankly, I would never want to buy this movie, I think there are many cheaper ways to burn things well.
