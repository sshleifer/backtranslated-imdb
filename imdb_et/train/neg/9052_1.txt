I respect the fact that it is a very popular show. Compared to Robert Altman's brilliant, fun, enthusiastic and groundbreaking 1970 film classes, this exhibition was probably less than mediocre ... even though it lasted 11 years, it doesn't necessarily mean anything good. This exhibition was an integral part of my early childhood (it happened again every night and I think whose parents watched it and laughed), but that's one of the memories I won't miss. And now that I actually saw the movie, I can give this series a precise criticism. It is not nearly "2 out of 10" in itself. However, the characters on this display are not as they appear on the film. Some of them are technically the same, but they are just similar. For example, when is Alan Alda like Donald Sutherland? His humor is completely different, as well as his characterization and outlook. The new characters are not so big; they just give you an indication of what they are replacing. It's the same with the new players (including Jamie Farr). The only thing that really goes into the series is the Radar, which is still (even if it is played by the same actor) just a light imitation of the original. Whatever? Oh, yeah. With a ridicule (it doesn't matter whether it was used in surgical scenes or not), it's terrible when it comes to other settings. And since it lasted almost four times longer than the actual Korean war, it takes the viewers into this strange temporary gap that doesn't work outside the caricature world. I've never liked this example and I never get it.
