I can't even believe that this exhibition lasted as long as it took place. I think it's all part of America. Personally, as David Spade said, I liked to show it better when he went to his original title "Seinfeld". What most disturbs me about this show is the obvious way to go along with episodes, alongside the "humorous" and general smut. Really big exhibitions are still funny after a number of repetitive views, such as "where Rob gets accidentally hypnotized", "Dick Van Dyke Show" or "where Lucy and Ethel are working in the candy factory." In other words, it is an honor that spectators have given to great programs. "Friends" writers and producers have ways that in turn would provide episodes themselves, so before anyone can even see it for the second time, not just mediocrity and scarcity. the original thinking of these writers, as well as the thoughts of their viewers. <br /> <br /> You have read some of these people's comments and come to the conclusion that they live in Hallmark Card like Neverland, full of greeting cards. Friendship's true meaning? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Wake up. These people should work in cafes and look for acting as actors, but they have somehow managed to live for $ 4000 / mo. apartments? Get real. All I have to say to those who want to go to Manhattan and live an idyllic New York life with their Rosses and Monicas, luck with all that. That New York does not exist for anyone who makes less than a serious six-figure income. But luckily, however. Now close Soma.
