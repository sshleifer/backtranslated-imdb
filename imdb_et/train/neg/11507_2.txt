Guy Ritchie's noble struggle is beaten, dropped, raped, beaten, struck, shifted, spitted, punched, sodomized and abused and left to death by Madonna's terrible result. His actions very much resembled the completion of the Al Gore Drama and Public Speaking School. Guy Ritchie made a somewhat superb attempt to do it again and if you exclude all the scenes that his wife had, it is the best film. I think the best opportunity ever to have been for Guy was to comfort her husband that his presentation was good enough not to shoot again. If you can watch Swept Away or your toenails for 89 minutes, go to the extended pedicure.
