First of all, I am not the dog of this movie here. I find it somewhat enjoyable despite the poor quality of production. Working here is as amazing as the monster who pursues them, though the monster itself is pretty well done ... in this impressively well done. In fact, he looks like a world like an alien who was on holiday in the Himalayan holiday, and when his father had taken it, having taken ... the call of nature, Spot got rid of and had no time to hunt him. That, or he's a Wishmaster Caucasian brother. I have not decided what. <br /> <br /> In fact, it seems to have been filmed somewhere in the snow country, but more likely Canada is somewhere other than China. Trees and views tell me Canada, and it's okay that the area you set never takes the appearance of uber-frost and doesn't feel like you might find the Himalayas in China. This is a Sci-Fi Channel movie so we can forgive the lack of location. <br /> <br /> Moreover, as we have just created, Sci-Fi directors are often unable to travel because they do not know that commercial aircraft fly over the weather, as is the case here, and the next accident would not have actually happened. But as I said, it's a Sci-Fi channel, so we have to forgive some things. <br /> <br /> Film is occasionally graphic and rotates between "Alive" and Donner party, "Predator" alien in the woods and any bad wushu movie where they fly around the wires. Yeti can probably jump like Spiderman ... or Super Mario ... remember? "Run faster! Jump higher! <br /> <br /> Yeti has also missed her teddy bear. She was looking for a high and low, but it doesn't seem to do the job. Bad Yeti! You can't help, but it is a pity. It has survived and developed for thousands of years only to succumb to serious teddy bear losses. He missed his bear. Or maybe he wants to pair, but that idea is BANISHED! Can you hear me? is a companion man. REBANISED! <br /> <br /> And it is supernatural. Well, it's not a human ... it's a super-yeti! But then again, what's normal - Yeti? is the quality of Michael Meyers, which is completely confusing, and he has this fabulous way to clean his fur. FABulous Dahlink! This is sometimes white if it is not supposed to be. It is super super ... super-yeti. It was a lot of fun to watch, he has some big killings and some honest plot elements. to absorb a terrible gravel-like production style, it is actually quite fun. I can't think they're planning another? <br /> <br /> This sets the M4TV on the 6.0 / 10 scale. <br /> <br /> This sets the 4.4 / 10 movie on a scale from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
