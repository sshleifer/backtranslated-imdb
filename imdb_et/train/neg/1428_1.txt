Although this film was made before Dogme became the dominant film method, and before the digital triumph, it hit. You get a point. This 1991 masterpiece clearly saw these developments. Corin Nemec is simply remarkable because he does well with author and narrator. This pace is slow but elegant, because the cinema is so beautiful. Save it next time on T.V because I guarantee you will never see a better nostalgia-rip-off-for-T.V. movie. Direct video never felt so good!
