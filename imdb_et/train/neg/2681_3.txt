A very good story about a movie that would have been done properly would be quite interesting, but when hell is the end of this movie? <br /> <br /> In fact, what's the point? <br /> <br /> The scenes are pulling so fast that you felt that you were not emotionally part of the movie, and that you didn't leave the way to understand. <br /> <br /> Casting is questionable, if not credible. <br /> <br /> Did I miss the movie somewhere in the movie? I think we have to wait for a sequel. <br /> <br />
