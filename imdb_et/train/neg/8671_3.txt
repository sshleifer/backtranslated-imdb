I watched this movie on March 21st this year. I have to say disappointment. But much better than "Tridev" .Plot is hackneyed. Anyway, Azghar Jhurhad is making a plot to kill his young brother. He will make a plan by sending some men. They will come to the school pretend to be Prabhats friends.Kill this child. This father throws him out of the house. annoying, Naseerdun is wasted.Divya did good, Sonam was wasted, Jyotsna was wasted, but seemed cute. The movie was cute. The too sad she was supposed to get her character killed. This girl was cute but was annoying. The other kid did a good one. The Alay did good. Kiran was enough. The script is weak, but it has some good dialogs. It also drags. just liked one song "Saat Samundar" with this song the words were good. Other songs were forgotten. Don't look at it. Rating-3/10
