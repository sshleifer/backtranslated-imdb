A brain that does not die is one terrible piece that opens up credit. It has all the classic signs of bad qualities: incredible plotline, terrible action, low grade kits and lighting. The drawing line goes like this: When the doctor and his groom take the accident, he goes loose and he picks his head and takes him to his lab, where he puts his head on a pan with a liquid that keeps it alive. I bet Virgnina Leath, who played in the head pan, had to spend a lot of inconvenient time wearing it around the neck and putting it under the table. Anyway, your doctor will try to find him a new body and hire two removal agents so he can choose one new body. Bad all the time, so bad that he was breaking into the Mystery Science Theater 3000.
