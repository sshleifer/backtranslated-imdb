Having decided to collect Billy Bob Thornton's films some time ago (classics such as "Sling Blade", "Simple Plan" and "Man Who Wasn't There"), it was inevitable that there would be a strange turkey there. What I didn't know was that there might be one bad thing. I'll give you an idea of ​​how this movie is incredibly bad - the most funny thing about this is: "Knock Knock", "Who's there?", "Big smelly man", "Big smelly person?" "Big smelly man - are you!" Yes, people, it's really so bad. Billy Bob is only in this about two minutes (I think he needed his job at this time during his career) and the rest of the film is painful. For some reason, though it is undoubtedly terrible, I don't hate it. This is probably because I save my big budget, special effects that are loaded with spam like "Fast and Furious" and not "non-budget" as it is. 2/10 pushing.
