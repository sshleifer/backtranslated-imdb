I wish I could say that this exhibition was unusual in this banalism, but it is quite common. It is a stupid man, his wiser but boring and ordinary woman, with an idiotic sidekick for "comic" relief - this is very necessary this predictable joke, even with more predictable responses from laughtrack, will instill this poisonous mental narcotic drawing of this toxic mental narcotic to leave me physically ill or in a deep sleep that resembles a more induced coma. But it may be a while, because it gives the average American to whom they can truly identify. "Regular" boy like you and me. I live in the south of the United States, so for me, this exhibition is just against Escapism. Here's an unpleasant character everywhere, in some form, or in another.
