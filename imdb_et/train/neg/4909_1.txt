That's right, you heard me. I'm a big fan of James Patterson. I have 10 books and I have read a whole series about Lindsey Boxer. I think the script should be shot. <br /> <br /> What right was it for every filmmaker to kill the terrible fantastic work and make it a mystery to mock? When I thought Harry Potter was polished, Michael O'Hara has misrepresented me. <br /> <br /> I can only pray that the next screenwriter who deals with this fabulous book will make it much fairer. Michael O'Hare and Russell Mulcah: Don't Stop Your Daily Work.
