I knew this movie for a while on my shelf in the Mill Creek collection, and one night I decided to watch it; though not expecting much. Since the start of credit around the circle I am surprised to discover this film was made by Filmirage company. Filmirage brought the world to such amazing stinkers as "Troll 2", "Ator Invincible" and "Quest for Mighty Sword", so I was forced to watch. <br /> <br /> As the movie started, there was a potential to be pretty decent, even if it was original. Gore scenes could have been improved if they were extended and more often. But after a while, the pace began to drag and find myself thinking, "Okay someone better to kill soon" or "Someone better mutation". At the beginning of the stroke when I had these thoughts, though someone may have killed or mutated, but as noted, gore and effects were not very good. Worse still, the scene transitions were confusing; for example: the first Dr. Houseman would be in the zoo, he would be on the back to maybe kill someone, finally he wakes up in the cold sweat bed - making the audience questionable: "Does he dream that he was in the zoo? "As at the movie pace, these scene transmissions got worse. <br /> <br /> I can try to say that Dr. Houseman's character development was pretty good, but at the end of the movie, that means if you've seen what the doctor is Metamorphinated, hopefully laughing - what really is the only reason to see this movie at least once, this movie inadvertently runs like a long joke in the same year. You have to love Filmirage movies, they always use the same stuff again!
