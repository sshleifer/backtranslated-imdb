"Children like them" could have been the appropriate film given the subject. But instead it has become a weekly TV movie that is lower than average if it is not. The action is hidden, the plot is predictable and the direction is non-existent. Try a great "Le Huiti√®me Jour", a movie about people with Down syndrome, to find a better movie on the same subject. "Like these kids" use them just as an excuse for smart sentimentality. Pretty terrible. 1/10
