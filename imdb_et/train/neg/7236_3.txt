Let's see ... I'm trying to practice finding positive things in everything, so what can I say about Pallbearer? <br /> <br /> I know! The performances were - no, it didn't work because they managed to clear all the personalities from Gwyneth Paltrow, usually so viable, and made out cartoons from Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey ... <br /> <br /> Oh - how to capture the story - fast. It won't fly as well, because it was troublesome. What was the genre anyway? It wasn't funny, it excludes comedy. It wasn't interesting enough to be dramatic. Was it romance between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I have to ask, because I can't be sure - we just call it "like losers". I am sure that this film started with a vision, I thought they should have one in the studio, but I need help finding it. <br /> <br /> Even though I was a patient who could forgive the story, I couldn't recommend a good conscience film that would allow a boy to go to a professional job interview with windscreen and dirty, fluffy, foolish hair. Talking about human hair - should we entertain Hershey's dirty black roots and platinum locks? <br /> <br /> What do I do? In the actual movie, I lost 97 irreversible minutes - I can't devote more time to that loser.
