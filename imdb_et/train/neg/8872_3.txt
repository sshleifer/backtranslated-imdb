Major Payne wasn't very good at all. Despite being funny here and there, the story was ridiculous and the actor was poor. Especially annoying was Major Payne's voice and temperament. The idea was ridiculous and the things the boys had to do in this movie were even more ridiculous. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
