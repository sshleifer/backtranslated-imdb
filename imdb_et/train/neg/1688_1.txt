Gee what was this ugly movie! I don't understand what people are so frightened about The Grudge. The director plays one trick (I have to admit a very good stylized lifestyle) and then repeats for the rest of the movie again and again. As a result, I was amazed a couple of times in the first quarter, but when I knew the drill I almost fell asleep because The Grudge grew more predictable in a minute. In conclusion, I can say that the genre has many better films at first, so that the predecessor "Ring" was so bad and that buying the ticket for "The Grudge" is a waste of money.
