I just got back from the movie and I'm totally terrible. This film is an absolute look at all humanity. There were probably 4 more people at the theater where I was. This movie was recommended to me and I couldn't believe this person liked it. I can't believe any wise person wants it. There was no plot NO PLOT AT ALL. It was a joke. How you can't do anything. This movie only shows why Hollywood is in such a low light. I can only watch the "Horror Movie" industry spiral and strangle. With travesty for all movies, this applies to all new "teen horror flicks" on Grudge, Boogeyman, Ring, Saw series. It's all such a trash. Don't support this hogwash!
