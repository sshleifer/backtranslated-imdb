The Lord. I decided to go to cinemas with my friends who want to watch one of these light, sensitive Christmas videos, and I walk around the annoyance. Movie failed. Complete stop. Paul Giamatti, who I think is a good actor, played his character and rolled terribly with Vince Vaughn, who has always been my personal favorite. They catch a Christmas movie in a new style. Similar bad, mixed with good, but everything turned out to be wrong. The first ten minutes were not too bad, but when we saw Santa, it was over. It didn't get better, this rate stayed the same, NO characters didn't exist, and certainly it's one of the most invented Christmas lands. Don't look at what you do.
