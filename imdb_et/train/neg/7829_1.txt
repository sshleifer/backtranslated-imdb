The early 90s brought many "peculiar" and "off-beat" independent films, a particular genre of which is a semi-spiritual desert crime film. Other notes are "Wild at Heart", "Dusk Til Dawn" and to some extent "Natural Born Killers". Good movies like those talked about as "Highway 666", "Destiny Turns Radio" and this unevenly surreal masterpiece "Under the Hula Moon". It is a comedy that aims to achieve a certain emotional tone, but it will continue to irritate. Although casting the wilderness of the desert and Chris Penn is a good idea, the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good criminal film, and is not focused enough to laugh to really be a comedy. I don't finish the end, but let's say it's bad. The film is basically a bad side effect of genre cancer. It's indie-mania rhinitis.
