slow, incomprehensible, boring. Three enthusiastic words that describe the book's film. This is definitely a case where the film should never have been made at the expense of the book. The best part of the film was landscape, great. The worst part was the slow movement of the participants, with an endless glance. Editing is steep and uneven. Nonetheless, the actors made hardly hesitant scripts using at least some faith. It was amazing that although Peru was being deployed, it was hardly a Peruvian person who traveled around - even in the 17th-century setbacks of Peru. If you have any history, try to avoid this movie.
