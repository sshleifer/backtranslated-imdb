Like someone reading the book, I can say that it is significantly worse than the great American version, starring Gwyneth Paltrow. There are several reasons for this. First, Emma is too unpleasant. Yes, he has mistakes and this is not the easiest person he likes - but the viewer should not despise him immediately. Secondly, Mr Knightly has failed. His bleeding and melancholy in this version are better suited to the adaptation of Bronte or Gaskell than Austen, and throw the whole thing away. Thirdly, Samantha Morton is too strong an actor who comes to Harri's role; and why did he make it so sick? Harriet should be blonde and flourishing - not see how he would have taken the next scene with consumption. Fourth, the structure is mucked up and scenes cut. Finally, when Emma decides that she loves Mr Knight, it is so terrible because this narrative is not shown enough throughout the film. Fifth, what exactly happened to Mrs Elton's accent? He sounded like an American actor, who tried to push his accent at first, to run through the whole of America and then finally return to English. Eventually it dragged at the end. The book and the big movie version end with the wedding of Emma and Mr. Knightly. This version will distract after the wedding announcement, without actually showing us the ceremony. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a pretty random experiment. Read the book or rent a Paltrow version instead
