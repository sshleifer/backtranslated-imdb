I'm a boy who loves a guy for movies ... I was waiting to see an army fighting dragon with cool special effects. All this happened, but this movie was the worst film I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The story was standard, but the story was terrible. Scene transitions were the worst I've ever seen. Why would you go on holiday if your life was in danger? The activity of the Mao dragon itself was very badly written ... and the attack possibilities of the snake dragon varied throughout the film, the number of times the main characters would have died. <br /> <br /> The director tried to put the love story in the middle of the movie at the most intense times, probably not being watched after it was made, I love movies, but I had to force myself to stop watching, thank God what I do did not buy, borrowed it from a friend. <br /> <br /> Don't buy it, don't rent it, but look at the discovery channel ... much more exciting.
