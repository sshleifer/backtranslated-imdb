The biggest national lamp hit is "Animal House" and rightly so. It was funny, furious and kind-hearted. <br /> <br /> The exact opposite of all other Lamps films. Including "Class Reunion". <br /> <br /> Please do not be fooled when Stephen Furst ("Flounder") is involved in "Animal House". Or that John Hughes wrote this confusion. This reunion is as fun as the root canal and twice as painful. <br /> <br /> One letter and it's generous. And again, I thought most of my old classmates were demons, vampires, and serum killers.
