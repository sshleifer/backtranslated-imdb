This film is similar to Noel Coward's "Blithe Spirit" game. The line of the strange woman and the media is closely related to writing a cowboy. I'm surprised that such films don't recognize the original writer's concept. I understand that the public may not be aware that this is a call waiting, but it is. <br /> <br /> Sad. These films are so expensive. I will enrich if the scenario is original. I'll even pick up if it's an innovative way to do a job previously issued. Some examples were mentioned (eg Topper, etc.). I understand that movies are still relatively affordable entertainment. But I don't want the public's taste to be taken for granted. In this situation, the taste of the public is neglected. <br /> <br /> I look forward to better movie entertainment. <br /> <br /> In this case. I see the game rather.
