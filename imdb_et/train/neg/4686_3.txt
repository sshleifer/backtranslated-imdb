Robin Williams and others were successful, but the film was widespread and very disappointing compared to positive comments. <br /> <br /> I thought Sy could become a serum killer who was killing people. The ugly clothes threaten his victims around the food courts by quoting Oprah and writing his medical history until they ask him to shoot. <br /> <br /> I think the movie mostly likes egomaniacs who think strangers are interested in their photos. I hope most retailers want a vacation from their customers.
