I just went to see this movie just to see what's all there is, and I was so disappointed to be surprised how it got 6 (?) Oscars and 7.9 ratings from IMDb today. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Bigelow should be a luckiest director ever to win the best picture and the best direction for Oscar such a really very bad movie and I wonder why? Does a totally unrealistic "cowboy" bomb treatment-man story mean anything to anyone I didn't see? Why did I get a mental picture that this film was a remake of some of the old bad Western films, which showed that "with plenty of action" trades in the "west of wild nature" infected with "evil" red Indians; just that this was a different background this time? Was it given to the Oscar because the director was James Cameron and made it a gossipy story for daily TV shows? Or was it a kind of emperor fabric syndrome - where most people realized it was junk, but just couldn't say it because others didn't say it out loud? <br /> <br /> And finally, what was the sniper scene, where they showed a high-resolution super-slow fashion when dropping the body of the case if you had sent a "deep message" or something? Anything "EOD boys make good snaipere good benefits and they get all the time dirty terrorists"? Was it just me who felt there and there were so many bits and pieces if there was no apparent reason in the movie? And can you get the Oscar to edit and direct it? <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it yet, don't waste your money on tickets. Wait until they start to run it on TV after a few years. You won't miss much.
