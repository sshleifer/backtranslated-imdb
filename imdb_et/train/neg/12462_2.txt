I saw this movie last night after several good comments from many sources. I would like to point out that if you are not prepared to try and constantly develop who it is and what it all means, you will hate this movie. <br /> <br /> I still try to understand the role of the participants in this movie by jumping from different stories and letting you really understand any role. <br /> <br /> For political buffs and other world government anti-corruption movies, this movie is probably quite good, but for the film's average observer, this movie is awkward, very boring in places, and you leave the cinema confused and annoying to pay the entrance fee . <br /> <br /> See if you are ready to focus on 100% of every minute detail or policy you care about. can't see it if you want to watch movies.
