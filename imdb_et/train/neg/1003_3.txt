OK, I'm not Japanese. I know a little about Japanese culture and a little less about Japanese pop culture. Besides, I'm Spanish, I eat paella and I like black humor. <br /> <br /> Good to comment on this movie: I have no idea how nice it is for a Japanese audience, Mamoru Oshii is a pretty good director, despite the surprising postmodernist style of Talking Head, and even it was curious and somehow interesting - and I'm surprised to find it. It might just be one of those lost translation cases, I'm afraid it is, but when a European viewer looking at the movie's subtitle with overloaded English subtitles, I thought it was terrible. The jokes seemed bad, the script was too hot - I mean, give the audience a break, and close a bit of a fucking narrator - until almost I have to explode over fast paced and absurd action. br /> <br /> But I thought the animation was really cool. The idea is great and is used in well-animated scenes. But eye-candy ends as soon as the characters are set aside to start with endless, funny everything about mumbo-jumbo speeches. It just puts you on to the next protruding hysterical character. <br /> <br /> I read that Mamoru Oshii is going to go about it. The idea was good, but terribly exploited. Perhaps the second part will highlight the good parts of this first part and actually make an interesting movie, or maybe it is more and more a narrated scene. But hell, if you thought Talking Head was tight, Fast Food Gifters' striking lives give you a stroke. <br /> <br /> Of course, all this comment is based on European experience. Probably it is totally useless for the Japanese people, maybe it was a really funny movie that disappeared from the cultural boundaries and translation. Maybe.
