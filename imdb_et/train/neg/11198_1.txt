I shouldn't even look at this movie because it's not really a horror movie - and so Dr. Cheese isn't worth the attention. At least it is not a horror in the usual sense. Definitely a terrible proposal to waste your time watching this mess. That's why I turned it off after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed. Yes, that's right; in a simple sense, this film is b-o-r-i-n-g. <br /> <br /> "Order" had many bugs, not all of them unique. In particular, it seems to me that the main problem with the "religious" subgroup of horror movies is Hollywood's unwillingness to engage in Christianity under its own conditions. It is quite possible to make really horrible movies that are also Orthodox. Just ask William Peter Blatty. In fact, such films are, without touching the orthodox, only with the imagination of filmmakers (usually dull and illogical). <br /> <br /> Think about it. If someone made the film seemingly, for example, on physics, but not only did not get the foundations of physics wrong, but based the whole plot on the wrong images, then soon it will get tired of the resulting futile plot. The same applies to such films. <br /> <br /> In other words, "The Order" (and many similar movies before) invent all of the fabric stuff from the Catholic Church and Christian faith and the attempt to create a plot of these inventions. Not surprisingly, the end of the plot is inconsistent and stupid. This film has the added charm of being as interesting to watch as your toenails grow. <br /> <br /> Avoid this steaming pile.
