this movie wasn't totally scary, but it was pretty bad. acting REAL was pretty good! Jeffrey's combs did a pretty good job as a mad scientist, a kind of his specialty, if you don't know such things: D. The bill isn't quite sure why he was in this movie. he is too good for this thing and his role was not exactly demanding. I rented it because of the strength of these two forces and I wasn't really disappointed. I mean, heck, it's a movie about half a man / half shark. It's not Shakespeare's people. Apart from a plot full of holes and bad dialogue, I would like to point out that cinematography also continued to do a lot of things to be desired. there were shots when they tried to look at the "bays" but ended up hiding the scene or just came out of the usual fun. they blew it several times when they had a proper dialogue and prematurely cut off before a person could even offer that line. it was pretty bad. but if you are a fan, it is worth it. it delivers excellent performance and does what it can by its nature. it is also not bad and both are female. heck if i remember his name though. bottom line, i don't waste my time.
