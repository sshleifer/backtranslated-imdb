I don't know if this is one of the original SyFy Channel films, but that's what it feels. A cheap, low-budget action movie, probably made very quickly, contains ridiculous effects, a lame dialogue, and one vaguely lost star that gives it the name of the brand (funny how many kids from 90210 are now making cheap TV movies). <br /> <br /> Ian Ziering plays Cortes, whom we know from history as a researcher who destroyed all the local people when they conquered part of North America. Here he is not played as a hero or even compassionate but as a sliding opportunist; his character would probably be killed if it was not based on a historical figure. In this story, Cortes has a brief observation mission, trying to find something of value to prove that it deserves funding for further American research. He and his men find the small Aztecs who are afflicted by the dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> The true hero of the story is the participant Rios, who turns out to be respectful, inventive and wise. He knows rightly what to do in any situation that puts him against Cortes, as well as a young, ambitious Aztec shaman. Of course, a native girl who should marry a shaman with a shaman shrinks to Rios, supporting her anger against spouses in Spain. So it's a pretty clich√©. Dinosaurs are sent relatively easily. Despite the fact that it takes place in a widely open area, the story is pretty much happening in the forest or in the village of Aztec 95% of the time, so it's not visually interesting. <br /> <br /> I didn't even know Ian Ziering. They gave her a ridiculous wig and a convincing accent and somehow she lost. However, he does not see Spanish in another, so the election choice is wrong in every sense. If this film had been released from the theater, it would have brought it to Razzie, no matter. <br /> <br /> Generally forgotten.
