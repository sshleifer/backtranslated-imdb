In this film, supposedly as a thriller, there were about five sub-plots that simultaneously hit the top, but ended up more than awake. <br /> <br /> Writing was tritical, the pace was slow and the solution and the characters were boring. George Clooney looks like he needs a gym, Matt Damon pulled it up and others seemed to read his lines on the television. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie was that it was carefully crafted to be politically correct and so did not say anything about big companies, oil and the Middle East. I've seen the documentaries more excitement. Look at it only if there is nothing else to do.
