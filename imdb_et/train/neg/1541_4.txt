I didn't want this movie intensely and left the scene at a time when British loyal gangs were being beaten. The film effectively accuses NI residents of their own cause of concern. This suggests that the 25-year war was a reluctance and nothing to do with the British partition in Ireland, and the dominance of its history, ie the NI was created in the UK in 1921, regardless of the rest of Ireland's wishes. <br /> <br Characters are depicted as an unfortunate fool, even though I despise the loyal paramilitary who they fought for - retaining their artificial privileges over the Catholic community. It is known that British Intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war to undoubtedly discourage Catholics and demoralize republicanism. <br /> <br /> The nineties' values ​​of machine, masculinity, etc., are being transferred to Belfast in the 1970s and are depicted as part of an allegedly unique Irish psyche leading to violence. A woman in an old club in Ireland, who is in the green fields ..blah..blah .. - is given a symbolic growth, i.e. a bad young man fighting for an impossible cause. Annoying, historic, cheap and nasty trash. O'Sullivan has personally published a conflict that requires serious political analysis.
