I sat through this movie tonight, forcing myself to stick with it, even though I never cared about any characters or their incidents because these two leaders, Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan, were big movie stars of their era and I wanted to see them "something else" what it certainly was. They both gave fine performances, but unpleasant symbols. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the whole film speaks of small towns in Mexico, where there are almost equally unpleasant signs of living (of course, the doctor is a big exception). What Michèle Morgan Philippes sees to fall in love with him is never explained. <br /> <br /> This is said to be the work of Jean-Paul Sartre. I thought that if Sartre's work was such a film, it would have to be a very mediocre attempt to imitate Camus's masterful scrap The Plague, which dealt with plague in North Africa. <br /> <br /> A well-functioning, but uninteresting movie.
