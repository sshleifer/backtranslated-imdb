When I was younger I had a very bad TV. We've all been guilty of this during this time, but my excuse to look at things like "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" and "Silver Spoons" is: I was young and naive; ignorance of what shows the show really worth. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I now appreciate good things. The Stargate SG-1 is not good. 12-year-old I would like it all hackneyed a bit, every line of dirty dialogue, every little unnecessary technobabble. Writing is far from enthusiasm; so blissful and uninspired is that it leaves Star Trek: Voyager. If your show makes me a show for a long time, you're in trouble. <br /> <br /> Film Stargate is an excellent innocent joy confirmed by two solid James Spader and Kurt Russell performances. exciting Egyptian architecture and culture, great musical performance and cool sci-fi ideas. Except for a little bit of original music, none of that made the movie fun. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who made MacGyver traceable and interesting about the Legend, seems to be half asleep in most episodes. <br /> <br /> The budget must be very low, because the kits sometimes look like someone in the basement. Cinema is not much better than vanilla and dull as scripts. It amazes me that much more style (like Farscape) and substance (like the redesigned Battlestar Galactica) are smaller, less rabid fanbases than this priest. It just doesn't deserve it.
