Redline is a Fast & Furious that has no redemption features. It doesn't have to have a twisted plot with several turns and surprises, but it needs SOMETHING! This is equivalent to a porn movie where the story and the dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and at the end. Except that it is worse because you don't get your money away. Mind-numbingly boring, impossible race sequences and terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars that almost acquire negative points appeared in this movie. Of course he's hot, but who's desperate for a woman? I feel the director sat there with a hat full of dialogue and fragments of plots, and shook 8 balls each time they changed scenes. No serious person who competes or knows anything about it, watch this movie and enjoy race scenes.
