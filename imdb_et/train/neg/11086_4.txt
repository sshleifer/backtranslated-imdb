As for the Spaghetti Westerns, I put this man on the dull side of the genre of death. It's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it doesn't have some others to see the SW. Guy Madison does his best, but he doesn't have the on-screen charisma needed to remove it. With one notable exception, the rest is no longer particularly good. The direction is uninspired and offers very little moments that I have never seen before. Just nothing is very excited. <br /> <br /> The chosen exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. He is one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre movie. Unfortunately, its screen time is less than 15 minutes. (Note: The IMDb page for this person cannot die is wrong. Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson. He is instead Mel. I am not sure how anyone Rosalba Neri could make a mistake on some of John Bartha's IMDb credits for the film.)
