NO SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, but it must be the poorest attempt ever made. Calling it a "movie" is also a stretch. This "random clips-obviously fake and sticky-violence-and-ugly-wife-trying-to-act sexy-edited poorly" is not worth watching. Watching it is just as interesting as some casual family vacation pictures, and it's the same quality you would expect when you send your ten-year-old son's forest with your new vid-cam and tell him to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
