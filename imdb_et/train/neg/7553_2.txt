Amazing achievement in horror. It's actually terribly terrible. <br /> <br /> First of all ... Nicholas Cage must now be in the finals of the over-emotional category in his class. Wearing new hairpieces and a face that has been lifted so many times seems to have affirmed behind her that she does not only want to get sick, but creates a "hero" character that you are not interested in. <br /> <br /> I don't know what it is about Neil Labute and female characters. She makes women completely deviant and evil ... and pays them back, taking several of them directly from Cage and calling them all "b **** es" a few times. I've enjoyed LaBute's previous movies and some of his games ... but it's the strange charm he has. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie out of 10 out of 10, based on Ellen Burstyn. At a time he finally makes his appearance (bravely wars through his scenes, whose wig line is clearly visible on the forehead), all hope has disappeared. He deserves here and now Oscar to say his straight faces, and when the white mummy and the blue, white and golden faces appear that bloom around Wicker Man, you know that working with Scorce and Friedkin really prepared him for this role. <br /> <br /> This movie is so false and crazy that must be considered credible. <br /> <br /> Highlights include: Nicholas Cage, who runs away from bees and then falls down the hill. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage steals a bicycle and looks like Mrs Gulch Ozzi from the wizard who is driving around. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage runs around the island hitting down the missing girl looking for doors. Nicholas Cage shouts, "Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it?" for no reason. <br /> <br /> The Nicholas Cage bear costume (I'm not funny) running through the woods takes off the costume (but leaves the bear's feet) and makes some karate some roses. <br /> <br /> And you haven't lived until you've seen the movie for the last 15 minutes and its a terrible epilogue that looked like it was shot yesterday in your cousin's basement. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if you can do this movie without laughing loudly, you deserve a medal. There was actually a point in the movie where I stopped to think if it was a complicated sending of "hysteria" movies ... but to remind you when Cage shouts / shouts / whispers his dialogue that he was really very serious. <br /> <br /> I think it's a cult movie again, but because it's so terrible.
