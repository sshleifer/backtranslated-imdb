Private practice should be a medical drama. So I think my biggest complaint is the lack of originality of the lines of the medical story. Just looking at House, I "solved" two (nine) medical secrets before doctors did it. Mooring. Seriously, if you're a lazy writer, why not copy some instances of older ER episodes or some hidden Brazilian soap? The house is recent and popular - the recycling of these ideas is difficult ... <br /> <br /> The second biggest complaint: these people must be forty times, right? Then why do they have to behave with emotional maturity of 15 years old? It is very necessary to understand for three weeks (ie, three complete fucking episodes) that if your best friend does not want to be your "friend with a benefit", maybe it is not because he wants to hurt you, but because that he doesn't do it doesn't want to jeopardize his friendship? By the way, the whole sign is a psychiatrist - the whole story is just so unrealistic that you can't really buy a "drama". <br /> <br /> And I'm not even going to complain about what everyone's favorite Addison showed us when we learned about Gray anatomy ... on Sidenote, don't you think it's funny, how Addison comes after loser Pete lusting (sorry but all who are trying to cure) insomnia with Mozart's Requiem is a loser, doctor or not) and Derek gets confused in the relationship, annoying Meredith miles from the rainy sea of ​​Seattle? Besides Mark's little, they seemed perfect for each other. Sometimes I think that Shonda Rhimes's subconscious is trying to tell us that our first choice in relationships is often right ...
