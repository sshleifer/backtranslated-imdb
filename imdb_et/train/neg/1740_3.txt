The film was a big disappointment. Especially since it was run by Priyadarshan, it was sad to see such unpleasant standards. The poor scenario (almost non-existent) and song sequences with bad songs every minute and in strange times killed any humor that the film could offer. some scenes were funny, but it was probably only 5 minutes of the total duration. Editing was pathetic. Dismal! In general, the film is disappointing because the story was too obvious. In fact, only a few people missed the movie after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> If you didn't watch the movie, nothing would have gone away. It is not worth spending valuable ticket money on this film. wait until it appears on your TV ...
