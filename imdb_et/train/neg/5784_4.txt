I was not nearly as struck as many other reviewers. Of course, he has a couple of cute girls playing erotic, lesbian vampires. Marianne Morris and Anulka D. play these two beautiful siren razor teeth that drive on the roads on the road that are out of the way, grab their home (in the twilight) and call their prey ... sex-hungry men in their budoari. What happens there ... well, after they are mostly dressed and able to kiss each other, they kill their visitors. Director Jose Ramon Larraz has a nice shine with his camera. Some scenes are quite frightening and effective, but sex alone does not keep the movie up (no red ... at least consciously). There's not really a lot of story here. We have two girls. We are shown some unexplained and inexplicable beginnings where we see them shooting with a gun. Why? What does it mean "Why do we have a man who will stay for several days to greet a hotel man who wants him to know him years ago? Is that a goal? Of course I have more general questions, like what are some beautiful girls doing anyway, the script is full of such errors, and there are very few activities outside the catch victims, the wine and the meals (quite literally) and then cry to sleep. it is anti-climatic, as it has been said that the director has made some effective scenes, how the girls dressed and filmed in the woods who were looking for their harvest. The house is also the most impressive, and both girls are very cute, especially Marianne Morris is different - more As one of the older film fans, Bessie Love, the silent screen veteran, has a short front panel at the end of the movie.
