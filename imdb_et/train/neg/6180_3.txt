I attended one premiere last night and received the following observations: <br /> <br /> 1. Just because you have directed tons of music videos NOT for you to make qualified movies. In the film, there were general persistent shots that did not make sense, terrible corners and terrible lighting. Editing didn't help this confusion at all. When "Dixie" appears late in the memorial service, her mother points out her hand, but it's never clear what the hell she is talking about. <br /> <br /> 2. The plot had a promise, but the script was thin and full of Ford Truck-sized holes. We never understand what characters are, what is really behind the conflicts they all have, or exactly how they solve them. The sixteen-year distance is wiped magically within 4 days. Deep chats clashed foolish clichés. (Actually, the whole city was one big cliché of southern life.) Half of the audience fell as Toby pulled "Ya got my blood running through the veins of the veins" ... and we were treated not once, but twice! Revelations were fun and dramatic confessions that were cooked "I was stupid and stubborn". <br /> <br /> 3. The action was fine, considering the wreck of the script they had to work with. Toby was dark and the biggest part of the film, but when he smiled and eased, he was charming. It is a shame that he had no such screen time. Kelly Preston actors are pretty rusty and show. Lindsay Haun is talented and certainly not her fault, which at first the writers made it so unlikely that you would not blame her father for not looking for her. Burt Reynolds and Tess Harper were able to do more with this film, but it still seemed more or less lost. (And indeed, the disappearance of these characters in this movie!) <br /> <br /> 4. If you are a Toby fan, you love songs. But often the movie seemed to have been forced to have one of their songs - or their record label artists. For example, the film's "Crash Here Tonight" is the official love song. You think it would play around the love love scene, but fast ... we'll hear about it for about 45 seconds when it drives the memorial service. Just as they said "well, we have to use this song somewhere". The song "Broken" is haunting and has come out the best of this movie. <br /> <br /> All in all ... a promising plot never develops and the film is terribly uneven as it tries to be Toby Keith's music and product placement for Ford Trucks. This is because people are bridging the bridges to try to be a force of music, but the story is so bad that both points are mistaken in this overgrown music video. I like Toby and really wanted like "Broken Bridges", but the people he hoped to make this movie let him down and deserve one of his famous boots you know.
