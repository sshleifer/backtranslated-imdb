The call girl feels murder and becomes the killer's next target. Director Brian De Palma is really in a terrible roll: his camera turns around the corners of the museum (after a long time over painting the monkey), he shares a split screen for artistic purposes. a sequence (again on a split screen) where two characters look at a television program about transsexuals and step into their first (first) finals in the rain. "Dressed to kill" is tiring, mainly because she asks us to swallow so much and not give anything back. Much of the action (except for young Keith Gordon) is mediocre, and the (second) final is De Palma's own "Carrie" hanging, not to mention "Psychost". An explanation of dirty acts like Hitchcock's deception, not respect. Stylish and sharp in the cold, the final results are clearly half-baked. ** from ****
