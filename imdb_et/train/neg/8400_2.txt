Not even the strangest fan of stooge might like the movie (I am one of them). It is also a shame, because it is the only function the length of which is related to Curly, and one of their efforts is painlessly meaningless if it had great potential. An amazing musical number doesn't help any. In short, what they did with the same title is more laugh.
