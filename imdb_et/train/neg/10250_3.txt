Blank, cheap sci-fi thriller, made for almost complete lack of conviction (a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decrypt space, only one person and very poorly guarded at night), and full of combs sound effects. Christopher Lee is not only wasted, but he also gives one of his few "I'm here strictly for money". (* 1/2)
