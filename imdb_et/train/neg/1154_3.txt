May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) are probably rarely paying for their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even when the visit begins, Toots carries a deadly heart attack, leaving the land of May, uncertainty and questioning his life and future. Recognizing his daughter's boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig), has inevitable consequences. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed, but for all of her proclaimed realism and recognition, her mother usually offers unpleasant, even repelling signs and asks the viewer to interact with them. Reid looks like May, and his skills and dedication are a wonderfully little-known actor who rescues the film from a completely depressing sex, but Michell and Kureishi have promised Craig, Mackintosh, and Cathryn Bradshaw to create such totally unpleasant signs that it is becoming increasingly difficult to take care of what's happening May As written, the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshawi are so selfish and cold hearts that one starts thinking about exactly what Kureishi was trying to say. As has been said, they do not want Bobby and Paula to raise themselves in two dimensions. <br /> <br /> Reid's performance is worth mentioning but little else. Shame shame ...
