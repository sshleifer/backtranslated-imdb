This film has some great noirish / neorealistic visuals, and it tells a story that is refreshingly free from the Hollywood sugar cover, which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some scenes continue for too long (especially weddings), and I found an exaggerated exhibition and unrealistic dialogue to fit the stage better than the silver screen. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was particularly disturbing and seemed to worsen as the movie continued. Most characters were either Americans or Italian immigrants who lived in New York in the twenties and thirties, but their dialogue sounded like they were playing Shakespeare when they mixed cement and put bricks. Finally, I laughed, not because the filmmakers wanted me. I think spicy poetry could be protected by saying that the characters would have spoken Italian and that the dialogue is literally how they really would speak. But that didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> Another line of dialogue made me laugh for a variety of reasons: The son of a mainframe born and raised in New York in the 1920s suddenly comes up with a lovely British accent. I think it had something to do with the movie being made in England. <br /> <br /> I give this film a lot of effort and intention, but it is much lower to fill.
