Bela Lugosi as a horrible scientist who uses orchids to conceal brides to steal the essence of an older woman's life. The dwarf of this movie is fun! A lot of freaks, plus a lot of upholstery, and no plot can see this movie as a nightmare. I loved how all the pieces finally collapsed in Hollywood fashion. The story will never be interesting and you will feel helpless when you look. <br /> <br /> Normally, I serve such small flaps, but the dwarf simply added enough embarrassment and entertainer to get a few more points.
