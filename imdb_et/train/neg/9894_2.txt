I missed the beginning of this movie, which might suggest why I didn't like that much. On the other hand, I've been studying the autumn of the Roman Republic for years, so I know this story. Then this may be the reason I didn't like this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has more historical inaccuracies than extras. Although it is so inaccurate that I do not believe they have tried to make it right, it can be forgiven. The odd thing is that sometimes they're historically accurate to get confused. Like throwing an Antonius marriage with Octavia and then pushing the two scenes away. Why even bring it up if it is not practical for the plot and Octavia has never seen it? And like calling Antonius with his real name (Marcus Antonius) in some scene and his strange English name Mark Antony in other scenes. <br /> <br /> Although historical inaccuracies are left, the film would still have been an entertaining clock if it wasn't for a leading woman. There is no dignity in him. He is a hysterical, dramatic and completely absent control over himself. Instead of being a clever and composed queen, Cleopatra becomes a hysterical teenager with bad PMS. 95% of it comes from poor activity, but 5% is also poor writing. The script writes too many stupid dramatic scenes. Sometimes you did not watch Antonius and Cleopatra, you looked at Dawson's and Joey's immature versions of "Dawson's Creek". <br /> <br /> If you want to see something about this period, look ... something other than this.
