That disappointment! <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to be trying to copy "top-notch" comedy, but the direction and script were the worst, sick and sentimental worst in the film's tradition. Jack Black's behavior / role was self-conscious and related ... and other characters were equally revealing and uninteresting. Soundtrack was annoying. We are (WERE) Black fans, but no one of us did for longer than the forced titer. Why did he feel he needed to make this mistake? <br /> <br /> We will not watch your movie without reading the comments more carefully! <br /> <br /> Did he get drunk when he read the script before registering this generation?
