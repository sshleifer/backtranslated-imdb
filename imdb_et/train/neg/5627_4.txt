When watching this movie, it is interesting to see how much this black men are marginalizing. The film spends time showing how vigorous the most visible black man in it (except the heroic moment). Most of the movie is in the movie other black men (and dark black women) in the background, barely visible. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams' character was strong and affectionate. The viewer can easily identify and help with him. There are also some fairly visible and three-dimensional support marks that are light and some white and warm characters. But 99% of black men in this movie are nothing but invisible men. Voting shadows in the background, with no consequences. Such a terrible mistake, but the general media is nothing but unusual.
