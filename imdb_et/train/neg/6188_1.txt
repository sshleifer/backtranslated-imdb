This is by far the worst adaptation for Jane Eyre. Not sure if the manuscript writer ever read the Bronte book. George C Scott is ridiculous and worshiping like Rochester - if it's not just old angry. Susannah York has the haircut of the oldest 1970s I've ever seen in a Victorian movie. The characters hardly talk to each other, so the rich passion in the book, which is the basis of their deep intellectual and lasting love, is lost. The end is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Please rent Timothy Dalton version. It's true to the book, it's like reading a novel to you. Dalton is great as Rochester. Mr C. Scott is ridiculous.
