It is put on the DVD market by Alpha and is only for hard Boris Karloff fans (like moi). This is not a horror stroke, but a drama where Boris is in trouble with a scientist who agrees to kill the wife of a rich woman to gain the treasure needed to continue her job. But when a deadly victim changes his will and leaves nothing to his wife, all hell breaks open. <br /> <br /> It is calm enough to see Karloff as another selfish sin, and some actors are unintentionally fun (especially the leading lady Mona Goya, who is absolutely ridiculous as a double baptized woman). <br /> <br /> But continue very carefully.
