Underground Comedy is perhaps one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I should have known that it is bad if the box had the phrase "guaranteed to insult" written on it ... that means that filmmakers are more focused on taking you out than laughing. <br /> <br /> This film is an amateur jumble of childish sketches, bad characters, and worse jokes ... from the miserable Bat-Man sketch to the painfully failed Arnold Shvollenpecker, they're just not funny. Few funny little sketches are little and far away - like Micheal Clark Duncan playing gay virgin, but even they go too long and destroy Vince's failure in the comedy. <br /> <br /> Keep the Underground Comedy Movie under the ground ... bury it!
