I saw this movie in the premiere of London and I have to say - I didn't expect much, but I was expecting something that was at least fun. <br /> <br /> The original "basic instinct" was not a great movie and it is still "smut classic" but it was fun. I remember countless times on TV on late Friday or Saturday night, and I found myself to actually pay attention to it. <br /> <br /> But this flat-brain, waaay-delay is nothing. Is Sharon Stone still great? Well, put it that way - for a 47-year-old, he's pretty hot. Is she as beautiful as she was in the original? She has also clearly seen plastic surgery and her haircut in this film is somewhat unpleasant. It doesn't look as soft or genuine as it is innocent as it did in the original - which is a kind of evil seductress and not. <br /> <br /> The rest of the performances range from bad terrible - to Michael Caton-Jones (a typically safe director - one who doesn't always do a great job but can make useful movies) has officially given his first true turkey; so bad people in the movie laughed at certain moments that were supposed to be serious. <br /> <br /> I hear that the film has undergone several editing sessions and it is very clear from the beginning. Nothing to understand. The whole plot is cosmic and end - oh! Talk about stupidity and disbelief. (Still predictable.) I saw "Gigli", I saw a "mask of the son" - and although I don't want to "smear" this movie, I can say with my powers (what you don't do). we must agree at all, remember that I prefer both of these films for this catastrophic failure. By the way, Stone stayed five minutes before the movie started, and in the theater people started to throw things off the screen during a particularly annoying and offensive scene inside an orgy-type nightclub. <br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" - basically it smells too.
