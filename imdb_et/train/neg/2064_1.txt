Heldeke. While the Chevy Chase and SNL band set a new height with the chart, it shows that it doesn't succeed at every level. Fortunately, Chevy is hardly at all, and it cannot be blamed for this perfect fear. It is really very, very bad. Although it was a political comment on the US at the time of its publication (1974), it is still not funny or sharp. The drawings are too long and all the satirical consequences they have had are lost because they are all drawn to full boredom. It is credited as a debut of the Chevy movie, and I'm happy to say that everything he did after that improved it. Avoid even as curious.
