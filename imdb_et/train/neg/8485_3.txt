From terrible death scenes to firearms without sounding called Fiend. It's all tiring, slow movement, unimaginable fire. It was OK when I saw a boy with a rope and a bow. Visually, it was horrible and probably busy with the movement of this era, but even in 1936 it was thought that even such a film would have had a little more imagination and blood similitude. I was just waiting for something to happen, because people were making calls and acting like they were at the office picnic. And then these balls are like the previous commentator. Perhaps the best idea is to look for water from someone's pants pocket.
