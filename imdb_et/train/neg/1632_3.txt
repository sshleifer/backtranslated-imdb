Karin Mani (who?) A seeming nonsense project like hottie Charles Bronson, who swept his "parents" or grandparents, or hit something like that, and impressed young people with karate skills. In the central scene, he intervenes to stop the rape, and the moorish policeman casts him in jail, so after a couple of jerky scenes and some abortive jailbacks, he must take the law to his own blah blah blah. I think there were many such films? The script is more unpleasant than you normally believe it. Mani comes out exactly as showbike types that play a role in his own Death Wish, and I find this type to be random, but the film is an ungainly device. Competent participants here are wasted on shock roles and would actively undermine the fantastic minced incompetent DA and judge who must be the uncle of the producer.
