What happens if you give the free person enough money to get into and guard him to rob rats? Homeless people do not respond to anyone. They do not have mortgages, rents or idiots bosses. Homeless people do not have to worry about IRS or performance assessments or credit card payments. But just give them enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car, and suddenly they have to worry about entering the rat race, buying gas for transportation, paying insurance for their car, and working for someone else. They will be able to be "productive citizens". This film was about as useful as a movie. The rich and middle class sheep have the opportunity to say, "What happens when you try to help the poor?" and it justifies capitalist arrogance. <br /> <br /> Why not a movie asking, "What happens if you take away all the rich man?"
