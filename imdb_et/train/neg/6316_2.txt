A movie like Amazing Grace and Chuck is a great example of how the left does not get it. They never did it. And liberalism will continue to move forward from political forgetfulness. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a little bit of a baseball star who decides to stop playing the ball as a protest against the existence of nuclear weapons. The boy is understandably ridiculous as long as his reason is to join the professional athletes led by former NBA stars Alex. Not only some of them join this cause. By the time his movement reaches the zenith, the professional leagues and college sports leagues must cancel their seasons because no one can play. Just to take this review forward, I am ready to give this assumption. Although it would never happen in a million years, I imagine it will, then go there. <br /> <br /> I don't remember how, but an agreement has been reached, and the boy decides to go back to the game he loves in an incredibly cute and ridiculous scene. <br /> <br /> Before criticizing this movie message, let me just say that this movie is badly written, behaved and directed. Even if the boy agrees, it would be impossible to overcome how badly the film was built. And it is disgraceful because there are many good players who go to waste. (Peck, Curtis, Petersen). However, Alex English does as well as he can, and I want him to try to act more in movies. Unfortunately, it is probably much easier to find a job in the NBA coaching world. One wants Mr. English to teach more of today's NBA types how to make the rock a little better. Alex certainly knew how to make the ball pass. <br /> <br /> With regard to the film's message, it's just wrong. Simple and simple. All those nuclear warheads left west of the rocket silos, ISSUED !!!!! It is one thing that this boy and his flock would protest the actual war or the use of nuclear weapons. These weapons were not actually used and were the genius behind them. Neither time during the Cold War was enough to shoot one missile. Without their weapon who knows what could have happened between the United States and the USSR. <br /> <br /> The makers of this movie were obviously meant for American children to solve their problem and follow Chuck's footsteps. Children in America, however, are more intelligent than the left-handed cake maker who created this drecki. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth only 2 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a big movie about the dangers of a nuclear war, keep dr. With Strangelove. br /> <br /> Mr. Newell, you're not Frank Capra!
