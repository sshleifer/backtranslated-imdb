Here's how you do this: Believe in God and repent of your sins. Then things should turn around the next day. <br /> <br /> Until the last fifteen minutes, this movie plays as a bad bite while drunk. His mother dies. His stepmother is b_tch. His father dies. She drinks. She's getting married. She has children. He drinks a little more. His wife gets crazy. She destroys her children. Spouse threatens to leave. He calls a respectable late night when he wants to kill himself. Then, after the repetition happens, we get a "left behind" a similar fine message. <br /> <br /> He needed a salary. This is the phrase that I had to repeat repeatedly when the credit started to roll so I would not lose my respect for Madsen. <br /> <br /> Madsen falls on his knees and asks for Christ's forgiveness. When he does, he walks outside and says he sees the world differently. He tells his wife that she has found God and that's good enough for her. Flip the scene for four months and the woman is tired of going to church. Finish the movie with Madsen on a walk and give you the comfort of being happy with Christ and without alcohol. The final moment? He gives the bar a little triggering wave (i.e., a sinister) and gives gay, Miami-Vice-school, a special congratulatory jumper air when the camera's freezing frames. See why I had to repeat the phrase? "He needed a salary". <br /> <br /> Man this movie is bad. The output of Class B 80 does not help much. The script could have easily touched the episode "Angel". It could have been 30 minutes plus an advertisement. Action is wooden and never plausible. Even Madsen, of whom I'm a big fan, and that's the only reason I went through it, makes it clear that it's her first exemplary job and she doesn't know her camera yet. After 45 minutes I started to frighten. This thing was like homework. I just wanted to put it down and say it's okay, I saw it halfway. That's good enough. But not. When I sat in the Cheerleader ninja, I can sit all over it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I don't give it is 1 point for two points: 1) I love Madsen. I know it's not fair. But this is great when the title "Introducing Michael Madsen" opens. Dig me in court. 2) Some of the dialogue is so bad that it's classic. At the end of it, there are some quotes that you can enjoy. <br /> <br /> That's it. For re-measurement, this is the amount that should remain with the rest of the cod. But hey! Look! Michael Madsen! (See also TILT, OBJECTIVE, MY CHALLENGE, etc.). Now I have to catch the reservoir dogs again and see how Madsen tortures the rogue to respect him. Look, kids. <br /> <br /> "This stuff makes me blind, but I still drink it" - Madsen's first taste of cheap alcohol <br /> <br /> "I don't" I know! Everything looks so beautiful! "- Madsen walks after confessing to God <br /> <br />" I'll go downtown later and I'll take the Bible and I'll get a discount "- Madsen after the dinner table conversion because Satan lives in her hair
