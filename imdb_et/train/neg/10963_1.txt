I went to see it with good old fashioned Alice entertainment. When I realized it wasn't getting it, I watched it for a pretty well done movie (filming and yes ... for that). besides having a good film quality, having been watching grain films throughout the day, there was nothing good about this movie. <br /> <br /> He killed 42. What were Tweedle Dee and Dum Mudler and Scully? Serisouly, Who can answer me? Who can make a terrible answer to this movie for me. <br /> <br /> I agree who said it was just one big long internal joke for staff. It looks like it is. <br /> <br /> Bad Mr.Carroll.I'm so sorry that someone did it with great tales.
