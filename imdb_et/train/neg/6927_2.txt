Although I appreciated this movie 2 to show full effort to try to create a high quality horror film, it was inadvertently on a funny scale. I couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were, but I didn't care because I knew there was something in every scene that would make me laugh. The dialogue is minimal throughout the film, but I believe it is because they started filming without a script. The lack of a plot line makes the film very versatile. It doesn't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from start to finish, or if you watch it rewind, you will be confused. I especially like the scene where the inmates are running outwards, beating each other with sticks. I believe the doctor refers to this as a treatment. Genius!
