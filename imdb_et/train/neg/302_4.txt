I wanted to like this movie. I love kenny hotz and spenny rice has a charming side. Not that I like it at all. Spenny destroys this movie. He should give kenny and his hot girlfriend a movie. There are not really too many celebrities in this movie, and most don't seem to have more than one line. In general, this film was disappointing. I would only recommend watching this if you were kenny vs spenny with 1 DVD of this season (it's free on the 3rd disc). Regardless of this production, I'm still very excited to see Papel Chase.
