When I rented "Unhinged", I waited for a gore movie. The box even claimed that the film had extreme violent scenes cut off from the release of the theater (I now have serious doubts that it will be released in the theater). After finishing the movie, I was wondering how it could even get a video release. <br /> <br /> The plot is as follows: A group of three young women who drive while driving will interrupt their car in the tree. These women can somehow reach a mansion that contains an extremely sexist woman. In addition to this point, the film consists mainly of useless scenes that are long enough to release the film. <br /> <br /> One thing that makes this movie terrible is the actor. Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, looks like he reads his rows of smart cards. Others are bad, but not nearly as bad as her. Another thing that makes this movie bad is camera technology. Many shots are taken with a camera attached to the ceiling. It gets very annoying as the movie progresses. In addition, there is a very small gore that makes the box very misleading. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. My rating: 1 out of 10
