It's really a bad movie, with a bad effect and a very boring pace, Lorenzo Lamas is really cool. All characters are just annoying (except Lamas), and no one can root or care! In addition, the activity is very boring. The film gives us 3 villains who were supposed to find threatening and distracting, when actually boring, ridiculous and just a bunch of moore, which I wanted to close! And it looks very cheap and amateur! Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma, but he can't save that piece, and believe it or not, that the opening was really cool, as well as the end, but in the middle it is incredibly boring and I was under pressure to push fast!, Plus Dialogue is especially ridiculous ! .This is a very cool scene that I really liked, but when Lamas leads the dock, it all breaks down with a scene where the villain tortures Jennifer's family and kills they had to bother it when it was really ridiculous! This is really a bad movie with bad performance and a very boring pace, but Lorenzo Lamas is really cool, but that's not enough, not recommended. The direction is very bad. George Erschbamer is doing a very bad job here, with mediocre camera work, a horrible location and a movie boredom. Operation is pretty bad (except Lamas). Lorenzo Lamas is fantastic here, and although he doesn't have to act, he is quite fun to look at and has a really cool character and he has a lot of charisma, but even if he doesn't save it, he was also chemistry not cast! (Lamas Rules!). Josie Bell is terrible here, and while she is looking at her, she is not very convincing and had no chemistry with Lamas. Cheryl Jeans is hot, but he doesn't have much to do but scream and scare, he did it well. Robert Scott is INCREDIBLY annoying when the main villain, and he was not at all threatening, he was ridiculous, like the other 2. The rest of the majority is bad. Generally avoided! Avoid !, Even if you do like Lamas (like me). * 5h
