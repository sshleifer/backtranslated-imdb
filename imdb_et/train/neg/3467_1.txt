On the cover of this movie box is the name of Kyle Minogue, but it has the same fate as Drew Barrymore on "Scream". This is the first thing that makes this movie bad; they're trying to market the movie to someone who's in it for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have to make this movie for young hip college kids who are attentive that there is a killer there. First of all, the fame of the 80's Molly Ringwald teen movies is this beautifully written movie star. It's a good career move so Molly can make money in Australia to make a funny movie so she doesn't get rid of the ridiculous states. <br /> <br /> In both cases, this stupid movie is a somewhat frightening film that has never stopped, because this stupid creature kills everyone in it. Throughout the film we should think who is the killer. A short story, remember our little friend Molly, she saves the day ... or is she? <br /> <br /> This move is just bad, rent it if you feel tortured or just break the floor of a local video shop when you see it on the shelf. Don't spread horror.
