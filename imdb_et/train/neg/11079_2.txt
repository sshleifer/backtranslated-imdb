For more than several years I have been looking for semi-based films for rent for my children, I have developed the sixth idea to mark really joyful, direct videos that really hurt to sit (for anyone over the age of 60) eight). I finished this ball and the kids spent half of the movie asking what he was saying? and "why did he do that?" and my eyes got aching every minute or so that the characters apparently did a bad job of changing the random scheme. And the next time somebody decides that with the sword absolutely no skill just "realizes" the movie, ask them to get bored or knife. "Prehysteria!" had the head and shoulders above. Arrgh.
