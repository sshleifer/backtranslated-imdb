Ha. no doubt Tommy is evil here. I don't know why, but for some reason, small children tend to tease so little with the butt. and because they are children, they will not die. because they are annoying ... well. but they are little and far. <br /> <br /> Anyway, film. Can't find this movie on DVD? definitely you can! All you have to do is buy a Chilling classic DVD package! not only do you get a metamorphosis on DVD for $ 15, but you also get 49 OTHER FILMS! what a bargain bargain! pff. OKAY. I've been advertising these chewing films. Let's just say that this movie is not worth 15 bucks on its own. <br /> <br /> So we have a chemist. yes. All chemists scientists are as beautiful as Peter plays. He tries to get out of the serum to stop the body from deteriorating. The college with which he works wants to pull the plug into his project so he tries to do it himself. but because it is a horror film, it sucks up and starts and has an incredibly long transformation sequence that takes about 3/4 of the movie. who has a son. and he was never married! scandalous! But of course Tommy is one of the most irritating signs. I'll take it back. He's the most irritating character. Worse than the old deaf man who wants to take over the job of Peter and move him to the hospital. it is right, even if it is old exhaustion, so you can still be a villain. <br /> <br /> So we see that Peter starts to randomly kill some people with the visions he has until he realizes he's doing it and just decides to kill everyone on his way to restore normal. Eventually, however, he reaches the lizard. yes, i know you don't ask. The end doesn't really make sense. And if you hope for really good profitability then you won't get it. <br /> <br /> This is not a HORRIBLE movie .... it's just frustrating because of a lack of good. pay off. if you already have 50 movie packages and this is next in your list, you are not for snoozer, but you are also not great for the movie. Just sit back, relax and eat a lot of snacks. Because this movie is not going to jump out of you quickly. <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis gets 10 of the four plastic lizard heads.
