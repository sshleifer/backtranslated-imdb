When I first looked at Robotboy, I found it fresh and interesting, but then I noticed that for each episode this show was trying to teach you how to behave, which is good / bad. Episodes became predictable. And the main characters are not interesting. Again, we see a hyper-smart boy who was beaten by his older brother, parents who don't understand his baby, and his friends: a girl and a fat boy. There is no logic in this exhibition either. Super-modern robot that works on two AA-size batteries and can use many weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super-activated modes. We see two different robots and this refuses the main idea of ​​the exhibition: "The robot must learn how to behave in human society"
