Frankly, this movie is another series of great disappointments ... most of these so-called "horror masters" are just terrible in terms of their sub-parameters and ridiculous story lines ... Ron All the other Perlman in this movie can't save their lives ... punches sounded like somebody played Bop-it under boom mike or something, and it seemed completely unreal ... generally this movie is as harsh as home The only ... the only good masters are cigarette burns, Jennifer and maybe Pelts ... I don't know how these directors sleep at night, knowing that they have destroyed the genre that some of them actually really understand. .
