Usually I don't like revenge movies .... PERIOD. But Double Impact is a bit more than your typical revenge plot. You see, DI has action, precision, exotic places (ie Hong Kong), battles of awesome weapons and enough martial arts to satisfy its tempting armed struggles. Like all vengeance, he also has feces that you would like to throw away from the top floor of a 40-storey building! But Double Impact does not have any sensational nonsense to stifle the plot and the elitist, racist and poisonous social stereotype that penetrated "Eye for for Eye" and "Death Wish 2". <br /> <br /> But the plot's Double Impact is as transparent as the hinge wrap. Chad and Alex's parents were killed by a crowd of people who were involved with a family doctor with money problems or at least what I remembered. An explanation of why boys talked about French accent is instant. It wasn't a watery plot that made this movie bad, but using clich√© lines and moving from other movies (Lethal Weapon to Princess Bride) really got worse. However, Double Impact is still observable. But why are such glittering films such as the greedy British man who killed Chad and Alex's parents and this deadly lesbian redhead chick that you would like to be angry with the fibers of your being?
