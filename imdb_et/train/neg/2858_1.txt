It must be one of the worst films ever. The graphics were terrible, the actor was a b-film and the effect was just Nintendo 64 qualified. You think they would put a little more effort into it. Of course this is a movie on the Scifi channel, so you have to wait for it, but it takes a cake. Hell, I'm still laughing. So, if I don't believe in the movie, it does well. <br /> <br /> Although it seems to have some "known" actors and actors, I find it hard to believe that they didn't realize that the quality of this movie was worth their time and effort. <br /> <br /> Graphics may have been good in the 60s or even 70s, but it's 2009! I'm not giving out a spoiler, just say that if you've played "Jurassic Park" on Nintendo 64, you're very familiar with the movie you see in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not worth the 2 hours it took it through
