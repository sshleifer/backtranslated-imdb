Note to Horror fans: The only horror here is if you knew you were just wasting 95 minutes of your life in a movie that was so worthless that it was offensive. <br /> <br /> I looked at it because: <br /> <br /> The goal sounded a bit promising: it is not. It is just an excuse to use the same flat piece of other low budget films that were also not good. <br /> <br /> The promise of a lot of forest nymphs sounded good, even if the film turned out to be terrible: it's not. That's not the case. Amateur cinematography ensures that fallen angels are about as sexy as an average homeless person. <br /> <br /> The name Tom Savini is a long history in the genre of fear: he is the king of low-budget special effects with a lower budget. Come to think, Savini should have seen this movie. It's not that he's bad, but he's almost always in bad movies. His only good role was from Dusk Till Dawn, and he has milked it since then in horror conventions. <br /> <br /> But we focus on the positive: Damned Forest is a great example of how not to do Film. <br /> <br /> Everything else is negative. Obviously, the writer is allergic to originality. The script is terrible. It's all given after the first 10 minutes. But married tempo; the way the director treats "plot" and "characterization" as a nuisance he thinks someone cares for; and the extraordinarily long and boring driving, walking, and natural order (undoubtedly added to increase the time to make the movie fit for distribution) does not show the general lack of film and storytelling. <br /> <br /> This is another good example of a number of options when you can tell if a movie is bad: if it's written and managed by the same person, wait for the garbage.
