a waste of my life .... .... the director should be embarrassing. why people feel they need to make valuable movies, it never makes sense to me. when he died at the end, he made me laugh. I had to change the film several times, because I looked at such a bad act with excitement. hopefully, the man who played Heath can never work again. In addition, I hope that the director will never be able to make another movie and take it back for that flock. {.02 out of 10}
