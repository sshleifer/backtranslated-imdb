Absolute garbage, worse fighting scenes than 20-year-old van damme movie or American ninja etc. <br /> <br /> Really terrible acting, not seeing the whole movie as it is in wooden sculptures. /> <br /> See that this movie is really bad, it may be acceptable in the 80s, but it's a 2006 movie, I don't have much love for this movie because it's not born If you like a real movie , check tony jaa ong in the tank and the protector, these are decent martial arts movies. <br /> <br /> Be laughed and see it today, you see the unusual humor as it is gloomy.
