I don't know much about making a movie, but good movies have to tell a story ... your characters have to start and finish their journey. When they leave Brook last time, they may, but in no way, satisfactorily, and I do not mean a happy ending, just end. <br /> <br /> The last exit to Brooklyn, which in 1952 was assigned a very brutal workflow in Brooklyn, sets a series of stitches moving. Most of them touch some of the most unlikely characters to ever walk on the screen. But the last exit to Brooklyn is not able to bring these stories to conclusions ... it leaves some of them hanging out without end or explodes some strange "artistic" ends of the stratosphere. <br /> <br /> Two cases point and spoiler. <br /> <br /> The sad transvestite character (the essential character of the movie) has hit the car and is killed. And it's for her in the movie .... she's gone good, erased all the memories ... no reaction from her friends, enemies, lovers ... anything. <br /> <br /> In the second thread, the stupid, helpless, and secretly gay strike leader, who has been rejected by the workforce, has discovered his gay-lover and neighbors' blows, accusing blows. The end of the beating scene shows the streets of Brooklyn and the street lights are very similar to the Nazi death camps ... and the scene pulls on and on ... and the camera is put down by the head of the workforce and is crucified ..... ppppuuuulllleeeeeeeez. And, of course, it is for him .... deleting the brain ..... gone. <br /> <br /> Bottom line .... no matter what the reviewers originally said about this movie in 1989 ... this movie is a depressing mud. Avoid it. And if you're not warned, it really deserves the NC-17 rating for massive physical, emotional, and sexual brutality ... not even allowing teenagers to watch.
