When I go to the video memory to rent a flick, I usually trust views of the IMDb movie, and until it had ever seen a 7.0 or higher rating that I didn't enjoy. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet, the legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century, made a real mistake here by making one of the biggest mistakes made by the filmmaker: filling in a film that was made with improbable characters without real redemption features. <Br>> <br /> I like movies with bad characters, but no matter how dark the personality is, we all have a little light there, we are all gray tones that are some darker or brighter than others. Mr. Lumet crossed this line, filling this film with completely atypical and almost masochistic blindness. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke Hank is a 30-year-old whooping, immature, irresponsible man-child who divorced a woman who hates her and a daughter who thinks she is a loser, what she's very much. His indecision and willingness to let others do this, because he is too shy to do it himself, leads directly to the destruction of his bank robbery plan and killing his mother. By the time he stops with his older brother at the end of the movie, it is more pathetic than exalting. Ethan Hawke plays his character well, but he is not given much work because he is depicted as someone who has a permanently stamped boot on his face, and he is not very careful that it is there. <br /> <br /> Talking about what her character's wife is equally bad. Almost every shot of a movie, where he is, is literally for his money for renting and supporting the child, and for further grinding with his non-existent self-esteem insults. Seriously, it's almost all a sign. His harp-like behavior is limited to malicious behavior. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays his father Charles and although Mr. Finney has been a great actor for decades, he spends about 90% of this movie with the same mouth to open his face with half-grimace as he suffers from the world's worst constipation. Someone who has been an actor for as long as Mr. Finney, you think he would be more emotional. Even if he doesn't show that much, his character is allegedly exhausted and full of anger. And when he captures Andy in the movie, he's like dr. Frankenstein, who put the monster out of his own misery. <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei is not much involved in her character. Sty is unhappy with Andy and communicated with her brother for some incomprehensible reason. When Andy's world begins to control, it logically jumps on the ship, but it does not make him any less selfish or self-serving than any other film character, but probably at least the one with the most reasonable. Finally, we reach Andy, always played by a good friend Philip Seymour Hoffman, the only reason I appreciated it for the presence of the accusing financial leaders of his heroin addicts instead of film 1. The "perfect crime" of abducting your parent's jewelery shop is scary. His descent from the peaceful scheduler of a peaceful scheme to the unstable, corrupted killing maniac is plausible and tragic. Hoffman's character arrives as the head of the film, but it is difficult to root against him because the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father who has himself acknowledged the poor parent's upbringing, his son's possible psychosis and indirect, involuntary murder of his mother <br /> > Ultimately, this movie is really only worth seeing PSH's excellent performance and family traffic wrecks. Just do not wait for there to be any signs worthy of rejoicing, because there really isn't.
