I've had this luxury to see this movie once when I was pretty young, so much film is blurred, trying to remember it. At the same time, I can say that it was not so funny when the movie called killer tomatoes should have been, and the most memorable things in this movie are the song and scene where a couple of elderly people talk about poor Timmys. Other than that, the movie is really just scenes from small tomatoes and large tomatoes, and people who are afraid and moving when people are doing this type of movie. But just a very stupid assumption and a memorable theme song do not make good comedy. This movie should be a B-film, but something that needs to be taken seriously should be fun, which is funny and not trying to expand the amusing space into an expanded film. Perhaps it would have been short if the trailer shown by the aforementioned elderly couple and the man who tried desperately to put up a larger tomato were actually pretty good. The trailer itself looked like a trailer, but they didn't really make a full movie and rather weak.
