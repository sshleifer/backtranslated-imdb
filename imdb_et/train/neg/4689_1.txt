Really terrible film made by filmmaker Ted Tetzff. Decent enough for watching a movie, but a time bomb for a movie that has no tension. Ford, as someone here puts it, has dreams of a characteristic smile. There are some details that were thrown around - the former Canadian army or the RAF, fighting bombs, his wife leaving him, but none of these backfires increases. The bomber himself is a complete secret. Why is he trying to break this mine? What time are we talking about here? World War II or post-war? I thought the latter would make the bomber's motive even more important. In general, it's just a terrible movie. There are many good time bombs to exclude it. See any "Danger UXB" episode for a more exciting time, at about the same time.
