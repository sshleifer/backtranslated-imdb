With such films you will learn that you will get common jokes about ghosts. Eva if the ghost is pretty funny. Other participants also do a good job. There is no direction and story. It could have been overlooked when jokes worked better. The only problem is that there are not many jokes. Of course I laughed a few times. Apart from talking parrot, there was no dream of creativity in the film. I blame the director for not using the assumption of its full potential. Eval is definitely a comic skill to show more but couldn't do that. In general, this movie is ideal for Sunday afternoon. Other than being completely skipped.
