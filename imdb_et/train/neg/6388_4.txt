Brothers Quay are the directors who would have had to stick to the usual idea of ​​making short films. I really liked their first function, the Benjamenta Institute, but judging by their recent efforts, the earthquake piano tuner, I agree to agree that they will not get close to their past gene in function-length. Piano Tuner is undoubtedly a great movie to watch and often listen to. Unfortunately, it is a limiting pain to sit through a twisted story and an ice movement. Reading the plot summary, it seems like a pretty good story. But the brothers can't do it unhappy. One thing they should avoid in the future: dialogue. My God, it's terrible. Big bust.
