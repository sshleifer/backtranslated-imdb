You can't really say around the refugee to say that, Lady Death: Motion Picture just sucks. In addition to being a well-equipped blonde who runs around hell from leather to bikini with occasional graphic violence, the film seems to have been made with a line of mentality in the 1980s drawing on the line of action. A bad guy even speaks like Skeletor wannabe, has a mandatory inept heap and lives in a nest that seems to be patterned after the old Saturday morning blackboard comic strip domain. Just do not wait for some other humor than sometimes a badly bad dialogue. At other times, it seems that such an anime story that fits better with the cubs is not sex, tentative rape (thanks to goodness!) And very few sex complaints, despite the physical appearance of the title character. This material just doesn't have an adult edge if you don't read bare heroin and bloody death. Basically we have She-Ra, the Power Princess of Feature length episode, but also the skimpier clothes and more gore.
