This movie was just bad. I love war movies and usually get away from most movies and find something I liked, but it wasn't one of them. This film lacked content and intensity.OK I get it, the Finns made one hell to fight and it is great, but the story is badly said. You have no real connection to any character and there is no real story. You're just going from one random scene to another, nothing flowing to form the story you are trying to convey. If you want a war movie that keeps you riveted and amazingly enough without battles, I would recommend a "fall" (German World War II). Or, if you want a great story and a lot of activities, I would recommend "Brotherhood War" (Korean War / Korean Film). These two films won't let you kick off during the winter war.
