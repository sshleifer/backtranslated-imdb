Obviously, Hollywood just gives money to someone who has the camera and the ability to talk. This movie was delightfully bad. Casting was a terrible, ineffective message and story full. Script? who needs a script? I was surprised that the film was not as verbal as I thought it would be, but I have quite a few R&D photos to keep me alive. The film was like listening to a 19-year-old street winner ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of a college). So badly written, I thought the two brothers of the movie were lovers in the beginning. The race scene with the main female actor made me think about Herbie: Fully loaded. This is the kind of movie Grindhouse designed for himself ... only the writers thought they were serious.
