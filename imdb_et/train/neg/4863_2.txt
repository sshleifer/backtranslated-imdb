Why oh, why don't movies just block your sales outlet? All in the cinema, the young and the old, were there to see the talking animals joking, and while they did that we were all happy ... And then, like Lost In Space, two killer strokes came - the plot and the feelings . Who really was interested in what happened to the tiger or did Eddie Murphy work with her daughter? Not me, that's for sure.
