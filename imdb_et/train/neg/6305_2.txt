This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We are also working on it.) Despite being true, it's still a movie and it's a movie site. I realize it's hard to get good actors for independent movies, but wow. Only mediocre is the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he was unable to make up for all the actors (including those who played him as young) acting completely cruelly. This script was a terrible clich√©, but even then you have to get some decent actors! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because it is so badly done in every category. Read some books about the true story of Mason in the United States because they give these men the respect they deserve.
