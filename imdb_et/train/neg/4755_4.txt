I thought the movie was partly good. The beginning was exciting. The first 30 minutes of the movie were good. The corners of the camera for the first 30 minutes were strange and I didn't like it if they didn't cover the participants completely. <br /> <br /> I think the last 25 minutes of the movie were not as big as we would expect for such films. <br /> <br /> dialogs didn't make sense and I think they weren't very witty. <br /> <br /> I felt like they were trying to copy movies like dialogs, but failed miserably.it seemed like many actors among the actors they were interested in and didn't make any sense for the story. <br /> <br /> The whole movie has just law and caine. <br /> <br /> I don't think it would be a waste of time, its an OK movie, but not a gr8
