LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - Wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And he's a star? I should have known better than renting out EDISON. In fact, I knew better. But at the time of absolute weakness, I rented this CTV. If you have big names such as Freeman and Spacey on STV, you know it's one of two things: indie or dog. Like on the shelf. What it did. And for good reasons. The plot is corrupt killer policemen with MAGNUM FORCE, and "journalist" Timberlake is the only one who is brave enough to discover them. He's focused on his efforts - or maybe I should say about his dreadful action. I turned it off when one of the bad guys was shot on the forehead and was still thinking of turning to his shooter and smile before the collapse. Just terrible. The real tip about how bad this flick is is to see Freeman's cover and the whole movie where he plays an unpleasant beard, watching like a hobby. You just know the director was not in control. Freeman is clearly sliding.
