Matt Cordell has died back to the third round, although I'm not sure anyone cares about this point, except for the rabid MANICA COP fans. Cordell, who died on the last flick, is resurrected through the voodoo and is now hot on the path of many malformations involved in taking Cordell's fellow citizen. I left some of this early in the 90s with low budget quick words, but it was nice to see that Cordell twists his body in many different, terrible ways. The problem is that the whole movie is pretty static and Cordell just isn't Jason or Freddy. It is quite fast, even if this B-filmmaker Robert Forster is a doctor who finishes his brain. Try the first movie in a series that is funny and scary and exciting at the same time.
