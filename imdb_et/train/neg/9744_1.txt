This is one of the worst things ever to come out of England, so it says a lot there. Tensions, if we have to find out whether Lembach is staying, are amazing. In retrospect you will see beautiful secretary Sheila printing her picnic tables underwear for some time after Dr. Rat Face has got it. This movie also has London views, though none of them are good. There is also a point where there is almost a car accident that will get your heart rate back to normal. There is also a clock that is teleported and the fear of a woman who cannot look at her is parallel to the horror of the "Sixth Mind", which is only much fatter and British. Add a fierce arms struggle between the British police and Dr. Rat, which results in nothing, plus a lot of people, as well as a cat and you have ... ummm ... British film. The MST3K version is pretty good, though not one of them.
