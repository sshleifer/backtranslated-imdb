We don't have it on television in England, but I walked it on YouTube. It's stupid, immature and boring! It's from the creator of "Earthworm Jim" Douglas TenNapel, I never got this comic, but I have to admit it better. The cartoonist hasn't done anything for years. For Doug TenNapel, it's a return and it's always low! The story is about three cats who inherit a house and a lot of money from their dead old lady captain. They are arguing and disagree with what they want to spend their money on. "FIGHTING"! Animation is terrible. The main characters are for cats, right? But they don't see anything like cats! Just strange creatures looking for animal monsters with big mouths, sharp teeth and bright eyes! Human and other animal signs are also really ugly! The theme song is terrible and irritating! Stories are also flat and are probably copied from older samples. It surprised me how this exhibition received 7.5 / 10 votes from other IMDb viewers. Television is not what is used to! But now most of them are stupid, cheap and boring. Some of your website may not agree well with me. I am sorry, but it is a waste of money and a complete and perfect waste of your time and I am glad that Britain has not tolerated too much (yes, if you have a digital, you have to do it), but I will not do so, so this is not my problem! Loser! 2/10 (and it's very happy to get it because I've given the worst examples to other examples!).
