The worst movie I've seen for a while. Interesting first half is a somewhat enthralling dialogue between suspicious characters in the late night bar. The film then degenerates into a formless sequence of scenes for visual shock (read disgusting) without any redeeming observations or lessons learned. <br /> <br /> I wanted to walk, but the director was there to show me and my courtesy that prevents me from showing him disrespect. However, time is precious (as the director himself observed in his introduction) and I really grateful for the time I wasted on that other half. <br /> <br /> Grace Grace was the three main characters in the first half of the movie, especially the female.
