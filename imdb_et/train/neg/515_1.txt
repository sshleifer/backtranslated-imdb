Oh man this movie is bad. It flows awfully. The story speaks to a car driver who is in love with himself, and then he has to promote the chicken fast food chain and by doing so he does not love himself. He's trying to get out of the contract and terrible, painfully failed gags. Jim Nabors seems to be in sleep mode, not acting. Looking at this stinker, you will be left with a Burt tie like Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed. Loni Anderson's hair is completely frightening, proving that in the 1960s, tons of hair did not go. Or maybe it was a wig. Speaking of this, Burt's wig was not bad in this film. His worst "wig day" was "Smokey and Bandit 2". Anyway, this movie is the worst Reynolds autofilm ever on "Cannonball Run 2". The original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper", which luckily wasn't a sequel) are big, funny movies. This is not. Even Ned Beatty, who is a great actor, stinks. You have a long Jackie Gleason-type villain who has fun hating. And remember that this is not one of the fun movies with which the bag is. It is trivial, clean and simple. Even the end results were tiring and boring and worst, sleepless. And at least forget that "Stroker Ace" was one of the first tough nails that sealed Burt's coffin before his somewhat lively year later in "Boogie Nights", another movie that, like "Deliverance" a year earlier, shows that a man can act quite well if he has a proper platform for that.
