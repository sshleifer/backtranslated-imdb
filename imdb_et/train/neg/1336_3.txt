This movie was certainly not one of Mary-Kate's and Ashley's best films. I really didn't like it, and I was disappointed in such a movie. For some reason, it seemed to be a film they really put together quickly. In some parts, it was so boring that I had to pass it on quickly. It had no bombs or exciting parts like their other films.
