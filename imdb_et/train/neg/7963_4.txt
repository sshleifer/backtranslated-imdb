I'm a fan of big old horror movies, and since I'm middle-aged, I'm an old film made before 1970, most of which was made in the 1920s - 1960s. I'm not a fan of the bigger modern horror movies, one exception is Creepshow 1, which I thought that it was great. I can remember the stories there, but I really enjoyed the story of Hal Holbrook's box, and what was truly a pure man was a great ending. All the stories were great. Why did I like them? The characters had some decent development, the lines were very clear, who was good and who was bad, the horror bits were lifted with a terrifying face, and funny bits were really funny! Such a sequence is not very large or missing from these elements! I write it only by watching it partly because the film was a waste of time and I turned it off to do other things, such as writing movie reviews at IMDb.com, lol. When George Kennedy and Old Dorothy Lamoure settle it the most, it tells you something .................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. ...................... I don't know what it was rated, but it looks like a PG for me, and it's not something for the movie. This is shown in the Encore cable channel when your yuck (yuck) sees it.
