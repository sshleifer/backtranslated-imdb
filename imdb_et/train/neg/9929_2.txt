Watching it was like a big mackerel that hit your face over and over again. Even if you thought, "That mackerel can't surely come over," * got there. I'm not sure what they meant. This is the pilot I watched and thought, "Did the actors know they were dead on a ship that was never intended to be a series?" Not only black stereotypes, but also Sweden and India. And while "Blazing Saddles" made these stereotypes a mixture of comedy and discomfort, these stereotypes were simply offensive. There was no graph, the end ended and no jokes. However, if you are a comedy student, look at this pilot to see what you shouldn't do.
