I have read all the rave comments here and I am impressed with the imagination of these films. I can't say I found a lot to recommend. The soundtrack of Leonard Cohen is not only too heavy, but also pointless. The film seems to be authentic enough, but something has to happen to make it work, and nothing is done: it is a variegated plot (which is not a real problem for me), not a lot of character development, something thematically. It's just slipping. Cimino "The Gate of Heaven" is somewhat unsuccessful and is a film that I look at again. For enchanting reconciliation, HBO's "Deadwood" is much better than "McCabe."
