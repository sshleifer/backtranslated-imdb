This movie is just kids against the evil genre. Thunderbirds is just a hook by which people see it, but use them almost randomly. The fact that the activity takes place on the island of Tracy is simply the attraction of the public. It was interesting to note what filmmakers are about the future of London and how the world fits together. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is some of the lines given by Lady Penelope, which is very comic. They gave some relief to those waiting for the TV series to be repeated. <br /> <br /> Having said that, it passes 90 minutes so "fun" and so it can be easily viewed.
