These were unexpected boredom over 80 minutes. First, I was wondering how to produce something like this. Then, at the end of the 70th minute, I was convinced that it was just a few minutes, and I was going to finish what I'm proud of watching this movie, which is an excellent test for the patience and nonsense of people. Is it worth checking at all? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, try it out and if you want to do it, you may even end up ... There is no unity in the movie and the characters seem to be common sense all. All the events in the movie, you can be sure that you saw somewhere before, and they seem to have been placed in this movie just to fill the movie reed.
