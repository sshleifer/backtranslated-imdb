I was watching this movie for about 30 minutes before I finally grabbed the movie. Sound track, so-called plot and every actor. It's like they all think they're the main part of the movie and scream "NOTE ME!" still over and over again. A bad boy is a musician with his bad guy and talks about bad things like a man. A good man does bold and noble things just when you didn't know he was a good man. And oh lord, plane. "MY HEIGHT IS MISSING! OH MY GOD! It's impossible for him to reach his families or toilets, or else he must be wrong!" (And yes, I know his clothes were still there, but frankly he woke up and started to panic before he had time to look at the fucking seat he was in.) <br /> <br /> Religious girl, I want to apologize to the world for wasting a movie. <br /> <br /> And I want my 30 minutes ago.
