In the first 20 minutes, every possible cliché was by the publisher and the director. The primary investigator of the NTSB was tortured with family life; politically tortured NTSB board member playing [I can kill ANY TV] Ted McGinley; the tortured father of the victim; and an embarrassing mild ambulance lawyer. Hollywood still has no concept of aircraft uncertainty. The collision plane was 737, and it was mainly on the ground like a hippo who decided to sleep. The first third of the body was intact, the flat rear side was intact, and there were no wings or engines on the dump. Most people should have gone into the light of how many people lived with the plane that had lost their hydraulics in Iowa. Most of this plane wasn't even burnt. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of the "Air Force One" scene, where 747 hits the water and then jumps out of one made of inch thick steel. <br /> <br /> The exhibition was so bad that it was impossible to see. Even my wife, who is more accepting than me, commented on technical mistakes. What stunned me was how this POS ever got. Are their things so cliché accustomed that they can't even recognize them? Someone read this script and said: Yes, I want to spend a million dollars doing it real. I would like to have this next man meeting. I have a title on the wonderful bridge in New York that I sold cheaply.
