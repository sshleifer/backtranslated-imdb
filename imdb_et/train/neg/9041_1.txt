I liked the movie, despite being crazy. BUT, I didn't appreciate the comment that Canada was named Montana North. Definitely NOT the bottom of Montana and never. Americans do not know why they are considered overwhelming elsewhere in the world, and that is one reason why. Stop teaching children in the United States that they own the planet. Such a centralist worldview does not become one of the world's great nations. Even jest. I would never be taken to the US as "Alberta South". Walt never let us down, why start right now. Besides the fact that the movie was pretty funny, the next time it was better luck.
