This movie is really nothing other than a really well-designed series of tense sequences that are separated by the inevitable "gotcha!" at the end. Indeed, there is no character development or real plot to talk about. There are only the most skeletal motifs to do characters when they move on to their inevitable things. All this is just an excuse to show the terrible ghost (who seems to have got his family cat mixed with his ectoplasm) and his ghost (with long black hair hanging on his face like a ring). a number of cardboard extracts, two-dimensional excuses for human characters. <br /> <br /> This Grudge English version is equivalent to cinematographic junk food; Instantly, but not really what you should live on. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
