Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" is completely and completely rude, raw, crass and lude. This is indeed the only way to describe this terrible, tricky stand-up. Eddie Murphy will rather laugh instead of shock value to try and win over her. He occasionally feels funny, but mostly loses the plot with linguistic and unpleasant sex jokes. Forget it! If you can't enjoy Eddie's unpleasant style. I don't think I'm bothering "Eddie Murphy Raw". I prefer many within the Eddie movie script. <br /> <br /> Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
