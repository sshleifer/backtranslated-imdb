Something to say, but Wow! Has anyone discovered anyone in an open area? Well this happens about 25 times in this movie (clearly the tactics of the leaders' favorite intimidation). In one opening scene, a smooth call / hot shot has to be fired by the manufacturer to drive in the back seat to allow the camera man to sit in front of the film. Soon after arriving in the field, 5 competitors will appear, and although this is obviously the afternoon 2, they are all convinced that the sun sets a minute. After about 30 minutes of tremendous trash we have the privileges of clown history, where we can see some of his previous victims. When you watch this movie, look at the woman's chest. Her ribs move all over her neck, flat. Most horror movies are done at night, but without a night vision camera, chaos is forced to happen during the day. A couple of night shots that made this movie look like they were stolen from the Blair witchcraft or randomly shot in the drivers' backyard. The film was redeemed somewhat by the end when there was a matrix like a shoot out with a clown we wound around and looked hysterically laughing. <br /> <br /> Be sure to rent this movie if you have ever had fun in an open area. <br /> <br /> DETERMINED, ANSWER
