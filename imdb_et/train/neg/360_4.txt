I read the book and enjoyed it from start to finish. But when I saw the movie, I was very disappointed. First of all, Deborah Raffin is not disrespectful, but she was too mature to play a woman 24/25. The recent Christopher Reeve was also the same reason. It was about 30 by the book. I would have loved seeing a little more of my military life, his friend Red, Elly's journey to see him, because it was an important part of the actual development of the stars. Miss Beasley also failed because the book mentioned she was a Plus Size lady. I know that there was no budget for "Madison County Bridges" on the film, which I think was released at the same time. <br /> <br /> But it was a very poorly made, low budget movie for me. As someone mentioned, I want Miss Spenser to retire and write scenarios for her books as they should be. He knows his symbols better than anyone, I hope he is also considering casting. Film me down!
