Brief Summary: This film reduces everyone involved. That means you. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that I am not a squeeze, and it could have been funny for a few minutes. Personalities are not bad. But in general it is just boring and exceptionally funny. Some simple jokes are repeated over and over again. <br /> <br /> It is clear that these films exist for the extortion of just a few dollars now from the brand Laurel and Hardy. The producer has no real attention to their place in film history or their talents. That's the most offensive to me. <br /> <br /> I liked my daughter so I am also a parent;)
