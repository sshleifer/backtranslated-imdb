It is a genre, which means you like the music of the 1950s or you don't. If you do, you love it. Personally, I prefer the 1930s and most of the 40s musicals with the talents of Astaire and Rogers dance, and Eleanor Powell, Bill Robinson, Ruby Keeler, James Cagney, Shirley Temple, etc., but with the 50s songs, the slower the dance numbers and decades of soap melodrams turn me off. <br /> <br /> This movie is case-specific. The first song was okay, but the next three did something for me. By that time, the story was not much. The existence of Deborah Kerri is another minus. I don't think I've seen a movie she saw as I liked it, including the one with an amazing two-shoe English teacher she represents, half of the film that threatens to leave Sia. (I was it!). <br /> <br /> But I don't like the likes of Roger and Hammerstein's production is a lot of people, especially those who wanted "Sound of Music" a decade later. R & H music has similarities. So, if you liked Julie Andrews slipping, you should do it. <br /> <br /> This is a naughty production with hunting in the capital, L. This is a big production musical that you seldom saw after this generation. You can also do dubbed singers, unlike today, where the actor can't really sing, so Marnie Nixon comes to rescue Kerr as she did with "Natalie Wood" "West Side Story" and Audrey Hepburn "My Fair Lady". "<br /> <br /> Yul Brynner is" King Mongkut "and is a stereotypical traditionist, which type of filmmakers always represent negatively. He is not" progressive ", as the left wing says, but an educational teacher (Kerr," Anna Leonowens ") Today's progressive people always place teachers higher than people who are trying to cure cancer, but Yul is good in this role and even uses comedy with his more hatching character. In Magnificent Seven, Yul was a cowboy who declared the bee. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this is a good movie for your day and millions of people enjoyed it.
