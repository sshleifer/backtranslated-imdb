I wanted to vote at zero or lower. I loved the comment. This is the worst film ever made, and "unendurable" is the perfect word for it, if there is nothing worse that Roget never thought of. I also regret that I think there is something negative about the exact description of Bo Derek. The best he can say is he is consistent.
