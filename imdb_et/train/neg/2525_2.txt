This movie was, as Homer Simpson would have said, "more boring than the church." Maybe I don't understand it well, and I thought it started pretty well, but after (STARTING THE SPOILER), Hermann Braun is sent to jail and Maria starts working / sleeping with her boss, which just started to drag, and I was bothered to wake up. Again, maybe it symbolizes something, but at the end the explosion seemed very forced and inappropriate. (SPOILER END). Finally, I don't see why others think it is so big because I found it very boring. By the way, I didn't watch this movie on my free will because I had to see it for the movie class.
