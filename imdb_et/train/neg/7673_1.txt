I don't know where to start. Tara Reid must be stopped before the second movie. Stephen Dorff looks like he got his character motivation from Val Kilmer "Top Gun". Go through this staircase. Direction, editing, sound (do we really need a heavy metal video in the middle of an armed attack?), Costumes (with their associated muscular vests) and hey, there's no noticeable plot. It amazes me that no one involved in the project stopped and said, "Hey, it just doesn't make sense, let's start." Hopefully, Slater's career may have a setback as a result of this disaster. <br /> <br /> Hands down the worst movie I've ever seen.
