I've never seen anything bad because I went out twenty years ago at James Bond's "Moonraker". I only managed to sit through it because of Tilda Swinton, but there was nothing she could do to save the beast. <br /> <br /> "Pi", "Orlando" and "Tron", this movie failed in all aspects of cinematography. The characters were cardboard and could not create any compassion. The plot was absolutely incredible. The actor was an amateur, except Swinton. Computer graphics were worse than Tron. Timothy Leary was extremely annoying. I can go ahead, but that's what it is. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that Tilda Swinton was in it. I have no idea why his caliber actress's consent to appearing in such a dud was, but he regrets it now. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money or time in this stink. There's nothing worth it here.
