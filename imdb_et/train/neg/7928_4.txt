In fact, this movie is neither horrible nor Sci-Fi. With a very strong Christian religious theme, this film offers minimal content and intercourse. Second-level participants make semi-permanent jobs when reading their boring roles. The only good result is Sydney Penny, who plays the role of mother ... I don't break the movie, it's either Christ or Anti-Christ. Avoid watching this movie if you are not a Christian religious fanatic who is an apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Being a non-Christian, I had to force myself to watch this movie simply because I wanted to write this review. It is a pity that the Sci-Fi channel was supposed to be aired at peak hours this evening.
