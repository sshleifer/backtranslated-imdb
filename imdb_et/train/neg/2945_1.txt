I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision's TNT. Even he couldn't make this movie pleasant. The only reason I looked at it until the end was that I was teaching video production and wanted to make sure my students never did something bad ... but it needed all of my intestinal resistance to sit through it. It's like your grandmother's flirting with a 15-year-old boy ... wrong. <br /> <br /> If you made a real movie, it was dipped in a color solvent, then I looked at it, it would be more fun. Seriously. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in the S-Mart band, stay away from being rattlesnake.
