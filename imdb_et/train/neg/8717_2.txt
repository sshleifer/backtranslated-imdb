This is one of the most fun bad movies I've ever had. <br /> <br /> I watched this DVD with my friends on one Friday night and we just couldn't laugh at the beginning The story is simple enough: terrorists take convoys who think they carry post-armed uranium, but in fact they have many human dinosaurs. Just make a mistake. Cue is an amazingly incompetent army of troops to fight prehistoric wildlife. They are led by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine; a man who seems to be the perfect "smell of fart" as Joey suggested to his friends. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of gore and terrible shots, but unfortunately, the Rance team seems to have a problem with their weapons in the general direction of a giant, robbing monster. Also, lights always appear flashing and go out when Velociraptor attacks (preferably not seeing how bad the creature's impact is). <br /> <br /> Having said all this, we all had a lot of fun betting on who's going to bite his head in the next order. <br /> <br /> Jusassic Park / Aliens style action adventure in this movie stinks worse than a dinosaur leg, but ridiculous, tongue-in-cheek entertainment is a rushing success.
