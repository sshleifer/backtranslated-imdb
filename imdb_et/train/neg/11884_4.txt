The world's biggest inside joke. The world's biggest, most exclusive joke. <br /> <br /> By creating dirty office space and "eternal" humor, this film drives the film's appeal to the ground, making humor so that it is just legitimate secretaries who write books. The public is asked to play in the role of a legal secretary, and then with an empathy for an astonishingly foolish protagonist. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the film is the legal secretary, who finds time off, listening to music and writing. novel while working. These are his goals. You can't imagine what a bump on your face is when it is in the audience when they (halfway through) find that they have a job that matches all three criteria, but then gives it up! The director and screenwriter (Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth) completely remove the public's motivation for empathy or even for an entertaining protagonist who has previously thrown away what he complains of lack of. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the main stumbling block, the legal secretary insider humor fails because they need to be explicitly explained to the public every time it happens. Without them, the audience wouldn't have noticed anything particularly strange. Humor is only effective if it is not necessary for the audience to be thoroughly explained, which is funny.
