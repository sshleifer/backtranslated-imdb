From the critical praise, I waited for this film and more from Tamara Jenkins. The story just passed and it seemed that it had no point or plot. And I find it hard to believe that a 14-year-old girl (aged or aged) would be so divided to get her innocence overcome. Maybe I'm too young to communicate (I was four years old in 1976), but I had no problems with Shakespeare's love or life being beautiful and I wasn't alive in any of these settings. The cast is very good, but unfortunately the script did not allow them to include the audience. All in all, Slum had its moments, but if you don't want to recall the overflows and pipe socks, I'd say that.
