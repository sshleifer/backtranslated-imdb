Of course, I like short cartoons, but I didn't like it. Of course, children love it. But then again, I am no longer a child (although I still feel young). <br /> <br /> I'm not telling you about this story because there is no story for that reason. How is it possible that this comic has been presented to the Oscar? Well ... I think it's because people in the 1930s were not much more satisfied than they are now. Today, where we live, everything must happen quickly. Watch movies today and come to the same conclusion: we live in a society that doesn't let men be slow. It's really a shame. I wish I lived in the 30s because it seems so calm. But every time I got my ups and downs, I think ... <br /> <br /> To sum up: if you like music (and frogs), you need to draw it. Otherwise, don't let that time.
