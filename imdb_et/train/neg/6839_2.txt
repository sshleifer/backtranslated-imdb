The twin brothers who are divorced after birth (due to the deaths of their parents) are reunited twenty-five years later to get their parents back and get their million dollar tunnel back. The double effect lasts for two hours and basically does not add a realistic approach to the Corsican Brothers plot, and Jean-Claude Van Damme is enough, because the evil twin brother is just embarrassing as a good brother. Even at this time, the sequences of activities are not so exciting and Jean-Claude relies more on firearms than on his martial arts. The trash is also wasted and after two hours the film is just empty. <br /> <br /> * 4 (bad)
