Melissa's 16th birthday is just around the corner and she just finds her sexuality with boys. But it turns out that all the guys he's spending time were killed in this overall 80's movie. The local city sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying mystery-loving two-footed daughter Marc (Dana Kimmell, Friday 13th part 3) to get to the bottom of these killings. <br /> <br /> This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the film, and less on its own killings, and so it is able to distinguish itself much from the 80s Slasher brothers. It doesn't hurt that Alesia is a big body (I feel the need to emphasize the obvious, saying that the actor is over 18 and therefore knows that I'm not too perverted). On the negative side, some plot points, which are underdeveloped and unnecessary, are hampered by the theme of the grid, which is used somewhat too often, and the end that is tad-climatic. But good weighs badly (barely). Give it a rent, but I won't buy it. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aleisa Shirley shows her tits, shrubs and ass <br /> <br /> Code Red DVD Extras: star Aleisa Shirley and Intruder Director Scott Spiegel; Both film director cut and theater version; Conversation star Shirley and director Jim Sotos; interview with Shirley, Sotos & Bo Hopkins; still gallery; theatrical trailer for this movie; and Trailers for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals and Balalaika Conspiracy
