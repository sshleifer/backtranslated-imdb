AKA: Mondays Daily <br /> <br /> I don't know what I just watched. The three men drive without purpose and drink, everything and everything on their way. It should be a drama, but what it is is a waste of movies without a one-time redemption quality. "and" heroic ".I'm afraid I can't accept it unless these men should have gone as dumbest most unaware proto-people who ever walked. <br /> <br /> All this? it wasn't a movie. It wanders all the time and loses everything except the audience. I watched it three times and can't see what anyone sees in this garbage. There's nothing deep here. It determines ZERO / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> From Fiend :.
