Why are filmmakers always against the author's work? I think yes, things have to be condensed in the interest of the viewer, but look at Anne of Green of Gables. They did a great job of bringing together important events into a single whole that was just pleasant. I can't believe they decided to combine the three novels with Avonlea Anne in such a terrible confusion. Look at what they missed doing. . . Paul Irving, Little Elizabeth, Widowed, Windy Poplars. . . and Anne College Years for Heaven! Wouldn't it be nice to meet Priscilla and the rest of Redmond's power? Kevin Sullivan should have taken one movie at a time instead of knocking them all together and combining characters and events as he did. This movie was good if you left the novels out of it! But L.M. Montgomery's beautiful work is something that should not be denied. This movie was only after he saw a successful way of living through Green Green Gables.
