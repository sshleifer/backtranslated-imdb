I saw this trailer and thought my god was the real movie who would like to see this movie and at the same time thought my girl friend turned to me and said, "We have to watch this movie." ..I said very much that I saw it for about 5 minutes and I tried to make a bold face and enjoy cheap fears, but they were not even. It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen, that the director has no perspective. The same frame was used again and again when he did not build a relationship, which is usually simply said to cry cry. I would like to see the script because the first 40 minutes were mostly annoying girgles and bad music, there was no character development. <br /> <br /> The plot is just ... there was no plot that was basically I know we're terrorizing a high school group tonight with a stalker serum killer, that's great! Hmmm Actresses in Australia's soap opera were hopeless that the main character, Blondie, was a goddess that she irritated me. his longest line must be half a sentence and every time he was on the camera he just pulled another rude facial expression. <br /> <br /> Please listen to me if you have any taste in the movie. this and if you like me and I have no choice, I wish you luck, maybe smuggled in ipod or magazine. Can't believe this movie!
