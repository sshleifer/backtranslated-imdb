At a time when the United States Constitution and Principles have been established, the administration is under pressure to desperately draw attention to its own internal problems, where the Geneva Convention, human rights and foreign sovereignty have been thrown away, a thriller country. Illegal activities that go far beyond the terrorists they are fighting may seem appropriate. But if you want to see this movie, try Ed Zwick's injured THE SIEGE instead, because NADA is one of the most recently born political thrillers. Like Robert Altman's PRET-A-PORTER, the director has taken a topic that seems completely unknown and prints his ignorance on almost every frame. <br /> <br /> His terrorists are a wildly incredible group of stereotypes - Fabio Test Dresses are like MAD Magazine's 'Spy vs Spy' strip, Michel Duchaussoy behaves like an absurd KIDS who sends Hell's sociology professor Mariangela Melato to the middle class revolutionary wannabe of cardboard - who behaves every convincing plot becomes like you would like to catch. The corrupt authorities appreciate a little better, but are still painted with an incredibly wide impact. <br /> <br /> It is possible to make a smart movie of stupid people (see selection), but it's a moral movie about stupid people. people who think they are intellectuals who talk about the mass. Indeed, it was to upgrade Test, Duchaussoy, and Melato with Jim Varney, Johnny Knoxville, and Shannon Tweed to really make the film's intellectual content up and not reduce it. <br /> <br /> Chabrol may just have missed his characters and events when he took them seriously, but his performance is so intuitive (the fighting scenes would shame the nursery class, while shooting the robbery is more intuitive than abduction) and his inability to get cast present at least somewhat approximation to recognizable human behavior so blatantly that it is actually embarrassing to look at (especially here is the Duchaussoy: in the very good Chabroli QUE LA BETE MUERE, he is amazingly bad here to do it so far that is back again.) <br /> <br /> Chabrol has made some fine movies, but you never think of this amateur confusion - a newcomer to his work would never want to see you after what is a great shame. Trim and potentially waste of potentially interesting material. One letter out of ten - and it's very generous.
