First, this movie can be divided into three segments. Promising opening with some cavalry from Cheyenne. This is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section, where Candice Bergen and Soldier Blue, who are completely caught up, travel together to reach the safety of an army garrison. Miss Bergen talks every time she opens her mouth with the wrong four-star words and looks like she just walked out of the 1970s Jack Nicholson. I mean, he keeps a zero interest, with zero credibility. The third and final part includes the complete free slaughter of the Indian village. It is so obviously superfluous to put on anti-war propaganda that it is so long, horrible and natural. Not recommended. - MERK ................................ Jacobe (comment above) Here's an idea. Why don't you actually watch the movie you comment on, rather than mess up your liberal pointlessness. It's not a political site, but a review of movies. - MERK
