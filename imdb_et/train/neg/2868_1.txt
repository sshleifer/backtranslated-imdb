This is actually an insult to the victims of the BTK killer and their families. The events of this film are not even close to the truth. Why they couldn't make a movie about real events, it makes no sense, because the real events are more interesting then it was a farce. Don't even waste your time watching it for free. Low budget and shameful picture of events that shouldn't be joking what this movie really was. If they allowed me to give this film -10. Good sucking and it seems to have been shot with an old VHS camcorder of the 1980s. Save your time and money if you don't watch this movie.
