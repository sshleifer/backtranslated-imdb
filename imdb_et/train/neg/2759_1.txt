Fun, laugh out loud ... and not yet comedy. Especially I liked the fast-planted gag soaked the "dirty hell" who then cries out of them "angry holes", I mean wow, someone's online degree in literature pays off! The worst script that you can imagine, with the introduction of the scenario right now, the story of a ridiculous movement, the formation of the ZERO character (even between the characters that meet .. it's the way they all knew and trusted each other over the years). impact and plot holes .. oh God is there in the plot holes! To be honest, I do not write it even while watching the whole thing, but I definitely expect the last 30 minutes to go, or not to correct the already pathetic event in the cinema ... thanks to the god we have a good look, somehow we forget that the movie is a load ... well ... use you imagination to make this particular sentence!
