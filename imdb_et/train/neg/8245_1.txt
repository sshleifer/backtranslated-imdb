I can't believe anyone liked this movie. I've seen a lot of low budget indie movies, but it's completely suck. A low budget does not mean that the movie needs to be demented. Horror does not mean that the film has to be demented. There was nothing to fear about this movie. It was just gore-fest and especially disturbing. The action was average, given that they were all famous actors, but the story was pathetic, the dialogue was pathetic. The film tries to be "artistic" or something like that comes down. This is not one of the really big indie movies that only costs thousands of dollars, but is very well done. It was more than an excuse for some very sick people who put their perverse obsession with the film. Other reviews also said that the soundtrack was sucked ... because most of it was written by the same person and some songs were written by one of the writers. There was no redemption feature for this film at all. Complete waste of my time and money.
