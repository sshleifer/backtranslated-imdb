The film is too gray for too long. As the film progresses, very little is explained, which results in many strange sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning, but because of the way they talk, they just become strange and understandable. It forces you to watch the movie again, but it doesn't. The fact that I watched this movie in the morning, I'm sure if I watch this movie in the evening, I'd be asleep. It was a movie like the "Blade Runner" of a poor man. <br /> <br /> The film leaves too many questions and is unlikely. This makes the film a pointless and lasting impression. <br /> <br /> The strange appearance of the film also doesn't help much. The film is halving the half-life of a half-CGI / half, but it is not half as good, impressive, spectacular and imaginative as it would be in later films like "Sin City" and "300". They even directed the characters on the computer with a computer that seemed a very pointless and odd choice, considering that the character's animation is not too impressive. Of course, the futuristic environment is still good looking and the film was obviously not cheap, but its style over the substance and in that case it is not really positive. <br /> <br /> Some lines are also terrible and uninteresting. The main God of the movie constantly says such lines as; "I'll do it, but it's not your concern why I want to do it". If you just don't say something to Mr Horus! It's an irritating and really simple thing to put into a movie if you don't want to explain something about the plot. The deeper questions and meanings of the film can confuse the film and its script at a glance. <br /> <br /> Actresses still did the best. They seemed to believe in the project and were sure that what they did would be something special. So I can't say anything negative about them. <br /> <br /> The story and movie are far from original. It blows up many classic and semi-classical, mostly modern, scientific literary films. Perhaps the reason why the film made me a very overwhelming impression. <br /> <br /> Unsuccessful and uninteresting movie test. <br /> <br /> 3/10
