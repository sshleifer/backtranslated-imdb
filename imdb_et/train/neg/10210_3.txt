It's hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder has ever made a majestic and very funny Maitresse (1976), and now it seems that only Hollywood thriller numbers do. <br /> <br /> This is a very light John Grisham material that has been overrun with a TV show plot. Bullock is Cass Mayweather, a criminal and independent criminal investigator specializing in serum killers. Ben Chaplin is his reserved police partner Sam Kennedy and they are doing with an awkward duo. It is not good if two unbalanced college maladriots (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send these wild goose chasing - by planting very evil and misleading forensics in criminal courts. <br /> <br /> Fairly fair, but while Bullock and Chaplin are not capable of sparking, we also have to withstand many dull, too melodramatic setbacks that illustrate a major event in Cass history. Of course, there are also frequent shots of the rock log house, where there is no doubt that the end of the OTT ends. Oooh ... the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> See the CSI episode. It's a point and a lot more exciting.
