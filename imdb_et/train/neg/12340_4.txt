"Transylvania 6-5000" is an insignificant but occasionally funny and charming 80's horror parody that has some very familiar names for cast and a handful of real chances to scramble the script. A double journalist who is a journalist journalist will be sent to Transylvania very much for their will to tell the story of the return of the mad scientist Frankenstein. There are some adorable little gimmicks and details to discover left and right in the movie, such as a small guillotine for hard boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes used to add cream and sugar to the breakfast table. The health of the film, however, is not as successful as it could have and should have been for jokes and parody situations that are too long. The production of "Transylvania Twist" by Roger Corman, which came out four years later, is much more fun and much more desirable. In particular, the film parodies the classic universal milestones of the early 1930s, so you should make sure you have seen them if you want to understand all the tiny and pointers. There's a real initial twist that shows that Frankenstein's behavior only works when he enters his lab. It also turned out that he is actually a kind of messian of Damien's father, who is only concerned about the condition of the three monsters. Michael Richards, a freaky man who plays Kramer's Seinfeld, stars as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments. I'm pretty sure that John Turturro's character "Mr. Deeds" inspired Richards' role here.
