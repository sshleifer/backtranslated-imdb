I'm not sure what Diane Silver meant when making this film, but obviously she had nothing to do with Richard Wright's novel based on film. summer AP in English 12 and watching a movie. During the periodic marking and checking of the clock, I considered the possibility that the flash would hit. Of course, the sky was completely clear and I was forced to watch the rest of the movie ... and then I write a 5-part essay on it. <br /> <br /> Wright's novel discussed very real issues with the killer's mind and the underlying psychology. Silver's film made a murder victim, which is NOT what Wright wanted (see: "How Big was Born" 454). Leave your consciousness, Raphael Lambert's words, unsullied, leave the movie and read the book. The 1986 adaptation is not a thought-provoking material. <br /> <br /> :: sigh :: Now I have to write an essay.
