This movie is not as terrible as most Sci-Fi Channel movies. I am used to seeing gray CGI blemishes and special effects such as close-ups of fake blood that make it very clear that blood is a strawberry syrup or another variation of syrup. But I thought I had seen all the possible areas that the Sci-Fi Channel could catch. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine a hand with a rubberized sock glazed with syrup? These are the main vampires of aliens in this movie. You can clearly see the finger rubber inside the sockets. There is a talkable hand inside the victims, and the vampire in the Vampire Hunter team can talk about rubber socks in Transylvania. How did foreigners vampires learn from Transylvania? And isn't Transylvania in Romania? Should they not speak Romanian? Why should some small towns have their own language? If you can stop your gag reflex and drive away the rubber socks, your fingers will move clearly into the heads of aliens; then you have to deal with the vampires of other aliens. There are "Leatherfaces" who want to wear the face of their victims. Then there are just fools who all seem to have many facial scars. Then there are the tortuous Valley Girls and their boys who are human beings who steal into space colonies so they can protect their defense systems so that they can attack the vampires of the space. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you think all of the above is funny and worth laughing, you need to deal with the third share of Network TV rejection, which is the team of this stereotyped angry hero who is constantly fighting with each other. Why do almost every Sci-Fi Channel film have to be annoying, annoying, abrasive, crude or simply unreasonable? I found that hoping to talk about rubber socks won.
