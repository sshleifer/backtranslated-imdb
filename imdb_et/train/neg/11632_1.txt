I watched this movie on Sneak Preview screening and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. This movie is just nasty. It is full of jokes and jokes and does not take any pride in action sequences (such as the "Little Germany" shootout). I did a little list of things I enjoyed in the movie and which I did not accept much. <br /> <br /> 1. Dave Foley's Penis. 2. Funny jokes. 3. Poop jokes. 4. Dude was a pussy. 5. Not Gary Coleman. 6. The Taliban 7. Bush again fun. 8. The guy has blonde hair. 9. Plot. 10. Killing Juveniles 11. Uwe Boll was there. 12. Most of the cast was only outrageous and from there. <br /> <br /> Now (few) good. <br /> <br /> 1. Dude uses a cat as a muffler as in the game. 2. A lot of actions. 3. Crotchy made a return (and a mailer) 4. Uhm .. I didn't have to pay for it. 5. There are some "what ef" moments <br /> <br /> Boll did it again. He made another crazy game to customize the movie. Weave to you, Mr Boll. 2/10
