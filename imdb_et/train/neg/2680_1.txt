The Brokedown Palace is not a movie I would ever like to see. I also didn't like the movie when some Aussie people smuggled drugs in Thailand and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale of smuggling drugs. I wouldn't go to this country, no matter what I saw after the movie. In fact, this film smells. I prefer Germany to meet beautiful single women. Germany is the country I tolerate. I'd rather stay in place of the United States. After seeing a movie in a theater that contained the wrong accusation of drug smuggling, I left the theater and my money was returned because I can't tolerate that movie. If you intend to meet someone in Thailand who could be a drug smuggler, forget about it!
