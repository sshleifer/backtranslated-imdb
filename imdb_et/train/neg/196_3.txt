This film is flawed on several fronts. Like many others before, it represents more Alamo mythology than history. Production is bad, which generally gives the impression of a welfare project for many participants who would otherwise have had to work on Hollywood squares. This was the biggest mistake for me - I know the age and general personalities of Alamo's real characters, and the geriatric ensemble chosen to represent them. Texan, I grew up with mythology. Later I learned more about history. I can accept proper production from both perspectives (although I prefer more historical accuracy), but it never gave me the opportunity to enjoy it. Even John Wayne or Fess Parker versions had more life than this tough confusion, being just a little less accurate. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing - to avoid it.
