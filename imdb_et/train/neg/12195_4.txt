The plot is not so original. If someone saw "L'ultimo Bacio", there is nothing new. The rich family in Rome, who lives in a daily life that is boring and false, asks everyone what they think about them. Really boring after half an hour because it's easy to understand where the story ends. Because it is easy to see Muccino's moral view in this movie, so even the most difficult parts seem normal. In conclusion, the first 2 minutes of the movie will suffice and the goal of the movie has already been said. The family saw 30-year-olds, I do not want to see a film that wants to show reality, but for their thoughts, they have to push more than normal situations. Really good, how Muccino put the camera in the right place where his enemies were, and that is the only reason that doesn't bring me to the movie, though at the beginning of the movie. Perhaps it would be good to see how the family really is and not to blame something out of it. Morante was intense and nice, as usual, but with a bad movie!
