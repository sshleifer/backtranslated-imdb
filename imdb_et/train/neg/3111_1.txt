I would have rated this movie minus 10, but unfortunately it is not offered. <br /> <br /> Why didn't I go out in the first five minutes of this movie, which I can't say. I should have gone with my instinct and leave now! Many of us in our theater did, and unfortunately did not follow them. <br /> <br /> The story did not contain all the criteria of the movie. NO primer. Awful acts! Even Robin Williams was so disappointing that I never see another movie he's on. I liked the Tazer scene. Too bad it didn't hit some of the flesh's meaninglessness. Someone needs a writer and director of this movie!
