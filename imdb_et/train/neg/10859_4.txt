This is one of the many B-minus films labeled as a movie poetry in the hope of creating some interest in what is missing. All aspects of the film - script, acting, direction - are mediocre. The operation of three lines is wood. I think John Dall should go to the movie company, but somebody realized he had little talent and that is why he did a TV job. Lee J Cobb, who is usually terrible, can't get up with a bad script and a bad direction. Jane Wyatt should be a femme fatale, but never comes to convince viewers. The film has two more strange looking cars I've ever seen, the one where John Dall goes after Lee J Cobb is particularly strange. DVD transmission is typical of Alpha.
