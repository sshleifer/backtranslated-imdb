Rob Schneider is a famous comic, which is a way of showing his movements, faces, and "no people". This time he's an animal. Marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day no one is attacked by a person, so Marvin has to take the case and rescue the attacked person. But he attacks the crime scene, he runs his car together and gets really damaged. He does not remember what is happening, and his next day, his life is not the same as he thinks he has animal instincts. Of course we got our wife, whose main character is trying to reach her, but her experiments are useless. He is played by Collen Haskell. There are no negative signs. A negative character is a fate if I could use this metaphor. Marvin should know how to become a normal human being. By the way - his animal instincts help him in some situations. Schneider's performance is so. The film is so unrealistic that at some point it becomes stupid, but it is one of those films called frantic fun, as I have written above. So look at this monkey style for Rob Schneider, but it is certainly not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best films Schneider shows. He's a great comedian, but it's not his best movie.
