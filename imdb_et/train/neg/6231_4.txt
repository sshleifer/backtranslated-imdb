Topless (and bottomless) girls, kung-fu kicking chefs, slave merchants, evil Germans with mustache, Cameron Mitchell and swordsome zombies. <br /> <br /> And, of course, Camille Keaton's breasts, the best-known breasts, are displayed in feminist classical exploitation. We also need to mention the jewel Shepard, who plays the whore in the latest movie The Cooler. <br /> <br /> Lots of blood and activities with knives and swords and martial arts bars topless among dancers. hoist building and battles for martial artists who move to some zombie islands where bad martial artists die or something like that. <br /> <br /> Tops and bottoms come easily and often as passengers are well-gotten thanks to the shipowner. <br /> <br /> Then a catastrophe will come when their boat is destroyed and they will land on a zombie island, where mass monks sacrifice young girls to dead martial artists. Just when you thought it had it all, there are pirans in the water. Yum Yum Great german gourmet dinner. <br /> <br /> Just the thing for your next zombie festival.
