For such a film, it is difficult to make impartial assessments that had such an effect at a young age. This is undoubtedly the worst exploitation film. I was lucky enough to see this movie for the first time in my youth, I'll never forget it. I thought it was the most terrible film ever made. Then I saw it again this year and again I was terrified. <br /> <br /> I am not familiar with and say what others should see and what should not be seen, but I made a big insult to how something as horrible and rape as this was dealt with. I love the lower cinema, but it's just unpleasant. Rent a Rus Myer.
