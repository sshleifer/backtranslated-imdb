As other viewers have mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. Colors are a comic book thick. I think the director got his attention to the content rather than the appearance of the film from his "artistic vision". Despite its alphabet, performances are weak and the story is almost inconsistent. Madonna was probably cast as a stunt to get a press release. A good look when her appearance here gave her an album "I'm a breathless (music-inspired film by Dick Tracy)", a stratospheric hit (largely due to the addition of "Vogue" dance), which has nothing to do with this film and has nothing to do with it ). I think the biggest part of this movie comes from the album of Madonna's "I Am Breathtaking". <br /> <br /> When you look at it at home, according to the final titles, "I have two hours of life that I would like to get back." Save yourself wasted time - don't worry about it.
