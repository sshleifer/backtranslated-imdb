I remember when it was in theaters, the reviews thought it was terrible. Well, I didn't think it would be so bad. It was amusing and had plenty of language-in-exciting humor with families around the holidays. <br /> <br /> Ben Affleck is a rich man who needs to find a family for Christmas that would love his girlfriend. He goes to the house where he grew up and comes to an agreement to rent a family with him for Christmas. I really liked the lawyer scene where they sign the contract. It was funny. <br /> <br /> So he makes foolish family requests and even writes them to read scripts. Of course, the family has a hot daughter for the sake of love. And he learns that the holidays are not so bad after all. <br /> <br /> The whole doo-dah act was also funny, especially when they replaced the first with black and their girlfriend's parents didn't even talk about it. And the parts where doo-dah strikes his "supposed daughter". END OF VERDIKT: I thought it was worth checking out when you catch the cable.
