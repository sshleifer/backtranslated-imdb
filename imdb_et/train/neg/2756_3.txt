{rant start} I didn't want to believe them first, but I think people are talking about it when they say that South Korean cinema is top-notch and may even go downhill. After a surprisingly fun and moving monster movie "Gwoemul" (aka "Host"), which actually managed to make a sharp satire B movie genre, successive Korean blockers have become more and more common, even though their budgets (mostly spent on special effects) have become more and more fantastic . Are South Korean filmmakers wanting to crowd out all the goodwill of the audience and investors that their industry has built up from the 1999 film "Shiri / Swiri", making a series of great budget-oriented movies like Mainland China. ? {rant end} <br /> <br /> The only reason I can make this movie is that investors are reassured by the Korean and East Asian style dragon I've ever seen for the final scenes. Now that they had introduced and given him more personality and purpose at the beginning of this dragon, like the 1996 Dragonheart, the film could have some more redeeming qualities when they had many digitally animated dragons. Remember the Dungeons & Dragons in 2000? Has anyone learned that the trick is not how many special effects you use, but how well do you use it? I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends that they can use because they have just killed a lot of international interest in the Korean Dragon Label as they filmed it. <br /> <br /> In short, I agree with all the negative evaluations went before and wondered how the Koreans felt that their people's anthem "Arirang" was being played at the end. As a creature I would have given her at least 5 stars out of ten if special effects or sequences of action would be worth it, but I've seen many video games with better camera work and script (just less dragon).
