The original Boogeyman was a foolish but entertaining supernatural slip. It wasn't a great movie, but fun in the right sense. The third installment of this series, the return of Boogeyman, is simply cruel. It consists of two things. First, cheap and lifeless new film material. Second, the first film of the recycled bits LOADS. The new material is incredibly amateurish but not fun intuitive, just incredibly annoying. This footage is clearly and quickly beaten. It works as a framing device for the endless clips of the first (and second) movie. And boy, are they dipping these clips from earlier films; sometimes reusing sequences over and over again. The only new addition to these parts is the voice that describes exactly what we see with our eyes. The whole experience of watching it is truly outrageous. <br /> <br /> Boogeyman's return is an example of the worst offense flick; one that uses the audience very cynically. I want this review to be short and accurate, because this film deserves no more. There is nothing of value here. It's worthless.
