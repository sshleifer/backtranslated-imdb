It's a movie about making a movie. Such films can be entertaining but require some substance. It didn't happen here, I'm afraid. Unfortunately, Mr Coppola did not inherit his father's skills (nor did his sister who was able to watch the films that could be viewed). <br /> <br /> I don't know how this movie came to get such rave comments. Let's see: the lead partner, allegedly director, is as expressive as the frozen squid and his voice has the same height as he says that a female actress has a face that is never changed, the plot is fully segmented into bits, perhaps with one connecting element, the idea of ​​a movie the film inside must be outdated against the Palaeolithic rocks ... Would that be enough? <br /> <br /> I regret every moment I watched this movie. This incredibly flat film has much better entertainment for the dog. Just like François Truffaut's plot was led by Dick Cheney ... <br /> <br /> Brazil, some other classic SF movies? You really have to make fun ...
