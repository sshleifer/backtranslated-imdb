*** SPOILERS *** Like some bad combinations of Tinkers-to-Evers-to-Chance double play, we also have the "Omen IV" dead Antihrist Damien Thorn's evil seed. Terrorizing his parents from his schoolmates to his neighbors and finally around the world, as he called Delia York, Asia Vieila. After being given a "worthy" couple of Catholic churches in St. Francis Children's Home, Yorks Karen & Gene, Fay Grant & Michael Woods. <br /> <br /> Little Delia did not waste time on peasants scratching their mother's house party. Later, Delia was killed by a runaway truck only to rescue the Devil Dog named Ryder. Going to school Delia takes care of the local bully, getting a big boy just like all his classmates. Later, when his father threatens with Yorks law-appropriate clothing, he is head-sliced ​​independently in a traffic accident! Delia is someone you never share when you know what's good for you. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Dalia's father Gene becomes a big man in the city, or he thinks he will be chosen as a champion of clean air and green trees for Congress, rather than having smoke and concrete boys to take his neighbor now with his own White House! Does his bratty and strange daughter Delia have anything to do with Gene York's sudden luck? <br /> <br /> This is only later, when Jo, Ann Hearen is hired as Delia's sitter, that the truth comes from her strange and evil powers. Even the New Age type realizes that Delia is a bit weird after blackening all of her white crystals and calls her New Age Guru Noah, Jim Byrnes, to review and control. Noah is so irritated by what she sees in the vibration of the color of Delia Kirilia, which is black and blue, a little red in color, that she slips her so badly that she almost fell into the mother of Delia. <br /> <br /> On his way to a psychological festival in Delia, the whole event will turn inferno, placing the place behind mental telepathy, fire and everyone who is also covered by the poverty of Noah, who was at the festival and ended with a leg. The gathered and shaken Guru was so awakened by all the experience he later controlled from the ground to become a hermit in the Tibetan desert. He himself is then thrown out of bed and cuddled with a pet, Ryder, out of the window on the second floor because of his death because he knew and spoke too much. This is when Karen is again pregnant so she finally decides on the truth about the true parents of Delia. This is when he and we face the truth with the audience. He is not only afraid of the book of revelation when he is his twin sister! His brother Antihhrist himself arrives at the scene when his son's brother to Alexander the unborn! <br /> <br /> Three times more than enough to bring Antihrey back to earth to bring Armageddon. The film that came to the public was already a little tired of him and his evil adventures. The fourth really is not necessary, because the original antihist Daimen Thorn had been dead and buried for years. We went to a regular ring, no one believed that the little Delia was "your" anti-hatch until it was almost too late to stop him in his deadly circles, destroying all mankind. The film is as bad as it is too long, 97 minutes, because this horror strike, which could have been a good talk, is a story in 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> Having a private eye Earl Knight, Mchael Learner, and later a former Catholic nun sister Yvonne, Megan Lehch, and now a faith healer in Felichy's movie, which only needs to be killed, didn't help the plot. It only prolonged the suffering of those watching the film. You will see that the surprise ends almost as soon as the movie "Omen IV" began, when the bases were erased so that Delia could take over both civilized and non-civilized world. What was a bit of a surprise was Delia with the help of small friends.
