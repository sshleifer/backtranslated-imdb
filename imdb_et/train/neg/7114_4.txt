In the case of cinema, this film was pretty good since the mid-50s. There were a few times that the lighting was too hot, but the shots were generally framed and stayed focused. With a low budget stinker, action was above average, but the direction was terrible. Several scenes were drawn for too long to interrupt the interruption and the effects were non-existent. The skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the final section, and every attempt to bring life to the skull was obvious with sticks and strings. I couldn't help but think that the budget did not allow them to give the house that they were referring to the movements and that all the things in storage should come soon. Honestly ... it would have been more interesting if it was a worse film. It wasn't bad enough to be a "good-bad" movie, but it wasn't good enough for "good". Get the MST3K version ... it's more fun.
