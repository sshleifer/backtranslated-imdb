It wasn't really a very good movie. There were a lot of unlikely and predictable things in the film ... but I think most of the reviewers are missing out on why a wide audience should enjoy this movie. This movie was brought from MAGIC JOHNSON! Isn't it enough to inspire us all? The film produced by the former NBA star does not come every day. Beautifully stupid kids in big houses where the hero gets into psychics. Every clich√© went out to overcome us. Teen sex. And it was all produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can't say enough about this movie! I'm doing drug use! College hijinx! And it was all produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! Yippeeee!
