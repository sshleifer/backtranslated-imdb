In an attempt to bring back the genres of servants that were taken by scarers such as Scary Movie and Shriek, if you know what I did on Friday the 13th, Valentine fails. Why People Like Halloween? Because it was original, new and went beyond what has ever been done. Why do they like Scream? Because at least it was worth it. Valentine is just a stupid slip that hardly has anything like that. The plot is so similar to the Halloween and Urban Legend that it's not funny. And the moment the killer appears on the screen, you know who it is, it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable. The girl's genre is DEAD Get over it! <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10
