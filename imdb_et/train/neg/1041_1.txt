How many of these fake "pieces of life" movies have to be made? Hopefully not too much. <br /> <br /> Raising Victor Vargas is a very self-conscious attempt by Director Solet to gain Hollywood attention. In general, nothing is wrong. Particularly wrong with this film is that it ignores the audience and piles of each clich√© allegedly in the "nervous" Hollywood independent production book. <br /> <br /> It should be "real" so that the left shakes the "documentary" style of the camera, with no documentary shaking the camera for purpose ... <br /> <br /> It is nervous, so don't waste movie lighting. <br /> <br /> It's a "tree" so let the kids use Scarface as a bathroom like Al Pacino ... <br /> <br /> And so on and so forth. All you have left is a very self-conscious attempt to impress Hollywood, who does not impress anyone outside the "rare" indie crowd, which still feels like a bad film.
