He may have an Oscar and a Golden Globe, but this film shows why he is also a multi-year Razzie candidate. To make such a bad movie, it should be noted that he needs money. He could advertise why you shouldn't talk to a mobile phone while driving, especially at night in a crowded shopping center. <br /> <br /> Susan Montford should hold down (Shoot 'Em Up) if she is not very good as a writer / director. <br /> <br /> He is attached to the four thug at the parking spot and the first thing they do is tell him they have a gun. What's he doing? He starts to beat them and tease them as he knows martial arts or something. He manages to escape, but loses the forest after the crash. Why didn't he go to someone's house? We get four thugs whose weapons and women with tool boxes. Of course, their weapons are not suitable for his wrench. Ha! Of course he also has a tire rail and a screwdriver. These bad thugs. <br /> <br /> He is now home to Christmas - and he brought a gun!
