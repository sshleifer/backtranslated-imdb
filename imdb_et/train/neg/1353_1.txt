What is this? are mish-mash of strange recurring motifs (snails, Shirley's temple, swastika and publicly racist music), limited by any narrative or plot or character development. The whole thing struck me self-consciously as a "cunning exhibition", and I mean not just unusual decisions. It's a feeling of a bad acidic trip, beyond any level of drug use can be attributed to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only movie I compare to is Eraserhead (my least favorite movie of all time), which was deliberately much more depressing, but I still found what it was? a waste of time. This is one thing that gives me another mind for inner work - even for someone else's chemically altered consciousness - but quite another, just to throw strange visuals for purely astonishment.
