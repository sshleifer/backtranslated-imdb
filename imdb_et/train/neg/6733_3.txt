The title exclamation point is appropriate, although underestimated. This film does not cry easily - it hits the glass well enough. The filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone made shocking, humorous, temporary thrillers trying to feel half-documented feelings. Here they shot the actual locations of New York, where there was a real biota with acoustics. However, the naturalism of sound recording has only amplified the Stones' maladroic dialogue and the mouth-frothing histrionic in the butterfly butterfly Inger Stevens. <br /> <br /> In a performance that is not fully modulated, Stevens plays a electronics woman. whiz James Mason (watching haggard and bored); both are imprisoned with Rod Steiger (looking at the swollen and boring) and his slimy cohorts in the scheme of extinction of a deadly bomb, which Mason has inadvertently helped to build. <br /> <br /> Here is another credible champion, for example, who is so attentive to every detail, but is weak enough to hire a degenerate undersized drug addiction. Stones' idea of ​​a nail biting tension is to catch the hysterical Stevens alone with the rape of the Benzedrine popping with the Neville Brand, filling the frame with his sweaty and burning kisser. However, camera work is so leading and the brand is so unlikely that the effect is hardly tough, much less tense. Stones, who are a square pair, do not even have the courage to lack their convictions. <br /> <br /> The movie ending with the surplus Steiger, who travels at the foot of the fleet with Stevens on the subway line, is as clumsy as it is unlikely to be difficult. Angie Dickinson as Steiger's Amoral Girlfriend Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey and Barney Philips.
