I basically resisted this film because I had seen Kitano Takashi's brilliant Zatoich remake and was in the mood for another updated samurai story, which was also Asano Tadanob. These two films are worlds apart. Zatoichi added his character and depth of humor and depth to the clich√©s of the traditional Samurai movie. Gojoe goes from the deep end to the other. <br /> <br /> First of all, I hate movies that have other characters that inform the audience about what the main character is, rather than developing characters in the movie. "You cannot decide whether you are a monk or a warrior," says almost every Benkei presence, but this internal instability is barely within character. Instead of developing a character, we get swollen, boring, gory battle scenes. Asano's character is not developed and even she looks like she is bored and doesn't know what she's doing there. I know he usually looks far and cool and is part of Asano's complaint, but this movie is not useful to him. <br /> <br /> Many camera movements are nausea. There is a scene that continues forever, where the camera revolves around the main characters until my wife and I felt like vomiting. The end is ridiculous and rather climatic. It is too bad that Japan does not really make good samurai films today with this type of budget. Colors, landscapes and costumes were great, but the rest is just a waste of time. I rather see one version of the Kabuki version of this myth.
