National Treasure is about as highly valued and overestimated as they come. Nicholas Cage is by no means a credible act of hero and this film is not "Indiana Jones". People who have equated this film with Indian Jones classical trilogy have seriously dropped their hanger. <br /> <br /> I can't really figure out what target audience this movie was. Maybe it feels like a pre-servant audience, but I found it completely ridiculous. I can't imagine adults or young adults that this is a big movie. Simply put: it's just OK at best. <br /> <br /> The national treasure is unimaginable and intrusive, borrowing what it has from the "Da Vinci Code". I would recommend waiting for this film to appear in 2006 and it will go on meaningless. <br /> <br /> The whole idea that we could easily steal the declaration of independence and drive around with Washington DC and Philadelphia (though never damaging it once), while "bad guys" fight and experience what should be "non-stop" action, is absurd. I loved this scene especially when the declaration was folded into the tube that was placed in the middle of a busy road, while the cars blew it, without damaging it. Oh brother! <br /> <br /> I reminded me of this "Brady Bunch" episode where they go to the amusement park and Mr Brady loses his architectural plans. Except that this Brady Bunch episode was much better than the whole movie! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a great treasure that no one believes is buried in the secret destruction of the US is extreme. Literally, this treasure trove has thousands of undiscovered "priceless" items. Share, of course !! Ridiculous! Worse still, the speed and accuracy that Cage finds and thinks should be "harsh" hints for these ancient puzzles is pre-posterous !!! Oh .. humanity! <br /> <br /> The performances of Cage, Voight and other "National Treasure" actors are so rigid, wooden and flat as they come. However, if you work with such a generous dialogue, the actor's 100% is hard to blame for that. <br /> <br /> The national treasure is one of the films that you can see once. I can't recommend it and definitely NOT buy it up, nonsense of extreme devastation. <br /> <br /> Rent it if you need to see it first .......
