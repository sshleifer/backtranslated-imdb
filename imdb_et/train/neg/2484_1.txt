I still can't believe that Wes Craven was responsible for bothering it. This film is worse than a "deadly friend". The plot is stupid, the actor is mediocre and the film is deadly. I don't know why Wes Craven hates his debut "The Last House on the Left" - an absolute genre masterpiece and likes (probably) this turkey. Don't get me wrong, I like some of his movies, but it was a real torture and watching it.
