In a word ... abysmal. I give her one-star hippie sex scenes and eye candy women, otherwise forget it. Corman's worst effort, none. Ben Vereen would have had to hurt his name permanently. I can't believe it's going to be on DVD (May 2, 2005) "Wild In The Streets" - another retro stinker. I woke up this morning, sick, cold, decided to watch a movie to delight me, scanned digital channels ... the premise seemed interesting enough because I like watching B-movie sci-fi, hip-hop culture and rebels in teen flicks. It seemed to me familiar and cast with Ben Vereen, I thought ... why not? What a big mistake ... it was a terrible start for my day. <br /> <br /> Only after it has been seen, I know now why my newly awakened cavities are familiar. I remembered to see this movie as a 14-year-old (I'm 45) already in the early and mid-1970s, Sombrero's local art theater, which no longer exists ... the whole theater smiled hysterically and even jumped out loud as bad this movie looked. Action: terrible, story: terrible, cinematography: almost terrible, music: terrible, sound: terrible, management: joke. If you decide to watch it after my warning, remember ... "I told you." <br /> <br /> "Gass-sss" is the perfect title for this movie ... you feel after "gassing" watching this filthy movie - or maybe you should take it to the "gas chamber" to waste your brain. I've seen homemade Super 8 movies that shame this movie. Definitely a new addition to my all-time ten best work films ... it's there (er, there) with "Tentacles". <br /> <br /> Ted in Gilbert, AZ
