I saw one performance in Denver and has never been less impressed. The word "vagina" says it all. Body part. There is nothing shocking here. I can tell my doctor, "My left hand is a little bit hurt after tennis," or "My vagina hurts after cycling" with an equal or social comment. It may be "Tricep Monologues" for all the entertaining or radical comments I heard. Monologues were dull, but they were passed on drama, the subjects were outdated and I was bored and annoyed alternately. If I think I laughed, but probably it wasn't when I had to do it. Surely it hasn't hit. Oh, and spoilers: there was LESBIAN! Oh, wait, maybe not, come and think about it. And inappropriate beating! And the broken mother! It covers it.
