I just want to make one thing clear - I love Michael Vartan! But this film gives him the opportunity. His actions are still great, he is still as charming as ever, and he still looks good. But the film itself is a load of garbage! Natasha Henstridge, I'm sorry to say it's a general masculine ... you're always waiting for her to run alongside her best friend. I and my family (who sat down and watched the movie with me) also put a soundtrack on the film; Sometimes music just didn't fit with scenes. But even this was not the worst aspect of the most disappointing movie. I can forgive the leading woman's Easter, I can forgive the astonished characters, and I can forgive the choice of a bad musical sender, but whose choice was to cut the entire middle of the movie and skip it straight to the end ??? The end was obviously planned from the beginning, but how it gets there has remained unnoticed. If you're a Michael Vartan fan, skip this movie: buy a poster.
