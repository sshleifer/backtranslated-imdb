A little disappointing film, I would say the actor was in a strange way. In many cases, I just couldn't feel that facial expressions corresponded to words or the goals of the scene. An angry (or sad, happy, disappointed) character should give the viewer the belief that he is angry (or sad, happy, frustrated). It doesn't happen here. <br /> <br /> A commentary on writers who assume you have already known signs was appropriate. They do things and say things that come out somewhere: the character Andrew blames his parents for sending signals to each other for dinner; then he blows up and storms out, telling his father, "Don't touch me, you f ***!". Perhaps, if we had seen the prequel, we would understand where everything comes from, but there is no prequel, so we are somewhat at sea! One of the weird, peculiar things Andrew is doing is to go to the old stone quarry, sit down below the edge with a view of 'still water'; then he gets into his jeans and extracts the cigarette pack and illuminates one. He did it three times during the same movie; I think we should see it as a tortured act alone and angry? Maybe once, but three times? Maybe even four times, I lost the count. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the fact is that he recently found that he has accepted; it happens very early in the movie, so there is no dramatic change he may have made because of this discovery. It is not quite clear whether it is so bitter or if it is something else. <br /> <br /> I think the film has a sense of Lynchius, but does the first-time director really try to scale such a mountain so early in his career?
