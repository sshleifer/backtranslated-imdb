It's amazing that this movie turns out to be one of my credit cards. This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not only will I ever be bored (not fortunately not more than 1.5 hours) that adolescents are trying to humor this feature is not even close, but one of the corners of the mouth is slightly inclined. After the first very uncomfortable part, you expect the other parts to be at least a little better. You hope in vain, it just goes down. <br /> <br /> The film has no story worth anything and repeats this story three times. One can only hope that after some miracles all the other copies of this movie will be lost forever, and Trent Harris will never make hands on the camera again ...
