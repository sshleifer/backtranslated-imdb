The theme is definitely convincing: a group of people love playing one step further, creating a fake medieval world full of warriors, kings, princes and palaces. Wargaming is an interesting phenomenon that deepens our collective need to "escape" from reality and sometimes our existence - something that almost everyone can associate with. The characters are the Lord of the Rings with predictable mixes and Star Trek enthusiasts. That's enough for most people to look. However, the film quickly turns into an insider's perspective that the nose is almost stereotypical with the nose that viewers who can't. The filmmakers seem to take wargaming and this particular, long time too seriously, recognizing humor and fun when making a film about adult movies in medieval passages and mute each other with foaming games. For anyone who does not sit on their computer for 7-10 hours a day, it is quite difficult to play games or name the last star destroyer to understand what the characters are saying and why we should even take care of it. But the filmmakers themselves don't seem to care about choosing to focus solely on the game itself, rather than building a strong story with a clear story that everyone can understand. What's more, the characters themselves are not so convincing and you need to be bored quickly: a big no-no if you try to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.
