You saw a trailer on another video and decided to rent it when it came out. Boy, I was disappointed! The story is very boring, the actor (apart from Christopher Walken) is bad and I don't care less about the characters, really wanting to run Nora's wife. The role of Christopher Walken is to throw a bully!
