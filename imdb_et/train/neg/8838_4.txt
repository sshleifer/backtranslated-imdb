Are there similarities between Ray Lawrence's "Jindabyne" and his latest film "Lantana"? dead body and its consequences for an already insecure life. But given that "Lantana" offered hope and resolution, "Jindabyne" leaves everything unresolved so that most viewers are not satisfied, maybe even cheated. <br /> <br /> The storyline - the discovery of fishermen in the river, floating far away - is based on Raymond Carver's short stage. It became an element in Robert Altman's classic 1993 Short Cuts ensemble. Lawrence uses this topic to explore and exhibit relationships in a small Australian community under stress. In the film, moral questions arise: "Would you let a dead body be discovered to break your good weekend?" and more to the Australians "Would there be anything when a dead person would be a native?" The actors, especially Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, are commendable. And there are mystic elements that are reinforced by ghost music, unlike "Picnic on suspended rocks". <br /> <br /> If all this sounds like a great movie base - be prepared to push down, the pace is very slow and the murder will be shown at first, thus eliminating the mystery. And so we are left to their destroyed lives and the empty final.
