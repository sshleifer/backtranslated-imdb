I saw this movie when I was very small. This is by far one of the strangest films I've ever seen. Now, usually, I like strange movies, but it was just a little too much. <br /> <br /> There is not much plot in the movie. If anything, it begins like Toy Story, where toys live, and Raggedy Ann and Andy continue their adventure to save their new friend Babette. There's madness. There are Ahned, Looneys, a sea attack called Gazooks, and a number of pirate singing shows stories that all made this movie. Also, I can't help but I feel that Babette is annoying and a bit too small. He certainly didn't help the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, although I didn't like this movie, the couple was a lovely part. I liked the camel song. Although it was a story of loneliness, he had this friendly feeling. Then there was Sir Leonard. Although most Looneys were just plain nuts, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably more fun. King Koo Koo was just a small dirtbag that made Dr. Evil a serious snare. It was also Raggedy Andy's song, No Girl's Toy. It was definitely a good song for the little boys who wanted to behave hard. But frankly, even these things didn't make the movie better. (But remember, this is just my perspective.) <br /> <br /> Although I personally do not recommend this film, even if I have to admit it, it has its charming moments. See if you are interested, but only if you are in the mood for something "normal".
