I saw this movie a few years ago at the BBC when I sat through it. How? I don't know, it's so "bad" in the good tables Kidman, Baldwin and Pullman when they see it now. I think Woody Allen would admire the extreme plot and Baldwin's part could have been played by Leslie. Nelson.it was here today again, I tried to look at it again, but my life is too short. A few minutes I watched, was pretty Nicole, she was so hot about 93, did Baldwin ever make a good movie? Pullman played a "nice but dumb" trade word in his store, which came out of his mouth when a woman "lighter" failed when the detective accuses him of murdering sounds so wrong. stay far.
