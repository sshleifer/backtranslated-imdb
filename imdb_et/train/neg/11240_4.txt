Inevitably an ambitious Kerry Conran sci-fi, for whom this is clearly a work of love. Unfortunately, it's not that good. It all starts well enough - with an epic but restrained score, editing Lucas and Hitchcock style and Spielberg's shiny cinematic mix. The film also refers to many cellulose sci-fi novels, series and films that are diverse, such as The The Day The Earth, Sot, Still, Superman, Metropolis, Apeside Planet, Iron Giant, Star Wars and The Spy, who loved me. The film, however, is not as good as any of them for various reasons: the main thing is that it is so much love that it touches everything on the screen and the creation of a new brave world, Conran really forgets that he is making Film. There is little or no tension, no atmosphere, no magic, no matter what the air, fighting, dinosaurs, and racing. Even the noir elements fall flat. However, this is a widespread way of looking at things - these elements fail mainly because there is nothing real at all and so obviously fake - the green screen looks like a video game half of the time and it is obvious that the participants are put on. The actors can't do much - Jude Law is wooden, Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid, Angelina Jolie is wasted - and that's all because of a terrible script - one that needs to explain almost everything. It is a decent experience and some may feel nostalgia, but in the end it is a pointless step in the world. Good to finish.
