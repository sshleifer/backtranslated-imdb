I usually never rent such a movie because you know it's bad just looking at the box. At the same time, I rented seven films, including Nightmare Elm on Street 5, 6 and Wes Craven New Nightmare. Unfortunately, when I got home, I discovered that the videoreore man gave me the wrong tape. Wes Craven's new nightmare box found this flat movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly boring, it is bad and there is no point in the plot. It's hard to write a good review because I have no idea what the movie really was. At the end of the movie, you have more questions to get answers to. <br /> <br /> On Max Power's scale from 1 to 10, I appreciate this movie: 1 <br /> <br /> PS, which I would like to correct Corinthian's overview (better under me). He says Robert Englund hangs lingerie, riding horses naked, etc. Those who did these things were Mahmoud, played by Juliano Mer, not Robert Englund.
