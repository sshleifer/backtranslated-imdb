After watching the movie, I was really shocked to see such a high rating in IMDb. <br /> <br /> "Fantastic Mr Fox" is an adaptation of the beloved children's classics, which represents the story of a smooth and slippery protagonist Mr. Fox (or "Foxy") when he tries to hide Boggins, Bunce and Bean from the "last" heir. . That's right, one short, one fat, one lean or it goes. <br /> <br /> I don't know exactly where to start with your criticism. <br /> <br /> Well, I was in my late teenager and was never a Roald Dahl fan, but I like his material well, reading some of his books as a child and seeing Matilda and Charlie and Chocolate Factory over and over again. This movie, however, fights for the audience. Is it aimed at children? Adults? I'm still sure! Many of the jokes suffered by the child, especially since Mr Fox, for example, visited a lawyer or complained about malice. It is also assumed that (children) children have compassion for the character who steals and kills chickens. I'm all in the food chain, but you see practically Mr Fox biting his neck! Surely this is a bit much? And the plot ... well, that's kind of boring. I only stayed up to this hope, but I got more and more annoying to make decisions for Mr Fox and his son Ashi. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, humor falls. I only laughed once or twice, although I felt a lot of fun. I think that part of it is that voice action is so incredibly smooth and monotonous. Voice participants do not know the comic timing, but seek humor that only works with certain media. George Clooney's goal is to portray Mr Fox as charming and sleek, but his voice is not characteristic. Meryl Streep has no emotions, I didn't even think Bill Murray had a role until the end of the final credit, and Ash, twelve-year-olds, sounds like he's about 30. <br /> <br /> I love animation, especially stopping the movement, but the visual style pulled me out a bit. The characters are long, spin-like and warm without design. They move at very low flow rates, and often the animation is nervous and strange. There is also a distinctive 'mixed material' feeling as 2D components are added randomly and unsuccessfully. The characters look directly at the camera and talked; it was very uncomfortable. There were one or two moments when Kylie looked directly at the camera, did not move and was swirling on the eyelids. Actually, I was amazed. <br /> <br /> Fantastic Mr. Fox had so much potential. Many people still feel pleasant - see reviews. Maybe it wasn't for me.
