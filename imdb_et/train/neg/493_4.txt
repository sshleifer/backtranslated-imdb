A deficient family goes on holiday and murder and disaster. Violent sexy Milligan at her most home. It's a little better than home video (so many Milligans movies) when it's a trip to the discomfort of the 1960s. Noteworthy is the abundant nudity and sex that is neither sexy nor terrible, playing more peculiar (though decisive). The film suffers from this uneven casting and low cost of production. (Nobody was ever sure where the money went to his films, because he always broke). This is a bad bad movie that is not worth seeing unless Milligan is ready, or because he got some good views of people who were stupid.
