Well, it's as stupid as this thoroughly uninteresting black comedy. In essence, what starts with Chris Klein, who tries to maintain a low profile, will eventually be the uninspired version of The Three Amigos without laughing. In order for black comedy to work, it must be terrible, not "Play Dead". In order for black comedy to work, it doesn't make sense what "Play Dead" is. What is "Play Dead" really is, the city is full of nut jobs. However, Fred Dunst takes a fairly fair picture of Billy Bob Thornton's "Simple Plan", while Jake Busey does a fairly fair imitation, well, Jake Busey. - MERK
