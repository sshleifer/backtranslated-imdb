A young black / latin woman is always looking for movies that represent the experience and life of my similar people. Of course, when I saw this movie from a video store, I thought I enjoyed it; unfortunately I didn't. Though the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story was simply not developed. The movie just passed on and on and many characters on the screen come and go without a general movie. If the director had combined the scenes better, I could have enjoyed a little more. To be honest, I would recommend a movie like "Raising Victor". I was just not surprised.
