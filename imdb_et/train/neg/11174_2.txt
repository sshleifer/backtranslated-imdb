Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Tea Leoni? Ryan O'Neal? Richard Schiff? My mouth had watered. I left everything to watch this movie cable. For 30 minutes I had trouble waking up. 60 minutes and I hit the record button and fell asleep. We finished this the next morning. It shouldn't have worked hard. What a great pain to waste and an idea that could have been an interesting story of "From day to day ..." Cure your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie. I'll give you at least one and a half hours of uninterrupted sleep. Dialogue horrible. There is no consistency. Camera work could have been done with Super 8 and better to watch. <br /> <br /> This movie was a complete disaster.
