This movie was terrible, just to say. It was so bad that I signed up for IMDb to warn you of its dangers. <br /> <br /> I am a campy horror movie expert. I've been watching "Redneck Zombies", "Psychotic Women House", "Slumber Party Massacre II" and many others. I know my score is. And I know this film sucks. <br /> <br /> Three-quarters of the movie is made up of frightened people running from one side of the screen to the other. If they do not, they are non-complementary lines with no emotion or motivation. When the participants start to be acceptable, the direction falls in parts. There were so many jarring low-angle shots; I thought Leif Jonker had a three-foot tripod. He used what I call "Leif dummy" several million times: that is, it is an interesting object like an amateur. Apparently, the film crew couldn't shoot the sunrise early enough so they filmed the sunset ... and played it upside down. Directing this lazy, you have actually impressed the final gory scene. The only thing you can think of is that the last five minutes were filmed before the first eighty-five minutes. <br /> <br /> If you want a good (bad) delicate movie, rent "Riki-Oh" or the base "Dead Alive." If you are a chocolate company and are looking for a challenge, give "Darkness" a go. <br /> <br /> quoting the movie '<br /> <br /> Vampire: It's a dead time!
