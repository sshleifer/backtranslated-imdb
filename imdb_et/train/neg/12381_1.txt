This movie is really a whistle. He plays the paranoia of the 70s to 80s of the city and puts it into the context of the school. I am not saying that urban crime was not a problem for many people or that schools were not / are not a problem area, but this gruesome exploitation takes a cookie. Violence is nothing more than realistically imaginable, but in that case it is not a social problem, but a white middle class student uses it as a local high-level offender. And of course he knows how to play this system. Does that seem familiar. Yes, yes. It is pure violent exploitation, really nasty work. This is a disturbing brutality, dressed as a social commentary. It belongs to the same category as Trash like Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on and so on. The only remarkable thing is that Michael Fox was so broke at the time he had to do such things.
