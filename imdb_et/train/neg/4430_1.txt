Thanks to Neil Simon's dull, dimeless scenario and the uncomfortable direction of Robert Moore, the second chapter becomes Marsha Mason, who received a double chapter for his third four Oscars, giving the same performance he gave to Cinnderella Liberty (73), Goodbye Girl ( 77), Audrey Rose (78) and Only When I Laugh (81), only this time does she have children with whom to drag around. The second chapter is the third and final feature film for Moore, who has previously directed Neil Simon's The Cheap Detective (78) and Death (76). Caan has failed, the characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is too analytical, and there is virtually no detail. The first half is less than exciting, between the cute Coy and the Chan Mason, and the terrible other side makes you the long first half. The NYC locations and Joe Bologna and painfully thin Valerie Harper are not relevant, but at least they give a welcome attention. And last but not least, there was a terrible song during the credit.
