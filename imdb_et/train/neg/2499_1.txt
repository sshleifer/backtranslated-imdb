Part of this movie includes some of New Zealander's better actors, many of whom have seen stunning roles, but this film fills me with deep shame to come from the same country as them. Counterfeit American accents are the first clue that things will probably go wrong. As another review has quite remarkably noted, a luxury cruise ship is actually an old car barge that is decorated with a flag of a used color. Most of the cast appears to be a (big) long-lasting New Zealand soap Shortland Street. It would be like this movie dreamed of Shortland's cast Christmas party, which results in too much ginse and maybe a little salmonella. Imagine "Under The Siege" will meet "The Love Boat", which is run by your local primary school and led by an autistic idea, and you get the idea. <br /> <br /> If you are an actress, I suggest you see this movie, study how to destroy your caregiver.
