I rented it back in the 80s and honestly doesn't remember anything specific about the movie - it's just the worst movie I've ever seen. It's not one of them "it was so bad, it was funny". It's not one of them "it was so funny, it leaves you feeling bad". It wasn't even one of the "what the hell was that?" movies. I do not remember the performance of the actors, but it was badly beaten, the story was separate and had no definable style. When it was over, I was angry that I had wasted time. <br /> <br /> I've seen many movies I didn't know about unknown culture, style and / or story, but it was clear that these films had some of these features. The Incub has nothing. <br /> <br /> I was thinking of NOT commenting on this "piece" because I'm afraid someone might look at this curiosity, but I am forced to warn someone who appreciates the film to skip this movie.
