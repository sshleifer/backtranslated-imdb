Well, it's just the worst movie that's at least the worst movie I've ever seen. They have tried these 666 Satan children who are anti-Christ gloves films about 1,000 times and none of them are good and maybe the worst of them. They think this is a better movie because more they use it for a fake. This movie has no idea, actors and filming are just terrible. Don't even make out that 10 movie minium in this movie. Really say something, but it's just terrible. How can they make such movies in their right sense, just don't understand it. It can't be a Hollywood movie, right? Just don't look at it when you use your money smarter.
