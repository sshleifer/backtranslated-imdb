It's a good thing that for Marlon Brando was a springboard because I don't want to think he's going for free money. Not what his fans should remember. <br /> <br /> Brando in his recent years looks more like Orson Welles and Free Money is a movie that Welles would have done to fund his work. Brando is the custodian of the local prison, which in America, when located in a small rural area, is usually the largest employer in the region. It gives those who are responsible a lot of influence. Unfortunately, he has one weakness he promises, his two twin red, otherwise known as daughters. Even when they get pregnant at the same time by a couple of losers, Charlie Sheen and Thomas Haden's church, their hearts still belong to their father. <br /> <br /> Don't be afraid, because Brando is ready to give them jobs in prison, where they work under conditions that are not much better than the convicted. What to do, but do a robbery of a train that passes through where everyone often uses the money that the Treasury burns. <br /> <br /> While free money has some sense of humor, most of the time is under the talents of all participants. Some of them would involve Donald Sutherland equally as a corrupt judge and Mammus Sorvin as a daughter, but also a straight arrow to the FBI agent. <br /> <br /> Of course, these people, and the rest, were able to work with someone who was much more than the biggest American actor of the last century. If it were not in the presence of Brando and it would have been around 40 years earlier, free money would play in a red state in America, where people saw how they would be satirized. <br /> <br /> Or try to satirize weakly.
