Based on Michael Chabon's novel, the Pittsburgh mysteries are about the notorious young son of a gangster who spends his last teenage summer roaming with two friends. The Year is 1983 and the young Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) is at the crossroads. Art plans to become a father's lifestyle entirely as a stockbroker. Visually painful attempts to create beautiful hip-indie cinematography, the whole film feels like a director - whose previous effort Dodgeball was funny when direct trade - is desperately looking for credibility by combining aspects of other indie films, but sprinkling it with Mena stars. Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. Like many star premiers at Sundance, this year it seemed to be a secret studio sponsored vanity project that helps the director earn points of indie credibility - it failed in this regard and independently as a film.
