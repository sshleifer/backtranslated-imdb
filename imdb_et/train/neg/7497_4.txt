After seeing this movie trailer and looking for Spike Lee's lead, I was delighted with this event. I wasn't alive at that time, I didn't live in New York, so I waited for more history than anything. What I got was an interesting actor, a lot of sex, and about a 30-minute value movie that actually had something to do with Sami Son. I think the film wasn't about Sami Son, but it was a look at the summer '77. Mark me frustrated. <br /> <br />
