In fact, it is basically the same film. And they didn't even get the timing of events right. If it was deliberate because of laziness or carelessness, then this thing is a real woofer.It hasn't even been served it is called a movie.i looked at it as a so-called second feature on a disc that contains the original. Boogeyman.i thought my head would explode, and I would urge you to drive this thing in the opposite direction if you should be cursed for evil, because it must be equipped with a warning sign like: Warning - can cause your iq to drop several points if you are near it. for me there is no doubt that this thing is 0/10
