I'm not sure what HK films have been watched by other observers, but Enter the Eagles is nowhere near HK. Michael "Fitz" Wong should be glad that he can operate in HK because he could not get out of his paper bag. Shannon Lee looks good and has a fantastic fighter (even better than a foot fight than his father), but also his skills are sub-par. In fact, all the English dialogues (90% of the movie - even more than Gen-Y Cops) are so bad that I switched to Mandarin to save myself from poor dialogue and misery in English. below. Of course, there are some decent armed forces (but something we have never seen before) and good cinematography, but the hair's visual effects indeed violate the action. see Shannon and Benny "The Jet" Urquidez. Spectacular and almost worth a look for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, you may want to note some of the scenes that seem to you "familiar", especially the shootout on the outdoor market (think Matrix) and the Fitz diving helicopter that carries black fatigue (think MI: 2). Guess someone thought that at least some of the things on this flick should be ripped off.
