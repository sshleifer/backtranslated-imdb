All in all, it is said that five girls are mistaken when they try to find their way when they stop in the shop to get their direction. when they get into trouble, but suddenly they see the lights behind (ooooh). <br /> <br /> Everything sounds like, cries and violence when they try to get out of the madness that lost it by screaming and crying pretty much the whole movie (very annoying) The movie is filmed when the inexpensive camera tries it it seems "really" or "shocking", it is just embarrassing and still useless. There is nothing better in comparing "Blair witch style". <br /> <br /> Amazing and crying that for the whole movie was an amazing sound, extremely annoying, you get literally a headache :) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but it wasn't scary, but annoying painful piece of movie.
