Don't waste your money on wasting this movie. Don't even go into your car and think you can see this movie if someone else doesn't turn to you. If you have to see a movie this weekend, go to Batman. <br /> <br /> The script was terrible. Perfectly written from a random horror movie format. Considering: a place in confined spaces, a crazy, curious man of different weapons who can reveal all the hints that honest policemen can't put together, and an innocent and too curious, but beautiful and strong woman with whom many are in the audience would be happy to invite their girlfriend . Mix together, add a lot of badly done gore and what kind of hell, we'll put some fries on a little "spin" on the plot. <br /> <br /> The actor was terrible and the characters were unbelievable - Borat was more plausible than this. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** and can anyone please tell me how a butcher's vest can be spiked after hearing without being hit ??? I'm in the army. We need this stuff for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10, and put it rounded to this decimal to give him the lowest score possible.
