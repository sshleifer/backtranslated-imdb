Seriously filthy movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie begins with a policeman and his partner who is parked outside the warehouse / furniture store. The "bad" cop takes the girl they had taken over, put in the attic, while the novice policeman is sitting out and thinking about what could happen there. The "bad" cop finally comes back with a heavy bag, and the novice cop does not think there are any problems, but he still wonders what was in the bag, so he asks, gets the answer, and then he thinks everything is OK (now). <br /> <br /> The "bad" cop repeats this process and even once with the title (made it a little better). But in the end, people start to do that, taking the time to realize it was obvious. One girl gets a voodoo curse when she dies like a road. Now, a "bad" cop will eventually kill this magically protected female, and then she will get rid of the bags. <br /> <br /> Since he had the oogey-boogey magic, he will return a lot of eye shadow that should show that he may be a zombie ... a magical curse will cause all other girls to be "monsters of eye shadows". Some girls meet a guy who is probably a currency specialist, and he offers them a ride (they seem normal to him). But if girls see other people, such as one girl's husband, then she looks out because she's outrageous (some people speak out, but others don't even notice) .... massive plot hole. So to conceal it, the monsters of shadows are killing a "bad" policeman who in turn gets a zombie in the last scene. It would have been like trying to keep us going! Like everyone would like to see part 2 of this cow.
