The first ten minutes of this film about making an international film in Belgium are good: you see the real chaos on the edge of the nerve breakdown, the cool has been the director (Mickey Rourke), bad tempered You've seen everything before, but it's well done. HOW! The rest of the time the movie just repeats: the same ten minutes over and over again. No climax, no dramatic development, good action, not even bad behavior, it just goes on and on. Mickey Rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his career in a scene where meeting and reality meet. It is 12 minutes in total. <br /> <br />
