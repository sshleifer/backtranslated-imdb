Having seen Versus before, I had great hopes in life. The description of the movie on the back of the DVD jacket sounded promising. Didn't give life. Very slow development. Potential loads of cast and cool images. The assumption was intriguing, but profitability did not offset construction. Could have done much more at the end. Most movies are just "sitting". To put it plainly, the three of us were full to sit and watch this movie, and with the 50-minute mark we bothered to finish it. It really needed more shock elements. If you are looking for Ichi killer or Versus type fighting, save yourself $ and frustration.
