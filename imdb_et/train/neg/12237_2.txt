Original Claymation Rudolph: Pretty good. The original Frosty comic: needs a little work but may be worse. But Frosty and Rudolph with the fourth in July? C'mon! Leave me alone!!! It was one movie that shouldn't have been done. It was bad. It wasn't particularly a holiday, except on July 4th. This made it particularly bad because Frosty and Rudolph are usually associated with Christmas. And every movie can be destroyed by too much song. Frequent songs made this film much longer than it really was. The film tried to mix two familiar Chirstmastime characters with American traditional holidays (which almost seem to have "curbed" with America), too many pointless songs and nervous drawings. The result? A bad movie that you can't really watch at any time. I suggest you give up this movie, even if you like Frosty and Rudolph.
