I wanted to see it for two reasons. One, the High Sierra remake with Bogart, two, Bogart played Jack Palance, who can play dramatic roles with some flair, like Big Knife. <br /> <br /> But now I don't know why they decided to shoot this remake. The film follows the same plot as Hig Sierra; only here, the actors do not care, the director has lost his mind and knows what the manufacturer thought. Jack Palance is bored looking at Shelley Winters and Shelley Winters asks her what she's doing in this movie. I don't even want to compare her to the same role with East Lupino. And of course they had to use the dog again! Certainly, they could have presented some different ideas. Perhaps because of the color, it is good to see the same location where they photographed the High Sierra, but it certainly does not add any quality to the film. <br /> <br /> This is a waste of time if you have seen High Sierra before. Otherwise, why not see the pseudo-movie poetry. As for me, I'd rather die than see it one more time ...
