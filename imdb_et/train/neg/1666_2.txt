does the film become more naive than it? you can't believe this script piece. and its soooooo predictable that you will get to the plot and finish in the first 10 minutes. The leading actress seems like she wants to be a Barbie (but she doesn't do it, the doll is more acting skill). <br /> <br /> The simplicity that character passes through and stays in the music school makes the phantom opera novel seem to be a historical biography. I don't even comment on the lowness of the characters, but the good thing about ONE is Madsen's performance that can bring life to a melodic, one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> The film is so exciting that it sticks to your teeth. I think some 13-year-old Britney-obsessed girls are screaming, "O, give us a break! If we want fairy tales, there is always a book of Grim Brother hidden in the attic." I gave this one instead of only one for Madrid in Madrid.
