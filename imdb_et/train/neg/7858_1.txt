I appreciate the need to hire unknown people for such horror films, but they should hire at least some of the right participants. In particular, the sergeant is guilty of using his monotone with a bulldozer on every row he has. But let's face it, the lines aren't really important. There is no really recognizable plot, so most of the writing involves the words f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r and the other mixed bad language instead of the right dialogue. <br /> <br /> "The story", as it is, usually consists of a seemingly random murder and death, a few amazing "surprises" that happen about 10 minutes after you see exactly what is going to happen. Not only that, but there are also some striking plot holes and continuity errors (why are they going there? Didn't he have a weapon? Wasn't he dead?), So it makes the whole movie as if it was another movie that simply relies on blood and gore instead of reducing true cinematic experience.
