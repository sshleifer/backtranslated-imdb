Don't be fooled by all the big names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. They are just glorified. Their scenes were probably filmed within one day. Regardless of their motives to participate in this movie, if you have an actor like James Woods, you will make better use of it. For me, this is a bad direction through and through. The plot itself was not so bad. And most of the participants acted above average. However, Cuban Gooding Jr was terrible. He was so incredible that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes. And because it was meant for a serious movie that can't be good. The action scenes were not bad, but they lacked this special punch to make it more exciting. Again, there was a need for a better direction. Such a film was also wrong. The main character came to action for almost half an hour. It's just too slow for a 90-minute action thriller. The only redemption factor is Angie Harmon. He does his best to make it work. Too bad that the director left his hanging. Yes, this film could have been much better with a big director. Andy Cheng has too little experience as a director who pulls it out. And for your caliber action / stunt coordinator, you expect at least the most exciting scenes. Don't waste your time with it. Avoid!
