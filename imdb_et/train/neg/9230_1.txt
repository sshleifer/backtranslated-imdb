I should qualify for this title now that I mean it. Checkout is not completely worthless. I have been able to see it twice and for the second time I smiled at the expense of the movie. so I think it's worth something. and also if the tiring pain of this at first sight is worth it. as the other reviewer noted, this film is in some ways attacked. no original thought went to this film (which makes the commentary below a prerequisite for absolutely originality). The film is nothing but a long-term clich√© that is assembled and paraded as a film. it is definitely not the next secretary, it is certainly not original and it is not absolutely "good, pure fun". The film is an absolute agonization inequality (after it first sees it, the second time can be quite funny, offensive). when I watched the theater, it was obvious that almost everyone who was threatened by the elderly was totally bored or painful by the film. during some particularly emotional scenes, as Nick was chewing his mother, the audience saw it at all because it was so badly done. I even heard someone in the theater * that I've never seen before. I don't care where you can see this movie, be it at a film festival or indie theater, or wherever. do yourself a favor, leave this movie with revenge. if you don't like me and just can't resist to see what can really be the worst movie.
