The Dead Letter Office is a low-budget film that is associated with some Australian postal workers and is trying to restore their damaged lives. Unfortunately, it is a poor one and the links between the past failures of the characters and the present mindset are clumsily and schematically represented. But the worst thing is that depiction is a life in the title of a movie title: no mechanization, and it is quite impossible to determine what any staff actually lives. It seems that part of the plot is that the office is in danger of foreclosure, but that office was definitely closed in the 1930s, if it really does exist. It is a disgrace because the overall tone of the film is poisonous and nervous, and there are some promises in the scenario: but few details are convincing. In general, this seems to be a job that has not really been experienced in real life; student's film, concept and sketch, but unfortunately little else.
