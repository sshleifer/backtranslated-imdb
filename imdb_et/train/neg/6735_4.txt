The best thing to say about this movie is that it is well paced. It didn't fall. The next best thing is an actor who plays foppish groom-to-be Edward, always a wonderful Dutch Taylor, and an actor who plays Taylor's wife. An actor who helps to criticize Messing's potential stock at an early stage gives the process a joyous absurd victory. Okay, that's the positive side. <br /> <br /> Dermot Mulroney, whom I adore, is much more plausible, expressing contempt for Messing than any scene where he tries to be either businesslike or supportive. As others have pointed out, it seems that he does not have an emotional investment in this company other than to pack it as soon as possible. Brass, however, sincerely tries to bring the film and create a chemical illusion with Mulroney. He does it enough, but is not just a strong enough actor to pull it all without help. Give him "E" for effort and "C +" achievement. Given Mulroney's indifference, one thing that could have helped brass would have been an excellent cavalier Irons-esquire presentation by an actor who played his former fianc√©e Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is weak, disdainful and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> When I tried to analyze it, I will probably pay more attention than most people involved. It's safe enough to pass the time if you have nothing else to do, and less unpleasant (and less creative) than a wedding singer, but you're back to "My Best Friend's Wedding".
