It's a lot much ... so frustrating to watch. Waiting for the whole damn movie to end and finally get the ANSWERS! .. and what I finally had was nothing but HUUUGE neon-sign question mark over my head !!!!! I have not seen such a bad act and such a long film for a long time. And what disturbs me is how someone (actress) reads such a bull! # @ movie script and say: OK, I'm !!! LET'S FILM! It's terrible !!! THIS MOVIE SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCU !!!!!! I just can't believe I've spent an hour and a half of my life doing something like that!
