I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old. My mother bought it in our local Kmalla because it was sold for $ 5 for VHS. He thought it would be nice for me and my brothers to have Christmas. This movie frightened my hell. Can you ask yourself how to scare anyone at Santa Clause? Satan, who sends one of his people, Pitch, to the surface of the film, turns to the ground, trying to kill Santa and destroy Christmas. That's right, Satan sends a demon to hell to kill Santa. Pitch Stalks Santa on Christmas Eve is trying to catch him on the ground when the sun rises on Christmas Day, because when Santa does not return it to his home in space, he turns to powder. Don't get me wrong, the movie is funny and quite fun, but the demons and devils dying deeper in the hell (which occurs at the beginning of the movie) are just scary.
