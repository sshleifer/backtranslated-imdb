This film is the look and feel of a student film project. Yes, there are some interesting (albeit tricky) edits and shots, but the end result was a minor. <br /> <br /> The director didn't seem to say, "Look at this movie." He seemed to say, "Look at ME! I'm a DIRECTOR!" <br /> <br /> Slightly down.
