It was the third rebuild from SLEEPING IN THE ENIEMY after YAARANA (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996) <br /> <br /> AGNISAKSHI was the only one who worked and had a better film <br /> <br /> DARAAR is the director of Abbas Black, who unfortunately failed in his experiment here <br /> <br /> The story was good, but handling was not so good and the heroine showed too regressive and the climax was disappointing <br /> <br /> Direction bad Music is good <br /> <br /> Rishi reiterates his role on YAARANA (strangely, what was also the SWTE remake) and looks too fat and okay The driver is decent, while Arbaaz tries too hard on his debut and drives the audience to cool the audience in many scenes but his voice was terrible Johny is too loud
