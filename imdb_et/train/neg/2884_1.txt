While working in a video store, I found it my holy duty to talk about the worst films I've ever seen and warn my friends and associates about it. One day, especially during the hot discussions, which is the worst film, my friend encouraged me to watch B.T.K. Killer, even saying that if I could watch the whole movie and still say my previous choice was the worst movie, he would look at it. I lost. I believe that even in high school I did better videos and these were hardly big young genes. This film not only concerned the value of the production (it seems to have been done with a bad camcorder, although it is surprisingly clear), but also acting (without scratching wood, hollow and pathetic surfaces), as well as just a general bad film feeling. I remember the scene where I heard a glass break, maybe I reminded me of bad high school plays (I know I refer here too often, but this movie seemed very young) as if it seemed too fake, but also when people read their lines from the script, not completely sure what is actually happening. My review does not make the film fair, because I can't describe how I spent that time. It is almost ironic to do a pathetic job of describing the pathetic apology of the film.
