I had the expected expectation for the film because it had a nice star wand and it was a return of Akshay and Saifi duo. Well, I looked at the movie because it was the same man who wrote the story of Dhoom's franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is comparable to Tashan, I would say that Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I saw the credit at first, I felt nice because it was put in a nice way. Well, the first scene pulled out a little. Then the main shortage of the film is the sequences of action. I and my friends laughed at our guts, looking at this dirty fight. It was like Akshay about 30 hell and everyone and the culprits even got into the machine! Phew ... you have to see it to understand how bad the procedures are. <br /> <br /> Another thing about the movie is the too predictable story. It reminded me of some films from the early 1980s. <br /> <br /> The only thing the film is worth is sexy Kareena, who seemed really hot in it. 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Guys, please ... please ... don't look at this as a real gangster movie. Well, you can look at it to laugh at the terrible scenes. <br /> <br /> All.
