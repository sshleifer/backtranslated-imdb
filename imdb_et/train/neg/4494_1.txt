*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Continues ... <br /> <br /> The whole movie's collapse here. First of all, we meet the rogues, who have the notion that we get ghosts and vampires, werewolves and the like. We get a man who has a slowed accent that talks of endless rubbish, two "ghosts" that do not offer any real purpose and have no character and no heap. Someone has told me they are vampires (directly from Blade 2), but they are so undefined that I didn't know. <br /> <br /> A funny funny funny bright man will suffer the same problem as Oracle, only for much longer and much worse. He has a simple reason for cause and effect, does it, keeps doing it and does it until it becomes complicated and stupid. His last line before walking is comparable to Storm's "do you know what happens to the toad ..." line of X-men with perfect and blurry. Chocolate cake is such a lazy, pathetic cliché and Monica Bellucci, because a woman does nothing more than exactly what we expect at the moment. <br /> <br /> And then we'll get another kung fu fight !!! WHY? Neo is said to be one. He can do something. He has the ultimate power and what he uses. Kung is constantly bloody. And if he can stop 1,000 balls, he still gets off with a sword and still makes 5 retrievable vengeance (vampires?). I wanted to see the power of blowing. I wanted to see him the most wooded, the worst madman *** because he could do something. I got the same as before without "wow". <br /> <br /> Charming car chase. It can't be bad. Well, no, it's not. It's not just what we've been. All the cool pictures of this scene are in the trailer. Everyone. So all possible Wow has been taken from us, so all we can do now is a good tracking sequence, guess what, kung fu fight !!! Okay, this is not Neo, but you would have thought he would have explained to his closest friends the reality of the Matrix. At least they taught them something. It's not difficult. "Hey, Morpheus, don't worry about what happens to you in the matrix. It's not real. As long as you realize that nothing is real, nothing can harm you." <br /> <br /> There you go. Easy. <br /> <br /> OK, so chasing is not bad. It's never boring and it doesn't seem to be 16 minutes. It's just that low. And still it gets worse. <br /> <br /> The final climax of the film is probably the worst imaginable. They have this comprehensive plan that includes three teams. They then only show it randomly over Morpheus between a long, super sermon and a monologue. Worse still, they do not clearly define what this plan needs 3 teams. You know basically, but you don't know who does this, when, when one team goes down, you just don't care and you don't know how it affects what's going on. <br /> <br /> I'll take it together, it happens that Trinity gets back to the Matrix to set it up at the end. This is the only reason why this happens. What raises the question why they had to send 6 people originally? Trinity goes for five minutes! <br /> <br /> Neo Journey The middle of the matrix (so to speak) is treated equally lazy. Ooohhh !!! She runs another 100 Agent Smiths !!! Woooooo !!! It has to be a lot of thought. It is only now that they are in the corridor, so the fight is not on the scale and is instantly over. The man that is the final !!! <br /> <br /> And then the architect !!! <br /> <br /> Remember that all I said was bad about Oracle and a foreign boy? Add them together and double them, so it's really a terrible architect. His only reasonable potential is that he starts to climb. <br /> <br /> And then it blows it! <br /> <br /> Let's look at what he's giving Neo. Choose one door and all humanity dies (except 27 !!!). Choose another and all mankind will die! The choice is what this film is trying to explore, but it is not really a hero. If he had the choice to "save humanity" and "missus" die or save "missus" and kill humanity, the potential for internal torture and tension is potential. Also, when Trinity is in the middle of autumn, the potential of a true rocker that would have made the third more important. But not. She won't save anyone and save her. <br /> <br /> Now the worst thing about the original matrix is ​​that Neo died and then ended back to life. In the year he came out, everything was so annoying, as stupid Jar Jar didn't notice that the Matrix ended with Steven Hawking. "Oracle told me I love one and I love you" .... Come on !!!! How can the whole world be skipped when it was terribly terrible? <br /> <br /> So what does Wachowski follow? Well, they make the end of the original better. How? Well, doing just about the same thing (just changing characters) just so much worse, I think my fa and r keys would have been worn if I wrote a lot before I got worse. <br /> <br /> And Cliffhanger isn't really a rocker. This is a reminder. <br /> <br /> In principle, this movie is just bad. I really didn't want it to be bad, but it is. Bad in so many ways. And what's worse, it's not a budget with enough budget. This is not a film that has a too short schedule. It's not a movie that's rushed. This is not a film where too much influence has come from outside. This is the movie that Wachowski has completely done with Warner's happiness. And that makes it so terrible. At least Rancid Aluminum can say that it is not enough time or money. <br /> <br /> Matrix Reloaded. The worst movie ever made? Maybe not quite. The most disappointing and defalizing film ever made. <br /> <br /> indisputably. <br /> <br />
