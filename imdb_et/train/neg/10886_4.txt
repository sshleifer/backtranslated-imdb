I just looked at the monastery a second time. I enjoyed it before and thought it would make a good drunken Friday night movie, some gore, style, a bit of humor and the like. I was sad to know that I can no longer evaluate it. It seemed that somebody had to look at the epic of cheese, such as the demons night, for a modern audience, but lost things that made the original worthwhile. For the record, I'm not even a big fan of the Demons night, but there were some things I dug about that. Convent makes cheese, but not goodness. In addition to the main girl (Joanna Canton's delightful performance), Adrienne Barbeau was a pretty girl and a lovely firefighter with a lot of all the characters that were terribly unlikely to despise the lowest level of moral, offensive jockhood. The film is seriously hampered by the lack of free nudity, which means that it is difficult to look at the characters and understand the good points of the film, given the terrible dialogue. The evil nuns are original in design and receive a lot of good scenes, though not terrifying of their kind and the film field also has a large number of pure gore. Finally, when Adrienne Barbeau is on the scene, the movie becomes quite fun because all the unpleasant people are dead and her evil nun collided with madness. The stylized direction also produces good results from time to time, although the camera sometimes moves too fast. All in all, it was a movie where the good points that I hated did not shine for me. Those films that love it more can enjoy much more, but it wasn't a good time for me.
