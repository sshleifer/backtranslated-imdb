When people ask me what is the worst film I've ever seen. It's not even close to MST3k leveling or midnight viewing at the theater or even at the late night of the Disney Channel. The only time I ever wanted to jump into Disney World (or Disney / MGM Studios in this case) was to grab Dick Tracey's jacket from the dummy, hang it on chips, and pull it out of the throat "Eat it! Eat this holy dark hair !!!" I'm never so angry about the film, not even "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" or "Flash Gordon". Want real colors and cinematography? There is no babe here. Observers say, "Oh, but it looks like a comic book," well, for me, it's Gordito's color after several weeks of sunshine. About the same enjoyable. Beatty travels around this landscape that jumps around and speaks to her watch, herself and from time to time with other actors, hoping that someone will tell her when the time will continue. To be fair, I have only seen this film once, but the threshold for my pain is human, not God.
