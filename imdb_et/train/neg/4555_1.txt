This movie does not capture any mystery and intrigue the book offers. The main point of the book, the perceptions, is hardly touched, leaving the viewer to think exactly why everyone is doing so much about them and why they are willing to risk their lives. <br /> <br /> Character development is not good at all. No background or personal development leaves the audience at all concerned about what happens to them, and so the action sequences gradually fall. <br /> <br /> Searching for manuscripts ends abruptly and without any real explanation, not leaving any satisfaction with the entire search. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst changes I've ever seen in the book. It's a terrible and waste of time. If you haven't read the book, skip this movie and read it. After reading the book, skip it and read it again. <br /> <br /> This is almost the same as the point of discrediting the book, that is, how badly made and ridiculous the film is. It is also disgraceful because it could have been good if they had achieved this success at the height of their success and they would probably have been able to become a good screenwriter and some good actors. <br /> <br /> Please don't waste your time, READ THE BOOK !!!
