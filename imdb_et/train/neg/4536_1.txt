This film is only a religious tactic that promotes classical Hinduism and New Age occultism, dressed in western images absorbed by those who do not know fundamental religious comparisons. The main tenants of Hinduism include elements of reincarnation. (Some characters appear at this time as well as in the 1600s) apparently reincarnated. God is an impersonal force. Animal life and plant life are all the same. (This is pantheism). Redfield has tried to mix East Mystery with West Christianty. His attempt at syncretism can be deceived or confused by those who are not seekers of truth, but this film is a weak excuse for any supreme reality. Because the old Berkeley Barb advertising for $ 10.00 tells you how to start your religion. As one famous prophet said, "Use Luke's power".
