Daddy's Firenze Lawrence and Dorothy West get some terrible news from the local post office, not knowing they are being stolen by Charles Inslee. At the same time, his father, David Miles, receives a message (from younger Robert Harron) that requires his father to leave home; so when young women return, can they be? home alone. Since the vulnerable pair will lie down in bed in the evening, the local "Black and Ball Big Ball" will start; and a dark-skinned solder adds D.W. Griffith's Dynamic Duo? <br /> <br /> Mr. Insleel is one of his best biographies, stealing The Girls and Daddy. It is ironic that director Griffith will appear in black and dancing ball as black black attachments. "Biography Girls" Lawrence and West later refer to "Griffith Girls" to Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially in "orphans" (1921); and they are too fond of bed! Racist tone is unfortunate because the story of the theft that has been redeemed for the greater danger of his potential victims being rescued is interesting. <br /> <br /> *** Girls and Dads (1.2.2009) D.W. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inslee
