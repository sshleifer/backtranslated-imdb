Two houses, one street, one phone booth, one car, girl next door, boy next door and zombie. This list of ingredients should be enough for a big horror movie. All we need is blue light, surrounding music and ... done. But not in the hands of the Dutch director van Rouveroy! <br /> <br /> I like to occasionally "bad movie nights". The concept is really simple: get a nice sweet, get some movie-loving friends and dive into the worst cinema. For such an evening, it is one of the best in peace. Laughs guaranteed! <br /> <br /> The odd thing is that van Rouveroy still protects his movie as if it were a great achievement. To acknowledge this, you must listen to the commentary on the DVD. Again: faith and laughs guaranteed!
