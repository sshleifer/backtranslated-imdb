My God, what's going on? Uwe Boll's film and positive comments? Wow! <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure to note that most of the positive comments come from the work of the beginner Boll. I myself, as I have said in previous Uwe Boll review, only look at his films in the hope that one day he will actually do something good. I mean ... AFTER ONE DAY! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, seed is not the day. I don't know exactly where to start with the sheep experiment in the horror movie Seed has. To remember people is that everyone in the world is sick because they looked at the video or the network for various illnesses ..... or thinks Mr. Boll believes. I still can't figure out for life why it is necessary to actually abuse and kill animals during the first 10 minutes of a movie. I understand the concept that Seed (killer) is sick and enjoys watching such things ..... but does not understand why Mr Boll thought the REAL shots of the film were working. Maybe shock us? Hmmm ..... well, I am not indifferent and can see anything on the film. I can't find the use of true animal cruelty film material, which is the smallest entertainment. If you tried to shock me, it didn't work. It just reminded me of how the world was confused because such things happen and also because Uwe Boll is allowed to continue making movies. Such a context may have worked for 70s / 80s (Cannibal Holocaust) movies, but not in today's market. Beyond this, we can move on to the fact that Uwe has managed to give the film a very cheap feeling, like BloodRayne 2. You can just say that there wasn't a huge amount of money for production. <br /> <br /> As usual, Mr Boll does not really care for a decent story because we are being treated for the daily police officers who watch the various videos of the Seed victims in the first 25 minutes. All these videos end with the victim's accelerated disintegration. It's all very boring and annoying. I do not comment on the scene of a toddler because it is ridiculous and just one cheap "shock" factor. <br /> <br /> If you manage to sit in the first 25 minutes, you will be treated with police officers in a very dark house to catch seeds. The lighting here is terrible and Uwe is the old "I don't use a continuous cam" fiasco that he did with BloodRayne 2. This scene is so bloody stupid that you should believe it. The policeman tells Seed that he could have shot him down. For some unlikely reason, the policeman does not take him. Given that Seed is a sick person who kills both children and adults, you would have thought of a script at this point that would take precedence. police who buried Seed alive (and they know he's alive ... if he didn't let him head on?) members of the police family. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to get over you is that it's just STUPIDs! It's not even a fool of Hollywood .... just dark. Uwe Boll can't be directed ****. Anyone with an ounce of taste would agree with this statement. Anyone who watches this movie and is somehow entertaining must seriously look at themselves as a person. <br /> <br /> Again, we are treated badly, directed, illuminated, produced, written with a UB piece.
