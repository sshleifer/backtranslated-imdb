This film is a rather strange mixture of musical, romantic, drama and crime, accompanied by a film noir. It is basically one dirty bunch of different genres, none of which works as it should. <br /> <br /> This movie is an attempt by Mickey Rooney to become more serious than an actor. She is a former child day, who always celebrated happy comic and musical performances at the beginning of her career. In this film he chooses a different approach (although the musical aspects are still present in the film). But his role is really ridiculous in the movie. I mean, Mickey Rooney is a tough player? He's an extremely small boy looking for a man. He was actually in his 30s during this movie, but he looks serious like a 16-year-old. Listening to her saying that babe for women and hearing hard talks to gangsters who are about 3 times bigger than she just can't see and do not feel right. He just isn't convincing in his role. <br /> <br /> As the film mixes so many different genres, this story seems to be dirty. Somewhere there is a plot of crime and somewhere it is a romantic plot-line and one of your dreams of living, but none of them really works because of the messy approach and its handling. It's not just an interesting or weighty movie. László Kardos is also a director who has made only 10 films during his lifetime, despite the fact that his career lasted from 1935 until 1957. at the same time he was given less work. His films are all unknown and usually not too high. <br /> <br /> Don't forget that this is a '50s movie, but one more or perhaps even one 30s seems to be one of the 40s. Of course, this is mostly due to the fact that this film became black and white. In general, black-and-white black films of the 50's often have a cheap feeling and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> This is a rather strange sight with Mickey Rooney and Louis Armstrong and his band together. It was not the only movie Armstrong appeared, and he often appeared in such films, often just for himself. I think jazz players can still enjoy this movie somewhat because of their music, because there is quite a lot in this movie. The film received the Oscar nomination for the best original song. <br /> <br /> A little bit of a movie and a trip from Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> 4/10
