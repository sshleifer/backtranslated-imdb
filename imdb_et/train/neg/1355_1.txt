I saw Crispin Glover "What is it?" Ann Arbor Film Festival. Indeed, the film had at least been skilfully named because I had a clear feeling that even the writer / director could not answer. In a survey and response session after screening, Mr. Glover said the film was originally intended to be a short film to show the use of actors with sub-syndrome. But this is not in itself a sufficient reason to create a movie. In my opinion, the actors are the blocks for building a greater vision - a larger vision that seemed to be the best and the worst. <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover also said he wanted to address taboo issues. Well, he does it. But why? The film has no position, no reason to do anything. Does he feel these things should not be taboo? The film doesn't even give it anything. Taboo is not interesting for taboo. He can't even allow the taboo to be disturbed or incited at any level because he has not taken care of the audience in any way. <br /> <br /> If for some time the concept was not taken into account, what was most shocking to me was how badly the film was put together. Editing, cinematography, and other technical aspects often seemed very amateurs. Glover said 125-150 thousand dollars went to the film and I feel the money should have been spent on different designers (Glover actually made the design myself - I know I saw at least a credit design). Painted sets are okay (not big), but they are badly used. Some feel like a photographed stage - what would be good for some purpose, but in Glover's hands, it just seems sloppy. The other parts have been filmed as a kind of home video that is of inferior quality to the many things I see on filmmakers for the first time on iMovie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem "What is it?" I can't even figure out how serious the film is. There are some parts that feel that Glover screams at you to think seriously. At other points, he seems to have little fun. Perhaps he thought it would be ironic or meaningful in some way, but I just felt that Glover couldn't even pay serious attention to his film. <br /> <br /> Glover said he wanted this to be a short film. If only it had been. After seventy-two minutes, the film has lost twenty-two pictures and ideas, and it is debatable whether the ideas are formulated enough to claim that they were even in that period.
