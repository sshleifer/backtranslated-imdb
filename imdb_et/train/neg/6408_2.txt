UPA films are surprisingly well rated by IMDb, despite the fact that the animation quality is behind the light years of looney Toons, Disney and MGM. Unfortunately, due to the increase in the cost of beautiful cartoons with beautiful frames and beautiful backgrounds, the UPA style (which debuted around 1950) began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s. After all, the movies were black cheap and they got several Osars to "prove" that the cartoons were now in the mainstream. As a result, bad animation became a norm and this trend was not changed before 1980. <br /> <br /> This UPA movie is one of the early ones. The characters are very easily drawn (all simpler and they would have used drawings) and the backgrounds were ugly - simple drawings with colors added in a very cunning manner (often with sponge and rarely in full volume). <br /> <br /> As for the story, it is a powerful jazz-style attitude. Some love it, others find it very, very loud. It's a traditional "Frankie and Johnny" story, and because of the shots and everyone, it's probably not a great movie for kids. Heck, because of animation and jazz, it's not a very good movie for me either! Some people read my review and I doubt I am a crank (which I have to some extent). But I love animated movies and a small part of this minimalist UPA style goes a long way and you can't really regard them as great works of art - just very, very quickly made cartoons. Ignore the Oscars and try to watch some classic cartoons or something - something else!
