This movie was confusing at first. I like Gina Phillips, but what I have to say was a bad choice as she made the movie Ring Around the Rosie that one of her good films. Jeepers Creepers was better. Anyway, Faye Dunaway was good. He pulled me completely and at the end, it was crazy. It was about Jennifer Cassi (Phillips) coming to the funeral of her two sisters. She stays at the house where her sister owns and her grandmother (Dunaway) lives with her aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen (Dunaway) sacrifices her relationship to survive and as long as she wants to live, she can't die. Even if Jennifer tries to kill her, she tries. Ravens has a strange part in this. When the relationships go to sleep, the brothers eat organs there, so they can't sleep. But they do it. Basically it's all crazy and Mary Ellen is ever dying and her relationship is buried, but not dead, b / c they have to endure forever so Mary Ellen can survive. Yes, I hope it helps. If not, excuse me. Love you.
