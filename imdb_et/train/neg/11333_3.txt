This movie is just nonsense. Although the directors claim that they are part of this culture, it is still a very, very bad director's debut. The theme itself is very interesting and I accept bad behavior because they are all amateurs and have never acted before, but the worst thing about this film is dialogues and very inexperienced and naive leadership. There's no timing in this movie. I felt as if the directors had left the film (this is their first feature) that they didn't really ask themselves what kind of story they wanted to say. I met Ben (one of the directors) on several occasions and he is a nice and thoughtful man, but it doesn't make him a leader. I think "American History X" is full of clichés, but somehow manages to transport the story. "Oh! Warning" is full of clichés, nothing new or provocative and (this is the sad thing about this movie) it's far from Oh! -Reality. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a strange but wonderful German movie, watch the films by Michael Haneke, Christoph Schlingensief, Oskar Roehler, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel: <br /> <br /> Benny's Video Funny Games Die Unberührbare Mein Letzter Film Das Experiment Das Weisse Rauschen Muxmäuschenstill ... <br /> <br /> *** of ten due to theme and photography
