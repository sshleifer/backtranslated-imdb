This movie is bad. I just don't want to say it's bad; "Oh script was bad", or; "Acting in this scene was bad" ..... I mean bad, as someone should be responsible for this unmodified pile of steaming the eavesdrop to an unsuspecting public. I don't even deserve it (figure?) With an explanation if I can refer to it. I can think of another event while watching a 40-year-old movie. my spleen in the movie. I mean, finally, no one will deliberately make a bad movie, will they? Well. Obviously they ... and the guilty man is the writer / director Ulli Lommel. But the worst thing is that Blockbusters have actually leased their customers! Recommend. Leave that mess where it belongs. Hanging on the shelf, collecting dust.
