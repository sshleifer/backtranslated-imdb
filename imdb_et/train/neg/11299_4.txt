The mummy's tomb begins with an overview of Mummy's hand events, and then the story goes several years on and across the ocean to the United States, where the current high priest and mummy Kharis tried to destroy and revenge those who broke the grave in the past. <br /> <br /> Although I loved "mommy" with Boris Karloff as a mummy Imhotep, and I liked Tom Tyler like Kharis "Mummy's Hand". direct prequel to this movie), I wasn't like "The Mummy's Tomb". <br /> <br /> It is made in a similar style to the previous film and has a somewhat similar plot, though in a new environment. Lon Chaney Jr is like Kharis, but he doesn't seem to. And I think this is my main criticism of this movie - that nothing really looks like. There is nothing really terrible here, but nothing really spectacular, so the viewer is left with a rather spooky mummy story.
