This is a television-made and rather unnecessary story of Beowulf, especially after the latest 2005 film "Beowulf and Grendel". This film does not really go to Beowul's story, but simply takes us through a battle that has bounced on the name of the beast Grendel, because it leaves the king in absolute fear and confusion, as a powerful viking warrior, Beowulf has been called to get rid of these monster rampage. Once this has been successfully achieved, the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep it at night. After some unsuccessful attempts, the creature is killed, but it is an angry and terrible mother soon to attack, leaving it to Beowulf to win her mighty bravery and strength to defeat it. "Grendel" looks like it's done with a small budget and the CG effects are terrible. As I said, this movie is totally unnecessary.
