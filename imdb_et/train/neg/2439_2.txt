Dorna von Rouveroy's "intensive care" is one of the worst horror films ever made. This extremely cheap Dutch-language flick offers some gateways and many absurd situations. The fear veteran George Kennedy is completely wasted as Professor Bruckner. Abysmal, action is slow and the climax is ridiculous. The famous surgeon has a car accident. He's been in the coma for seven years and then wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage. "Intensive Care" clearly influences American films including "Halloween" and "Friday 13". Deaths are fun and dialogues are painfully stupid. If you are in the right mood, you can give this piece to the trash. You laugh until it hurts you can believe me!
