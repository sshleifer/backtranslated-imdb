Roy Rogers and the company are trying to bring "Sintown" back to life - this is a ghost town that can gain momentum when silver mining is successful. Andy Devine (as a "cookie") bounces. Jane Frazee (like Carol) loses some of her bitches, Mr. Rogers. Foy Willing and Purple Sage riders (or have it sung?) A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and sons of pioneers. James Finlayson (from Laurel and Hardy) adds a "hit" look to the Grand Canyon Trail. The open floor slab offers winning comedy. Mr Devine else hits his heels. The energetic performance is also energetic - but this material is not Grand. <br /> <br /> Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine
