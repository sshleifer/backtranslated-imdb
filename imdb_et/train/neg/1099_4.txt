I was shocked by Tigerland's ridiculously incredible. It was a liberal fantasy of how the army should be. The dialogue was difficult to swallow with the stupid things Colin Farrell's character promised to get access to his senior officials. the soldiers had to stand up for battle and turn them into one unit. I took Bozzi to get his ass because he was such a threat to his soldiers. I wouldn't want to fight with a similar war because he was more interested in knowing people than what was needed to protect his unit. <br /> <br /> - <br /> <br />
