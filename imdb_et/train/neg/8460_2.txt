I only rented this movie because of the promises made by William Dafoe and Robert Rodriguez. I assumed that if you see RR (actor) on the cover, this film would be good. It sounds like a movie Rodriguez would have done if he wanted to give him a name, if it had to be good? ERROR ERROR ERROR. Worst editing from "Manos' Fate". The way it was changed didn't make sense and made the movie unobtrusive, and after the first 30 minutes you don't even want to follow it. I have no idea how Dafoe and Rodriguez participated in this movie, maybe they owe someone, but they're good for that. Besides, they were only a few minutes in this movie and Rodriguez didn't even speak. So if you want to see a movie that has poor editing, bad performance and a confusing story than my guest, but doesn't say you're not warned.
