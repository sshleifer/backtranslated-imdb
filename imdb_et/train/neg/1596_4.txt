Not one of the best pokemon movies. <br /> <br /> Two legendary pokemons come to the story. You can see how strong Celeb can be, even though it turns first on evil. <br /> <br /> Suicune is also a look, he didn't seem so powerful. <br /> <br /> Don't you have a lot of strong Pokemon except this taranitar? Some fight scene with your pokemon may have made it better. <br /> <br /> Ash and Pikachu meet with a much younger professor oak, though they don't understand it. Misty thought it was at the end, but he didn't come close. I saw this credit. <br /> <br /> Don't wait here for the worst series so far.
