This movie is one of those I regret to have put in my 90 minutes of life that I will never come back. The prerequisite is really interesting - it is essentially a zombie flick from the undead point of view (the hairs don't share whether they are dead or not. Unfortunately, they are unable to play a good role in this framework. Almost intolerable monotony of a central character's life can enhance the film's realism, but it sucks all the value of entertainment immediately out If they had made a little more effort to get the viewer involved, it would have been much more likely that they would go home with social commentary.
