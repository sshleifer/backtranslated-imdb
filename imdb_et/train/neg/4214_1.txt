After just wasting a few hours of looking at it and 80% of that time being totally unbelievable, I can give this garbage year to a turkey that isn't a problem. Saying that the plot was incredible, there is some big underestimation. Frankly, I lost my words to describe this surprise. The signs are not completely and completely without the similarity of originality (such things have been done by many dozens of "serum killers"), but the action was terrible. For those who pay for it, I hope you get your money back, for those who paid for it, I hope you will give your money back. Believe me that there are many new releases that are much, much better. Look.
