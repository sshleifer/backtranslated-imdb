Really one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. I've never really taken the time to write one of them, but I felt like I had witnessed it after making the film and feel somewhat impatient to say honestly that I have time for such a turmoil. There were so many parts that shamed me with total randomness and thought (for example, when would the police force ever have let people with infectious diseases? When would the hospitals treat such people?) , while he rolled up in bed? Also, the characterization - as we almost expected in such films - was terrible (eg how a blonde man - I don't remember his frickin's name and doesn't give any beats anyway - he turned to his girlfriend and ran away to leave him) Stop it all terribly! Production was horribly scattered and cinematography was something to write home.
