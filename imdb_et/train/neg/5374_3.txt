CRIMSON RIVERS are one of the most targeted, above all, I've ever seen from France. Nothing is worse than French production trying to make Hollywood movies and CR is a great example of such a wannabe horror / action / buddy flick. I almost finished it halfway because I knew it would be nothing more than the French guys trying to show. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a promising film like an expansive horror movie, but it quickly shifts genres, from horror to action to x-file type, to a friend's fate that eventually CR is all that and none of it. It's so full of clich√©s that at one point I thought the whole thing was comedy. The painful dialogue and those silent breaks that disappear and disappear just in the right moments of exposure made me silent. I thought only movies made in Hollywood used this hackneyed technique. <br /> <br /> The Chase scene, where Vincent Cassel runs after the killer, is so exaggerated and superfluous that it's almost beauty. A mountain area on the hill, a foolish revelation of the killer (s) with Cassel and Reno, who play "friends", like Nolte and Murphy in 48 HRS, completely robbed this film of little credibility. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that the director of CRIMSON RIVERS also led GOTHIKA, which is partly related to the problems, not even going too close to this overwhelmed movie.
