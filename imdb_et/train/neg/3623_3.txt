(aka: BLOOD CASTLE or DEMON SCREAM) <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * <br /> <br /> It was a built-in feature with VELVET VAMPIRE. Spanish-Italian co-production, which involves murdering several women in the village at the same time, shows a local figure called Yanos Dalmar, who drives off with his "male eating" dog. <br /> <br /> The townspeople already suspect that he is behind it and wants his castle to burn. The murder began first with the time when Yanos' older brother, Count Igor Dalmar, was terribly burned and killed in a lab accident. <br /> <br /> Then Inana (Erna Schuer), to whom Igor hired before her death, to help her in her experiments. Yanos agrees to hire her instead of her brother and together they are looking for formulas for regenerating dead cells. Yanos wants to bring back Igor's thin body. <br /> <br /> But Igor is naturally alive (albeit terribly burnt) and pursues and kills women in the village. We see that his face-baked face appears in various places on the film, so we know he's still alive, making the whole thing a little too obvious. <br /> <br /> Igor will meet another fiery end with Yanos over Ivanna, where burning candles fall into the same bed as Igor stumbles upon, meeting another final charcoal. <br /> <br /> The Retromedia DVD is taken from a VHS source and looks pretty grainy and bad. Other caravans are not included in other accessories. Although it is beautiful, creepy with Spanish castle and good atmosphere, I found it to be quite boring and predictable, without any excitement or mystery. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
