... although there was a clear lack of blood in the film, which seems to be trying to market itself as a horror. <br /> <br /> There was also a clear lack of qualified management, behavior, editing and script writing. <br /> <br /> Jeremy London has put on one of the most terrible performances I've ever seen - his "madness in the maelstrom of descent" is painlessly self-conscious and clumsy. Oh look at her twinkle! Oh look at him to drink strong spirits! Look at her, lift her eyebrow and fall with a dirty corner with her head! Look at her unwashed, greasy dark hair! Oh listen to his affected husky voice! He must be a tortured artist / writer / genius! Oh, yeah, the poet-shirt is coming out - it's another boy who thinks he's Byron. (Or Store.) Oh, that love ... did anyone give this man's handbook "How to act good" or whether they just pulled it out of a cardboard box somewhere, a lost little plastic toy award for a finished brand-favored-bin grain. Okay, it was a silly line - but it's just because London's performance has melted its brain with its horror. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is cute and very sharp, but she hasn't grown as an actor yet - she gave her lines as she was detained; lines - who knows, maybe he just reacted and tried to neutralize, Jeremy London's flailing is superfluous, but if it does, he will take it too far. <br /> <br /> Noteworthy is Arie Verveen as Poe - while her character's role is confused, she offers the best result. He just looks right, but it is more than that - he has some depth, I believed he had life beyond the two-dimensional quality of the rest of the characters. Perhaps this is just because I like Poe, and then I could just let my mind go astray and invent it when it was on the screen - no matter what he was missing. <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are blur of the face - all the usual cartoons: a perky blonde, the best friend who is a little cozy; a naughty local policeman who's a little fuckin '; a defensive senior man who may have too many fathers' interest in our heroine; spooky old witch etc etc. <br /> <br /> As with the "lack of special blood for horror film", none of the topics mentioned (and that London character - so dirty - in his attack on Poe writing) are followed. As another reviewer said, there was potential: murder, incest, - really shocking stuff, but instead they hide from things and cut off from violence (a raised candlestick that pulls through the air - closing it as a victim - then - cut into black! This is nice Noirishi's traditional horror, this is really to be expected, and it is a pleasure when it happens - this is an expensive convention, especially if it comes with fake flash bolts and intense Siouxie eye makeup - but the descendant it just comes up clumsy or as if the editor last It could have been a very tense psychological thriller - horror / fraud / madness - or a simple (and fun) movie: it tries to be both or not (something new and exciting!), but in either case it fails . The only fear element of this whole movie is this epic boredom. <br /> <br /> I think the editor (if any) must be drunk when he chipped it. scenes; scenes that seemed to have failed (but what could have been a bad script). Lkewis Director and Operator - There were some very strange shots and framing that I think they should have been a tribute to Hitchcock or Browning, but it was just stupid (again a fine dagger, but it was trying to be something else). Maybe the whole thing might be funny (in the way that previous reviewers have mentioned - "OMG how did it get?!"), If I had been in the trash, unfortunately I had a dissatisfaction on the couch, the lights were low, with the explicit intent to scare me - this is a very bad film, and I'm afraid it can't be recommended to people, not even laughing. <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time or money - borrow a real horror / thriller movie or find yourself a copy of the fantastic tales of the Store as you are. I have a much more enjoyable and frightening night than you could ever achieve with this garbage.
