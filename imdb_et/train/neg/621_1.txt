Holy @ #% and this movie was still warm and juicy. I tried to look at this fabric as a seal of waste, but I find that my wrists slashes were simpler and Lysol's floor cleaner fired back when he had more than half of the mess on my screen. I'll put it down on anything I've ever watched on film or on TV, and it says something. I had once seen a cow in the field. I looked at the steaming pile and half an hour who knows ... maybe it could have been moving or something. Well, it was time to spend it better when you look at this view. The operation was non-existent, the plot was elsewhere than on this film. I think I saw a section that you saw early when the plot managed to escape and drove back in the background at the back of an old pickup, going to Portland to become Steven King. Please tell me that the Director has medicines he needs so badly. It is quite clear that he needs heavy medications and I would be prepared for the money needed to cancel my lobotomy. Bah ... I can't give this review because it's not necessary because something like that can never be fair in a printed word. Let me just say that if you are looking for a flick after some time and you see it on the Chilton shelf, walk into the car, start the engine, then put both fists straight into the fan until you feel your bones vibrate any more. Be sure to keep your wallet because you were wasting cash. You may also have the privilege of wasting yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, I watched it after my "friend" sent her girlfriend to see it. He came over, SHE was too. What's even worse is that he had to see this $% & @ thing twice! I heard their marriage now and he can visit his palette once a month. I hope it was because of this movie.
