This is one of the worst films I've seen throughout my life. I wish I could travel in time and do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Find out where the movie "War Games - The Dead Code" was filmed 2) See your current WAR GAMES computer knowledge AND the 1983 preteen eyes. 3) In the 80s, the twentieth computer will penetrate the knowledge and perspectives you learned and remember. 4) Program WHOPPER for NUKE if it is in DEAD CODE location before your first filming day 5) Come back to the present, be beer and get Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to empty your memory, especially my "Dead Code" preview 6) Be one more beer and see WARS GAMES 7) Be happy until the next bad remake of GOOD 80 movie. <br /> <br /> 8) I forgot the Jar Jar was killed. I'm not sure if I have to go ahead. Maybe I need access to a wormhole.
