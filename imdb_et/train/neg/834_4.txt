I found it to be a complete waste of time, effort, and money. I know Disney always shows a lack of creativity when making "direct video" movies - but the transformation of the original movie "with a new perspective" is ever lower ... they will soon be releasing the original movies with new animation and new songs and calling it "movie new version we all love. " Nathan Lane returns to Timon's surprise again. The animated animals of the original "Lion King" world Timon and Pumbaa start a narrative journey to tell us the original story of how it really happened ... as they see it. <br /> <br /> Of course Timon is now creating a hero, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah ... <br /> <br /> The musical sequences are flat and the animation is crap. Vocal talents are impressive for the video feature, but when you remember Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg, or Nathan Lane, is there any real commercial content? In general, if you liked the original, you hate it. It is offensive because it is unfair for both children and adults. And that's a summary.
