I believe that war films should try to pass on the fear of war, avoid idealism and respect some basic military principles. Zvezda barely makes the first. Zvezda was a Russian military film, I was expecting patriotism, sentimentality, beautiful poetic images, lush results, Slavic cheek-like and cruel Germans. I did not need naive love for non-matter, unrealistic foolish misuse of war mushrooms and syrups in a film that carefully kept all historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism, Holocaust) to stop only passing but still insulting our sense of "Polish liberation" in our history. Missed opportunity as a film, but not propaganda apparently.
