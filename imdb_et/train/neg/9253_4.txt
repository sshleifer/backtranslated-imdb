If I hadn't read my name on the DVD, I would never have suspected that the man, who was so closely connected to the new wave of France, was making this very fine and old-fashioned music. In fact, the film is so far away that I don't know if in the 50's and 60's New Wave's drivers would have hated this type of film - that's ... so ... unrealistic. And it seems he has little to do with so many of his previous films. It may not be a bad thing - just a very surprising thing. <br /> <br /> I also found a little surprising how many reviews this movie gave - especially if there are so many better French musicals out there. The songs in this movie were simply not very interesting and all the characters seemed so strange and stereotypical. When I had to see another wealthy person who was worried about how hard it was to be rich or to get a good sale price for designer equipment, I started hitting. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that like American musicals, not every French musician is gold. This movie is not yet another "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" ("CHERBOURG UMBRELLAS" or "Huit Femmes"), and despite Audrey Tautou's presence, I see no reason to suggest it other than boring strange.
