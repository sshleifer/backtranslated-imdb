This film was different because it did not show the typical gay stereotypes I used to see. But it does not change the fact that it has no story at all. I'm sure there are many gay men who are just happy to see themselves on the screen because black gay characters are rarely visible and these characters are usually not fully developed. But how hard would a writer actually write the story at the beginning, middle and end. Or how the story that was focused. There really is no point in this film, and although it is a low budget movie, it is still not the reason for hope or lack of plot.
