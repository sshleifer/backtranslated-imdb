One of the more nasty movies I've ever seen. I wanted to vomit after watching it. I saw this movie in my American history class and aimed to see a farmer in the west in the late 1800s. What we saw were shooting pigs and then killing, giving birth, branding. At the end of the day, the birth of a calf was born, and let me tell you that the birth was not too bad, but the numerous liquids that came out of the bathroom drove most of their class to the bathroom. The story itself was OK. The story presupposes the widow and her daughter and they move west to be the cowboy of this cowboy. They live a life of hardship and this is an interesting pretty accurate view of the West in the late 1800s. But if you have a choice, you won't see this movie.
