I'm surprised that reviewers @ IMDb gave this television a high rating. It's a harmless, sweet, simple clich√© movie that had two big names from the past (both did a decent job), but this movie shows a little budget work we see every day of the week. less cable TV. I like both good romance and someone else, but when my wife and I watched it - and before we saw the rating, we said, "There are people who appreciate this movie too much because there's nothing to challenge their brain, faith, comfort level or their cultural preferences.It is possible to make such a good movie (and away from it is an example), but it was an amateur-hour. Indeed, the second long line of delightfully inadequate holiday films.
