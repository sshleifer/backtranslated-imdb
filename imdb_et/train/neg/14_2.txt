There are times when it comes to finishing the movie, just to get paid for the time you spend. It was one of those times. I almost gave up on just 15 minutes ... and I wish I had ... <br /> <br /> The pace that man goes from straightforward, controlled life to full spinelessness and irresponsibility can never be so fast. <br /> <br /> Ending the graduation to the predictable Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), which allows privilege and culture to be women, violence and mind-altering agents. Of course, the part of the woman is understandable by following the talents of a beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley). However, it is impossible to understand the penny, violence and devotion to a person whom he has just met with the drug pound. <br /> <br /> Frankly, apart from being able to look at Kenya, Nathalie Kelley and Monica, this film has no redeeming qualities. Save your money, save time ... do something else ...
