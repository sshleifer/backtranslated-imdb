This film is probably made for someone who has some good ideas, but who never made a movie before and did not think the script should be changed or even funny. When I saw this movie, I saw it for John Candy and assumed it was fun. Instead, there was a silly plot of thought and so many apartments, uncomfortable moments. And on top, Candy gave some of the most sharp lines I've heard so far. So, despite the idea of ​​a potentially funny story and story, you remember the amateur and raw film that is probably too stupid for the average adult, although teenagers will probably find some laughs. It's really a shame - it could have been so much better. I mean, Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy should be wonderful.
