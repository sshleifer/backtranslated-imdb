Elizabeth Taylor could never do anything at all, and she was just that tedious, untalented herself in this movie. It was before he got so fat but still looked very short and a little. Rock Hudson was OK, like Bick Benedict, but obviously it would be better for the actor to be more than William Holden. Indeed, James Dean proved that he knew how to knock the film. The whole movie is incredibly slow and goes on for too long. The participants were too young and light-weighted, and none of them could be convinced by the bad make-up. Hudson looked ridiculous as it was padded and Dean and Carroll Baker were probably the same old. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
