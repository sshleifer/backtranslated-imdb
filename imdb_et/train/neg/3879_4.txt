Rebar is an astronaut who goes to the world's first space mission to Saturn, but of course this horror film is ugly and returns to the only survivor on earth. With some odd situations that cause him to slowly melt and lose his mind when he regularly consumes human flesh, he kills what is probably the only nurse in the hospital and flees to a neighboring country to hide more victims. <br /> <br /> I liked the assumption and the monster and gorefire are really good, but space scenes are just pasted out of NASA footage and the hospital looks curiously like a warehouse. The very weak script, the small character development and the general bad behavior keep this resurrection nothing more than a mediocre slip, the novelty of which is the renewal of a living candle and has more or less only an effect of interest. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 fans of the strictest harsh monster movies.
