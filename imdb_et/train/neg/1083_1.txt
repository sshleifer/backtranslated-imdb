This film is like a real life, which means that it does not happen much in 2 hours, and often there is no visible majority of the game plan or plot (their invisibility is due to "experimental" illumination as by many reviewers). <br /> <br /> Great cage. It is not surprising that this Altman Mr. - he is a very changing performer (yes, we all loved "Gosford Park" but "Pret A Porter" anyone? Kansas City? Dr. T. and Women? Aaargh) but the fact that the raw material is the story of John Grisham, and the excellent casting you perceive from the accumulation of your demanding sleep, makes this a really bad movie masterpiece. And no, it's not "so bad it's good". <br /> <br /> It's just bad.
