Where to start ... If this movie had been a dark comedy, I'd say it was FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me and anyone else who has the time and the bits to save (remembering that it was the price I paid, I got it from Wal-Mart), this movie was meant to be a thriller. The only THRILL I got was to look at Kirkland's nervous transfer from Anne Wilkes to Misery sans snow forest. If you want to laugh, rainy Friday night with friends, I recommend this movie very much. But if you want to look at something at least halfway, don't worry. <br /> <br /> I enjoy one dirty movie, the worse it is in most cases. But Wow ... I was thinking WOW! The only person in the whole movie that didn't smell it was Vincent Berry's little boy. The only reason I even give 3 letters is that it gave me something to do.
