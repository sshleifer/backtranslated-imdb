Think of this movie as a program of action on Saturday morning many years ago. Even small cups find it hard because it runs like molasses! I can't fully understand how god is terrible to do something too typical and uninteresting, especially in the costume department! Too many warrior wizards have been used many times there by the same old drawing, but it is mighty little given his call to small couriers. And who in the world would have given the first topless mermaid? I thought it was a "family" movie! MST3K, here's another fine pearl for your 1999 TV season!
