This film shows the distortion of live animals by a clip that has been hacked by a mechanic and ripped on its skin. I know these terrible things are happening in the world, but I'm watching movies based on the fact that what Im looks like is not actually on the screen. These live animal clips are not meant for movies, they are meant to show people who belong to certain organizations to help the terrible things people are trying to do with other kinds of things. <br /> <br /> It should be banned and destroyed. I've also contacted Netflix and other resources to collaborate on removing this movie from the market !! <br /> <br /> This movie should be removed from the public. The filmmaker needs psychological help.
