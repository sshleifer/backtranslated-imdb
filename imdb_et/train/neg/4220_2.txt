A brief overview, but ... <br /> <br /> Avoid 90 minutes of in-depth waste at all costs. At the end of the movie, I was not wiser in what really happened. It's full of cameos (Stephen Fry (3mins), Jack Dee (30 seconds), Philadelphia girls, and some vaguely recognizable people, but it's just not worth it. Is the story just lost in editing, which I am not now but jeez .. <br /> <br /> Put on a DVD or go to bed and relax! <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (chasing bags and Morris Minor cars) <br /> <br />
