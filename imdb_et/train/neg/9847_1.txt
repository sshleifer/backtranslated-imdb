Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha, ha), a pirate baker who takes over as captain. Although he is witnessing the treachery of the treasure, he is losing his memory and his treasure card is empty. So Dick is forced to find someone who can see ghosts and communicate with them (do you put that ad?) And contribute to the treasure. It makes no sense how anyone could have banked this pointless movie. Former Goon Spike Milligan replaced Medaki as a director and gave Medaki a talent for The Ruling Class, probably guessing what a terrible, illuminated scene was at the director's board at Milligan. Peter Boyle will briefly appear in the first 10 minutes of the film as the captain of the pirates killed. He's probably quite grateful that Young Frankenstein was released the same year when he was filmed and preserved so he could continue. Franciosa looks like a nice force behind Scratcher, but both the seller and the seller are quite desperate, even sellers' makeup and hair are looking quite awful. They had to know that the film was bombarded, even when they filmed it. With such lines, I understand any possible anxiety: <br /> <br /> PIERRE: (will be hung up soon) You pay for it. <br /> <br /> SCRATCHER: No, I won t. I'll do it for free. <br /> <br /> And this is one of HEA's jokes. It's amazing to me that a large part of Sellers' fertile material is still arched, but it was made available in VHS more than 15 years ago! How would somebody step on the record and release a well-received British TV show "A Call Called Fred" who plays sellers, Milligan and directed by big Richard Lester?
