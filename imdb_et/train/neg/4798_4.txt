* Includes some spoilers * This film is a horror of the 80s throughout its horror. It takes too long, never permanent, to take the plot off the ground, and then just captures the movie for about 40 minutes. Zombie fans have a few gem moments but not quite enough zombies to create a real sense of terror. <br /> <br /> Zombies also take their look. First of all, all the movies and prison gangs. The hero of the movie is a former Vietnamese vet who gets into the mobile. The main mob boss puts him up and he goes to prison. In this prison, they have tried prisoners to find a way to treat them for killing tendencies and criminal behavior. But there are other plans for the badie psychotic head scientist / military. He wants to use a bit of a different version of serum to make .... da da da .... super soldiers! After some infected prisoners, some guards are killed and most prisoners are infected with communion, the military / crazy scholar goes "hey this may be a problem" and calls for a genius scientist who turned to the investigative journalist hot babe ultra - an independent character of the woman who naturally invented the original serum. He goes to jail to see what's going on, the military is calling some SWAT crew out of their secure position outside the prison, and the hero sounds a few prisoners who are in the heart of gold when the rebellion breaks out. The hero and the scientist / journalist lady's team found the cure, the caregiver's children escaped, and they worked on some irreducible prisoners, both infected and not. Meanwhile, the mob boss guy has entered the prison to save the imprisoned brother. The army is ready to get there and find a way out of every place inside. <br /> <br /> There are many gory scenes where people are killed by pushing or capturing prison. There's also a scary forging scene and an electric shock scene that includes the same infected rasta in jail. However, the most annoying scene at the beginning of the film is when a serious corrupt guard robbes the prisoner. <br /> <br /> The main emphasis of this movie is one end of the scene. The hero, wife and children are trying their way to the only escape route. Their path leads them to the long front, one side has a wall and the other side bars. Hundreds of bloody zombie hands reach out, stretching their hair and face as they pass. There are also some good scenes from the classic "few zombies from fresh corpses" and "many zombies hanging with one guy to crush". <br /> <br /> In general, it is worth looking at the zombie genre because it has so many zombie clich√©s to mention; it is practically a handbook on what you should not do when making a zombie movie. But if you are new to zombie tear and you want real intimidation, then you should look elsewhere.
