I can't believe I wasted five hours of my life on this rubbish. The last five days of this author's offer was very enjoyable and I was really expecting it. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Suranne Jones was the main culprit, because she mumbled or grabbed her lines, but most of the other pains followed her example. Notable exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, old staggers whose dictation was exemplary. Do the producers listen to the production before they are going to make sure the dialogue is audible? As a result, I think I lost what is happening, and since the original plot line seemed to be a metamorphosis to standards between them and us Muslims and others, I soon lost interest. The end was complete anti-climax. Completed.
