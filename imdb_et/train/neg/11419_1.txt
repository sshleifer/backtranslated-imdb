I think I've seen such a thing before: college graduates don't realize they have this pretty fucking good, all the time, complaining that their lives are sucking. <br /> <br /> This movie is very big and bites of reality from what I can do about it: they have virtually the same plot. <br /> <br /> When something good came from this snake festival, it was music. It was so. <br /> <br /> I'm worried that I have no impression ... but then I didn't expect anything less. This film was directed by the same person who led Batman and Robin; another movie that should only be seen with the eyes. <br /> <br /> Now this is the decision: it's 10.
