It was amongst the STUPIDEST and PREACHIEST films from the 1980s on anti-dolls. <br /> <br /> The idea that a child and a basketball star could "change the world" is far removed, considering how many "Child Peace Lines" and "celebrity protests" existed and exist. <br /> <br /> But the idea that the Soviet Union agrees with nuclear disarmament TOTAL, because some children became aware of the "silent protest" in the West is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> What was the end of the Cold War? American harsh, I dare to say "Reaganesque" attitude and internal mistakes of socialism. It was not a march of peace, "killing", or movies like "Amazing Grace & Chuck", "Miracle Mile" or "Testament".
