Anyone who could find the redemption value of this value should examine their head. We have a submissive, heroin-dependent, part-time whore woman with laceration of her entire body, the consequences of repeated beating of a harassing son. Now she wakes up on the floor of the entire kitchen, so the widespread release resembles Helen Keller putting her hands in the running water. We have a husband who starts patronizing a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter (she is upset with her because she came too fast) and ends up murdering her female colleague, having sex with her body and then grinding. We have a child whom his classmates are tempted and who come home and their mother wins. It's all circular. Deep, right? The only decent moment in this terrible heap is when his father murders his son's tormentors. It's a good thing that this turkey was shot on the video, otherwise it would be an expensive movie waste. If the man who thinks the artists should be interested in this slop is really serious, most people don't know that artists are crazy. We saw this bad movie, then we put "Zero woman, accused". Oh my God, it was a tossup for which one was worse. What's happening in Japan these days? Sick, sick, sick.
