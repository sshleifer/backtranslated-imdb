This beautifully filmed and scripted episode was shot for two reasons. 1) Maybe the moral of the 1950s was spoken, but no one left alone for years on an asteroid reacts with such a hysterical negativity to an android woman. 2) It wasn't an android at all, but a woman, beautiful Jean Marsh. <br /> <br /> The popularity of the sex industry in the coming decades could have regained its beginning if they did it properly. In fact, the modernization of sex bots in news is when I speak. <br /> <br /> When this episode was made, the robots were not new movies or televisions, so they could at least act like one. His flesh would then have added a horrible element. Instead, it becomes a nice little love story for a two-star star. <br /> <br /> The Twilight Zone always drew imagination and faith. Usually no one cared. But this episode seemed to be stuck with the Calvinist morals, which gave up what would have come with the machine, or completely careless.
