Veteran Director and Producer Allan Dwan, whose large number of films includes both completely unforgettable and repeated shows (such as John Wayne's "Sands of Iwo Jima"), tried his hand with great music "I dream of Jeanie". Using the casting of the singers with a little past experience, and, as it turned out, practically no future, he created a fictional and small part of the offensive story of the great American singer Stephen Foster. <br /> <br /> Bill Shirley is a young lovestruck Foster whose friendliness with slaves involves giving money to the engagement ring to pay for the injured little black boy's hospital allowance. His goal is Inez McDowell (Muriel Lawrence), whose irritating younger sister Jeanie (Eileen Christy) is slowly realizing that she is in love with an almost strange song-sword. Foster is in love with Inez, who is confused by composer number 1 at dinner Parade Tune, "O Susannah." Enter Minstrel Edwin P.Christy (Ray Middleton) to help launch Foster's career earnings process. <br /> <br /> It's a big production of early fifties musical-film standards. The sets are in this Hollywood special way that depicted the fakes with all the decorations. The singers are not half bad and the songs of Foster are almost impossible to destroy. <br /> <br /> But it's also the southern word of southern milk. The biggest number is the black face for everyone on stage, the historical anomaly and the modern futile racism. If these black images were almost in reality, the condemned judges were rightly condemned to intervene so gladly in the institution. <br /> <br /> "I dream of Jeanie", apparently sank into the studio yard, whispering to death. Now they have just revived by Alpha Video for just $ 4.99, a periodical piece with charming songs and repulsive sentimentation about the great crimes of America, the victims of slavery. <br /> <br /> This was what Hollywood was two years before Brown v. Education Department. Must have warmed the hearts of some cinematographers who carried their bed linen to the theater.
