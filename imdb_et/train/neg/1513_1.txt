Flock is not really a movie. This is a wannabe movie with wannabe actors. Except for Richard Gere, he gave excellent performance, but if only one actor gives his character and the rest is just acting ... the result is pathetic, just like this movie. You see, the idea of ​​acting is to hide that you act. What the hell did Claire Dains do in that ?! He is the most inappropriate actor of this character. 99.9% of the movie he looked eminent, everything !! The only thing he did was ask stupid questions like "do you really think so?" And they made foolish faces. I was embarrassed by his behavior, seriously and I liked it ... He's a romantic type of movie, I don't know who chose him between all the actors there ... LOL and saw Avril Lavigne?! it really made me laugh .. Anyway .. If you want to get thrown out, this movie will work for you! I wish I could vote -5 ..
