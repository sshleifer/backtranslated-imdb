Despite the positive reviews and screenings made for international festivals, this film is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story is very similar to other movies, where the teenage girl of the immigrant family has to overcome many common personalities with her age problems, as well as fighting the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. He does this by choosing a sport and a local boy who, for some reason, falls in love with him, faces his problems and wins. <br /> <br /> In Girlfight, this boxing is, bend it like Beckham, it's football, and now it's Kung Fu. <br /> <br /> But the fighter is a much lower product than the two, it was just embarrassing to watch it. Semra Turan, the "actor", who plays the role of teenage girls, can do a lot of things, but one thing she can't do is act. His presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy, dramatic situations in which he tries to show some emotions, is terrible, his body and face are an amateur actor that the director is poorly instructing. The rest of the majority is a little better, but they just can't save this clich√© movie with stereotypical characters and low prints. In addition to some relatively good moments, this film has nothing new or interesting. <br /> <br /> Even kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch it, it's just so boring. Slow motion was really unnecessary, choreography was basic and there was no inspiration, and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in any kung fu positions, not really fighting. Not to mention how ridiculous it seems when a small and skinny girl is fighting big boys and boys and hitting them off the legs. <br /> <br /> The only reason why this movie has been seen is that it is European. This movie is very easy to publish - the first martial arts movie from Denmark, but don't be fooled, it's not. It's just a drama for teenage girls and its problems, which by the way aren't really convincing. <br /> <br /> A bad movie with embarrassing traits, behavior, and story.
