It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Branaugh seemed to work so hard to recall his accent that he was unable to fill his lines. The plot was certainly not worthy of John Grisham's name. No wonder it was never published as a book or in theaters. I didn't even look at the whole thing. I decided I didn't care about who did it, I realized that there was no "bad" to care about!
