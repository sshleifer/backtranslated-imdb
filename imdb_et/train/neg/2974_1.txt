I'm a nice boy and I like to think like a genre-tolerant. And I think I think I'm trying to watch the movie in the context of the genre he lives in. If anything else, it saves me the feeling that I should say really nasty things about people or movies I don't like to do. <br /> <br /> This single plot was obviously obvious, the production values ​​were very low, and the kits, um, were simplified. Actress rose from time to time to play "high school". My feeling was that it was filmed on the day - please tell me it was. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that sex, although it was quite abundant, was quite common, at least obstructed by my copy. "over the sound", which was contrary to action (climatic moans and shrieks lying on the bra ???). Certainly there was no "edge" at all - nothing to distinguish nor an interesting and surprisingly fast cut. <br /> <br /> My voice is then "1" with the following summary: it would have been better if the club stuffing material was expanded and the rest of the film condensed.
