This film is the biggest steaming pile you know, having grown and grown in Wichita Kansas, I know 90% of the film was Bogus. There was nothing wrong with the names of some of the victims. The film looks like it was made with the father's handy button, he had the footage that, in my opinion, came from another movie with the slaughterhouse. I usually enjoy watching bad movies, but doing bad things, poorly prepared or non-existent sets and a very boring and short end. It was a struggle to finish it. I recommend that you don't waste your money on this movie or you won't lose. Crunch
