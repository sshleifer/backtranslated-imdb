That's how it begins in a beautiful country house. You have a group of people who are asked to come to this house and (not surprisingly) that caregivers always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason. Anyway, people laugh, joke, etc. This dr tells them that this woman and some kids are a terrible story. They are afraid they will feel things. Oh no, the girl's spirit. Some more say that this huge ghost comes, etc. etc. This girl discovers that this ghost killed little kids and she must release her soul, yes, blah blah. He does, but, no, he dies as he does. And going to heaven when this evil ghost goes to hell. Two people will survive and escape from the house. The script is terrible because the boy is crushed in his head and Elanor (the one who dies children) says "oh no". The action is wood, the effects are crap, and the set is a couple outdoors, used over and over again. Basically, if you want to laugh at poorly made movies, look at it, but if your scary search will definitely give this film a response. I was very disappointed when I looked at it. Very big shoot. My sister (who gets very lightly holy) got bored of this movie, it's terrible.
