This movie was hard to see and be absolutely fair and objective, because I'm a big fan of the 1944 movie. This, to me and many others, is one of the greatest filmmakers ever made. Understanding this is just a film made for shortened television and most people had thrown it off, I didn't expect much, but you can't do it when you compare it to '44 movie. The scene after the scene found that I compared what I was watching and I remember how he played with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson and others. Now I saw those famous actors who played their famous roles, replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. <br /> <br /> When all this was over, I found that it wasn't as bad as I had expected, but it didn't fit the 1944 original. The two main areas where this TV movie was not so good (1) the lack of two electricity and (2) just 90 minutes, rushed hardly to developing a plot between characters and chemistry. Crenna and Eggar were flat and just did not respond to MacMurray and Stanwyck as "Walter Neff" and "Phyllis Dietrichson". <br /> <br /> When done again, it was another character, such as "Barton Keyes" and "Edward Norton." Cobb was terrible as Keyes and Robert Webber as head of the insurance company. It was also somewhat interesting to see a change in the schedule, so that houses, cars, telephones, dictation equipment, etc. were all in the beginning instead of the mid-1970s. Otherwise, the story was very similar, just hurried. <br /> <br /> But one view was enough and I'm happy to return to my original version of the rest of my classical story and movie views.
