After reading a number of good comments and hearing something about it, I decided to rent a Come Undone. I must say that I was quite disappointed. The story was hard to follow, because the film is set for a setback between the present and the recent past, which is very poorly met. The characters, despite the best efforts of the participants, are smooth and uninteresting. Sex is and nudity is clearer than necessary. I've never seen a movie where they seemed so unnecessary on the plot. The end is very anti-climatic and leaves many unanswered questions on a story that was not well started. I think it is a waste of time.
