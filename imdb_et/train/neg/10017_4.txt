The "Dragstrip Hollow Ghost" seems to be taking place in a free world that has long passed, where the biggest sin a child could commit would be a law violation and a traffic ticket. It opens up with a young female autophanic who gets a business from her competitor, pushing her to drive. It's for dragging it - this B-flick is mostly tied to the rock 'n role, man! The people of American International obviously loved decent, square teenagers who liked the party and still didn't know the adult chaperone. There are some amusing double packers and fruit swaps (Necking Kid: "We thought we'd come in the fresh air" ... Dad: "Where did you think you'd find this throat?") But the ghost arrives a little late. Shortly after 65 minutes, cheat the film on the climate car, which actually happens on the screen and on the upcoming exposure of "Scooby Doo", which makes no sense. However, nostalgia buffs, some pointless fun. ** from ****
