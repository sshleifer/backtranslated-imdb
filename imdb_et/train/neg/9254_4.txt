Thick, wow! The genius that brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the challenge of changing the vibrant color of French music of the 1930s. The old, decorated inter-headlines call was a nice touch. The camera aperture (like the old hand carts) then opens to a black and white disc. The camera supports (or rather up) the unexpectedly beautiful and elegant color for the tea party. It's all within the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the music starts. A rather banal and forgotten surprise with a convincing cream of 3 girls who dragged some nonsense that has no relevance to the film (and yes, I speak French so I can't blame it on the subtitles). These characters throw the door out and are replaced by more people who break even more into the forgotten song. Then they leave and finally Audrey Tautou will appear and we will hear our first noticeable dialogue in 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Resnais was going to start with cacophony with timing and musical waste. But the effect on the viewer is to make you want to skittle the screen and hurry. I supported. <br /> <br /> It didn't get much better. I'll tell you why. No characters are completely known. We don't even see our faces for half a time (because Resnais seems too clever to show off the expensive landscape to take care of the people in front of the camera). People flee on stage and drag like lamps and we cannot focus on any particular person or plot. It would be like you would have taken every Brady Bunch episode and made the effort with this 2-hour movie. With bad songs. <br /> <br /> The only thing that watched me (1 hour) was that I watched the camera technique, the lighting and the landscape that all were, I admit, great. But is it enough to keep your attention for 2 hours? Not me. Maybe I'll try to look at the end tomorrow. Aw, I am joking. I have more important things. I'm sure you're doing. Skip it.
