The moment when you started, I knew we were in trouble! The premise is at best ridiculous. The story was even worse than possible. <br /> <br /> The actor was rigid and the actors gave a thought. You expect more from Slater, Reid and Dorff. The lines were delivered from the robot. And I'm sorry, I like Reid, but he was very unbelievable as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff chose the tough movies to try their return. <br /> <br /> Continuity throughout the movie. The creatures were not bad, but they were not good either. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, I want ninety minutes of my life back. They can save money but give me time! What waste.
