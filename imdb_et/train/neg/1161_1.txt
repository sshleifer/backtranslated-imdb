As a participant, I was a member of the band in all the basketball games, I would like to let the world know after the movie that we couldn't see it because it was forbidden in Oregon. This was because the producers and the director violated the agreement with the University of Oregon where it was made. It seems that the O-sign of O was shown. At the time of shooting, we were allowed to eat several meals at the meal and production staff. Mr Nicholson was quite memorable to be one of the worst men I ever met. Pretty time for a young 20-year-old. Certainly not what university life really was in the late 1960s and early 70s, regardless of what Hollywood thinks. Oregon Trombone Player
