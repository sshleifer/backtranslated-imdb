Scary .. yes scary! The jam-packed jam (between fatty people and lean) is on the Nudist Beach of Maslin Beach SA. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie two years ago - it's safe to say it's a strange topic discussion the next day at school. This movie was terrible! Hardly a romantic comedy - just a nudity showcase! This movie hit one of the youngest characters with its lowest point, looking at the girls' legs. <br /> <br /> Girl: You can't find God there! Guy: Nah, But I think I found the sky. <br /> <br /> Observe if you do not want to listen to amateur actors to discuss topics like fading, adultery, and genital mutilation. AVOID!
