Excellent cast. Great operation. An unpredictable story for the first half <br /> <br /> an hour or so. I really wanted to know what would happen if each of these annulling characters happened, and how their <br /> <br /> seemingly different lives intertwined. But when <br /> <br /> the writers started to join the glue players, they mistakenly used the super glue and brought the film to a standstill. <br /> <br /> Over the last two hours. I thought it would improve, but it only worsened <br /> <br />. Do not believe in comments. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Think about it - Tom Cruise was ugly - why? Amazing <br /> <br /> The bunker that carries braces - why? I know it was tied to a plot, but without them, at least one memorable cast member would remember.
