Director F.W. Murnau stayed wisely with the silent footage he felt so well to cover the story of local island life in the South Sea. The documentary works very well in the first half of the film. The landscapes are beautiful and the everyday life of the islands is interesting to watch. However, the film loses momentum when it starts to focus more on the narrative story of two dead lovers. The story is never so interesting, even though Murnau has done it well. He won the Academy Award for Best Contest, although the prize should have been the best landscapes. You don't really get a credit for DP to shoot in such a beautiful place.
