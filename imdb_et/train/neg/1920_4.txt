I'm not saying Twisters Night was terrible, but it wasn't much. Medium absolute best. However, it seems to me that each time one film type is released, the other must be about the same time. (Think of Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante's Peak.) Twisters' night is really just Twister, except for the worse and the daily special effects. They weren't big, it was a movie itself, management, special effects, the whole storyline was just strange to interpret. Many of the tornadoes hit the city and basically the film is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage. <br /> <br /> I really don't know why the duplicates of the disaster movies seem to have been released, but it would have been better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.
