Although it is not as bad as its game-film adaptations, this eater is not much better. <br /> <br /> Boll seems to have a pathological inability to accept that he does not make good films. One of those days runs out of money and stops making the world with bombs. <br /> <br /> The actor was sub-par, the dialogue seemed to read TelePrompTers and Boll's special tiny touches. <br /> <br /> Like all Uwe Boll movies, it shouldn't be there. <br /> <br /> Simple and simple. <br /> <br /> Just like Uwe Boll himself shouldn't exist. > _>
