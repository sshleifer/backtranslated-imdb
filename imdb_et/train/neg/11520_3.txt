I didn't enjoy this movie at all. One, I found it just crude and vulgar, without reason. I also felt that it was misogynous (against women), but the film doesn't really look like anything, and I didn't find any characters that would be pleasant. Really, there doesn't seem to be any point on that. If I miss something, but for me, this film is a waste of time if I could have done something more productive and enjoyable. Like my face as a pin-pad. James is collecting this thing, as well as C. Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones and James Cromwell.all are wasted here and I'm sure it was a lower point in all my quarries. is also in the movie, and it's nice to see her in a non-ditsy role. t rises above mediocre script. For me, Tank 3/10
