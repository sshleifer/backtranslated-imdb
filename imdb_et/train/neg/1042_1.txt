First, write the script to the tray. Who needs more? After all, we are not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Then become amateur actors. This is a good festival leap. After all, who needs people who have spent years crafts? Then hire an operator who doesn't know how to enlighten. You see, when it's well lit, it doesn't see "real" and people in the festival don't like it. Who needs professional photography? Then hire a ten-year-old who has never been a camera operator. It gives his film, which is an entirely amusing touch, that festival leaders are mistaken for "reality" and ensure that even though you empty places from people, critics and small audiences over intellectuality, "genius" screams because they don't believe it was just an adult hour. <br /> <br /> When you have done this, buy your ticket for Bad Film Festival or Sundance. <br /> <br /> What a sad waste.
