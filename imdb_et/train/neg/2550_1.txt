This was the "American Pie" tradition of a label line that deceives me about renting this movie. What I got was a Jackass-style junk, the biggest difference compared to that of Jackass, is Kane. <br /> <br /> This movie made me regret that I rewarded other films from 1 out of 10 because now I can't go down there. It makes pretty bad films for cinematographic games. <br /> <br /> I pulled it out after 45 minutes and that's something I rarely do. But it was just plain boring, stupid, uninteresting and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> You can't believe some people will pay for it in 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? Get you on your head if you were just a kid? Or was it the first movie you ever saw, so you have nothing to compare? Are you still a virgin and are you all you ever think? Something must be at least wrong. <br /> <br /> My advice: stay away from it. Even if your mood is simple for a movie that doesn't need thinking, choose something else or you will definitely regret it.
