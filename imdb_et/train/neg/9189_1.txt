This movie has got many bad magazines from people who don't understand what it was supposed to be. It should be understood that this film was never to be taken seriously. It's a camp, just like the "Army of Darkness". AoD was silly but funny and bad. "The House of Death" is not "good bad." <br /> <br /> Featuring good qualities, the most important feature is believable fantasy. You have to believe what's going on in the movie to see humor when the situation goes unbelievably wrong. Without borders, the film becomes absurd.

For example, horror films are too often trapped in the trap where the main characters find love between the lord and the destruction. I don't know about you, but when I'm pursuing zombies, I want to make a hot chick. Believe it? No? Then it probably won't believe when the characters start to suck one another in this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to the obvious problems that interrupt this movie like many other horror movies, Uwe Boll scenes from the Zombies video game are randomly shot every time a character is shooting a zombie. Not only does it have a clear logic for this artistic choice, but it pulls one of the incredible pieces of land aside. In addition, there are frequent and numerous examples of bad behavior, and apparently the director's efforts to steer the participants' reactions to events ... without leaving the film with redemption features. Avoid ...
