It's not just a plot that makes this movie instantly turned off for a boring audience. This is a terrible direction, with a scary script and left and right errors that make it too agonizing. I'm sorry, but I don't see the fun. Just excitement to point out many bugs and fools. Well, I was wondering how managers think about their production company when they first introduce their film. Probably as stupid as the sheriff who tipped a truck full of antifreeze that was full of bloody wounds. Sorry! Did I forget to mention this sheriff not only as a poor actor, but also to break the shoulder with antifreeze that breaks the exposed meat? I think he forgot when he won a less exciting win for a snowman.
