This movie has o.k. David Muiri as dr. The start and end credits show with most participants and "special effects", which is a low budget movie. There's nothing in this movie that you didn't find from other crazy scientists, horror / comedy or low budget movies. No nude scene buffer or bad film student is special. This movie is just here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are also not excited. If you are curious when I was and can actually find it, you will understand the truth of one line of summary.
