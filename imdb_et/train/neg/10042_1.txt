Such a long-awaited movie .. But it's disappointed with me and my friends who had gone to see the movie the first day. It seemed like trailers, but it turned out to be a comedy. bad comedy). But one thing that deserves recognition is the action of these professional actors, they have done their part of the film very well. Good action, but I don't think it can save the movie. India is fascinated. Kerala, Rajasthan (Ladakh?) They were all saturated with color. However, as the inner beauty of these places became, I made me look exactly where these places were and when I could go there ;-) <br /> <br /> The sequences were shot very foolishly, no one could make the stunts out of their heads and they were very well used akki (akshay kumar) but could have done much better. <br /> <br /> Animation is the worst of the latest movies. In the 90s films had better animation scenes, which I think (the original scene where the car falls off) flying should be a better word for the "lake lake". <br /> <br /> The movie's name is mentioned almost every 20-30 minutes to make sure the audience doesn't forget the name of the movie.
