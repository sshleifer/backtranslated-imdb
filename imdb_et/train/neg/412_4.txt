In the field of science fiction, two specific issues that were initially studied in the literature of the cinematographic era were questioned and reviewed by filmmakers and writers on a regular basis since then. The first theme, the chronicle, has been a fervent charm for the film fans and the written word, the last one on the screen is H.G. Wells' classic "The Time Machine". Another theme that can keep the audience excited is the invisibility that creates the imagination with its seemingly endless and abundant possibilities. And this theme has again become the basis for another HG Wells classic film "Invisible Man", the realization of which is "Hollow Man", directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Caine (Bacon) and his colleagues have been experimenting with the US government for some time, exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility they have finally achieved with the many primates they have tested on their method. In fact, they have come to the point of achieving invisibility; their only problem now is the return of the subject to the state of the original visual state. The problem is, however, that Caine has solved the lab after careful effort and too many hours - or she thinks. And if the application of his theory to a living object is successful, he decides to submit the results to the board, thereby trying to maintain the funding needed to continue the project. <br /> <br /> At the last minute, Caine, however, demonstrates that she is controlling the project before they can go to the next level - testing a human subject. And he will take up this issue by securing his research team by telling them that the board has approved it. But something goes wrong, and Caine traps her invisibility; and since he and his team are struggling to find a significant dilemma before it is too late, it will begin to pay Cain's mind. And suddenly, his fear of losing funding and control becomes unchanged because he finds himself in direct danger of losing much more. Now there is a very real chance that he can lose everything - himself. <br /> <br /> Verhoeven has shaped what is originally an exciting, even thoughtful film; it creates a good pace and uses the F / X at its disposal to make a big difference, even though it tends to allow astonishing visual signs to develop. Anyone who knows an invisible man, or actually anyone who can logically track the progress of the story, knows early on that Caine is not meant for a happier time. Nonetheless, Verhoeven has a narrative style that will definitely keep the audience alive. But he seems to be bent towards the climax, and along the way he renounces all the nuances that have made his film a success so far by choosing to enter the final queue, other than the mad blood and brain fest, giving his audience and everything that he has worked in the movie before. Instead of looking intelligently for Caine's suffering and using some ingenuity and imagination to make the film inevitable, Verhoeven takes a low path, and although it can succeed on a purely visceral level, some idea of ​​what the story could become dissolves like so much wind, as well as something that would have made it a memorable film. And this is a shame, because Verhoeven has a higher level than that offered in this genre, and he lets him unnecessarily sink into a much lower one. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon does a good job of creating what is plausible if it is only on the surface that seems to probably serve Verhoeven's goals perfectly. There is little depth in depicting Bacon, but it is more related to his director's agenda than his own ability to act. Verhoeven simply does not allow Bacon some time to develop Caine; the character is mainly a ship around which Verhoeven can build and work on his story. The film would have been better, but Verhoeven and Bacon would have worked more closely together to develop a link between Caine and the audience, which would have encouraged the audience to feel emotionally involved, something that would have led them a bit, rather than leaving them in the gate as it was , just F / X loaded with extravagant observers. <br /> <br /> Elisabeth Shue shares her well with Linda McKay, Caine's bad partner. a fatal experiment, but it is basically a thankless part that offers little challenge, especially for the Shue caliber. The same can be said about Kim Dickens (so great in the 2001 film "Things behind the Sun"). His character, Sarah Kennedy, does little more than action and F / X. Both actors are capable of doing so much more and deserving a better job than working here. <br /> <br /> Supported by Josh Brolin (Matthew), Greg Grunberg (Carter), Joey Slotnick (Frank), Mary Randle (Janice) and William Devane (Dr. Kramer). Hollow Man is an entertaining and even successful at some point at a certain (low) level, one of those films that leaves you wondering what might have been. Like the annual fireworks, it gives you some of the current thrills, but after a while it starts to blend with everyone else you've seen without anything special to separate it. And it's too bad, because there could have been so much thanks to the talents and abilities involved. I appreciate it 4/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
