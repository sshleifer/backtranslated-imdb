I usually speak a little about the plot in the first part of my review, but there is not really much to talk about in this film. Just mish-mash other FAR's better sword and witchcraft epics. The lack of unity runs rampant, as is banality. Even the main wool who refuses to wear clothes as loincloth is quite bored because she has a lot of young boys on her chest. Lucio Fulci demolished the barrel here and shows it. <br /> <br /> My Class: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Addons: Posters and Styles; Lucio Fulci Bio; and US and International Theater Trailers <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sabrina Siani is a topless collection (some may think tempting, I didn't); The different extras are also topless
