Sometimes one of the foreign films is served. This is their great attraction. They take life and serve it raw. American films rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society. Too many hangings and sick fear of financial failure. The Almighty Dollar determines their choices. Something that calls European leaders. In addition, the viewers of the whole world are hungry for "different" films, especially those that offer delicious bite-sad, suffering humanity. Despite the fear of managers or manufacturers, many viewers want the beauty, the poetry, and the ancient taste of life. This is offered by the film "Father to the Left" to target audiences. The family locked in the belief that family unity came from its tradition of obedience. But when the family patriarch forgets that its members are the flesh and blood of people who are full of fierce, unlimited dreams and dark passions, these two are set against themselves. Selton Mello plays with Andr√©'s son, who tries to control his inner passion with his father's standing philosophy. Raul Cortez plays his Father. Simone Spoladore is Ana, a young woman who is trying to extinguish the forbidden thirst in the family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is the older brother of Pedro. The film offers a lot, but does not say it very much. ***
