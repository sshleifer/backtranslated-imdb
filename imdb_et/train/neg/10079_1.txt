When I was 11, Grease 2 was like a crack. It was a classy, ​​disgraceful, euphoric and powerful addictive experience. My sister and I would look at it, rewind and look again and again until we passed or made too confused and hostile to each other. So, if you are an 11-year-old girl and you watched this movie as "brilliant" or "fun" or "better than the original fat", then your young adolescent hormone is accused and you can be sure it is tireless if you are not a little girl you have no excuse to assume that Grease 2 was nothing but an artless, slipshod embarrassment for anyone involved in its production, distribution and / or consumption. <br /> <br /> For the sake of criticism, I am making a movie with dignity, explaining why it blows? <br /> <br /> 1. Well done music should develop songs or develop characters. In Grease 2, with some disputed exceptions, music is obscene. Most of the songs seem to be associated with sexuality ("Score Tonight", "Reproduction", "Do It For Our Country" and "Prowlin") in a general and general manner, without any specific statement about it. movie characters or themes. In addition, all the music is uncomfortably stupid, and no one casts even the most brutal singing or dancing reminiscences. <br /> <br /> 2. T-birds should be bad and if at least somewhat enjoyable, each of them is a tedious wussy-dufus loser. Ultimately, when Johnny Nogerelli offers a holy T-bird jacket to Michael and initiates his gang, Michael should hit the ground, spit on it and snatch it to nervously chew any part of his body that he touched. But of course he agrees that it is gold, because despite the fact that they are bundled with meath, there is no greater honor than being with T-birds. <br /> <br /> 3. Since Michael is beautiful, intelligent, kind, inventive and above average (despite musical impotence), it is possible that Stephanie will eventually take hold of him when he appears behind the mask. In contrast, Stephanie is a slippery, flabby jaw, bubble butt, fragrant, dirty costume, harsh and rude. So she's not pretty beautiful (I think) she doesn't recognize any pleasant qualities, so there is no right for the audience to have the depth of her attractiveness to Michael. <br /> <br /> I could go ahead, but I did not want to mention my predecessor's greater injustice because there is probably so much crank that seems to be unfair. However, I say this to those who think you want to re-examine this mess after an old time: Grease 2 is an experience similar to reviving your first kiss. Only you are 32 years old and kissing a 13-year-old child with tn-nin with acne and slobby braces. The magic is gone and you feel dirty and disturbed. Trust me.
