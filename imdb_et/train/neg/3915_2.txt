This film is not only badly written and directed but is just terrible. This movie has a beautiful novel. Many changes have been made in the storyline, probably to streamline the schedule. But what results are simply confusing. An actor cannot overcome a possible script that removes their behavioral motives. In addition, English conversion does not work if everyone refers to the Patriarch EsTEban as ESteban. Terrible. Please, please read the beautiful novel in Spanish if possible. DO NOT SEE MOVIES. It will destroy you, which could be a great experience.
