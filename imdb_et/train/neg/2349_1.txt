Big movie about Steve Biko. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Denzel Washington - who is never the most flexible actor - is not able to pass on the great punishment Biko had. Attenborough's large crowd scenes are ridiculous. Soweto's massacre wasn't like that, three decent rows of kids (some doing a trolley!) Happily marched into the soldiers' weapons. Biko's dead movie descends quickly to farce. If there was something to fight for Apartheid, it was a black fight, but we should somehow stick with us to escape the white man and his family. I'm sure Donald Woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that Biko was important when he wasn't. Penelope Wilton's accent is pure Hampshire and he seems completely unaware that he is at all in South Africa. above all. Wood's family dog ​​gets more rows than a black girl. As the family escapes with one woman I saw in this movie - otherwise it was just about a dozen black people in big cinemas - whispered, "It's like a sound of music." He was somewhat meaningful. <br /> <br /> In general, this film, made with good intent, is a somewhat incorrect white liberal about fighting radical black people. Indeed, South Africa needs white liberals with good intentions, as it needs a head.
