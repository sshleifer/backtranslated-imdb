Something must have gone terribly wrong at the right time when the director felt that tone. The film, which was supposed to be a remake of one of the most loved films in the cinema, is unable to provide the film in every aspect. The best artists could not tune in, which simply shows that the film itself was a serious mistake. <br /> <br /> Edit is bad. The direction is nonsense. Acting out of this world (omg)! Characters who should look at scary force to make people laugh at the stupidity of these dialogues and costumes. <br /> <br /> I don't watch the movie even when someone paid me a ticket price or even gave me a free burger.
