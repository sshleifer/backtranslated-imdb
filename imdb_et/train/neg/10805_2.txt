The only reason I made this movie's DVR was that 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq is now playing basketball for us. 2. I've always heard how terrible it was. The film is not disappointed. The best parts were Shaq's equipment. The worst parts were all well. My 12-year-old son and I just watched and couldn't look at the screen when Shaq started to scramble and we thought why Max didn't want Kazzam to fix his front tooth! But all this is terrible that we just couldn't look at it, this story sucking you, like a black hole or flap or a torch, it was hypnotic. But it was worth laughing at and just saying that we actually looked at "Kazzami".
