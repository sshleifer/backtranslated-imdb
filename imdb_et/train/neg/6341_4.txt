East Palace, West Palace reminded me somewhat of Detective, Frank Sinatra as a police officer and William Windom is a boy. I think this is a progressive film for China, but it also confirms myths about feminine femininity: a lot has been done about Chinese myths where men take on feminine roles. The film focuses on a feminine man who wants to despair and hurt desperately. He drives to the park without fear - he hopes the officer will take it to the station. And it actually happens. Then he tells the officer the whole story of his life when he is tortured a little; That's what gay man, and indirectly, gay man challenges police self-esteem as a man. The story of homosexual life (which includes setbacks) is acceptable, but when he begins to describe old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the film becomes unbearable. It will be a fear for China, who only wants to fulfill its traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can't associate.
