I think this "film" is rather pointless to comment on the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment on. It is similar to a rotten egg that has nothing good to show to the world because it is rotten because it is an otherwise endless number of eggs before that have been. But because the comment is obligatory for such a spectacular insignificance ... <br /> <br /> Filth is definitely the right word to describe this movie, which was created in the same way as every other Romanian "film" directed by Lucian Pintilie , who demands to portray the post-communist "Romanian reality" (from 1990 to the present). <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances is it recommended for people outside Romania who lack the quality of managers / actors and others (who recently found an amateur camera, there are no plots), noise, etc. is trendy and even artistic: watch and enjoy this "movie" "(as I know you do this), but do other well-intentioned IMDb members prefer not to write a web-based review because it misleads, irritates, and ultimately wastes your time. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this film (among other things) has some value, one example of education: "How not to make a movie."
