Roy Rogers marks Jesse James and his appearance as a gambling man, Clint Burns. George "Gabby" Hayes is Mr Rogers' former prayer, sheriff Gabby. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are a remarkable team, as two journalists watch stories about the hero of the hero that is unclear. <br /> <br /> Of course, the wrong identity / impersonation plot is developing because Rogers has a "double role". Rogers are charming as usual; but nothing is really higher than usual - any potential to give a memorable Jekyll / Hyde performance is done with poor material. The better couple to watch is pr. Storm and Mrs Paye as St. Louis Journal reporters - these are highlights of the film. The songs are well, albeit poorly synchronized. <br /> <br /> *** Jesse James Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gale Storm
