"Paula, I can be a bitch, but I can never be a meat!" <br /> <br /> A fun line of otherwise pretty tiring skin coloring with pretty honey at Stacey Walker, but that's all. This is a real tease who attracts his friends, associates and even his lesbian roommate in his bedroom, but then gets rid of the job of shouting "rape" and calling the police! <br /> <br /> This certified c ** t schizophrenic personality may be interesting for some time, but this story will eventually become a real recurring one-off relationship. At least the end is worth waiting for those who still care about this time.
