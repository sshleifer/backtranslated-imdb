Let me start by saying that I saw this movie as a good part of it. I was really bored of a good 1997 day and so I drove over to a movie rental store. I asked the secretary what was the worst film he had in stock. Without hesitation, he walked me to "Lucky Stiff". He told me he would give up the $ 1 rent (he said it would be wrong to ask more) when I promise to watch the whole movie. So look at what I did for free ... <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. God-Awful even. I don't have to go to the details of the plot, read other comments. Jokes don't make sense. Action was terrible. I know it was supposed to be a comedy, but the stupidity of the main character was tiring. You can try to look at it as a laugh, but it's so bad that it's not so funny. Avoid!
