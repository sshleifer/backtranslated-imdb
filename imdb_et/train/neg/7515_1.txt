SUcks. That's all I got to say about this apologetic apology to the film. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. I mean, what the hell did they mean? Involved idiots should never allow other movies to be made. The action was so bad that it didn't even succeed at a bad level. The "Lesbian Scene" attempt was sad. I felt the ladies involved were so bad. This movie sucks! Sucks! Sucks! <br /> <br /> I heard the rumor queue. <br /> <br /> God <br /> <br /> Help <br /> <br /> About Us <br /> <br /> All
