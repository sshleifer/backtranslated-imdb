Now I love Bela Lugos, don't get me wrong, she's one of the most interesting people who ever make a movie, but she definitely did her part of the clinkers. It's just one of them. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays drLorenz, a doctor who has pulled his medical license for inexplicable reasons. However, he does experiments to keep his wife young and beautiful.It showed that he is 70-80 years old, but Lugosi seems to be in the mid-50s as he is married to an old woman, never really explained. <br /> <br /> In any case, these treatments or experiments had given the brides who were on the altar married to some sweet smell through which they go out, but they are thought to have died. and bring it back to your lab, where it is kept in some kind of paused animation or catatonic state. somewhere in their bodies, perhaps on the neck, and then the needle is pushed into the body of Lugosi's wife to bring her back to the youth and beauty. We never see where Lugosi sticks with the needle or what it is that she pulls out of the bride, but she restores her somehow women's. a woman doing a lot of shouting until she returns to her younger country. Helping her in the lab is the only good thing in this movie .... strange old hound and her two deformed sons .... one son is a big lumpy-looking slow-acting male who loves to love the bride and the other son is the average little dwarf .... small person, to be politically correct in today's world. At night, these three varieties and sleep in Lugosi's harsh down lab.Who these 3 are and how they came to be Lugosi's scared assistants are, like many things in this movie, never explained. <br /> <br /> So anyway the female reporter is given the task of her gruff editor to find out where all the stolen brides go in one thing in common with all the stolen brides is a rare orchid that can be found in them. it is said that there is a world-famous orchid expert who lives near who just happens to have developed this orchid. This expert turns out to be a terrible Dr.Lorenz. He is following him quickly and disturbs his little house of horrors. I'm not sure where the police were during this time, but they came in when the reporter had done everything it seems that the Lugos movies always had some unnecessary silly plot line that just made the whole thing smell high. I mean the world famous orchid expert robs the brides, sending them doped it is known that the orchid is self developed? D'OH! <br /> <br /> And then it turned out that young ladies don't even have to work as a bride, why should Lugos rob her brides from heavily guarded churches for her experiments and create all the attention and newspaper headlines? Why not just grab a prostitute from the street like a normal weird pervert? This clunker reminded me of many other Lugos stinkers, "The Devil Bat" .... the same silly plot lines and bad behavior and the same silly "reporter gets bad". <br /> <br /> But Lugosi is always good - he is scary and embarrassing enough to keep you at least interesting enough to keep track of him. The woman who played the reporter was just a terrible actor .... she had no emotions, she just gave her lines like a machine, fighting them as fast as possible. <br /> <br /> But this is a traceable thing, only for Bela Lugos fans.Lugosi was always so intense even when the picture was a dog. He must know that he is taking terrible pictures, but he may also have known that when he gave it all, he had a little bit of intensity that could pass all the bad and bad deeds surrounding him and he was right - We horror fans are always in love with Bela Lugosi.He gave her all every tim she had in front of the camera. We'll give you two f ** d, Bela.
