Oh my God, I give this movie ten stars out of ten for the following reasons. the final sequence has been resolved quite effectively again and it was a lot of fun. for that they get three points. besides, it was terrible. it wasn't that funny that a lot is obvious, but duplication, the behavior of duplicated votes, the dialogue they said, where often fun. Activities performed and / or not performed also bring a lot of fun and / or things on the screen. as the whole city is killed and one small group of people standing on the balcony looking at the cooking glass, or "trying" to escape from the church where they punch. <br /> <br /> The evil mayor: I think something goes outside, so you should go up and look out the window. <br /> <br /> Hero: Ok. <br /> <br /> The Mayor of Evil: Now is my chance to make an idiot out and hit a fire that is totally ineffective and started to hack. <br /> <br /> Add the order in which this happens. <br /> <br /> The evil mayor: The devil, wait, I'll get this little baby and he walks outside and cries the priest seemingly obvlious to the fact that these rotten bodies are not just spooky strangers, but are actually zombies without meat or skin or something and he takes them away and i flee! enter the order in which this happens. <br /> <br /> Hero (Upstairs): He is trying to escape again, stupid, and he has left the door, he is stupid, it's a nice view. woman: where is my daughter? <br /> <br /> Hero (now on the ground floor): I don't know, I don't see him anyway and he wasn't out because I didn't see him, even though he didn't see him there and I a view of the whole neighborhood, and he is standing right outside where he could be on earth? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, someone will throw things off the screen in 10 minutes. So, look at the first movie with a few friends, taking some drinks and make sure you look at it, that you are completely blinded and you can just tear it all out. and there was not even a decent gore, such a shame.
