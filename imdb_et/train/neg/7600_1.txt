This movie proves that good behavior comes from a good direction and it does not happen Ask dust. Colin Farrell is usually a good actor, but he is a minor. Donald Sutherland comes as an amateur. Why? Because the script is terrible, the adaptation is terrible and the actors seem boring and half-hearted. The film's atmosphere is bad - I can only think about when it will end and I turned it to the side. The director has done a very bad job and although I haven't read the novel, it is definitely an unanswered opportunity. The film that the film tries to provoke, and the message and storyline never reach the audience. In short, it's a TERRIBLE movie.
