This movie was an attempt to go to most places and shouldn't get caught. It was a similar trial odd, head-to-run term given to us by Cell, though not close in depth and well-portrayed. The plot is just built with the original maturation. Then, when the film takes its supposed "dramatic" move, the plot breaks down on what some feet were up to first. In principle, the idea that a child (Chris McKenna) needs money. He takes a hit that kills the city accountant. Then he does not get paid for his work, but tortures for several days because he dreamed of the "brilliant" idea of ​​trying to use the backup he used as a means of payment. This idiotic move is trying to force him to pay back if he is abusively and endlessly abused. He's going to go crazy (some very disturbing scenes). Then, thinking that he had paid for his sins and could start, he would visit a man's wife (Kari Wuhrer) who killed him and won his affection. Soon after he discovers who he is, the tragedy strikes and revenge through the air as the boy goes after his tormented (Daniel Baldwin, George Wendt, Vernon Wells) for his previous "goodness". <br /> <br /> But I asked what is it with Kari Wuhr and horror / gore movies? <br /> <br /> It seems that everything he has recently released has been in this genre. I liked the fact that I liked this "eight-stroke" and he was "Anacondas". But despite all the obvious beauty and temptation (wow, she's hot!), She can do much better and choose better roles. Or maybe I'm wrong and it's just a misconception. For everyone you saw there, you see "her perfect" in this movie, though it's pretty weird and short-lived. I almost felt like he saw soft porn when watching this movie (nothing is strange to Kari's career). Gender simulation is such that it has to think about what is really going on in filming. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I say there's a good actor. Just don't expect it from Daniel Balwin, whose career seems to be his brother Alex forever. The film, however, brought out some of the old prizes, George Wendt (Norm from Cheers) and Vernon Wells (Commando, Weird Science). First of all, Chris McKenna will do the best work of the main character Sean Crawley. His little acting experience, and yet his plausible nature as naive youth, bring some elements of the film to the film. <br /> <br /> I didn't go out of it. If you're bored and tired of the same old "Hitchhiker" episodes, I would recommend looking at it. <br /> <br /> And Kari, please start with better movies!
