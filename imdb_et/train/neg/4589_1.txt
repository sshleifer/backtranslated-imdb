Remember that the chain of smoking a chain is 60 years a few years ago? It's her. Many people watched this movie without checking the goodness of filmmakers. Manufacturers have been very successful in using counterfeit "word of mouth" campaigns without disclosing the financial and philosophical basis for this marketing breakthrough. If you believe in sewer, reincarnation, the aging of the new age and the daily peace, this film is for you. If you want to discuss quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this movie is to convince you that Ramtha is not a wacko, so you give him a lot of money. If you can ride through the Ramtha website without disbelief, you may think that those who have fallen for this assault have been well spent for being mad. <http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
