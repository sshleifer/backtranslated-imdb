Dialogue: tendency, clichés; Action: hammy, clichéd; Plot: Predictable, Cliché. <br /> <br /> Just what does Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski do in this "B" garbage? Plummer had been making this film for decades, Kinski was behind him ... "Tess" and "Cat People" ... Must be desperate. <br /> <br /> Bad guys are very bad. - * Bad * Bad male-accents! (Especially Plummer! Where * did he learn German?) And most of them also have a bad boy. Innocent bystanders make enough of you to laugh at you. A good man will survive, among others: * 5-inch throwing knife buried deep into his shoulder - just pulls it out and seconds later uses his hand without difficulty; someone who was referred to as .50, a foot he sorts around with a bandage around his panty and after that he has barely, * several fights, in which he carries a number of nipples and runs a cranium - first on the door frame, * on the fall, upside down, on the third without the smallest twisted ankle mark or other discomfort. time when it's all so boring and boring. <br /> <br /> OK, it's not all bad. Plummer brings some class to his class and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick. A lot, but he can make a hesitant frog without using the tooth technique that most rogue uses here to pay his "Ve haffi races and mindsets" type of lines with some threat, but you are always aware that you are watching Christopher Plummer, who acts as a villain. <br /> <br /> This movie is a really terrible waste. The action, as it is, is a kind of wooden line transport of the 70's 007 films, which corresponds to Bruce Lee's very obvious counterfeit scenes, but it is not even as good as Roger Moore 007 or Bruce Lee's film. Do not worry.
