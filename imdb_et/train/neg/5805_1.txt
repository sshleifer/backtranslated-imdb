Anyone who saw the original should go out and destroy this terrible remake. Alex Baldwin, who again tries to mimic Steve Mcqueen's words in the word "remake," just doesn't work. Although Baldwin has done an amazing job, it is a flop from start to finish. McQueen had a charisma, never trying to compete with an asterisk. As Kim has said enough in the role of Ali McGrawi. McQueen seemed dangerous, threatening and plausible as Doc, the film had a thrill and intercourse, Baldwin and the company did it for comedy, I laughed the only time I saw this unhappy movie. And this terrible hairstyle for Michael Madsen, one of today's exciting and credible actors! Did makeup people have it for Michael what they thought. If you want to see how the film was made, how it was for Sam Peckinpah, then get the original!
