I am a big fan of Spaghetti's Western genre and I usually like most of the cheap ones. However, the infamous director Demofilo Fidani is rightly known for some of the cheapest, heaviest and worst genre contributions. The Fijian film plots were usually very weak, and because his talent was rather limited, he usually tried to sell films by adding the famous Western names of Spaghetti like "Sartana" "Django" in the headlines. I'm a special case of "Gi첫 La Testa ... Hombre" in 1971, just taking the name "Gi첫 La Testa" by Sergio Leone (aka "Duck You Sucker") and adding "Hombre". The movie can be found under different titles ("Fistful Of Death", "Western Story" ...), I bought it personally under the name "Adios Companeros", which this movie shares with another Fidani movie with almost the same pain, "Per Una Bara Milk Di Dollar, also known as "Adios Companeros" in German. <br /> <br /> The plot is rather weak, basically following a man called Macho Callaghan (Jeff Cameron) and his involvement with two competing linguistic gangs led by Butch Cassidy (Jack Betts) and Ironhead (Gordon Mitchell). <br /> <br /> Jeff Cameron's leadership is generously convincing. I also didn't find Jack Betts very "Butch Cassidy". However, the B-film legend, Gordon Mitchell, is always a try, and although he was probably not a very good actor, I always found his performances in the western countries of spaghetti quite funny and original, and he actually recorded some of Fidani's films (as pretty funny "Django and Sartana ... showdown in the West "). <br /> <br /> There is one very funny and original thing about "Gi첫 La Testa ... Hombre" - great Klaus Kinski plays the priest! I could have imagined that Kinski had a role in some way, but before seeing the film, I would never have guessed that anyone wanted him a priest. Kinski is big again, though he has only a small screen time and one scene he fights is probably the only good scene. Another interesting thing about this movie is that the legendary director and King Joe D'Amato made cinematography. <br /> <br /> "Gi첫 La Testa ... Hombre" is a cheap, funny movie, but still has some funny moments. Being a spaghetti from a Western enthusiast, I found it fun to watch, but if you don't, don't forget this movie or just watch it to see Kinski the priest. 3/10
