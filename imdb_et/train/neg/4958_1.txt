Not only did they not get the symbols wrong, not only the voices suck, not only did the writers seriously need girlfriends, not only the drawings are really raw, but it seems to have been created mainly for ages 1-6. The only episode I have seen about the show that I was looking at was "Master" because I liked Robin's character. And sometimes I think this is a general copy of Batman's animated series. Example: In BTAS, Bruce with friends is Harvey Dent, right? Over two episodes of story he turns into an unlikely cannon, TwoFace. "Show" Bruce is the friend of this Ethan guy and the story of two episodes, making him an unlikely villain in ClayFace. It was just a small example (it may not even be true), but in short, it is the Batman series WORST test. And it says something.
