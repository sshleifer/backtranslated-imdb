I find myself quite melancholic, especially when I look at very touching and teardrop films. But not for that (what surprised me!) And it is surprising to see how many people praised this film so much. <br /> <br /> The film has several disturbing facts: 1. Despite the guilt - Bensi's real intention to save his life to save 7 lives, I find it annoying that the film seems to be conducive to this type of suicide. Some people may feel that this is a heroic activity, and some others think it behaves like a coward, in the end it was a disturbing activity for me. <br /> <br /> 2. The story of the movie is too dramatic, but the logic is too simplified. Medically, the blood group response must be an organ donor. At the end of the movie, we learned that Emil had a rear blood group that restricted her ability to get a donor in a short time. However, it seemed that Ben was a rare blood type that allowed him to be his donor and, despite the rarity of Ben's blood group, he could donate not only his heart but also his kidneys, cornea and his bone marrow, which in all cases required not only a suitable blood group but also a tissue antigen. <br /> <br /> 3. Why do doctors allow Ben's organs to donate despite the jellyfish poison that he himself killed? <br /> <br /> I can analyze the whole story because after that it's just a movie. However, some of the disturbing facts described above will hopefully help you review your plan to watch the movie. When you go to a soap opera movie, go to it. But you're going to look for intelligent entertainment, give it one!
