This is a very bad movie. I laughed once or twice and the story sucks! Maybe there is one funny joke, it's stupid and it's boring. Through a short movie, I fell asleep and wondered when it ended. <br /> <br /> No one is acting humanly, and everyone is acting foolishly and ridiculously. Rob Schneider, acting like an animal, doesn't pay anything to see. It seemed funny, but the bottom line: DO NOT REMOVE THE FOLLOWING TIME IF THE RIDING CROPS AND STUPPES MOVIE. <br /> <br /> I was wondering when it ended, although it's a short movie. At first we thought it would improve; but it gets worse. Stupid, to the end. I walked out of the theater and I remember this movie forever and bad. <br /> <br /> The writer and co-producer of this movie is a Simpsons TV writer, but it's not like the Simpsons (this movie sucks !!!)
