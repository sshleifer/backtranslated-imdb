Well I have to admit that it was one of my favorites as a child when I looked at this home as a super-8 roll. There is not much to suggest now, except for the natural camp value of the participants, the "ugly" copies of human skulls. Special effects are pretty foolish, mostly composed of wires' skulls and 'ghost' images. <br /> <br /> But there is something to say about the set. The big mansion where this is going is quite creepy, especially since it is mostly unfurnished (probably for budgetary reasons?). <br /> <br /> It definitely inspires more laugh than screaming. Just try not to get strangled when a woman (who does more than her part of shouting) goes to the greenhouse and faces her husband's former ghost.
