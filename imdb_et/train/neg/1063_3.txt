The idea is great. Bringing so many stars in one movie is great. But .... too many stories, too short and really do not make sense. No connection between scenes. There were 3-4 great stories ... but they were 18th. The frame reminded me of "All the Invisible Children" - a movie that I really liked. Compared to that, "the intriguing story of Paris Je T'Aime, which is developing - begins and ends. And it has no topic that would unite all of them - children. I can't find Paris enough on a subject that would combine 18 short sketches together. Perhaps the people who know Paris are interesting. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it ...
