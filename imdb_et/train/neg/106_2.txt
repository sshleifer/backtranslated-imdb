View 1 of 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): A 3-D movie about eating meat from zombies in 3 films. And yes, we see zombies who eat parts of human meat in 3D! Wow, no! It is again and again in a 2D zombie movie, but what usually makes the zombie movie better is the underlying story, not the actual meat eating. This made the original zombie classic good. Eating meat was simply extra. In fact, every three-component chronicle is actually boring because it is easy to understand and slowly proven in the finale. The last story is actually the story that the movie started with (which had a reporter studying the so-called ghost skies) and of course we can also see the meat that eats the zombie. I think I've said enough. Look at the classics, not the 3D hatch.
