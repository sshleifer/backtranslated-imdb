Don't look at this movie. Bad functioning and stupid gore effect. Complete waste of time. I was hoping to see many cool murders and hot chicks, but instead the director depended on killing the animals to shock you, the guard. Nasty. Murder is pretty flat, basically stinging. One woman she wears in her mouth, one she puts raw hamburgers on her face and strangles her. BTK = BTK broiler, burger king "killer" new sandwich .... ha ha. I don't think this film was based too much on actual facts. I mean, his real BTK killer didn't carry rodents, scorpions, and worms. Get your finger off.
