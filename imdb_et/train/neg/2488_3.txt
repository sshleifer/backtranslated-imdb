What is the misunderstanding of the film. Something from a policeman who fires bullets after shooting and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom (and he's been shot about fifty times the size of the jar) and a top-secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who, for some reason, are flying to Mexico. Whether they were deliberately sent there, or simply lost, has never been made clear. And you don't hear a second scenario with the word "butthorn". Gary Busey tries to play Mel Gibson's role as "Lethal Weapon" and when Busey is a serviceable actor, the scenario gives the film a mediocrity. William Smith makes another turn as a Russian soldier of the same character he played in Red Dawn a few years earlier. After most of the 70s, cycling joy was fun to see that he was expanding his communism to a harsh range. Unfortunately, he is probably always remembered as the best man who Clint Eastwood whisked in "Every Way You Get."
