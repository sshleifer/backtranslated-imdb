It may not be the worst comedy all the time, but it's close. The producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life, and I want it back! <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan is funny for about 10 minutes. His high level of voice and crazy madness will begin to get older and then you will realize that the rest of the movie is much worse. He falls on a long line of former SNL with film tests. Some have been excellent, some have failed. There is not much in the middle of this category. Although Chris Farley was brilliant and then okay and then not so funny and then dead ... so I think he will hit his entire career in one career. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like a plague. br /> <br /> c
