Another International 13th Ripoff Even Part Of Your Music! A group of young adults will meet for a small high school meeting and will kill Jason Voorheese. Could it be that they used torture at school? <br /> <br /> Routine slash-fest is fun for fans of the genre and includes the usual movie T&A quota, as it does. The end is a bit more imaginative than your normal slasher. <br /> <br /> MPAA: Rated for violence / gore, language, sexuality, nudity, and some drug content.
