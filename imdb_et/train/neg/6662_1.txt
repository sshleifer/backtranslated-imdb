* Spoilers and Extreme Bashing * <br /> <br /> When this show first started, I found it to be acceptable and fun. Pretty Oddparents was what kids and adults liked. It also had high ratings with Spongebob. But it started to fall because the next crap that Butch Hartman and his team would hit the show was at first. <br /> <br /> First of all, the toilet is not so funny humor. A quick laugh can easily be pulled off for a small child with a break, but this is the only audience to laugh at such a clich√© joke. Next is jokes. Lol we see people in their underwear and see people who are crossing. LOLOLOL !!! I just can't laugh with such tomorrow's bliss! Help me someone! Of course, this exhibition does not suck if it is not for stereotypes. Did you see how the team depicted Australia? They saw them as something other than lover of love, boomerang-throwing simpletons living in a hot desert. But now ... Is the coup, WHY, if this show really sucks them up the most ... EVERYTHING USED !!! The exhibition constantly draws the same jokes (most of them have failed), thinking it is like the biggest thing ever! Cosmo is mostly guilty. I hated how they mentioned "Super Toilets" (which also has humorous humor) and Cosmo is startled. And who could forget that funny battery jokes that every godly mother in Dimmsdale would use this email episode? You know, where every single parent (who does not know that other parents say it) expresses exactly the same sentence before getting into the child's room? Yes, it can be a first-rate humor for some people, but it's pure for others. <br /> <br /> If I am not mistaken, I believe Butch Hartman said something about ending the show. Thank God! Everyone around me says it's like a more fun Nickelodeon show. I just can't accept that? I think this is another horseshoe pile that we get every day in our comic strip stations, but worse.
