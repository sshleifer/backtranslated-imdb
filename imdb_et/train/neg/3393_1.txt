If you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood, let her be a boy. But prepare yourself when you bring your hp when it comes with the radio. <br /> <br /> After watching a good movie like Arisan (2003), it's terrible to see what they're coming up with in Indonesia again. It seems that the only idea is to make money, but nobody seems to be seriously working with the image of Indonesia in the world of entertainment. The fact that it is a "global" world does not seem to appear in those who make films in Indonesia. And because the Indonesian public absorbs everything that is presented to them as "Made in Indonesia", which has a western taste, they get it. <br /> <br /> Let the story be a good start. And it could have evolved into a nice flick. But did the director never think that the musical need is first of all live music OR at least good playback, and secondly, good choreography? In this movie, playback is SOADE that will make you look in the cinema. Every word you hear is followed by a second by the actor or someone who sings, and it is extremely annoying when watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Choreography is like going to make a movie of morning gymnastics, but finally thought it would be nice to make it into music ... They only forgot to change choreography. You can hardly see the dance, they jump here and there, throw their feet in the air, and that's about. <br /> <br /> Well, at least there is a happy ending .... But if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is much more romantic, DO SO!
