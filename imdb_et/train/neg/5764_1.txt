Scary Movie 3 is a stinkfest that is difficult to formulate with words. Movies like Malibu's most desirable films look like Oscar material, they say. <br /> <br /> The original Scary Movie was a lot of fun, one of the best 90's of junk movies that came from a great team who used to be our fascinated world that is not threatening to the south of the south when it comes to drinking its juice in the hood. But what the hell happened? After the tragedy that was Scary Movie 2, I thought the cast and team change would help, but worse. <br /> <br /> After 20 minutes, I smiled twice. No one laughs, jokes were reused and originality was not obviously a factor. The fact that the majority of people who voted for this site in writing today have made me a physical illness. If there are big clamps like Rock School, which are really jokes that are * funny, then anyone who wastes their money on it will need to look into their heads. <br /> <br /> no stars / ****
