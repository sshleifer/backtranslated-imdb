As a Danish, I am proud of the good Danish films produced in recent years. It is a terrible shame, however, that this increase in quality has led most Danish film critics to lose their criticism. In fact, it has become so bad that I no longer trust the reviews of Danish films and as a result I have finished watching them in theaters. <br /> <br /> I know this unsuccessful development is any one movie, so let me emphasize that "Villa Paranoia" would in any case be a terrible movie. The fact that the critics were with this mortgage just added fuel to my stem, which is disappointed with the Danish film. What's more, while waiting for it to appear on the DVD, there was very little help in wasting time and money. <br /> <br /> Erik Clausen is a director of social reality in Copenhagen settings. I especially liked "De Frigjorte" (1993). As an actor, he is usually funny, although in general he plays the same role in all his films, namely the working class, who has succeeded, partly because he is sliding, but mostly because of society and who himself redeems himself by doing something good for his community. <br /> <br /> This is the first "Villa Paranoia" problem; Clausen criticizes himself as a chicken farmer, a break from the rule that he can never make it credible. But it is much worse that the film has to do twists and turns all the rules on how to tell the story to make the audience understand what is happening. For example, the film opens a very sad attempt to visualize the deaths of a visual nature, using low budget effects and poor camera performance. After that, the character tells his best friend that he suddenly felt the urge to throw the bridge. It is symptomatic of the whole movie; there is little or no motivation to make characters, and Clausen is in the lowest form of communication, regardless of motivation: showing instead of showing. So, at one point, you have a character who speaks aloud about the allegedly catatonic person, how he feels, because the script does not allow him to feel his feelings; Later, the voice call is introduced abruptly, albeit as a later idea, to pass on the feelings that would otherwise remain unaware of the injustice of the director. Fortunately, you have now spent about an hour now taking care of any character, let alone a story. <br /> <br /> A good thing that has often been a problem with Clausen's films can be SÃ¸ren Westerberg Bentsen, whose only claim against Stardom was the Big Brother competitor, not worse than many famous actors. <br /> <br /> I give this 2-out-of-10 rating.
