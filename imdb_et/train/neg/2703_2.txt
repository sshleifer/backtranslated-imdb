MY SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Well, I just sat up late and watched this movie mainly because I enjoyed some of Singleton's earlier works, such as "Boyz n the hood". But I have to say that it was a great disappointment and all I hate about clich√©s, so-called message films. <br /> <br /> Actors are mostly poor (pop stars and models may not necessarily act as good actors), situations are hard to swallow, (rape becomes a victim of overnight? ... please!) but worst of all reinforces every twisted stereotype you mean. In the second half of the film, it has become a comic that characterizes you, losing any empathy you might have for one-dimensional players. <br /> <br /> Nothing is a valid point for the causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result, it simply comes to the sensational of the results of these problems. Its message is contradictory, resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot cohesion. As for films, I found it to be predictable, embarrassing, exploitative, and slightly offensive. I have to say the movie "Higher Education" that all I learned is never to see it. <br /> <br /> If you want a real comment on some of the topics that this movie does not fully complete, then hire "American History X" .... if you just didn't look at it for Tyra Banks, go hire a life .
