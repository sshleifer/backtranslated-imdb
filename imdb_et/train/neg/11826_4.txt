There is something sad when you see someone who is so good to do something, trying to do something very different ... and finally it's mediocre. I thought Jordan was playing baseball, but the same goes for Steve Martin. <br /> <br /> This movie is reasonably well behaved and directed, but the script is smelly. Martin did a great job of adapting the classic story to the comedy "Roxanne", but this effort to bring the modern scene to a contemporary scene smells straight on the unlikely wall. If you want to see an old style that is updated with some style, it is best to rent "Great Expectations".
