Well I looked at it last night and one thing that didn't make it terrible was that it was straight forward. The bush was not beaten that this boy was Anti-Christ. But the film was just badly written. For example, they never explained how they made the dentist's case "unfortunate" or, finally, how the policeman just came to the house miraculously to save the child without even calling the police. The scenes of death were simply very bad and not at all entertaining. The child they chose to play Anti-Christ was bored and could really choose a better child. Just don't waste your time looking at it.
