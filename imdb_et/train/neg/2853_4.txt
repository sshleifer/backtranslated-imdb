Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is the boss of the troops, leaving the spiritual institution back in the world of his gangsters. How can the director conquer Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very proud), Gabriel Byrne, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Billy Idol and the time wasted? This film is a comedy that is not funny and has a cast of constellation. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Pleasure in Killing You!" <br /> <br />
