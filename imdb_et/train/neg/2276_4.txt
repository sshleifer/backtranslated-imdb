CLASS OF '61 <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> In 1861, West Point Academy class members were crushed apart from civil war outbreak. <br /> <br /> Gregory Hobl's OK Historical Drama is an obvious point - virtuous men have become blind due to conflict - although production seems a bit sparse despite the authentic time and detail. by talented newcomers (Clive Owen, Christien Anholt, Josh Lucas, Andre Braugher, Laura Linney, etc.) named Dan Futterman as a conscientious Southerner who takes weapons to protect slavery and puts him in direct conflict with his former North friends. The film's emphasis on such an erroneous - albeit sympathetic - character is particularly bold, but the drama is otherwise flat and superficial, and the direction of Hoblit is more effective than inspired.
