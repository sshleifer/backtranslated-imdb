I checked this movie when he had 6 more votes and he said like 7.2 or something, but it's a terrible movie. Allows it to break down. The first thing you notice about this movie is that it was filmed in a handheld digital camera owned by a community college. the next thing you know is that the actors are all friends of this fresh friend. songs in this movie, at 30-second intervals ... also all digital edits are made on this fresh home computer ... probably using Windows Movie Maker. I would not recommend this movie to anyone I know, but I punish the writer and director to watch this movie in hell for eternity.
