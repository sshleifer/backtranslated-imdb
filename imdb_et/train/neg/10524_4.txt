I wanted to see it in the movie theater. It was actually sold out. I was actually going to look at Solaris, which was actually the worst film that appeared in 2002. <br /> <br /> Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a rugged, street-friendly street pharmacist, when he sees, the child gets off so he decides to go clean and invest all his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). It looks like things go pretty well until Jack jumps out of town with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). It happened very late in the movie, so if they didn't show it in the preview, it could have been an interesting twist. But they did, so this is not the case. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is nothing interesting about this movie; everything is previewed. If you even saw one preview, you saw the whole movie so you could just think of filling the gaps. Go to website, download preview, save $ 3.99. There is no surprise or twist in the whole movie except how amazing the soundtrack is. <br /> <br /> I hope that someone who was responsible for writing the soundtrack was fired. Twice. Most of this is what the music would be like if the only loose songs were Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan duets, and (I can crush the space-time continuum fabric with the idea as it is). he had less talent and musical ability. <br /> <br /> The actor is the best in poverty, at best the script is anti-human, and Denise Richards is at best 67% styrofoam and 33% ziploc. You know, things are bad when John Leguizamo (he was in Pest!) Puts the rest of the show up with the actors.
