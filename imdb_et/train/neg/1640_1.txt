This film lacked ... everything: story, actor, surprise, ingenuity and soul. Fifteen minutes I looked at the screen saying, "How could all these men come together and make themselves friends (even without a girl)?" For another 15 minutes, I prayed as much as possible to Amanda Peet. When a bad movie lives quietly, it's a ugly head, eye candy is a nice consolation. But it wasn't much! Cheated on all fronts!
