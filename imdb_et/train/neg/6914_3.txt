I saw this movie some time ago (working with a movie production trailer) and it was TERRIBLE. Hewitt is at best mediocre, Hopkins telephones (but still blows Hewitt in his scenes) and Alec looks bored. Trust me in this: you should avoid this movie like a plague if it ever gets free. It seems that it will continue forever if the tired plot is at a snail's pace. It is relentless, the cinema is busy and the direction is pedestrian. Alec Baldwin should go to film training if he plans to re-lead. In his character, his character is completely unlikely, which makes it impossible to root him. Dan Ackroyd is a pretty funny and surprising jury at the end of the movie, but this movie is just terrible.
