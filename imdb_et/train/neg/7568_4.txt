Chan Wook Park is nothing, if not inventive. I'm CYBORG, but it's OK, full of amusing little technical prosperity, with some brilliant ideas. We are trying to walk in the footsteps of Marc Caro and Jeunet (LAST CHILDREN'S TOWN, DELICATESSEN), Park starts a fantastic, white and story that is a radical departure from its usual morbidity. Hardly anyone who is guilty of his ambition or vision is really unexpected to see so little of Park's efforts. <br /> <br /> I'm CYBORG, but it's probably surprising to separate it when it goes, with the end result being a fraction of the sum of its parts. The assumption is promising, the gags are rich and the rich humor is rich, but not everyone can easily create a meaningful connection with the audience. The characters are cute and selfish and played with joy, but try as I could, I couldn't take care of myself. <br /> <br /> There was a wrong move for SADATIA LADY VENGEANCE, which may have somewhat occupied the Park, but still managed to show some of the director's unique burns and, after impressive filmography, easily forgave him. No definite confidence that led the common security area or symphony for MR. VENGEANCE is here to see. I am CYBORG, but it is OK, which was so free for me that from time to time I got instinctively fast (with the progress of the film more regularly). I gave LADY 5/10 and because of this action it probably deserves more than 3.
