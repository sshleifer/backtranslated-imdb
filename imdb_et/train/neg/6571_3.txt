Although I disagree with one observer who described Charley Chase as unusual, he is definitely in this movie. It is a shame because I suspect that another reviewer must have seen only a few Charley Chase duds and assumed that the boy was not funny. Movies like MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE and WHAT PRICE GOOFY? is a very good chase movies so he could be really funny given good material. Unfortunately, there is something in this movie. Even generally, the addition of a good Oliver Hardy to a foil is no help because the basic assumption (boy wants to marry a girl, but the girl's father thinks the boy is nervous) and the gags are so poor. It's a shame, because I really wanted to love this movie, but I couldn't. <br /> <br /> By the way, for those who are used to looking for Charley since the mid-1920s, you're quite surprised if Chase doesn't make any glasses or mustache - and looks very little like you would expect.
