Wow You guys are too nice! Corny, Corny, Corny So I feel this movie. It started well with a good idea, boy (Edward Asner) flees from Jail, dressed as Santa. He and her believe that her true Santa Claus, so the fake holidays are recruiting children to help him find a stolen money bag. The film is like a "whistle down the wind". The film starts well, but gradually it becomes Cheesier and Cheesier so that eventually it becomes ridiculous and you just can't take that movie seriously. For example, a Scrooge-type character called Sumner (Rene Auberjonois), who is the entire Douchebag who treats his little son like a trash, treats the son so badly that he doesn't even buy him the right clothes, a poor child wearing jeans and holes in it! but the 45 second scene Fake Santa visits Sumner and finally gets a guy to sing a happy singer to a happy song and giving his neglected son an expensive ... yes, that's how Corny is ... I'm all good at knowing a movie especially during Christmas and I I'm a big fan of the seasonal TV movie, but it's too overwhelming for me, it's a shame because it started well, but the other side of the movie is trying to make a supernatural element of a movie that just doesn't match the rest. It's not entirely bad, there's some solid action, especially from kids, but there's a much better Christmas card.
