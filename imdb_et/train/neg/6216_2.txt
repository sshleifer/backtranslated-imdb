9, the movie I've been waiting for months ... was a little more disappointing. <br /> <br /> I was deeply surprised by the 9 missing stories and the strange character development. All awesome sequences in the world do not compensate for one atypical character. The weird, almost occupied in the series, was not only stationary, they were scary. The story tells about robots and scientists ... why does this suddenly become a necronomicon horror wannabe with mysterious symbols and a green magic ghost instead of giving answers to what might have been great scary story devices ?? <br /> <br /> How, what, when, why .... issues that only require you to care and it becomes less likely that you will leave the theater. <br /> <br /> This film is frustrating because of the lack of depth ... I look at the film that was drawn with pastel when that story was good. But filmmakers have trusted the crowd of the CGI and the name of Tim Burtons. What ... is what drew me, but I couldn't get my respect. <br /> <br /> 9 could have been fantastic ... with some rewrite and a little more respect for their creators.
