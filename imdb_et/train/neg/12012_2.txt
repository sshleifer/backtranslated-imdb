The dialogue was quite terrible. The plot is not all that was clearly inspired by the complex. Not visually stunned. In fact, it is occasionally annoying visually. Definitely one of those movies that is easier to finish when you hold one finger back and forth. If you could watch it for free, then there are no other options open at the moment and you really dig a little poltergeist lady ... well, maybe I would recommend it to you, but no one else I could think of right now.
