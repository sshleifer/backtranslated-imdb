"The Rainmaker", which appeared in 1956, owns the best actors of its time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges and Burt Lancaster are the main players. Even they do not save it completely over the acting melodrama. First of all, Hepburn is terribly disgraceful as a shy spinster - despite his shine as an actor, he can't even pull it out. He's too strong to be believed to be so simple, and just too old. Lancaster goes over extreme acts and Earl Holliman is too hammam and goes out like Jethro Clampett. Only Bridges and more reliable Wendell Corey look a little higher, but even they can do so much. It seems that the 1950s was a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings as an actor and that is good. He just made a bad choice here. Fortunately, his fans (I am among them) did not make too many of them. Despite the cast and good production values ​​of List A, it does not work.
