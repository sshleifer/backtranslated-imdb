Laugh, Clown Laugh, released in 1928, celebrates the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus club called Tito. In adulthood, Tito has raised the foundation (young and beautiful Loretta Young) and calls her Simon. Tito has raised the girl in circus life and has become a ballerina. Though Chaney gives her usual excellent performance, I couldn't get Tito, who is now in the middle, to a young Simonett. Although he is not his biological father, he has raised him as a daughter. This "ick" factor passes through the film. Tito competes for Simonetta's affection for the young and beautiful 'Count' Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta clearly falls for a young man, but he is innocent of Tito's abandonment (loyalty, not romantic love). The premise of the film is ridiculous and I find it amazing that nobody in the film tells Tito what a stupid old stupid she is (until she reveals it at the end). The film is remarkable only because of Loretta Young, who continues his great career. While I adore Chaney's shine as an actor, this whole movie seems to me out and just plain horrible.
