I often feel that Scrooge, the slamming movies that others are raving about - or, I write a review to offset unreasonable raves. I found that this film was almost unobtrusive, and for me it was unusual not only through numb, cliché dialogues, but also through dull, cliché musical numbers. Whatever the originality of this movie is - an unusual home-made device for music, there are many fantasies, some animations more than compensated by a script that is not a dream or thought-provoking plot development. Individually, on June, Haver and Dan Dailey are beautiful people, but they can't carry the movie as a team. Neither of them is really charismatic or very sexual. They're both cool. I like Billy Gray, but his character is quite a remark. For me, the best part of the movie is the beautiful costume and body of Haver in June.
