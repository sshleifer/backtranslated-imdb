I think the tips on this topic will be commented on. <br /> <br /> I was quite surprised by the number of people who liked this movie, who wanted to make it "mandatory" or "mandatory." <br /> <br /> I think this gives us some insight into why this film and the underlying question is so polarizing. The global warming problem calls for many people who want to force others to "do the right thing". This calls for more "more liberal" inclined people because it is not related to the bedroom morale, which usually becomes a conservative who wants to force you to be "good". <br /> <br /> And this is a problem with the film. Al Gore is a politician. And very successful. He just can't help to turn to people who want to force others. The political complaint is just too big. <br /> <br /> And we have a scientific question that can be very important, a reduced political issue that invites people who are in a political situation and who are cautious to force others. Another interesting question is how the movement of environmental protection from such people hijacking?
