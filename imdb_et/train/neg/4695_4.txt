I watched this movie a couple of times and never thought it was funny, but it's still fun to watch and good for some laughs. <br /> <br /> The fact that women work in the company and their boss is a jerk and they end up giving it the taste of their medicine and trying to get the respect they deserve. <br /> <br /> Actress is really good. Dabney Coleman is one of those 80 stars that plays good bad, not very evil, just unlikely. Dolly Partin is gracious and fun to watch comedies and her south wit really shines here. Jane Fonda is that way and does little for me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing for this movie, she has the most fun lines and I made a lot of laughter a lot, I have to love her. <br /> <br /> I could recommend it to anyone who loves 80's comedy. I like the movie, but it has things I don't like. It starts with a big one and is a good stream, and then it all starts to come together and makes me feel less. They all have little fantasy about what they'd like to do with the boss, and though "cute" I just thought it slowed down the film's flow. When the movie goes on, it starts up again and the funniest things happen and then it slows down again, but just for fast wrapping, which is too good to be true. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10 stars, but try if you haven't seen it. I think that depending on their mood, it can be more or less pleasant.
