I like animated shows. I like Nick's fare pretty much, including Hey, Arnold. But watching TV on Big Screen is not easy and it just didn't feel big enough. It was rather a long episode of the show, and it just didn't go well. Judging by the behavior of the children we had with us, it didn't work well for them.
