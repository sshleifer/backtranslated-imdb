Even with this genre's standards, this film is very difficult to swallow. We are asked not only to acknowledge that the record back can bring a dead person back to life, but it also contains hidden messages specifically targeted at one child if the singer was not a boy when he was alive, and of course it is not possible to know which hand record ended. In any case, the film is fun for a while, but ultimately domination and nonsense. If they were really trying to create a new Freddy-like horror, they were down: the villain doesn't have personality, motivation, or diversity. (* 1/2)
