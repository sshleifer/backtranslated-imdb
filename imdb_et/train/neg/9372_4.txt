This is a typical late Universal Horror flick: its technically compromised when it is numbered, with a cookie cutter and some serious moves. The most interesting part of this movie is a man with bone disease, Rondo Hatton, the stunt of the movie "The Monster". It's sad to see that this man was used, but apparently he used the money they paid him. Hatton is less terrifying than in the studio's hope, because I mostly felt fear or even sadness. Martin Koslack is a movie on a crazy artist and he is very fun about it. I know Koslack's vision in almost everything; for some reason the man is interested in me. The only other part of the film that interests me is the absurd art world of the film. Here are the evil art critics who enjoy their ability to break artists; it's next to the movie's "hero" who is the "artist" who paints ... get it ... familiar girls. Somehow our hero's work is viewed alongside the woolly absurd sculpture. It is also fun to be the main nasty critic of the film, who at one point claims to despise the hero's pin-art because "such women do not exist", to which our hero responds, that the critic is simply not enough. Finally, there is a bit of a lower-ranking heroine (who is the art critic himself), which is dominated by a leading person ... feminist and witness ridiculous. In general, this film is a rather mediocre picture with some amusing elements.
