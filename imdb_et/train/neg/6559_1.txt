My girlfriend chose this; The South-born and raised African-American found the plot and space of this film completely reliably. To believe that class and racial bias was so easily and comfortably stopped would only come from someone who is completely familiar with the south angel. Completely absurd !!! I don't know how they got a good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actor like Andie McDowell (who's better in the south)
