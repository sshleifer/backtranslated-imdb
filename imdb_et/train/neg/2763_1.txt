I went to look at the D-war and with very low expectations. The film could not fill them. <br /> <br /> I don't mind stories that stretch faith - remember Reign of Fire? - But I hope they are internally consistent. The movie jumped to the shock, without the breath, all confused with special effects that were far behind the LOTR or even Godzilla. <br /> <br /> Shape-changing mystical warrior from Korea, strangely metamorphosed by a Caucasian antique dealer and opens up as a deus ex machina to get the unhappy protagonists out of his last confusion. A special representative of the FBI, who seems to be completely boned with ancient Korean folklore, thanks to Fedi's excellent "paranormal division", which has so far been abandoned. Lovers kisses abandoned beaches, where one shouts, "I never wanted to happen." Reincarnated by a couple of long dead Koreans who "died as adult Christians". Mysterious pendants, the hordes of robotic warriors on display (which owe much to Peter Jackson's orcs) and the snake that wastes so much time that every time he has chosen a prey, he pulls it aside, pulls it aside. > Dialogue is terrible, wood and the impact of the whole was, frankly, annoying. But for me, the crowning moment was after the finals, when the final exam music was - Arirang! It's like Akira Kurosawa, who closes "Rani" with my Way - karaoke transfer - and let me be clear that I don't compare in any way with Director Shimit Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> In short, a sensitive collection of clusters and narrative non-sequences that can turn to the so-called melodramatic way of thinking in popular Quran culture, but should not be worth the price of a ticket on any serious film carrier - or not so serious film carrier. I would advise you to bypass the movie and go straight to the video, but I'm not even sure it's worth it.
