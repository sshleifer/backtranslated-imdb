<br /> <br /> I saw it on a Sci-Fi channel. It came right after the first one. For some reason, this movie kept me interesting. I don't know why, stop asking. The first film had a "cause" for killing people, but in that order, half of the killings / killing attempts were basically without reason. Stanley killed the director because of his creative differences, he created a co-writer because of creative differences, but what was the attempt to throw away? Not cast, no movie. He wanted him to "look dead"? If it should be such a high budget movie, use special effects, MAN. Of course, like the first one, the captured girl disappears and Stanley gets confused and stops. Woooooow (sarcasm). This movie HAD potential. And the saddest thing ... really sad part ... I'd look at "Cabin by the Lake 3". Just because I like Judd Nelson, and he's the only good part of that sequence.
