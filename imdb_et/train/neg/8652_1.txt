I thought it might be a good thing to start with these movies, but when I started it, I found it really terrible. They said the film was made in Afghanistan, but I think 95% of the film is shot from India. you can see cars made in India. You can see a lot of drinking in the bailey (Indian watermark), prices written on the roads, you can see the Afghan temples * hahah * its really funny and many other stuff that proves he hasn't been shot in Afghanistan. I think one should not waste his time watching his movie. Pure Timeline .. I would recommend doing something else instead of watching a movie or maybe your heart might be a better idea, but don't look at this waste of time
