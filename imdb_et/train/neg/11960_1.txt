Actually, I missed some of the Asian horror movies a while ago when I got completely sick when I saw the same ghost story. But I have more and more recently used the flick of exploitation and decided to give them another chance. My first harbor was the highly respected director, Takashi Miike, highly rated Visitor Q. I've already seen Audition, and although I didn't like it much, I appreciate it as one of the best contemporary horror movies in Asia. So, I went for it with reasonable expectations; and unfortunately only boredom was found. I think this movie is really smart and just went over my head, but what seemed to me was just a set of violent and disgusting scenes where there was little or no coherence between them. All comparisons with the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch are of concern to me; all Miike has made a movie here; the surrounding intelligence has been applied by conscientious fans, desperate to find any meaning. My headache took about 10 minutes (after my father had sex with some girls for some reason) and it didn't fall until the movie finally ended; at least twenty-four hours later, or so it seems. Don't make me wrong, I'm not against film violence, and I'm looking for the most notorious movies. but even though it may be violent, it is also pointless and boring and I did not enjoy this ounce. Takashi Miik may have a lot of fans, but I'm definitely not one of them; and I hope this is the last time I come into contact with one of his films.
