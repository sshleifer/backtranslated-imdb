What's wrong with this movie? Many, many things. Editing tries to look too good and does nothing but confuse the viewer while also providing a powerful headache. The plot is confused and apparently prolonged from the beginning of the short (stories or film). The plot has just less than ten minutes of good story and is just painfully stretched until it reaches the minimum length of the feature film. We all know what happens to things when we stretch them, right? Exactly. They get thinner. Ultimately, the plot is so thin that it won't even be left out if you don't pay attention to what it's hard to do when watching this movie. Operation is not even a bit impressive. The characters are badly written and boring, uninteresting. One of the worst things about this movie is that there was probably no one who was responsible for the score / soundtrack, the idea of ​​what the film was or what it was supposed to be (not that I blame him, I couldn't do it) t also find out. As a result, half of the music in the movie is not suitable for scenes. Also, what about all sexual undertones between Eliza Dushku and the main character? Of course, this was to attract young men, but it was just as cheap. And is there anything else in the first scene about the film? At any conceivable level? Overall? Two creepy men didn't see the movie at all, they were there to get some tracking scenes. I doubt anyone could really enjoy such a badly assembled movie and such a shameless and terrible Hollywood-like event for a somewhat interesting idea. But I ground. I recommend this to little-attention teenagers who don't really mind a bad horror thriller if there is some gender and gore (although this may be true only for Killer Cut, which I saw). 1/10
