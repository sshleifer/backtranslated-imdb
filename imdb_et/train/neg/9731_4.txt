Others have already commented on the "downfall" of director Tobe Hooper, but how did Brad Dourif? He was perfectly capable of choosing good projects (if he proved "Exorcist III" in the same year), why would he agree? Of course, he gives a suitably demented performance and the film isn't totally bad; it is just gripping, uninteresting and unpleasant. That's three too many. (* 1/2)
