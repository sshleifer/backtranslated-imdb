<br /> <br /> When I look at watching "Trance" or "Eternal" or what manufacturers call this movie, I thought myself: "Of all the bad movies I would have seen, I would not have seen it at least what was fun? "Even if the film does not work well for running, managing, writing or for you, it can be at least fun and therefore worthwhile. But not only does this film have a bad artistic value, it is incredibly boring. With such a thin layer of air, it moves terribly slowly, with little dramatic tension. In the case of at least a entertainment experiment, the deaths of the characters could have been cool and / or enjoyable, but the creators of this creator also failed in this department. <br /> <br /> What is this movie going for? Quite a lot, except if you can look at the entertainment of Christopher Walken, who is capable of being brilliant, make so little effort in his activities to get into an independent parody mode (Why did he still decide to do that?). br /> <br /> I give this movie 3/10 because God helps us, there have actually been worse films in the past.
