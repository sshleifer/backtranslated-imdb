The first point that draws attention to "For Ever Mozart" is the lack of plot summary in IMDb. The explanation is simple because there is no story, scenario, plot or anything that could remind you of the minimal structure of the movie. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most overwhelming and terrible directors in the cinema industry, and this nonsense crap is among his most hermetic films. I believe that neither of them has understood what it is; but there are intellectuals who vindicate this dirty movie to justify or explain, and it's funny to read their reviews. <br /> <br /> My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Para Semper Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
