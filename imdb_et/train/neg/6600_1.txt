Yowza! If someone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good then you are a better person than me! This film, although a great attempt to "imitate" Laurel and Hardy through appearance, sound and routine, is unable to hold them or even a film of any kind. I blame Larry Harmon. The dialogue is shattered from old L + H films and planted unrealistically, the plot is confused by the useless characterization of other unnecessary characters, Pinchot's accent was strange to Stan, and although Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie's accent, he also tried to create a wonderful blend that was Mr. Hardy. Where was the (good) musical number? Editing is dirty, functioning is rigid, lines are terrible, physics is impossible - (although they were trying to give in to knowing cheap kits?), And generally this is a terrible testimony. It is still painful to look at ATOLL K, where the legendary duo made his last film in terrible 1950s history and photography. Take advantage of and watch as many ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy movies as you can and learn how things were. You know what MAGNATE is, isn't it? Stan Laurel did not respond to each sentence constantly with half-moral smiles. <br /> <br /> I regret anyone who thinks it was a good update / au for boys. Where was CLASSIC THEME SONG?!? Why destroy "Here's another fine mess"? Why skip some wiser? Why was there a pointless look at missions? WHY MISS GULCH OZI WIZARD? WHY DOES HARMONI RECOGNIZE IT? WHY BOZO!? And does the teacher's channel help finance this thing? <br /> <br /> I really know. Fart jokes, for God's sake. <br /> <br /> FART EVERYONE.
