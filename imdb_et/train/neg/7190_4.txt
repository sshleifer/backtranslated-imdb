On the 7EVENTY 5IVE plot, there are college kids playing a cruel phone game that unexpectedly (for those who aren't the fans of horror) will get into their heads. On the other hand, the 7-year-old 5-year-old is a horror film with a little promise, which unfortunately was really losing weight. <br /> <br /> What could have been fun if somewhat silly, the old-fashioned story tells us early about the misleading conviction of the filmmakers that the audience enjoys watching a lot of loud, rich children worshiping each other for most of the film's driving time. Except for the police detective played by Rutger Hauer (a minor role, mainly intended to add the only star power of the film), each character on the screen is different from the new breed in the A-hole. <br /> <br /> Male and female, black and white, straight and gay, the whole ensemble with low and gentle college kids carries most of the film's narrative. Worse still, because the story is about a PARTY game that is overwhelmed, most of the scenes are full of these little b ***** ds. That's why there are few breaks for the viewer who are grabbed by the anger of the finely pulled protagonists. Although at least some of these people are said to be friends, all characters are always relatively long in a relatively hostile way before a real conflict actually arises. This leads to the worst possible result in a slasher movie: an audience who wants to take care of drivers, not only rejoices in an anonymous killer, but also wants it to come out to start removing the snapshots much earlier. > <br /> The real shame of this bad character is that otherwise the 7EVENTY 5IVE really has the potential. Visually, it's good. First-time directors Brian Hooks and Deon Taylor know how to create a tight mood. They also manage to provide some of the classical 80s-style gore competent, as little moments. Surprisingly, casting production is also quite capable. It is not that actors are not able to express realistic human emotions; it is just that the scenario (also written by newcomer Vashon Nutt and director Hooks, who is much better than the keyboard) is short of such moments. <br /> <br /> 7EVENTY 5IVE is hardly recommended as its familiar assumption and little excitement cannot overcome the bad taste that has been strangled by unpleasant signs. In this mild whodunnitis, it is a real secret why one should take care of a group of young peoples who cannot even please one another.
