My comments may be a bit of a spoiler that's worth it. Stop now if you care enough .... <br /> <br /> Grace's recording should have been titled "Paper-Thin Excuse's Old British Women to Get High on the Screen." This movie is stupid. Random music is an outrage, as is the obvious hackneyed stories that randomly pop up to comment on the narrative ("Spirit in heaven," - Oh, I get it!) It's basically Cheech and Chong movie made reliable by his stodgy of English and Brenda Blethyn's overwhelming power Generate emotions in the audience using your voice alone. I can literally listen to people in the High Times magazine who get their jokes over the huge "buds" that nest this picture. The worst scene? Easy. Brenda tries her illegal luggage in London on a white dress. Not funny. Not original. Not interesting. Not a good movie. 7.2 rating is due to over-voting. Don't waste your time ...
