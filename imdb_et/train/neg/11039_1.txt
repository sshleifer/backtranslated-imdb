All the funny things that are happening in this sitcom are based on the main character Jim, who is either a bad father, a bad husband or, in general, just very selfish. How is it funny? Of course, the character of sitcom must be faulty, but the character of Jim is extremely inappropriate. <br /> <br /> And why is this? I think it's because "he should be better now". Jim is not a stupid boy, he can take care of things and he has opportunities. But he decides not. This is the conscious choice she makes when she decides not to play with her children, not to shop because she does not want to buy "lady products" and that is her choice when she puts down her relatives. <br /> Other characters appear to be in the series, so Jim can have someone to come. If Cheryl's character was a real person, he would have left him years ago and did not stay dead for 8 years. But, unfortunately, he is the catalyst for Jim's distinctive middle class extreme selfishness.
