About twenty minutes of this movie, I was already bored. Just those signs were quite boring. Sometimes something pleasant happens, but then it slows down again. Fortunately, my patience was finally rewarded and the end of this movie wasn't at all bad. But it was not enough to justify the session in the first ninety minutes. So, I would say that the film was generally mediocre, and I would be disappointed with it, given all the false sensitivity.
