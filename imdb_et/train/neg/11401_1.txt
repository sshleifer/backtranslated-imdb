The script was VERY weak w / o arc of sufficient character to change the care no matter what characters or what happens to them. The script is too talkative and not enough gore or action to call it even slow. The story is that you want everyone to close and die as quickly as possible so you don't have to listen to them, talking about a very silent and stiff dialogue. The technical note has a set of music and it is difficult to understand what is usually said. Then it could be called a blessing. All in all, the same story would have been in a shorter film w / running time less than 30 minutes. Sam Raimi and Evil Dead's obvious "respect for your face" would have been good if they were more subtle, but here they seem more like a bald face. Is such a 35 mm budget and is it the best thing to do? However, cinematography, lighting design and shots are very well done.
