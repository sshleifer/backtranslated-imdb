Unfortunately, it was wrong. This movie was stolen from start to finish. It was hard to watch because I looked at Clarissa Explains It All every day on Nickelodeon. I loved her. The next thing I found was that he was in Maxime and he was great! I haven't really heard of him until I watched this movie randomly. I couldn't believe he'd even see something like that under his name. All this was wrong, but it still seemed like someone in the team was really hard to rescue the ship. Too bad .. I hope he will continue to act and I would like to see him with a real movie.
