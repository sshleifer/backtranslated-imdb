Recently, they have been trying to promote this movie on cable television late in the evening. Don't believe in hype. I was one of the unfortunate people who saw this theater. I think it is the worst film of the 3rd era, just behind Mac & Me (# 1 worst) and Jack Frost (# 2 worst), but I have to admit they are all close and all TERRIBLE! Indeed, such a movie is neither funny nor distracting or anything else it claims to be so that it does not waste its money. The only thing that's good is to give your worst enemy. I don't lie about that. Someone you would like to kill or torture would be the main candidate for this movie. That's terrible. If you don't believe me, you deserve to suffer because of the trouble I doubt you can stop. Two thumbs enthusiastically down.
