Unfortunately there are more drops than ups. The plot was pretty decent. I mean something ordinary, but he had a story, unlike other modern horror. Another good thing was cast. I'm not saying it was good because it wasn't, but every actor / actor was hot and attractive. One of them is that the film is exciting after the first 40 years. minutes or so. The rest was pretty boring. Another downward (or if you want to keep it if you want) is excessive nudity. All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes and all the boys showed their bucks for a long time. It is not that I am against nudity, but it was a horror film, not a "dream". <br /> <br /> If you are not very desperate to take a man off your swimsuit and run naked for a few minutes or see if the girl is naked for no reason or Debbie Rochon fan, if it's a movie for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.
