Richard C. Sarafian has come to Japanese theaters for a disaster in this country and has just arrived at the video, where it was not seen again until Turner Networks needed anything other than information markets to fill their 3-6 year slots. tape at the bottom of your trash. The name Smithee should be used when the studio hacks the film so badly that the director no longer wants to add her name to it. But I'm afraid Sarafian can't blame the studio for that. Actors, mostly recent graduates "Overacting 101", give one horn line after another. The plot is twisted. Special effects are unimpressive. Those parts that are not ridiculous are just boring. The script or book must be good - why would Palance, Matheson, Boyle or Heston agree in this dud? But something went horribly wrong from the screen to the screen. Summary: Avoid. Not so bad to be so bad, it's good.
