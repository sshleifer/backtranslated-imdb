I'm sure it was one of those "WOAH!" sights in 1982 when Epcot opened, but now it's just stupid. The film's message is a clich√©. Circle-Vision is disorienting. And this terrible song at the end is a grid. And I really want them to install the seats. After so many walks, all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes. And when you hear that the movie is seen, it sounds pretty glamorous! You're having fun, right? ERROR! You stand there for 18 minutes, relying on a short small fence. Disney should make the newer Maelstrom a similar attraction to liven up things and replace this boring, empty film. NOT FUN. Skip it. In fact, miss out on Canada if you don't eat there. Go straight to the UK.
