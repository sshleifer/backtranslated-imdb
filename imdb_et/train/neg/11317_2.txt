This move is about as bad as they come. However, I was forced to give it to 2 on the terrain. There are many great shots, including many at Monument Valley, one of the most breathtaking places in the US. It's also filmed from John Ford. In fact, one scene with Krise and the girl was filmed at a John Ford point.
