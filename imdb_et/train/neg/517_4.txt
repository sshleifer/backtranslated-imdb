"Chandu's Return" is remarkable when it can be said that Bela Lugos is cast as a hero rather than a frog. Why does she even get a girl. <br /> <br /> This story includes the Ubastian black magic culture, which is trying to capture the last Egyptian princess Nadji (pleasant Maria Alba) and use her as a sacrificial tool to revive her ancient leader, just like Nadji. Lugosi, as Chandu, who possesses magical abilities, tries to stop the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Director Ray Taylor is doing his best with limited resources and extensive footage. King Kong fans (1933) recognize the gigantic doors that were used to hold several scenes in Kong. Action is usually terrible. An actor who plays, for example, a high priest (I believe Lucien Prival), uses the coach-inspired pronunciation that spoke so early. The less you talk about others, the better. <br /> <br /> It is a mystery that Lugosi took part in independent quarries at this stage of his career because he was a universal service at that time. Maybe it was because in that case he came to play the hero and the girl who knows. As his career began to decline in the late 1930s, such a price would become an exception to Lugos. <br /> <br />
