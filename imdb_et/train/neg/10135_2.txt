I watched this movie on Starz. Let me go through some of the things I thought I could have improved; operation, writing, management, special effects, camera team, sound and lighting. It also seemed that the writers had no idea what the film was about. Obviously, in 2007, when the dollar was stronger, it could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for $ 75 million. Now-days these things cost about $ 3 billion and they can't go invisible. You can probably fly from the US to the Middle East within an hour. There was a totally casual lesbian scene that I didn't mind, but it seemed a lame attempt to get more men to see it. The camera would increase random participants and skip random scenes. Oh yes, because his Steven Segal movie is predictable to hell. All in all, I got it right there at Snakes on the Plane.
