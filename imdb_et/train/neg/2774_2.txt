It's just a bad movie. What seemed like a pretty nice budget, he had a much better chance. It was almost. What a heroine is beautiful almost like Salma Hayek, a hero who fights almost like Jackie Chan, battles and duel almost like Crouching Tiger ..., music almost like, for example, Conan ... etc. Almost. Ultimately, it's just boring and it's hard to find something interesting. Perhaps besides John Rhys-Davies, who is driving in a duel like Hero warriors or the Crouching Tiger mentioned earlier ... I am ashamed of old poverty. She's a pretty good actor and deserves a lot better. Just like you - so if you still have the opportunity to look at something else.
