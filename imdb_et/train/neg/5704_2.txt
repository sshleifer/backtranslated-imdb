After reading some good comments about this movie, I thought it was time to go and see it. Well I don't know why I was bothered. Basically, this family is entrusted with a hint that will bring about the great size of an ancient treasure hidden by the Templar knights in the War of Independence. Obviously, it had to be kept away from the British at all costs. First, why did Knights tell the treasures of Europe to America? How did Nic Cages say that Charlotte was actually a ship? How do they think of all the hints and puzzles in about a minute? And how could two people suddenly get captained and stolen, which is probably the world's best-guarded paper? These are just a few plot holes in this unpleasant Hollywood action. Cage has been in some great movie - "Face-Off" and "The Rock" - so why did she get herself off? Is he getting too old?! His character is quite annoying - somehow, this "normal" man steals the Declaration of Independence, the thieves crosses with weapons, flees from the FBI and seems generally invincible. The whole movie doesn't really make sense and all this was quite disappointing.
