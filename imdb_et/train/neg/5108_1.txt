I can't help but laugh with people who praise this exhibition as heart-warming and tearful. For one, it is totally unrealistic for these people to have a perfect life after their new home. <br /> <br /> How can these families afford these new mega-houses? And how about their poor neighbors? Real estate taxes will surely happen after that. Plus, the noise disturbs me. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how big is the change in reality TV shows? This is practically the same repetitive junk a week after a week. We introduce the injured family, they renovate the home, then surprise the family and all the bursting Kleenex boxes. <br /> <br /> Not to mention how difficult the renovation part is. The only interesting part of the exhibition is to see what the house looks like, but even this segment is destroyed by fake fraudsters and continuous robbery. <br /> <br /> "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is an exhibition that pretends to be cordial, but it falls. Leave it out. If you like reality television, "Survivor" is much better and more mobile.
