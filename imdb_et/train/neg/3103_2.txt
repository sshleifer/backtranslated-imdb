So there is an old security guard and a man who dies and then KEVIN, the world's biggest wuss. Kevin wants to impress his incredibly unknown, bratty and virgin girlfriend AMY. When he returns from work ... to a casual house ... he finds his "friends", a sexually confused red short KYLE and a truly revolutionary DAPHNE. They are soon joined by Daphne's boyfriend, a trigger-happy sex-crazy macho lunkhead NICK. And there are head creatures, terrible little dogs that kill people, giving them a heart's desire. Kyle's heart wants to fast with a spandex creepy, happy woman. The desire of Nick's heart is to throw grenades at a college caf√© - I mean a nightclub. Kevin's heart's desire is to beat the skinny thug by using dolls. Amy's heart's desire is to be a nasty bitch. Daphne is already a nasty bitch so she doesn't have a heart's desire. Along the way, a truly disgusting band sings a truly odd song. Hobgoblins go back to where they came from, and then blow. "Citizen Kane" doesn't get a clamp for this real American cinema masterpiece.
