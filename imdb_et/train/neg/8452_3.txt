This is the first time I've commented on a movie because I felt that when the right person reads it, they can wake up and do something. In recent months, ABC Family has begun to incite a new film format. I've seen the last three and enjoyed them. They did and did the trick. My wife loves these movies. I was waiting for "View Jane Date". Trailers saw and sounded good. Unfortunately, this is a film where the book must be light years before the writers and music projects are involved in the project. The year is 2003, the source (all bad), the score was as interesting as the department store lift. It was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the film. It worked against it. I work in film and television business. I like entertainment. This is one case where I thought it might get worse. The script lines were still ten years old and I know these women can act, but you don't know the movie. To add a general experience, I finally shook my head. Tips for Disney, ABC, ABC Family and Producer Leaders: Never ask the composer or music director to make a future movie. They have lost their touch and they need to understand what the word "modern", "modern" and "current" mean in describing romantic comedy. There's a world that takes you along. All in all, the people of the Von Zernecki-Sertner and ABC family are very disappointed.
