As a random listener of the Rolling Stones, I thought it might be interesting. Not so, because this movie is very "age" in the 1960s. For me (someone who was born in the 1980s), it looks like a hypipuristic propaganda mess, but I'm sure this film wasn't made for me, but active people in the 1960s. I was expecting the drugs to be very rich with Stones, I was disappointed, it actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, so much I felt like I had worked with them to get to the end of this pious movie. I have not seen any other director, but I suspect that they follow a similar style of leadership, a kind of "amatuer", that felt like the TV show Eurotrash, which is poorly targeted, cleverly assembled and lacks real entertainment. My only good opinion about this is that I don't waste that money, it came free with Sunday paper.
