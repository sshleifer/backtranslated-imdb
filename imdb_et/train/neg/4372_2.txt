I love Don Knotts, just let me say it's ahead! He is a tremendous talent and the best he does, which is a nervous, lovingly lost loser thrown into power. She's a fabulous group like Roy Fleming, a reluctant astronaut, but the movie is pretty boring, though my brother is a child and I'm happy to watch it and her other movies. It's still worth watching, but in fact it's the movie that the kids enjoy best. I classify it as 100% family-friendly and something that you could sit back and watch with your children on a family evening. <br /> <br /> As with all Knotts films, the great beloved character is an actor and you can't help but smile when Knotts gives one of your shameful, oral cues, no matter how old and tired you are. <br /> <br /> From an adult perspective, one thing I think is great about this movie is how he captures NASA in the 1960s - all new modern buildings, hope, optimism, the future! And I was surprised how fun and ridiculous Leslie Neilsen was then. The only complaint about the story is Roy's interest in love, a pretty damp, unlikely woman who can't give her a time until she gets a big blow - if you're like me, you hope she'll give her a final ride at the end. Be careful - you miss a day after viewing a theme injury, it's memorable.
