... let me read the ways. <br /> <br /> 1. Only titled "remake" that draws out every clich√© in the Slasher Handbook. <br /> <br /> 2. The plot is so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3. Complete weak performance for all temporary or exciting tests. <br /> <br /> 4. A PG-13 rating that provides gore, violence, or sex. <br /> <br /> 5. A villain who is not scary or even mysterious. <br /> <br /> 6. Natural signs that are so thinly written and stereotypical that we couldn't take care of them. <br /> <br /> 7. The absence of an effective creepy atmosphere (much different from the original Prom Night). <br /> <br /> 8. A dialog script that goes beyond the poor - it's meaningless. <br /> <br /> 9. A series of cardboard performances (not sure whether to blame the actors or the above script). <br /> <br /> 10. A completely unfair teenage remake that is not bold enough to try imagination - or even show a blood gap. <br /> <br /> This is a no-brainer horror fans, saving your money. /> <br /> BOMB field ****
