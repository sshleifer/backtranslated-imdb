(I will show in this review the point where spoilers start.) My dissatisfaction is divided into: 30% tone-deafness, 70% writing. <br /> <br /> 30%: I agree with the first comment summary on the lack of diversity of songs. I was surprised at how this film, at best, badly changes the actual NYC by presenting a set of people and relationships so narrow that it would fit as if it were inhabited only by Gossip Girl (from someone who likes Gossip) Girl ). Some minorities have been written in the story, but they are mandatory, while we see the gears under the film so clearly, trying to be "diverse", but they are getting so short. <br /> <br /> 70% is why everything isn't enough. All the characters, white plus some symbolic minorities, are one-dimensional, cardboard cutouts of the human concept. Worse still, their interaction with each other is scripted so that for each vignette of each movie, the audience is treated with what I say is "gag": we get a basic idea, then a punchline that is meant to be a wise twist. But even if we stopped cynicism for a moment, saying, "Okay, that was a surprise" ... the stories are still not that interesting because they are also low. If the fashion story so that their existence depends only on the unexpected end, you write jokes. <br /> <br /> Spoilers below ... <br /> <br /> The movie is primarily about romantic stories. That's fine. But romance is amazing, deep, sometimes difficult. Each of these "romantic" stories has a girl and a boy who at some point have the same location and look at each other. The exchange of words, thoughts are projected through the voice, but they also succeed in listening to the audience that one person is interested in another. <br /> <br /> Meaning, no seduction (in the broadest sense), no tension, no confrontation or coexistence between the will of two different people who try to match their existence. The only story that encompasses superficial "seduction" is precisely the fact that the audience is surprised that the boy (Ethan Hawke) is the girl he has hit, who suddenly turns out to be a whore. Of course, his words, when they catch him, are interesting to hear and we are amused if we were if we were next to them, but there is nothing outside of A and B. So it opens when a postcard is similar to all other stories: A then B - that's the only point is that they happen to be "set" in Manhattan. By the way, the only Brooklyn we see is the Coney Iceland sketch; the only Queens is the flashing of the train running by a person traveling to West Village. <br /> <br /> It's easy to choose between movies that play between racial, gender, sexual orientation, and common stereotypes. so on. However, New York, I Love You, deserves a stricter check because of its title. We look forward to seeing a true New York and a true New York Master, but we've gotten into the demographic section we've chosen, its characters flying from the OC, and some others to make it SEEM as we would have paid attention to diversity. But if we go closer to who these characters are, then the whole stigma will turn into diversity and ethnic groups and cultures that the film is not shamefully representing. <br /> <br /> For example, a Latino man with a little white girl in a park that is mistaken for two women as his manny (a male sitter) when he is actually a father. Regardless of the last scene of this part, from a dramatic-constructional point of view, it was not necessary (it would have been much more interesting to stop when the mother and the boy / stepfather cut off the girl), frankly, a little disgusting to the scene where we are sure that the girl's father is Latino ALSO must tell us that he is a sexually desirable dancer. What, father can't be just a man from South America? Now, if he's obviously hot, is it better for the audience to accept having a child with a middle-class white woman? Are we so naive to ask for it? As if the Mexican construction worker would probably be too unpleasant. <br /> <br /> It's not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone. But in all conceivable constructions and plots of land, the direction cries to the current situation, turning to safety. All of these stories could have been made more interesting, even if we were forced to keep one-dimensional characters from them, at least not by choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes. An Asian girl living in Chinatown is a gentle old white boy? Getting Asian cougar strives for a white college boy. Again, I am not saying that the whole mind must be changed. It's just that. fucking. story. is so hackneyed - and so they can't pass on anything outside of New York. A real way to improve your movie would be to write a script worth reading. <br /> <br /> I admire the soundtrack, the good pace of the movie (even when it was a stamp, well, dredge) and the general feeling of many scenes. The movie was just good to sit on, and I didn't want anyone to do it. However, it says that the most important tribute to non-superficiality is when the old opera song says (parafrased) "This is what I love about New York: every other place." Well, you don't know about it.
