This movie is just bad. Weak story, weak leadership and below average. What was very irritating to me was an obvious advertisement - constantly - known to an internet service provider. It is obvious that some scenes are written just for the purpose of advertising. This movie is the face of anyone who paid for it. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it, it's not worth your time.
