This movie was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> I think the critics are the opposite. It is not that the material is not at the level of the participants; here, the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) have just reached the level of material. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were all as big as Davis and Cagney and saw how it happened overnight - all the time classic. According to a very similar story, Davis proves that he has no comedy talents (it is good for him that it is almost the only comedy he ever tried)! Cagney, who was a great comedy actor, seemed not to sync with his defendant Davis. The script offers some decent features and gags, but the delivery seems to be a better drama than comedy. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the soundtrack that, like Davis and Cagney, seems like a lighter drama than comedy. <br /> <br /> Jack Carson, who played similar roles throughout his career, has handled much more in similar material. In a rather typical supporting role, Eugene Palette gives a respectable result. In a slightly different role, like the old western remnant, Harry Davenport, is very good. But one of his poorest performances is William Frawley's rather irritating. The constant reference of his character to fictitious policemen is a bad effort in irony. <br /> <br /> I love every one of these performers and it is a shame that if the ensemble no longer achieves chemistry or better results than Bride Came.
