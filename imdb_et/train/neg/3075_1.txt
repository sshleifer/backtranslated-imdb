Yeah ... it's definitely where MSTifyed is the worst, but I've definitely seen it worse. Think of Gremlin R. Well anyway, I met Rick Sloan in some of the science fiction conventions that he was amazingly lectured! It was one of those very small budget conventions where everything goes, everyone brought something in (if you wanted to see the mess, you should have seen what some friends and I brought). <br /> <br /> He seemed like a nice guy, he was very kind about his questions and comments about Hobgoblins and he even said I wouldn't take it seriously and said he loved MST3K! <br /> <br /> All in all, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think it was bad as Martian attacks. So I think I'll stand for this movie and give it to 5 and betray all my compatriots. Sorry, guys.
