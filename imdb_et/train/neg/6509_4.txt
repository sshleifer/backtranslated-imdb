Sean Bean is great as well as photography, locations and costumes. But the plot is somewhat confusing and the conclusion is flat. The plot has changed from Cornwell's novel, not from the right. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better than the one we watched. Sharpe was too narrowly demarcated here, unlike his literary alternative ego, who seems more intelligent and decisive, despite his fear of his new role as a promoted official. I really enjoyed a short scene where Sharpe was displaced by a "real" officer, and after a quick break and banging, the surprised and grazed officer was pushed back. It determines its later command of command as an officer. <br /> <br /> Rating: "4" is "10."
