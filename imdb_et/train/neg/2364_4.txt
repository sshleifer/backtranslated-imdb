"Freddy's Dead" did the smartest thing he'd done after the fifth movie's disappointment. It started from scratch. Of course, this "final" movie saga is silly, but at least it's the original. Some visuals are even a bit breathless. And the story of Freddy's child (Lisa Zane), who returns to the city against the evil father, is unique. It has a number of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Lezlie Deane) who basically see fools and migrating as a sheep ready for slaughter. It's one-sided, it's a magic trick, and finally it's nothing but silly, childish entertainment. <br /> <br />
