The worst film on earth. I don't even know where to start, but I hope I can save another person from punishing this movie. When it comes to acting and light, this film is similar to bad porn without sex. Participants are some of the worst I've ever seen, and they couldn't have been worse even when they tried to mock the movie completely. The film must have a record low budget, which I am sure it was almost wasted on the film cover. This movie has now become a joke with my friends and has become a standard for comparing other garbage films. I would like to point out that no other film will even be compared. I personally feel responsible for my friend and I watching this movie and I am surprised that he considers me my friend after the torture we've been through. Don't look at this movie!
