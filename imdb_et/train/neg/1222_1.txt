This is one seriously disturbed film. Even if the boys deserved what they got ....., the sadistic frightening executions were "a little" up. The only wolf that showed some conscience early was killed before it could provide some help to the sad plot. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, it seemed to have some promise of mediocre things, but it was just nice to keep the audience from feeling the wrong feelings before it came to pleasure. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have saved a movie for me was when Jack Nicholson jumped out of the bush and yelled, "and where's the batman?" Kim Basinger could have shouted. <br /> <br /> It would have been cool now!
