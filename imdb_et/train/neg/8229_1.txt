- Includes a spoiler for miners - <br /> <br /> I've seen a number of decent Indie horror movies like The Hamiltons, The Boys Love, Mandy Lane and Cabin Fever; unfortunately I felt that my eyes were not in this category. From the beginning of the movie to the end, it is troubled by an amateur actor resonating from a very bad script, God knows only why the writer (s) thought of dialogue as "Don't go there, don't go there to get you: if he kills you, kills you and kills you , you are dead "is the quality of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie shows very little character and, frankly, I couldn't care less about the pain and torture they were inflicted on because they are just a group of ditsy college girls who show almost no redemption qualities. All they do is cry and joke throughout the film and if the girls do not cry out their claim; When they talk, the subjects are completely random: about sending boys or how one of the girls' males was recently incinerated (suitable items when you are beaten by a psychotic killer). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also a poor display of techno-music at the start and end credits (although hearing the end of credit music seemed to end in the sky). <br /> <br /> Camera work is terrible and from time to time makes the movie unobtrusive. I think that due to the lack of budget, the director was confined to just one digital camera that lives in the girls' car almost the whole movie. I think it was an effort to listen to the audience as close as possible: to feel and experience what the girls are going through. However, due to the very shaky camera, sharp picture and close action, it can be difficult to say what happens during the operations and what is simply chaotic. One thing is the subjective making of the film, but it is another to display an action that the audience cannot decipher due to poor cinematography. <br /> <br /> I understand that five eyes have a low budget. film, but it does not release the extremely poor quality. There are no redeeming factors for this movie: bad behavior, bad scripting, bad camera work and story. In the light of this, I decided to give the film to 10 out of 10 because it was very disappointing to me; wanted a meteor to land, giving me a sweet relief. After 94 minutes, foolish college girls are crying, arguing, deliberately working, and have unexpected inappropriate conversations. But many times you see how the girls get into their hands and throw in the car on the windshield.
