This movie has a class B inexpensive for its scenes, effects, etc., so you think they spent 80% of their budget on Connery. It's like watching some Wing Commander things after Star Wars (completely beyond the content). <br /> <br /> The story can be described in one word: FLAT. And my god, I can't remember such an interesting traitor long. We have not given the reason why he is both sad (innate defect, we lead thinking) and no real conviction or elegance for his indignation. <br /> <br /> If you are a "Hunting Forrester" rental outlet in Connery.
