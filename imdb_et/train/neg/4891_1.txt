I want to explain some things. I don't know Ming-liang Tsai movies and I'm familiar with the art cinema; I grow up in Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many other seventies. <br /> <br /> The art films were really ART; like colors. People did it to express their inner feelings, not really worried when other people understood something. They were beyond business values; just look at some old Antonion (or early Picasso) and you understand. <br /> <br /> Tian bian yi duo yun (The Wayward Cloud) has nothing to do with it. It's an opportunistic film designed to fool the festival's judges and critics, playing a lot of things without saying anything. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't make sense. Lack of water makes the government use hydrated watermelons. The man in despair steals water from the public bathroom toilet. There is also a beginning (neighbor) who is trying to make a movie with an actor he doesn't seem to know. There is a romantic awakening between a girl and a porn star. Confusion ends with the sexual scene (not pornographic) that many people feel shocked, but I believe it is less provocative than the American pie or the history of violence. <br /> <br /> There are never two main characters to talk about. Sometimes the musical number 60 appears and explains (through the song) what is happening in the characters. These video clips are really welcome because the previous scene, with no dialogue or music, but people watching each other, sometimes takes 4, 5 or even more minutes, which is too much for movie times. <br /> <br /> There are also a few bits "hard to love without sex", "porn industry selfish mind". <br /> <br /> It is obvious that this movie is meant to (go out) to fool festivals juries and critics. It has some pseudo-shocking scenes (within Taiwan's censorship) and many topics are open but nothing is done or going anywhere. <br /> <br /> These tricks were the important prices of film (disputed) at film festivals and made the movie a desperate commercial success (I see a movie in France and the theater was packed). <br /> <br /> But don't be fooled. There is nothing new or original in this film, or even originally stated or filmed. It's boring and empty; Really scam to the public. Boogie Nights (which I didn't really like), Intimacy and 9 Songs are much better films.
