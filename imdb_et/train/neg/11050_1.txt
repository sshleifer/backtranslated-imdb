Terrible use of scene cuts. All consistency is lost in either dreadful scripting or sleepiness. This evil robot ... was black jazz dancer? It is also one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard of (monologues usually drowned in music). And ... where did they get their props? This ship looks like milk packaging ... I made better special effects at 8 mm at age 13! <br /> <br /> I recommend that every film student should watch this flick (5 minutes at a time) so learn how not to film. Or ... was that the editorial fault? <br /> <br /> It's really too bad because the scenario was actually a good concept ... just badly done around the way. (Sorry Malcom. You should have sent a "stunt-double." You're too good an actor of such a stink bomb.)
