This movie was like "The Disney Channel After The Dark." Take out "are we not naughty" language and topics, and you are left in dialogue and drawing equipment that offends everyone's intelligence, who does not describe a high-quality TV. The dialogue was so ridiculously and deliberately dirty, one might think that the scenario was the result of locking Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhas in the room where every amalgam of any bad script was ordered, each of which was ever in hand. When it was Roger Kumble's intention, the mission was accomplished.
