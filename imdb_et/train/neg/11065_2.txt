This film had so many options. Anyone who followed the story of Jeffrey knows that there are so many details in this movie that it is ridiculous. The film spent too much time and effort on Dahmer's homosexual trends and his alcohol consumption. Where was the character formation? Any villain is always interesting and Dahmer was no exception. Where does the film deal with your adolescent when he started killing and distorting small animals? Instead, we are giving a glaring set of setbacks that try to explain the origin of the killer, but do not solve the main point of Dahmer's development. The reason why the country made this story so interesting was the details - how it kept the body of its apartment and its length and dimensions; his cannibalism and his desire for meat, etc. I could go on, but all in all, too many backward points in the movie, focusing on his sexuality and not enough gore - the good things you would see as the title movie "Dahmer".
