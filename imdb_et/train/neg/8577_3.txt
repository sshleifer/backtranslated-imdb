I knew my summary would give you. How this movie is for pet rock and disco! Well, if you didn't live through the 1970s or 80s, you probably don't understand why someone would want a new cake or have a pet (and, frankly, at least for Pet Rocks, I don't fully understand it). They are just a few things that seemed to make sense, but they really displaced the younger generation. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and his band. At that time (mostly in the 1940s) they were very popular and had enough power to play in the studio with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugos and Peter Lorre. But if you did not live at that time (it was before my time), then you do not know why someone liked such "entertainment". After all, Kyser and his band's companions are incredibly unpleasant and their humor is very, very wide (ie, frankly, I was not able to carry my antique and I don't understand that there were just too many musical numbers in the movie. The back seat and the fans of these actors are likely to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film includes a sniper and a band that comes to the mansion, where a young lady and her crazy aunt are there, and there is a strange event going on. Sally's life and sessions. It's all been laughing - and it's not really a fear film, despite the pain. <br /> <br /> In general, it is the best entertainment entertainment. As a fan of Lugos and Karloff, I felt I had to be disappointed to have to look at the Quiz and his knees.
