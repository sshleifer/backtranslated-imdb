I didn't enjoy this movie, Joshua at all. Perhaps this is because I saw another, much better, movie called Orphan 2 days ago, but maybe it's just because this movie wasn't very good. I'm going with the ladder. Of course, the plot of the evil child is not quite original, but that does not mean that the film does not succeed. It could have been tense and entertaining and chilling, but it was slow building, boring, uneventful and really didn't leave me thinking more than "it wasn't very good" when it was all over. <br /> <br Finally, Joshua's motivations appear. I will not give it away, but the reality is that he did not really achieve his goals because, despite Vera Farmig's mother, Abby, disappearing through the thirties, all arrows point to her return soon. He was devoted to the spiritual institution because he lost his mind, but then Joshua's father / his wife was accused of breaking his medicine, which tells the public that the institution realized that he was not really a mental ill but was treated medically. So ... shouldn't he come home soon? Hasn't Joshua failed? Does her mother live with her and her sister and maybe her father? I ask the Father because his future is over. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, I didn't care about characters. The evil spiritual child Joshua was not really scary. The story went slowly and when it got up, it was still boring. The thrill dropped every time. When it was over, I couldn't believe I had been through the whole thing. <br /> <br /> 4/10 just because the actor was particularly good at parents, especially Vera Farm as a mother, but if you want to see the movie about the evil “child”, see Orphan. Now this is a film that took the unigenous concept and created a great movie.
