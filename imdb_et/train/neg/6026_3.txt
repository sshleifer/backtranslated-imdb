* Review may include spoiler * <br /> <br /> predictable, combed, bad special effect. it has a TV movie feeling. According to the Bible, the idea of ​​the United Nations, which Satan has taken over, is an appealing end to the end of the world. the assumption is interesting, but its excitement falls in a short time. if you want to make people like this for Christianity, at least make it good! I had seriously checked my watch watching this piece of dreck. can't say much more about this movie because i saw it over a year ago and there is not much to say about this movie .....
