It's interesting to me that so many reviewers consider it a masterpiece. In the case of quality films, I am not buggy, and I agree that the film has been awarded the prize in a technical perspective and from many depicted characters. But this film has no sense (for me) where it really is; I mean to look at the viewer everywhere. It is a series of mood scenes that may be remarkable, but I want more from the movie. I'm looking for a story and a movement and an arrival that no one found in this movie. Yes, it can be considered a film poetry. . . but there are many poems that I can't live for the same reason: that it paints pictures without going anywhere. <br /> <br /> One thing that needs to be said is that it records childhood from the middle of the century, which is necessarily limited to its universality. I was personally terrible about what a young British boy had to live through this time and place. Having grown up in America only ten years earlier, I can say with authority that the contrast is enormous. I can't think of whether this contrast affects the film so beneficial. In other words, can there be a tendency to fully appreciate the film from its "film magic" (which I admit it is) and completely ignore its absence with regard to the nature of its actual reminiscent experience?
