This movie deserves another bad overview. Think of one of the reviewers for the virtues of the film, "some kind of sex, violence or gore". Excuse me. The very structure of the film is that we look at how Cody's young companion, with love for life and who has everything to live, is blown into bits that leave Cody's inanimate, bloody body. And given the nature of the war, we know that Cody has seen fear every day. So many of those who watch this movie with rose-like roses are that the violence that defines Cody's personality is removed from the viewer's memory. <br /> <br /> Sans, all of their Cody families, like John Rambo, migrate to the country on their own bike to make a long trek in the hometown of the United States with a place called Nevada City. Not mentioned, don't understand that Cody is a damaged item. We know this because his CO practically proclaims him to tell Codale "to rest" from the death and destruction of war. This explains that no one seems to be attentive or caring, Cody's obvious "flat" effect. It's not bad action. This is a smooth effect of post-traumatic stress disorder. Don't think here, remember that his CO ordered him from the battlefield. <br /> <br /> How this "casual" kiss, as noted by another review. The fall was an accident, no kiss. How exactly did Cody "respect" faith, knowing the full extent of what he was told? Now it was not a valuable moment for the family. The moment that is reported to the immediate universe as posted on YouTube. Of course, the loss of faith, as well as Cody's "return" to a woman who is going to marry, get in the spirit of Xmas, all CHEERING their frustrated hearts and lips. <br /> <br /> We know a little about the groom of faith, except that he knows his love for him, he will accept his proposal for no longer than nano seconds (could have expected some other thought), he is generous, he loves him to death, the family has nothing against him, he believes that marriage is based on compromises and two have never discussed marriage plans. No evil doers here. <br /> <br /> Asner is a beautiful actor who is handed over to a mountain-based dialogue like "we love you son ...." "You're part of our family" literally after they've met a stranger named Cody . And "the brother's speech band, where the phrase was first ever meant, is not meant to be a battlefield for virtual strangers. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: this movie is a cotton candy Xmas fluff that despises itself. Respecting the family, as we know it, is the acceptance of a virtual stranger as a full-fledged family member because we all love you, how many of you have done this or know someone who is did it.
