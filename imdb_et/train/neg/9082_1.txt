This is the worst film I've ever seen. I was deceived to think it might be good because there are a couple of my favorite characters. Now I want to face Jason Schwartzman for this role. After watching the movie, I was physically ill. I don't sometimes understand Hollywood. There are so many people who are trying to break that I'm sure you can cut off and get the best. So the worst thing about the movie you are doing is to use Ferris Beullar instead of the same mud. The humorlessness of the film was added to the hair cam and hairy jeans. It's nice to have this movie and I watched it on TV. This proves that you should avoid the January release at all costs.
