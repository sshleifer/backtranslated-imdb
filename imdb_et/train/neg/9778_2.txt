I'm sure operations at Dames were a favorite back and forth back. There is nothing on the plot that you might miss if you were otherwise busy. And if you need a mood for other activities, then you have some curves on the screen to make you feel. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, there are not many operations that Dames has done. It is set for the Korean War, where the group of geographical indications, along with British Tommy, goes a little too far and must return to the UN lines. Already bad enough, but these men also experience stubborn USO girls in the same situation and their choreographer. <br /> <br /> You know what the sad thing about this movie is that the generations of women finally accepted the army and combat situations. These universal bimbos make the release of women light for years. In fact, even a hard-bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant of their men is keeping it in his pants. <br /> <br /> But it was probably better to remember what they were for while driving. This name is not better for me if I do not recognize any of them for any individual effort. <br /> <br /> Dames is definitely a team flop.
