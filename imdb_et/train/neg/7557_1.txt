This movie was terrible. OK, my favorite movie is "The Wicker Man" (1973), so I was always a little biased. <br /> <br /> A piece of rambles along, throwing enough of the basic elements of the original to make the concept of "remake" very dubious. (She's not a virgin, she's allergic to bees. WOW!) So many things happen that don't make sense and are inexplicable, which I'm afraid Mr LaBute is not a horror movie. (How are the two people we clearly lived in the beginning and well respected at the end of the movie?) Cage sees haggard and puzzled, and his character is prone to call "Rowan!?" the smallest noise. The original notes are irritating because they come from sticky rather than intelligent tributes. For example, certain incidents reflect the original (a girl who falls outside the locker who pretends to be dead when looking for Woodward / Cage on the island) and several lines of dialogue are directly from Anthony Schaffers' original scenario and rubber band. <br /> <br /> I am sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this, I can't write more about this movie. It has no substance at all. Throw it on all the other remakes that have broken the good names of the films that were the "basis" (in this case very loose).
