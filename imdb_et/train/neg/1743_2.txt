Unlike its title, this film does not offer a spice, and so the audience gets a tasteless dish. All humor seems to be forced, theatrical, mechanical, staged, recalling the Pakistani games available on video, including motives. Everyone shouts, screams, and does strange things for no reason. The assumption is interesting because it is a straight lift from Hollywood's "Boeing Boeing". John Abraham, who is so natural in almost all of his films, is a totally wrong mistake here. Kumar and Paresh Rawal, two experienced stalwarts trying to make the film truly natural, but in vain, at least three girls' characters should be contrasted to bring interesting elements, but unfortunately all of these seem to be meaningless indigenous bimbets (3B) who speak, behave and even screaming in a rather similar way. The main hole in the northern part is what made the protagonist to keep the three girls in the same home, pretending they could never know each other? Sex could make hundreds of other ways, so there are not so many dramas for any reason easily visible, but definitely great meat and tempting promos always such movies are a great start. Now, to those who call it a real comedy, I call it a pathetic taste. The sense of humor of such a cinema audience is definitely spoiled and demented to the extent that they combine sadistic, strange and crazy humor, where they do not mean, but rather their own and their own laughter. The disappointments that see how useless we are to laugh we have to wear such things?
