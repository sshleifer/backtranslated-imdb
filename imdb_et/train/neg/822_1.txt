The parts of this movie are really two. First of all, there is a ridiculous movie movie that is so hysterical and cornball that it almost seems that "Simpson" Troy McClure should weave it. <br /> <br /> Then the rest of the movie begins (starting with a title song that doesn't really fit the rest of the movie), which is technically OK, but kills with vague, inconsistent and convincing graphics, not just uninteresting characters, but characters that don't make sense . This is especially the case with Mickey Rooney Spiventa, who was constantly on the plot and part of the organization, but what would have happened if Hackman had made a seemingly arbitrary decision to take her along when to break it? In that case, he would have been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character, which is ultimately still. <br /> <br /> The general problem with the movie is that it is completely undesirable to give details about who or what is behind this conspiracy. The filmmakers would not have the courage to point out that a certain level of society would be able to create such an organization and instead agreed to hope that the lack of explanation was sufficient and that the audience should form their own conclusions. br /> <br /> Simply put, the movie doesn't work at all levels.
