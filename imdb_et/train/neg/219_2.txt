it can be a good movie if it had looked at the surface of an interesting rather than just lesbian relationship in the sense of the film, it is quite predictable, not to mention that two girls resemble a Russian group. ..security? I do not belive. There is nothing original in this movie to support it so they should have used something that is already known. Other participants ... well, I just don't know what their role should be. Most of them are well-known people in Romania and I must mention that some of them are not even actors (egMihaela Radulescu). language to shock let = love sick .... too bad ... the idea was good though ... and I'm serious about commenting on the title ...
