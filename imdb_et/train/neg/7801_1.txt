I will keep it in the shortest possible time because this piece of piece deserves to be mentioned. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst films ever made - from there to Schnaas' other horrible zombie records - ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3). These films suck so bad that anyone involved in their creation must be defeated. I had somehow managed (barely ...) to sit through ZOMBIE DOOM - but ZOMBIE 90 is so terribly intuitive - even compared to Schnaas' other terrible movies - that I had to move forward in just 10 minutes. ZERO's working skills, uneven gore, terrible camcorder-style camera work, ridiculous copying ... it continues and continues. I really can't find one thing that would redeem this garbage - and I usually find SOMETHING redeeming in almost every movie. This is really one of the worst films ever made - you have been warned ... 1/10
