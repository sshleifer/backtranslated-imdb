I have tried to look at this example several times, but at the exhibition "This 70's exhibitions" I can't find a couple of hairstyles and an accidental reference to a discotheque, which is actually seventies - decades. where I grew up. Of the episodes I've seen, most plots and jokes can be set at any time period. Remove the (alleged) novelty and show set in the 70s is not interesting or funny. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an exhibition that is more successful in representing young people in America in the 1970s, my humble opinion cannot do anything better than "The Wonder Years".
