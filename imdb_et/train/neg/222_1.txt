As a 40-year-old woman, I found this extremely offensive and humiliating woman over 40 years old, not to mention any other women of all ages. The man was sad, pathetic attempt to write and direct the "chick flick", and it failed. Andy McDowell is not a lot of actors at first, but given that there is no "plot" (I even hate to call it a plot), he had no chance. There was no character formation, no reason to feel sympathy / empathy with any character, nor did it try to make the film realistic or credible in any way. And then there is an obligatory straight female obligatory male fantasy that decides to suddenly try lesbiology - PLEASE. <br /> <br /> Not only do I want to get my money back for a DVD rental, and I want them to be 112 minutes back from my life. With ripoff.
