Arg. Repeated dinosaurs have come back to take the second bite of the terrifying third movie. This time, European terrorists (according to Irish) say an army convoy, which should transport uranium. They retract to the shipyard, open the truck and discover our old friends carnosaurs. Pandemonium comes when rubber dinosaurs are attacking terrorists, policemen and some naval soldiers. The whole movie seems to be (again) highly inspired by an alien (like Carnosaur 2) with the pathetic navies who passed the "claustrophobic" shipyard? weapons ready. This third opus is probably the driest and most unpleasant film in the lot, with only one bleeding when the rubber dino lashes with the head of the sea. Dinos are rigid, confusing creatures as usual and T-Rex sounds like a raging elephant when it roars (it also seems to have no eyes). One of the scariest scenes in the film is when the caps come to the scene: they enter the building where the hijacked truck is kept and hear some strange noise coming from another truck. It's a surprise when you open it! The rubber reptile bang shattered and eats them. Why were the dinosid locked on another truck after the first escape? How were they locked when the truck door can only be locked from the outside? What was the idea of ​​filming this scene ???? Oh barely who cares? Both thumbs are under the size of rubber for Iguanas.
