This is undoubtedly one of the worst films I've ever seen. This makes your TV movie run like Reservoir Dogs. Based on one and only Britney Spears and her mother's book, this is a trash bin that has no bar, with sensible performance from Virginia Madsen (I hope you pay well) to save it. The Red Neck Country Gill Story, which wins a prestigious music school scholarship, has little, but Mrs Spears trousers to drive music to the consumer and generally agree that the low eyebrow must be the way to go. There is nothing good here if all the shocks are as predictable as the next day. Never again.
