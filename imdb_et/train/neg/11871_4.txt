Gregory Peck's action was great, as one would have expected, and cinematography is quite stunning even when he played some melodramatic moments. But the rest of the movie was too much for me and was hard to see. I tried to like it, but I had to move forward quickly over the last thirty minutes. I feel like wasting a few hours. If Gregory Peck hadn't been, I wouldn't have been fifteen minutes. 4/10.
