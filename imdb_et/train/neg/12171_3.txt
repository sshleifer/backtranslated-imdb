Being a sloher movie aficionado, I usually settle down to watch every slash that moves over my retina, which sometimes causes more damage to my brain than I say. When the channel was skied the second night, Sleepaway Camp II happened to me. Of course, I wanted to check it, as I had heard from the Sleepaway Camp franchise, but never seen them (shame, I know). I note that since I have not seen the original, my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously, because perhaps what I think is wrong is completely deliberate because of the franchise's own design. <br /> <br /> Now I'm assuming the Sleepaway Camp franchise is a joke itself. Hell, even the name comes out like a deliberate joke. Sleep away from the camp? It's good fun. I appreciate the movie for just wanting to put something on the horror of a clean camp, but it's as far as possible. The creator of this film made the original Friday casting, 13. Campy requires bad action, but come on. Pamela Springsteen, as an evil reality killer, did a better job of killing her interests when she killed the whole cast. As for comedy, it was a few times when I smiled, but it was a little and far away. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, SAC II is pretty boring and I really want to sleep in the camp. Deaths are so obviously staged and fake to barely assess them. If you are looking for a good camp comedy movie, I recommend Dreadi. If your channel surfing takes you over it, check and see what else is.
