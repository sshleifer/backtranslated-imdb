There are fans in this respectful production. But for paraphrasing the classic bad view of "Mary Reilly", Moby Dick is like a painting that is slower. <br /> <br /> This is because the philosophical reasons for the "production" of the film are never a big movie Instead of replacing the lack of strong thought (in this case, the transfer of books to film) with the hopelessly sprayed, undynamic, but dazzling ideas viewers think they have seen the size. As viewers and critics are suitable for this, the Oscars who feed the entire stupid equation follow. <br /> <br /> I don't share the joy that all these reviewers found. Moby Dick is stunningly gripping. Actors conscientiously announce essays on Jonah, Moby Dick, Ocean, Moby Dick, Moby Dick, all things that can't respond, and none of which diminishes. It is sharply inert. It doesn't build. In a narrative sense, Moby Dick (as a film) is a bit more than an unsuccessful conclusion when searching for a real story. After half an hour I felt "Oh terrible ... another oath ... another 4 minutes soliloquy!" Here's a lot of gray hair. Starbuck should be a golden god. (!) <br /> <br /> One person knows that he is looking at a great director when he makes his middle, not trying to repeat the feelings of someone else's paintings and palettes, or respecting classical praise, as Huston does. Paintings and books are nice, but they are different media. Such a film cannot understand that honestly enjoyable jamaos (village of Damned) is better in most respects than an effortless culture. This is the film making school of Eat Your Vegetables. <br /> <br /> One will appreciate the work that has to be done to make the film, but not the narrative. Only a few segments that reflect marine research are interesting; storing shanites for structuring work and various marine works; and whaling technology. And it doesn't require a two plus hour movie.
