Since the little mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies, I was little, I was curious about this stage. <br /> <br /> A small mermaid (one) is a classic animated feature that is a top-notch, great music score and targets the general audience. Conversely, a small mermaid 2 is primarily aimed at young children because it is spontaneous, reflects the child's own perspective, the music is bolder and less dramatic, and the end is a feeling of dredging. <br /> <br /> Little Mermaid 2 begins when the baby Melody is on the Ariel family. Suddenly, without a visual tip, the giant tentacle grabs to support drama. I laughed, wait one minute, it's not funny, the baby is attacked! Okay, I'll stop laughing. Morgana's crime due to the wide range of daylight and his spontaneity takes away potential drama because it happened so quickly. This quality of Melody's character is clearly outlined when he fights with Morgan without seeing his fear. <br /> <br /> Like the first film, Melodial has many Ariel problems except the opposite. Queen Ariel is like her father, limiting her from the ocean, King King Triton besieged Ariel. Ariel and Melody are both rebelling against their parents. <br /> <br /> Music moves first emotionally. There are a lot of songs, but not so many orchestral works. This is great for the little ones because it doesn't impress the orchestra. <br /> <br /> The end of the first movie was strong and uplifting. The bouncing song and all who play in the water will end. This is definitely more targeted at children, because instead of finishing to celebrate you and leaving you, this ending leaves you wondering: "It's time to deepen!" Ultimately, this movie is fun for the kids, so we should let them have fun.
