I watched this movie and hoped that something would improve all the time. What is an unknown man with no emotions? * yawn * <br /> <br /> You never see Alex show emotions to anyone other than his son. Yes, I know this is the reason why his son is the only one who makes him lose his mood (if you call it), I get it. <br /> <br /> Characters are undeveloped, relationships are not enough time to understand. In one scene, Sarah says they don't love, and next time we see her, she tells her how her death really awakened her because they were so close? There are plenty of logical synapses in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's like someone who looked at Boogie Nights and wrote this part to imitate Little Bill. Even the scene in which he "loses his mood" is the same as Little Bill puts his wife under the facial expression (or lack of it). Yes, William H. Macy is good at depicting a man without emotion, having been there to do that - can you say Magnolia? <br /> <br /> This film did not only touch emotions, it lacked content, a good script, developed characters and a plot. And it certainly has no suggestion for me. :) <br /> <br /> ~ ~
