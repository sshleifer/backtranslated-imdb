The next time you are at the party and someone asks: "The second day I heard the word" Author. "Does anyone know what that means?" Tell them to sit on the water. The only way Diaz could survive this film was through the literary device commonly used by bad writers. There are some comics and you have some laughs. But the film is not inclined to the least logical analysis. Why is Keitel Diam's hand tied up in front of her, not down? Why can he do that with a chainsaw, of course. For me, the best part of this movie was that I saw it on cable TV instead of spending four bucks in a video store.
