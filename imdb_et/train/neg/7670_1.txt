Well, where do I start my story? I was in a movie today with some friends who didn't know more than the actors involved, and that was supposed to be a movie. what was the bad decision to see this movie? Plot was a mess, and so was the script. These lines were terrible so that people in the audience smiled hysterically. <br /> <br /> The cast could not be more plastic. Even some scenes seemed to have been much quicker ... as they pulled out for no special reason. Very poor editing. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was a waste of time and money. Boo.
