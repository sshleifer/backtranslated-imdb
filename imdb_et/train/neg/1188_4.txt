Kurosawa really blew it. Any genius is allowed to fail. The concept is good, but the exercise is badly cloudy. <br /> <br /> This movie has fantasy air that makes it an artistic film. Tokyo poverty deserves a fairer and more realistic depiction. Many of them have interesting stories to tell. Very disappointing movie.
