I don't understand why people praised this garbage. Her false, stupid, unrealistic, terrible and almost everything else. The film is a view of life, racial questions, prejudices and all the other issues that strangely continue at the College. This is where it fails. It has no orders for reality. In many questionable non-sense scenes in the movie, for example, <br /> <br /> A black man who casts a white man with a gun, a black man and stopped the security guards in handcuffs and carried out when the gun runs right into the past. <br /> <br /> The same white man who slips people over the roof theme that has been stopped and beaten by the same black person is stopped and given Rodney King-style beating when the gun man runs free while the moment one of the four of the guards ran back, it was once. <br /> <br /> As one previous reviewer noted, several white 230 lbs men were beaten by several black men who weighed about 160 pounds, including 105 pounds a. Rhymes <br /> <br /> Another critical mistake in the movie is the low uninteresting main characters. Frightened and confused about the white man and the middle, angry and yet justified (?) Black people. It is almost as offensive to both black and white people. I'm a white man and I know a lot of black and spanish who agree that this movie is wrong to portray characters and give them these qualities only because of their competition. <br /> <br /> The story I'll explain now is about three characters. One black athlete, another confused frightened white girl who doubts her sexuality, and the third is a white man who is also confused and scared, and blames her problems for the black people she gets in the movie later from the Nazis. They all have their own part of the problems and adventures, including sex, rape, fighting, love, hatred, prejudice, racial war and oh yes, don't forget about education. What all will end to kill a deadly fire. What after they return to their eternal life and think "white is bad". Does it sound like your college year? Didn't think so. I don't think the director attended college, especially when he made this terrible mess. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a very bad, bad and ugly movie. If you want to see more specific views or racial issues, see American History X. Just avoid this confusion.
