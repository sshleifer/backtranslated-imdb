I feel like a genius; I feel like I'm the only one who saw this fake film. I looked at it three times, with comments one time, and found myself distracting in all the close-ups, all the time the screen just blackened, and worst of all, I feel the film never solves anything. Yes, the priest dies, but he didn't seem calm with the city, giving him so much grief or himself. That and he was an idiot. If Peter Cowie hadn't commented on that, which explained not only the film, but the book from which it came, I would not have tasted it at all. I enjoy French movies, but it was completely absurd. <br /> <br /> County Mayor's Diary is filmed in beautiful black and white photography, but it alone does not save this deadly dazed ride. A scene after an extreme close-up scene where characters are not said before the camera cuts and turns black does not make an interesting or relevant story. How this film once became a classic is remarkable in mind: it reminds me more of the Emperor's new clothes. <br /> <br /> Yes, Claude Laydu's presentation is cordial and thoughtful when you are a sadist, but this movie was left I feel empty because it is generally a weak impression of the Catholic priesthood, an outrageous and frightening corruption agency. The pride of the young priest's victory over the countess is a weak scene, but 90% of the film draws you into the evil introspection and window with the young priest's melancholic thought. This priest does not get so modest as he is simply pathetic. <br /> <br /> As I don't speak French or don't understand it, I expected the SUBTITLE thing to help me understand the film. Well, English SUBTITLE is sometimes impossible to view / read and the text rolls so fast that a lot could not be read (and I am not a very slow reader - I finished Dostoevsky in 3 days). <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie. I will try everything from the "selected" set of criteria, but I can not understand why this in many ways deserves some kind of critical cold. But I was sitting for the longing for this two-hour movie to feel a sort of empathy for the protagonist and never changed. He seemed to be a victim rather than a fighter. And about that, I'm saying it has escaped.
