When I finally had the chance to watch 2 Japanese DVDs in the Zombie 3 (Zombie Flesheaters 2 Europe) import area, I blew the fun of this zombie couple. The transfer is almost strange, as good as ever before, when Anchor Bay doesn't hold it. Gore truly looks like it should and you really appreciate the great makeup and gore fx. Sound is also terrible.It is only 2 channel dolby, but if you have a Dolby Prologic 2 receiver, you can really appreciate cheese music (actually very good score) and effective, though cheap sound effects. It never heard so well, and great transmission increases overall enjoyment. <br /> <br /> I've never understood how much blood is flowing in this movie, it's extremely brutal with exploding headlines, explosive shock-filled mega pimples, zombies throat slit, woman's flared edges (how does this man burn off too) ), gut munching, zombie babies and much more i lost the journey. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly a hardcore zombie action for fans, especially Italian. There are some great equipment and cinematography, I think people don't give him enough credit if you see pure print and not some terrible pirate copies, it's a completely different experience. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't let you go the second time, and I realize it's inconsistent, duplicating, the actor is rigid, and it's highly marked, but it's part of that charm. <br /> <br /> For me, this is one of the best horror movies you've never done. movie it bad, so good for purpose.It is a random genius in the highest order.If they played it laugh would have been a disaster, but they played it directly as an arrow and the result is a terrible cult classic that thumbs it to the nose of each conventional movement standard. <br /> <br /> Sequence sequences, exotic places, great set, good, sometimes green cinematography, admirable and inconsistent, but still interesting plots, big makeup effects, beautiful women who can hit the butt, great music and sometimes fun, sometimes horrible but always entertaining zombies. he has everything, the cult class that stands in the test of time.
