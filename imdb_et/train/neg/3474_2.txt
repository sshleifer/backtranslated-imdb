This thing is terrible. Ben Affleck's character is self-centered and gleefically sadistic - punch-you-in-nose fratboy sadistic. And she's a romantic HERO! Being in his comic does not change from beginning to end, but his money allows him to finally buy happiness. <br /> <br /> If I were a socialist, I would level up unbelievably, but I'm not a socialist. br /> <br /> We capitalists like uncommon little Christmas elves. It's not magic. I don't know what that is. It's just terrible. And this is a waste of talented talents. O'Hara has been hysterically laughing since the late 1970s. Gandolfini. Applegate. These people were all underestimated. If Ben was out of the equation, these people would have dreamed something very good.
