Ron Howard led it? The 1966 cartoon is charming, teaching children a simple lesson with a simple plot. In this film, Howard gives us Whoville, full of greedy, manipulative, selfish Whose. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault; I imagine that the script required the most imaginative person so that Carrey turned Tom Green and the result was the magic of the film. Like Danny Devito's penguin on Batman's return, Carrey Grinch is so unlikely that any comedy that could be mined from his character just evaporates. When the 1966 comic was Grinch, which we all can identify, Carrey Grinch is the angry, breathless old man we've all seen at one time or another, sitting in a parked car that thundered to himself or attacked by his sugar cane in a toddler supermarket. This Grinch is extinctly lost from all humanity, humor or understanding, and his redemption at the end of the film speaks of lies. The whole movie is wrong: there is a stupid Christmas lighting contest, an unsuccessful attempt to explain why Grinch is a child who digs his childhood, and an unclear secret about why some of them have such a weird lipstick and some of them are not. In contrast to the 1966 comic, I imagine that children would find this film tiring, irritating, and full of contradictory messages. Did we really need to see Slutty Smurf, named Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard filled his uninvited relatives. Throw in the fun of jokes, jokes, sex jokes and other obligatory humor of Carreyesque's low eyebrows, and you have a movie that is about as far back as the 1966 comic (or the book that inspired it) because George W. Bush is from a reasonable, clear idea. Thumbs down to this great fat turkey.
