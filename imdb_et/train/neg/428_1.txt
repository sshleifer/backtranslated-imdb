Wow, a movie about NYC politics, apparently written by someone who has never been in NYC. You know there is a problem when you wait for the credit at one point and the movie continues for half an hour. The characters are boring, John Cusack's accent is ridiculous, and the drawing lines are boring and ridiculous. A horrible movie.
