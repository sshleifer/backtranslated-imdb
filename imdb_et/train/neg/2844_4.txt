This is one of the worst movies on Clark Gable. Only PARNELL was probably worse. It's just so painfully cliched and the dialogue is so weak that it's not something Gable or Jean Harlow should have been proud of. <br /> <br /> Gable is a heel whose illegal activity results in his girl slammer (like a gangster talking?). He keeps the hope that he is doing the right thing, but he just leaves him there - neither of them is known, gosh, that he is "in the family". Finally, the rogue will return the right thing and they will link it all together to a happy ending! They seem to have forgotten that Gable has to take the oilseed rape and spend several years. Leonard Maltin says "the stars are the best here". Which standard? Is it best to make unintentional plaques? Hold the break! <br /> <br /> PS - After that my wife said Leonard Maltin was looking for me and hitting my butt. Hmmm. Despite my comment, I think Mr Maltin is the best reviewer and person on the planet (I hope he will soothe him). <br /> <br /> UPDATE - 2/2/08 Since I didn't want this movie for the first time (especially the ridiculous end), I decided to watch it again. After all, sometimes when I watch the movie again, I like it a lot more and realize that I was a little too harsh. Although this has been the case for several films in recent months, this movie still didn't like - even for the second time. Most of them were not the first half of the movie. In the first half, Harlow's character was amazingly stupid, but at least it was plausible. But when he was sent to jail, all the clich√©s were until the final ridiculous marriage. The bottom line is that this sequence is embarrassingly foolish - it makes no sense at all and is similar to making the film a somewhat crazy fairy tale, not a love story of two drawbacks. I stand by my initial review (despite all the "NO OPERATIONS") and I think that apart from PARNELL and possibly POLLY CIRCUS it may be the worst Gable film.
