Bad film is definitely sure. It is such a ridiculous fantasy that has many bad special effects, lots of hurrying scenes (like an airport) and a real sleepless time. (Charles Dance) is terrible as an evil guy and he is much better off (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) makes a non-comic joke and I heard that it was already drowned, a great time for success? !! I never understand why or how ?! In a TV interview I have heard (Eddie Murphy) herself when she was an Oscar 2007 candidate, she regretted it in a comical way! One of the comments said (Hey ... It's 1980s!). Well, my friend is not. It's a cinematic stupidity that made many RAZZIE movies over the years, be it in the 1980s or 1950s! <br /> <br /> There are two reasons why this movie was written. The first is that I will never forget (Charlotte Lewis) the exciting legs of long tanning, especially when she was in bed before the bad guys attack her house, wearing only a blue shirt and OH BOY, which was in her camera around her naked legs. it should be. But how weird! As I've been watching her in the following movies and she wasn't beautiful again! Anyway, another reason is that I recently found the title of this movie in the list of the worst 100 movies. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: bad film, Greeeeeat legs.
