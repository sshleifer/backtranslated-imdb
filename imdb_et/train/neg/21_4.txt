Madsen tried to act like a hard ass, but the script and direction did not allow him to do enough to make it more interesting or three-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Even the sound effects of the armed forces at the beginning of the movie sounded like the noise of bullet guns when they were fired. It was really weird and they didn't know the real weapons. The video game had better sound effects than this movie.

Dumb Movie. Poor Madsen.
