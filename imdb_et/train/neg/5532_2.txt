The Zombie Rebellion is not the worst film I've ever seen, but it's far from the list. When an expedition is sent to Cambodia to discover the trick of post-WWII zombie, one of the members decides to use the knowledge for their own evil ambitions. And he will succeed at least in the beginning. The Triangle of Love makes the story somewhat more difficult. <br /> <br /> It was a really annoying movie with terrible action that made it difficult to tell who the zombies were and who wasn't. The dialogue was a little better and the plot was incredible (not part of that zombie, but "romantic" parts). And although I'm not a student or cinematographic expert, the camera didn't seem to work much for the movie. <br /> <br /> Although I've seen some of the worst movies, it's not likely. someone. It's bad and NOT so bad that-it's-on-good-way.
