I see many people liking this movie. For me it was a movie written in 101 and a person failed in class. From Lindsey Price's time, a video artist will come to the end when the film was very predictable. I watched to see if it was going anywhere. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have a widowed young father. Cliché # 1 movies / TV always kill the mother's parent when the child is a girl, or the son of a boy, so that a single father can sweat his dead wife and feel completely from his element that takes care of the children. From my 3 sons to 2 1/2 fathers. These films are usually dramas and comedies are TV shows. <br /> <br /> Keyboard # 2 If a pushing woman has a video camera, she plays a big role in the film. It always has solutions or even if that person is a head. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 3 If a dangerous person is an alien, they must be of Latin origin. And they must be illegal. Obviously there are no legal Latino and illegal Europeans unless an IRA element is involved. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 4 This Latino must be highly educated in its home country. In this case he was a professor who made 200 euros a month. And the highly educated Latino mentioned now has to act as he has not put his head on his head and let the head hit the side. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 5 A crime that a person actually committed a crime but an accident. But since he has lost all that he had when he crossed the border, he is now acting like a foolish idiot, and now he has taken his daughter as dangerous, passing him from the frontier to the idiot. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 6 One never runs over a crime that comes from a crime, but a poor little cute boy. This is because the parents of the child have to play a large part of the film and because the child who accidentally killed the child may have ridiculous communication with the parents. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 7 is a movie where one policeman is not an angry vet and they become a partner. Even if they are killing detectives who must be the most experienced police officers of the police forces. Sev7n and Copy cat and Law and Order come to mind right away. And the vet, even if the outside has a golden heart. Cliché # 8 Let's go and finish some unemployed soap stars. Now I like Lindsey Price. But Susan Haskell IMO can't get out of a paper bag and if she uses one life to live, Marty always threw her away when she opened her mouth. She uses me sick. He may now be better attached to the land, but he still cannot act. <br /> <br /> The film could have been more understandable if it wasn't full of clichés. I don't think the film has to be expensive or good for the brain. But it was just bad. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER **** Now I'm not breaking the end. Oh heck, because I feel it is humanity's inability to let people waste time because they never get back to watching this movie. This includes Cliché # 6 and # 7. If a person has never seen a movie before it came to see what came out. Finally, the father even makes a prison sentence in the police and becomes an angry veteran who is suddenly very upset. You think he thought the poor guy was innocent of the whole movie and he's carrying him wrong. If he didn't. Now, a little girl brought by her father with her. Guess what happens to her? The time he lives with the family whose child was killed by his father! Come on! You all knew that would happen because he is a substitute child !! That's why he wasn't the character of Lindey Price. <br /> <br /> This movie was, in my opinion, offensive. Because there were so many options, this movie could be explored and humiliated, but he decided to take a cliché. The two stars are two stars, the little girl I thought was very good and Lindsey Price, who was characteristic, was annoying, but she did what she did with it. My advice is to take a vice and squeeze your head instead of watching this dreck
