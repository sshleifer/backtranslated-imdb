I saw on TV last night. Yes, I hear what to say about it. It is likely to be classified into one of these stereotypical series of TV soaps. All justice has a story that is fine with twists and you can say, "Well, that's not what I expected." But when it comes to the movie, it is not easy to mark the redeemable item. Casting, dancing, camera work, cars, costume, setup, script, no, there's nothing to congratulate. Rated R? Oh, this scene. Did we need it? This is a movie you can watch and then forget that you even looked. And what was the title again?
