Isabelle Huppert is a great actor. "La Pianiste" manager understands this by giving Huppert the viewer a long time and it is a pleasure to see. Huppert is not an animated actor - he registers emotions with the slightest eyebrow raising or smile. <br /> <br /> In addition to looking at an experienced actor in your profession, nothing is the film that makes me recommend. (Well, if you like self-harm, sado-masochism, and odd behavior, "La Pianiste" may work for you, except for those attributes, I didn't find any redemption value in it.) <br /> <br /> All this strange material buried is the core of truth. People who compete at the highest level - musically, athletically, whatever - start with strange people and are designed to be foreign people in a competitive environment. <br /> <br /> Learn this life lesson with a worthless movie. <br /> <br />
