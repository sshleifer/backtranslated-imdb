Seriously. This is one of the slowest family ties. <br /> <br /> Plot- Family without mother and 3 'father' raises 3 little girls in San Francisco, California. <br /> <br /> Characters - Nice cozy Danny, cartoon loving Joey, hair fastened by Jesse, spoiled brat Michelle, stupid DJ and almost normal Stephanie. The creators of this exhibition want you to hate characters, don't you? <br /> <br /> So I don't think anyone should watch this show. I showed a couple of moments in the whole running of the show, and I think all criminals should be forced to look at this example, torture, which is much worse than anything else. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 or: D
