* Spoiler warning * <br /> <br /> First of all, I rated this movie from 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, but there are too many foolish mistakes in the movie. make it a psychological drama that he could have. First, he never fights alone. After the first very strange doubt about the mother (which is not believable if the mother proves to be so supportive and loving in the film), the victim of rape alone is not. He is also incredibly naive at the crew's foreign traps. <br /> <br /> His friends are incredibly disgusting. <br /> <br /> What I find most unbelievable is that Ethan does not control the team when he changes his opinion. Ethan is a team leader (hey, they even say) and people seem to think the other man is a jerk, but if Ethan changes his mind, he just can't convince a single person in the team that he is right and his former friend is wrong. Everyone just just hates him ... why? The film does not explain. How did he ever become a leader? <br /> <br /> A funny comment is that my girlfriend thought I was looking at Beverly Hills when she came in. Two equally successful TV series actors .... cheap five viewers?
