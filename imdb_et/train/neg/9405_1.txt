I just finished it on TV and what I can say, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen! I'm embarrassed at Melbourne where the film was made. Diabolic behavior, amateur makeup effects and really bad sound. As for the plot, it is even more stupid! Some of the scenes that left me stunned how bad it was. There's a reason why they put this type of movie on the TV late in the night - because they're full of garbage! Avoid at all costs.
