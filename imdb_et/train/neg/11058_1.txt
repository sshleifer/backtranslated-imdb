A disappointing and undoubtedly boring real criminal film with badly cast characterist Jeremy Renner, knocking his way into the title of Jeffrey Dahmer, one of the most recognizable degenerate / serum killers of the last century. "Dahmer" is at the beginning of 2003 a video that has been returned to the video, a truly criminal drama that has never been a terrifying murder of the recent massacre of a psyche. as it was a perfectly good potential to do! But what he is trying to do for the reasons I know, gives the viewer some sympathy when he depicts him, which is ultimately lonely, nebbishy, ​​and a seriously socially unfair homosexual loser who was just looking. for love in all wrong places, not cold, computational and exhausted, and mad that he was! All in all, the "Dahmer" of 2003 is something that can be omitted from real crime everywhere, because I'm not kidding when I say it is one of the worst successive killers. It is even sorrier as other pathetic and exploits direct videos in trash like "Gacy", "Bundy", "Ed Gein" and "The Night Stalker"! (Turkish-zero letters)
