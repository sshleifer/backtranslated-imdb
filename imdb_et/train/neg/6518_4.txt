The movie is pretty funny and covers about four days, then it becomes really commercial for some guys (and even his "friends"). This is a pretty interesting concept; movies are looking for true love in modern LA. The problem is that it sometimes feels somewhat scripted and badly self-evident. Whatever the symbol is difficult to care for and pull from, the writer / actor is both egoistic, unpleasant, wrong and just unlikely. You end up feeling sorry for your dates.
