Well, the big money machine has done it again! Disney takes advantage of great morals like me, who feels we need to have every video (good or bad) with a Disney moniker. Why do I expect those "descendants" that make Don Blut a bad day for Leonardo DaVinc? Cinderella 2 consists of three lines (already a bad choice!) Not one of the most enjoyable Disney creations that deserve at least a linear story? Of these three, there is only the last of the quality of animation and storytelling that I expect. The music is frightening and modern (after 2 years it is already dated) and the story doesn't add anything. Why do you need to upgrade everything? You know that the original comic is still popular thanks to its timelessness, so why not be respectful and real with songs that reflect the same style as the original? Gee, I can't wait for Sleeping Beauty's sequel. Instead of Tchaikovsky-based music, we get Britney Spears-inspired music !!! So Disney, when you listen, remember we're not all the indiscriminate kids here. How about throwing a bone or two on fans who have been long enough to find the difference between craft and crap?
