This movie was sometimes fun, sometimes even hell funny. <br /> <br /> The reason I got the movie was that women were responsible for all the people's concerns. Every time a woman is depicted in a movie, she is lazy, being a sliding or sheep-like poor guy for no apparent reason. I don't think the involved message is good for women or gay men. <br /> <br /> But this is a comedy and work of art, so it's just someone. Even if I disagree, they still have the right to it. <br /> <br /> A fun movie, but some of the comments others have made are just stupid. The best film ever on my foot.
