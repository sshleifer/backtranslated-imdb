What did he mean? file: Whoopi Goldberg will play a police officer in the future with a talking dinosaur (!) case of a crazy man who wants to start a new ice age. The strangely-recorded strange is embarrassing and ridiculous, searching for a high definition for itself. Apparently it was the work of the love of his writer-director Jonathan Betuel (who was also one of the producers); Unfortunately, the end results are anemic, charitable. Goldberg's mere presence on the screen can often cause goodwill and laughter, no matter how bad the script is, but here he is drowning and seeing forgotten results. NO STARS from ****
