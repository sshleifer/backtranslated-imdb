I like Jane Austin's novels. I love pride and prejudice and thinking and movies, and I'm in the park at Mansfield. But I couldn't resist Emma. I gave up the book after two chapters and at the end of the movie I couldn't worry less about Emma. He didn't see any change at all. Perhaps it was Paltrows, who was acting (which was great in Se7en) or my lack of interest in the film. Dunno. Costumes are nice, but dancing was cumbersome compared to the dance of pride and prejudice by Colide Firth and Jennifer Ehle. <br /> <br /> I gave him 2 basically that the knight is bloody proud, and although it was a rather uneven force for Ewan McGregor, I liked his singing.
