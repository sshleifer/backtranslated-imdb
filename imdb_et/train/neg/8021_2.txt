Visually left and full, the director apparently decided to look for the faux depth to extend the 5-minute plot to a 81-minute snore painting. <br /> <br /> The moments in the movie are very limited and the characters don't even feel real. How do you feel about investing in the main character who was made so surreal? <br /> <br /> Basically AND stylistically, it seems like a peculiar dream. The work of an irregular camera, uncomfortable silence and gaps in action, and what's on the screen of a small spider screen? Anyone who thought about this must go back to school. It didn't add any meaning, just cheese, and didn't even work with the rest of the film's style (assuming the film even had a style that's close to the speech). What a flop.
