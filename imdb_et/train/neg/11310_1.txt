First, animals have emotions. If you didn't already know, I believe you're a moor. But let's suppose that none of us are mores. We all know that animals have emotions and now we want to see how these emotions are obvious, right? <br /> <br /> Instead of getting it, it is a tedious and ridiculously simplified documentary that tries to show how animals are "human." The filmmakers are looking for high and low values ​​for the footage of animals with similar behavior and when this happens, they say, "This monkey is almost human!" (this is actually a direct quote). <br /> <br /> Everything is human. They waste time theoretical on what makes dogs "smile", but never mention what a tailed tail means. The arrogance of these scientists is disgusting. They even go so far as to show a champagne and a cowboy hat dressed in human clothing. <br /> <br /> I had been waiting for promising documentary documents on my terms. I wanted to learn how animals emulate their languages. But instead, scientists are back to pedantic, anthropomorphic observations and assumptions. Add a cheezy soundtrack and pictures of chimpanzees to "Christmas", and it was enough for my belly. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't stop there. Half of this documentary is filmed not in nature but in laboratories and experimental spaces. All camera cameras are on steel bars and see how these monkeys are filled in sterile concrete drills. One particularly peaceful moment begins (though you must notice it quickly), where the monkey in captivity says in the sign language: "You want it out. Hurry." <br /> <br /> Twilight references have been made of "stress tests and psychological experiments I imagine. Baby monkeys are separated from their mothers since birth and are given doll dolls to prove that baby monkeys have a body figure. And after 40 years of experiments are predicted by smug scientists behind their backs to achieve their brilliant conclusion: monkeys have emotions. with a glance (again through the bars) that his tendency towards a concrete wall is a rather empty expression, personally I do not need to see any additional experimental data.Washoe, I apologize for all our species.
