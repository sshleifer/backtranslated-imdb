There is already a discrepancy from the beginning of the film. Since this film takes place on the borders of Normandy and the Middle East and is also an international film, it can be assumed that the right accents are depicted. This is not done by the majority of cast America. I also find that the actor to be practiced at best is a bit difficult to follow from the beginning. Who is who? Otherwise, the movie is very accurate in costumes and landscapes. If you want to see a movie to feel the past (though there is no accent) then this movie is worth the rent. If you are looking for an epic as a kingdom of the kingdom of heaven, look elsewhere.
