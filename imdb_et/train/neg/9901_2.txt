It should have been one star, but so many cliches, predictable twists, saw it before the slasher flick parallels that I actually give him an extra star that it made me laugh ... though it was never the directors' intention of sure. <br /> <br /> I don't often write comments on movies, they must be either sensational or very bad. <br /> <br /> Frankly, as soon as I saw Jeff Fahey, I knew it was bad because he had a unique nose to pick the worst films. make it through, maybe to MR T for a fun voice (don't talk to Mr T, but you know what I mean when you look at it) when you look at it, make sure you don't pay to see it. It may have worked when they were actually going to put the comedy into it, but I'm sure you'll find all the weird laughs here and there.
