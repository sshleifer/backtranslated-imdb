It was supposed to be one of the most terrible wrestlers of the gods and it was recorded only by 2 games. The hardcore game between Edge and Mick Foley, as well as Vince Mcmahon Shaun Michael. The main event between Price and Triple H was a complete clean-up and, frankly, I almost fell asleep that it was so pointless that the cup competition wasn't worth it, that Undertaker appeared there and there was a game between Boogie Man and Booker T. a complete joke. If you really are a big fan of WWE and have left WWF and Wrestlemania between 17 and 19 early days, then it probably likes. But I found that Wrestleman left much to be desired.
