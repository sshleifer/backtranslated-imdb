This movie is something like the "White Zombie" sequel, because it is done by the same man (Halperin) and has zombies. Halperin, his day-to-day George A. Romero, is unable to provide it. <br /> <br /> We have a man who can control the Cambodian people's thoughts and search to destroy its source. his power to send zombies for free. Also interest in love against evil man. <br /> <br /> If this movie really looks, it's a picture. Cambodian temples and dancers are very nice and the zombie sees a very large number of very powerful. Unfortunately, we can't really see a lot of zombies in action, and the love story seems to be too big for a fear film (although this is the reason for a later plot). <br /> <br /> I would have loved seeing the 1930s zombies that attack the helpless people of the city, but this movie didn't give anything. And no strong villain (like Bela Lugosi) was waiting for a fight against our heroes. And using Lugosi's eyes? Nice effect, but misleading because he's never in the movie ... why not create it again with the eyes of a new actor? All in all, a movie that could be great, with a little script re-working, could sometimes be a powerful remake (especially if they keep it in the same postwar period). Heck, if they can confirm "The Hills Have Eyes," this film has hope.
