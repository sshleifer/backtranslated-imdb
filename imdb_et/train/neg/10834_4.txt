Sorry, did I miss something? did I go out early? The first ten minutes of unusual (and wrong!) Stories meant to me that it's classic. The action was brilliant, because what William H Macy is worth is fantastic and just better and better for every movie I follow. I had been waiting for a great moment in which all the stories connect and then suddenly ... the frog frog? it was when the writer said, "I've gone deep, how can I get all these stories together. I like smart movies, I like strange movies, but it was just strange and boring.
