Oh, it was a really bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is OK, but I think she's acting through the movie, not because she has a kid in the night where she lives, but because she thinks about dismissing her agent to put her here. . Faye Dunaway acts as she emits a mommy more expensive and the end is completely stupid. I really can't recommend this movie at all, though as a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, I was a little interested in references to his work (Ravens, Usher's house, like a family curse and buried in life). he would probably turn around his grave when he knew about that movie.
