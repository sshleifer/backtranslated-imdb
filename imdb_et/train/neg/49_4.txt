Very fun and dull teeth film, designed to be hip and modern, shown in the style of editing and in some strange corner of the camera, causing only sleepiness. <br /> <br /> Cast is wasted, writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing worth seeing is the top-notch Lalo Schifrin soundtrack, really cool and also opening up, very original and interesting. <br /> <br /> Drive as far as you can, bad opinions and comments on this flick are completely deserved; this is really pure garbage. Of course, it has its own charm, watching a movie that everyone would not let on the shoulder glass if it were a fire, but save it on a storm day where you have nothing else to do.
