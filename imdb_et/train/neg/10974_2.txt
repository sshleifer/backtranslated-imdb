I am an Irishman and have lived in Denmark for some time, so I waited home last week so I saw a break. And I'm going ahead, saying: <br /> <br /> This movie is very good. <br /> <br /> It is not quite as bad as "the most fertile man in Ireland", but it certainly does not stand there with other Irish films like "Commitments", "I went down" or "Michael Collins". <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the movie are actually pretty funny, for example Colm Meaneys American-style gourmet. But the film itself is totally wrong. Turning the camera upside down and zooming in, zooming in, strives to give the film a nervous look as if it was a sharp drama. But it is not. It is an Irish lock, a backup and two smoking. It should be a smooth movement from one picture to another. The film just looks sloppy and drowned. <br /> <br /> Performances are okay, given the terrible script. One of my friends told me as it was, they just followed Colin Farrell in Dublin for about a week. He gives a decent display of Dublin's Dirtbag, but it is in no way equivalent to his performance in minority reports, in Tigerland or in the telephone booth. The best performance was from Dierdre O'Kane, who plays a sexually frustrated middle-aged woman who has been dumped by her husband's wife for a younger woman. I think he should leave his godly stand-up and focus more on his actions. <br /> <br /> All in all, it does not in any way meet the expectations of the Irish press or worthy of being regarded as even one of the best Irish films ever. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the backlash of these comments because most of the people I have talked about have said it was great. But before you answer, ask yourself: Would this film be as big as it would be in England or America?
