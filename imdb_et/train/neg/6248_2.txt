Something very strange happens when you talk about global warming: science goes out of the window and "belief" and "consensus" become the subject of debate. <br /> <br /> Because I give the documentary a bad sign for Al Gore. Instead of promoting an intelligent debate, he held the debate at the level of "belief" and "consensus". <br /> <br /> Of course, if you try to sell the world's spending trillions of dollars to stop global warming, it may be that the problem is a scientific truth to say: we don't know how much of the current warming was caused by people. Maybe none of it, maybe some of it, or maybe it has gone to the rest of the ice age and we got really happy that we didn't cook this planet. we know. <br /> <br /> So we are asked to believe in "consensus". Do not forget that any scientist who renounces "consensus" is stuck. Do not forget that scientific research is about abandoning consensus. Einstein did not believe in a consensus, neither Copernicus nor Galileo. <br /> <br /> So, why are so many scientists exploring the areas asking harsh questions, so many scientists? If global warming is so indisputable, some people who are testing this theory may not be so threatening. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? This is the film I was hoping Al Gore would have done. Sons, he decided to tend to support "consensus" with true "believers". <br /> <br /> Really sad.
