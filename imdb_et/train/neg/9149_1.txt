There is absolutely nothing in this film that even shows the smallest talented residue. No one has ever acted on it before, even the cafe's accessories look like they're glued. Nothing seems to be tried. The quality of the film is terrible. Most of the activities take place in narrow corridors or apartments, where the operator is compressed as a successor, pushing some cheap cameras forward and further between the "participants" when they deliver their lines. No tripod or the right microphone, the sound quality is terrible. Even "Manose" fares are better, at least they had the right equipment. What a plot is just lost in the confusion of production. <br /> <br /> Continue with your home video, preferably by a 5-year-old child who is trying out the father's new camera phone video feature. You have a long search to find a movie more intuitive than this.
