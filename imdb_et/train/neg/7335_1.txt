This is probably the worst version of the game I've seen - many times in production after the movie. <br /> <br /> A very nice idea about establishing - in southern America, Hero's alleged misdemeanor procedure can be the ultimate background. <br /> <br /> But filling it! Widdoes is a very fashionable Beatrice, which gives a particularly bad result. Exquisite actor Waterston is not much better than Benedict. <br /> <br /> The poorest power is in Don John's role - it makes Keanu Reeves good. Maybe you want to make the caricature associated with a scapegoat that binds the girl and the track, matches the capsules of the cornerstone of Dogberry and her men, but the actors show you want to spit. <br /> <br /> Successful settings include a scene where Benedict thinks Beatrice loves him - if acting competence were great. However, the use of the river and the visual humor of Benedict's mobile proximity are well produced. <br /> <br /> Generally, I had to keep a constant eye on it, but it certainly didn't leave my attention. Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> For the last comments I have almost 40. I've been watching Shakespeare's productions and productions for over two decades. Maybe I would advise my friends to speak with pieces rather than attack other reviewers if you are so inadequately armed. However, I can assume that your opinion of your youth will determine that you have a sufficient age when the behavior of the past days is more to your taste. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite pair was Rylance and McTeer at London. Unlike Widdoes, McTeer can become a skilled worker and charismatic performer.
