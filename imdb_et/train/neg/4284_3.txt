Jason Lee's bangs are back! If that's what you're looking for, look no further. If not, better move on ... <br /> <br /> But about the movie. Classical clich√©s, some badly fired but exotic fighting scenes (used JKD) and many bad acting and cheap effects. Poor Lee looks like he is painful and not a miracle throughout the film. Not a pleasant comeback. <br /> <br /> The movie is not even cut as a B-film - sure there was a German bleached blonde Rutger-wannabe bad guy, but no free event or even any catch. Missing. Zip. Nada. Even in Starship Troopers 2, they had the common sense of adding mandatory nudie scenes (like my other comments on the quality of this great classic cinema, see our upcoming review of this mind-training stage). I got the feeling that the writer took revenge against him - so I can't get to the "plot" of the movie or much more. Except that it has some non-heterosexual hints, so "nuff said. <br /> <br /> This movie is one thing - Jean-Claude :) :)
