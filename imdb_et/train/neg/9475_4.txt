Beautifully photographed and generally acted, but writing is very slippery. There are such incredible scenes that watching is not a joy. The fact that a young lover, for example, has a twin brother, is so imaginable that I dropped out loud. And the "emotion lamp connection" also seems uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> I don't know. If you have a couple of glasses of wine and feel relaxed with some beautiful views to watch some funny comedy scenes, this is a pretty good movie. There is no big view on the viewer. But the Italian film, especially Italian comedy, is usually much, much better.
