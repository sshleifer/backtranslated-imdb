The idea of ​​seeing this film was so attractive that it would live up to the shine of Charlotte Bronte's original classical story. I was deeply disappointed when I found that the film, which seemed to be written or filmed at high speed, had no features that made the original novel so powerful. The main characters between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester seemed to have lost a lot of the fun from the scenario or left the cutting room floor. Neither was Jane Eyre's charismatic feeling that allowed her to suffer from her instability and triumph. The original Jane Eyre was a hero. The woman in this film apparently didn't have much victory, including one of the greatest parts of that story, as Jane away from Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. His attempt to find food and shelter, shame to get bread, threaten to freeze with death, everything he loved was, in my opinion, a story that was simply a narrative part of the story. excluded from this movie. The title characters seemed dry and uninspired. The story was unpleasant and for those who didn't read the book, I couldn't imagine that the story would be the least interesting. The scenario and direction did little or no classical story.
