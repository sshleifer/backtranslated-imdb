This movie really started out great. It could become a truly heartfelt romantic love story for cinematography that captured the love of "Harlan" and Tobe with a long, poetic and idyllic scene. It didn't really have to be any more, and for a moment I was excited that someone finally made a beautiful movie for myself, another timeless classic, a modern myth. Why, why, then mix it halfway through the Norton's second psycho? Maybe I'm missing, but do we really need another movie in psychics? Or, in Hollywood, is there a need to portray the illnesses of human nature, which refers to a more general sense of malice in the film industry? For a moment, I made a mental note of the director's name; Now I am indifferent. At least the protection of the film should be accompanied by the fact that all participants seemed to invest in their roles. Evan Rachel Wood is also a beautiful and good actor with many options.
