Oh-so familiar comedy story from a low-key nice-boy Paul (Jason Lee) who wakes up in bed with Becky (Julia Stiles) after his bachelor's evening. After lying to her fianc√© Karen (Selma Blair), she is forced to lie more and more to cover her stories. <br /> <br /> I am sure most of us have acknowledged this story at least once before ... on film or on TV. The film is formal and highly predictable, with the end you see a few kilometers away. <br /> <br /> Interest is at least cast and keeps track of it. Lee is in the lead and Stiles is a very comical comic role that is different from the very serious roles he usually plays. Becky is a free spirit who seems to change jobs as often as other people change their clothes. <br /> <br /> But you know it's not exactly written. At least one question is left unanswered: for what exactly is Ray (Lochlyn Munro), Becky's brutal ex-boy, what is IA investigating? <br /> <br /> And I didn't like Buce's character (David Koechner), Paul's stepfather; he is a super-unpleasant hero who got into my nerves so quickly that I asked someone who hit him. <br /> <br /> Add another debit: free, unqualified comic / actor Larry Miller, who plays again (in this case, it is justifiable - his character is an extremely conservative minister). <br /> <br /> It's not good at all, but as usual for me, I give it three to ten, relying solely on casting efforts.
