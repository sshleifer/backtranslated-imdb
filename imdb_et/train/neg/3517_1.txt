I don't know who wrote this script, but from the first moment I was upset. Of all the possible decisions they could make in the mountains, why do they make the decision that is most dangerous? Why do criminals fool, even though they managed to get a huge amount of money out of the bank and give up? Why doesn't the main criminal land need to shoot a helicopter, shoot Stallone, grab money, and get out of the chick? And there are more cases of illogical behavior. I'd give this movie 5 points for nice action and great landscapes, but due to the illogical behavior of the characters I can just give this movie 1 point ...
