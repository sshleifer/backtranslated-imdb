After buying a DVD at Bargain Bin, thanks to the impressive number of features listed on the cover, I jumped with this DVD player and it all seemed good. Nice animated menus and a whole host of extra features ... but when I played the movie myself, what to let. It's the worst thing I've ever seen, and I've seen some bad movies of my time. The comment on the film in IMDB is actually the filmmakers. So don't believe it if you don't want to waste your money!
