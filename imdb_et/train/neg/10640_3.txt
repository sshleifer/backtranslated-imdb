Curdled is a very sprawling film, because it is an uninitiated title for flat screen shows. The film has got some fans because Quentin Tarantino's name has been added to it, and the silly and inappropriate nod to the Rodriguez / Tarantino flick "From Dusk to Dawn". These things, however, do not make an excellent film and it is more than obvious with "curd". The film suffers from a too obvious lack of ideas and tries to hide it with murders designed to be stylish and events that should be distracting. The Mexican music score, accompanied by many movie sequences, is probably meant to cool, but it becomes very annoying; Especially in addition to being a Mexican, it is not compatible with the film's tone. The film's plot is usually gentle and follows a gorehound who, thanks to his acute assassination obsession, works with a company that clears murder images. It sounds boring and that's it. <br /> <br /> William Baldwin is the only name on the election list and he doesn't even impress. He has not given anything to the film, nor does he talk to his victims, and has been trying to threaten when he threatens. Angela Jones, or rather; The Pulp Fiction taxi driver takes a leading role in a young woman who has become obsessed with the murder, and it is always clear that her participation in Pulp Fiction, who won that role, not her ability to act. He may have a good role in his small role in the masterpiece of Tarantino, but he does not have the talent to direct the film himself. He looks lost and inappropriate for most movies and was not his Latino accent; he doesn't convince the audience that he is on either level. Curdled is a 100% repellent trash. Such films often praise the invention or black comic books; but it does not succeed at all levels. Are you a fan of Tarantino, fan of William Baldwin, a spooky fan or just a movie buffer; it is one of the longing.
