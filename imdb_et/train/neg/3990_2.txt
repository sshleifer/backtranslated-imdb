Jungle Fever is too stylized, stereotyped and so dishonest. Wesley Snipes was in the lead and there was no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra. Even though there are many talents in this film, it is mostly wasted because the parts are slightly less than decorative. In addition to simply showing racism for this ugly and stupid thing, Spike Lee chooses to strike it as the flagship and most irritating. I did it through most of the film, but I couldn't finish it completely and it has rarely happened to me.
