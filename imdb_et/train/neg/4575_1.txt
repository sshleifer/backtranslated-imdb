I admit that I am currently only a college student with English. When I saw this movie, I was a high school student - I want to say a younger year, but it may have been older, hard to remember. My experience with quantum physics goes a long way in my physiology course, interest in quantum mechanics, which has led me to read a number of books on the theoretical aspects of theory and about every article I find Discover and Similar. I am not a PhD in any way. <br /> <br /> That said ... <br /> <br /> This movie is just terrible. Its purpose is to appeal to a middle-aged guru scientist who desperately believes in how special everything is. My mother is such a person, and since she has seen this movie she has tried to get all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the movie. I tried to draw attention to the various shortcomings and problems I saw in the logic and science of films - and they are numerous - and left their claims back because "oh, so a high school student knows more than all those with a doctorate." probably so. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the fact that earning a doctorate does not necessarily require a person to be right or actually intelligent. Leaving aside the fact that my basic knowledge of physics is enough to take half the film off. Nonetheless, filmmakers manipulated their interviews with at least one participant to explain that they supported their convictions when they actually accepted them. <br /> <br /> I could go ahead and I think the intuitor really did a good job of scrapping the movie so you can read it if you care. <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
