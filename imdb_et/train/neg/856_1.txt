These writings write the end of the plot, so don't read it unless you have seen the garbage. <br /> <br /> I found this in the trash section of the trash that made me think it would be a horror. When I owned a video store, I put it in BORING. This movie is so debris that it makes you feel like you've lost your socks. <br /> <br /> This movie contains endless people who drive as if they were scary. Well I drive to work and back (and sometimes to the store or visit my cats) almost every day and trust me that it's not scary. It even starts with a 20-minute drive. Also, the little boy does it. He goes round and round and he never stops. What's so frightening when you look at a small child who rides a bike for an hour? I think nothing, and if you look at it, don't think so. <br /> <br /> The family in the car arrives at a large castle and is given a tour that endlessly walks in the kitchen. Then the man walks for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. It's all that happens and as you can see this garbage.
