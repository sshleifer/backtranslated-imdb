"Cavemen" exceeded my expectations, not good. It was even worse than I thought it would be. There is basically an exhibition here: Cavemen is an intermittent contest, they face prejudice, and so on. almost worth the time in the jail for writers. In one show, the club's caves appeared, trying to pick up the girls and nothing else happened. It was reminiscent of listening to a 22-minute dialogue between Andy Rooney, followed by death of dead bodies through a dwarf cannibal. For those who have not seen this example, there is an example of dialogue: "You are sure to come out with a man." "Yeah, that's fine. I was like 10 thousand!" Funny ... Possibly the best writing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A 22-minute awkward make-up, which deals with serious social problems ... Sounds like an entertaining night. I also love how bad the recent ideas were about using sitcom for car insurance ads. I don't know if they will make the next Gecko, so I have a new title for the worst show I've ever seen. I would even say it is worse than Viva Laughlin. At least "Viva Laughlin" hanged something that was somewhat inspired. <br /> <br /> Shows that it gives me hope that there is a comet somewhere on Earth. <br /> <br /> (Honestly ...)
