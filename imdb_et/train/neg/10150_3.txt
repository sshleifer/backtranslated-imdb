Humphrey Bogart apparently did not want to be in this film and be forced to participate in a Mexican party or be suspended. Believe me, he made the wrong choice! Probably Warners, after the success of Dodge City, tried to continue with Errol Flynn and his regular friends list, such as Alan Hale, Guinn (Big Boy), Williams, Frank Mc Hugh, and John Litel, who is constantly performing, but they made a huge mistake in trying to present Miriam Hopkins love interest Flynn v. Randolph Scott and as a singer to do bad things because he proved one thing and it can't sing. The story was not too bad, but with Bogie it was also a mess, it turned out to be a poor western part that was too long, and a low budget, but fairly, it wouldn't have helped.
