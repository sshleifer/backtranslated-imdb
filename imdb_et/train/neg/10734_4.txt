I haven't read the negative professional review of this movie yet. I think I should have forgotten something. Initially intriguing, the three main characters meet late in the evening in an otherwise empty bar and attract each other to the invented northwest. This is the best part. After three go their way, the film is divided into three yarns. This is when boredom persists. Of course, the yarn is Felliniesque's babushka, who makes the bread out of chewing, the curiosity of opening eyes. Unfortunately, the director won this one death, even injecting a line of natural plot that does not lead very far. Bottom line: Two-hour plot-thin hopelessness. If you have insomnia, check it out in bed and have a good night's sleep.
