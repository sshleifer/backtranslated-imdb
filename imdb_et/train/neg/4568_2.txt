Not a bad start to the whole program - but what the hell's face is for true law enforcement. The worst part of the series is that he is trying to think of himself as a real ticket - and that's something other than. Men and women who devote their lives to law enforcement deserve it. What's next, a medical school in a few minutes? Charo fills the lipo? Charles Grodin Assisted In Hip Replacement? Show a little respect. Even Muncie's citizens run the program according to the stage. Police Academy = High School Gym? Bad Editing (how many times can they use the Taco Bell auto-car in the background?), Cheese siren effects (the same chain adds an ad museum to every "call", regardless of whether the roll code is or not), and the last but not the least - more officer problems if you could shut up. <br /> <br /> If I want to see police and wise crafted police, I would look at RENO 911.
