Often, the impressive and explosive trailer of Asian films is more than empty stories. Like Unleashed (which was great), Dog Bite Dog's story tells us that men are lifted up as wild wild dogs that make their master's offerings. The main characters, the emotionally developed, immoral killer who is matched by an equally unstable police officer are far from the usual heroes and villains we often see. In fact, you will eventually lose what you should deal with empathy, but don't even feel the slightest emotion for either man? Whether it was the director's failure or perhaps what he wanted to emphasize is to decide. <br /> <br /> Although the beginning of the movie was full of intriguing and unpredictable, halfway this point slides into a humble story of survival and revenge. The initial break, which soon appeared, was soon lost due to the inconsistent music score, which reduced the potentially effective story. Finally, you felt that all this detailed background information and the sense of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary. <br /> <br /> On the plus side was the transition from a to b to story b relative to US films? so those who don't know Asian movies and are tired of Hollywood's predictability should check it out. <br /> <br /> The white balance seemed during most of the movie. It was like looking at a fluorescent image when it was set for tungsten. Maybe I'm the only one, but it tightened my eyes. <br /> <br /> Did the movie play tricks? An interesting structure gave me hope for a slow moving track until it was directed to a low budget, a low-speed chase. And just when you think you get an unanswered indie that ends with the tragedy of Shakespeare, you realize that it's not an end in itself, but rather a transition to the uncomfortable montage of peace and tranquility in earth music. > <br /> Throw some backward-looking throttle scenes, a moment when redemption unexpectedly brought back to the wild and back again, the Asian charm with bodily fluids, and a terrible music score that didn't match the movie, and you get a standard Asian thriller. <br /> <br /> I just don't understand why every fight scene was with stinking lions? In the end, we are finally reminded of a real murderer who still attracts us? tetanus. <br /> <br /> 4/10
