With such a headline you know that you don't expect a great horror movie. But it was very bad, even with low expectations. The plot is really offensive and stupid: the escaped offender carries a Halloween mask so everyone around him thinks he's someone else. this joke can actually work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not for the whole movie! the actors are not so bad, but their characters are pretty stupid and the story is boring and stupid. No relationship, no excitement or little gore (very cheap). Satan's little helper tries to combine horror (...) with comedy and dramatically fails. Eventually it became so boring that I actually stopped 10 minutes before the end. I don't care what happened. Amanda Plummer was great at Pulp Fiction but came on ... it was 13 years ago and she hasn't done anything right after that. So it is no wonder that he had to sink as little as this mess. Avoid or warn.
