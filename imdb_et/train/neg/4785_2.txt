So much is wrong with this film with a little wet fart, which is hard to know where to start. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is an amazingly frightening scary film, even according to Amercia standards. Dialogue is a clich√©, the characters are two-dimensional, writing is dim, and what a small story is not cohesive and far from interesting. <br /> <br /> We meet the following stereotypes: Balding Loser Man (probably divorced, but who knows? This movie doesn't tell us), a brave heart, a young hero (who doesn't do anything heroic at all), a brave little boy (with a murderer) mile) and Black Bad-Ass Bitch (more beating than the brain). These guys take a constant struggle with Tall Scary Reaper Man and his evil Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie is full of evil little metal orcs who suffer from menacing threats. Whenever possible, they perform expressive brain surgery on those who do not have mental acuity to come on board. Booh! In fact, one of them is haunted by a good ghost (but again it may be a fraudulent face) who seems to intend to help our bold agonists reach their young kidnapped friend. <br /> <br /> Characters have no background or even an introduction to any character. It begins with a reminder of the end of a previous movie, but it didn't explain much. If you've seen the first two movies, then good. Otherwise, you do not know who these people are, how they relate, why they are not at school or at work, or why you should care whether they live or die. Consequently, you don't. The only point of interest becomes any spray effect. And those who keep you awake are not enough. <br /> <br /> Three potential Raider Punk are of potential interest / amusement, as stupid as they are evil who are threatening our heroes. But they don't get much screen time. They are almost immediately attacked. Then they are buried (why should anyone go away from time), then they will appear again in Evil Raider Punk Zombies. Just driving back in a few minutes. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie consists mainly of Caspari's friendly Ghost, which will appear and disappear while driving around looking for places and Balding Loser, who is trying some Bad Black Bitch Booty using a longline that would disgrace a teenager with intellectual disabilities. There's no dice; not even a free birthday could have saved this movie, so the good thing is never. <br /> <br /> Peapall, called Tall Man, can't scare anyone over 3 years; funny "Booooy!" every five minutes is not enough. Why, with his astonishing telematic power and surprised by the strength of the upper body, he just doesn't explain our heroes like bugs. Instead, he delegates his work to his unsuccessful slow minors who are never able to kill anyone before hell. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers who like masterpieces like "Friday 13th XXXXVIII: Jason Goes to College" to find entertainment. The rest of us who have developed the hair of the pubic hair get bored of our skull.
