... one of the worst Swedish films ever ... forgive me for boredom. <br /> <br /> First of all, I haven't seen the first one (I was bored, what's my reason to watch the second before), I hope the first one is better than it was filled with weird cut scenes and very strange changes in parcels. For people who saw it and think 4/10 is high), but it made me laugh a few times because it was so odd so bad and I still laugh to think of the idea of ​​the "punk sjunde inseglet II" . A series that is not based on a novel or book does not often become large and is a great example of this. <br /> <br /> OK, I'm honest with you: I smiled a little, it got some decent jokes and a sense of humor. But don't buy it, rent it. Just let other idiots do it or download it. <br /> <br /> 4/10 This movie is remembered and the director is probably already laughing ...
