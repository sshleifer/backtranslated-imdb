Although the film may be "true" to the Lewis book (ie, the script was literally, literally), it was unable to capture any greatness that would otherwise have been associated with such an epic story. Mythical creatures (unicorns, centaurs, griffins, ghouls, ghosts) are * drawn * and, as in the previous review, the green screen flying sequence was very difficult to swallow. I almost laughed at death when I saw humanoid clumps with their giant rigid suits and belt teeth; I almost cried when I heard the wolf "misery" - a man who had a gray fuzzy suit, basically as loud as he could have been. <br /> <br /> All the actors are enormously forced, especially the small Lucy Penvensie ... I took just so much outrage, despair and teeth (which seemed) to watch the movie for 14 hours. An actor who plays the White Witch in all of her histrionics seems to have more on the stage where the voice flourishes, spread guns, and bravely struggle for Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Sets know claustrophobic whether scenes take place indoors or outdoors. Indoors, this is how the BBC can afford to spend $ 100 to build a set and so it is very small and all the characters are constantly put together. The White Witch Castle is a rotting, rotting landscape of an English castle filled with polystyrene and bad lighting. When Penvensie children get lost through the woods - in fact, * all the scenes in the woods - they feel they are just traveling around. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is decent in the movie is Aslan, but you can bet that the BBC blew the whole budget out of the mechanical construction of cats. It looks good when it is standing and before it starts talking, but when it starts moving, you can't help but harm a poor person who has to be in the back of the lion's share. Yes, if you are a fan of hardcore Narnia, you might see this version just because it keeps every word Lewis ever wrote, but Lewis wasn't a screenwriter and a lot of dialogue seems junk and uncomfortable on the screen. During the scene, when the kids are bunches and getting ready to escape from the wolves, Mrs Beaver is incessant, "oh, just one thing, sad, and then we're ready to go," letting the kids go. "NO, Mrs Beaver, PLEASE!" - A comic scene that is so inconsistent (they should be out of FLEEING's immediate threat, don't know if the sewing machine is packed or not), reduces the drama the scene might otherwise have. In fact, the whole movie is guided by a pepper, such as those. <br /> <br /> I suggest you see the new Narnia (Disney 2005). New film with updated effects, grand computer animation, great timing around the world and a gorgeous and scary white witch (who plays a part of the sophisticated evil of an experienced politician, not a fool). Narnia's greatness and grandeur in the world without Lewis' initial vision (I think) will not diminish. Lucy has a lot of delicate (NO buck teeth, YAY!), As well as beavers (and realistically sized), and bratty BBC Edmund has nothing divine with Desperately-Hungry-for-Acceptance-Insecure-and-Angsting -On-Inferiority- Complex Edmund to the new Disney version fronts. <br /> <br /> If you are not the type who enjoys the time you entertain campy movies, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
