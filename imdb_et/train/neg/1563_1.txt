I saw this movie in Sundance in 2005 and I was amazed at how bad it was, even though I was able to see it on the catalog. Allegedly, this was the "mockumentary" of two high school students who were involved in a documentary in high school, bad behavior, poor leadership, the writing of completely absent characters, and a complete bust. I love good movies about high school and it's not one of them. The characters are one-dimensional and self-conscious "cool", although they should be expelled. You get the general impression that people who sit around deliberately make a bad movie to show their friends, but somehow it happened to Sundance. Mysticizing.
