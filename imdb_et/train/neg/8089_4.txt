I don't know what this is about Donald Sutherland's style or vocal style, but he always seems to be behind a massive soggy Kleenex. He's just ... I don't know, PIKE? Somnambulistic? On meds? Weird. <br /> <br /> I said I saw it for the first time after the first release, and frankly, I don't remember that it stops something like that. It's also a bad end, because there's nothing to do. But with a dead wife? Is it a tedious child (and was it a son to whom it was?)? Scottish yard and military? I would have wanted something packed and I would give it all the dramatic closure, not just a great panoramic view. <br /> <br /> And what does a woman sleep with a man she knows just killed her husband? Even if he tried to break the doubts of the needle to protect his child, he had always had a headache. This last meeting made me feel too itchy and uncomfortable ...
