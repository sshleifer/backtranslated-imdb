Don't waste your time with this movie. It is a complete stroke of action, control, sound editing, soundtrack. The film does not improve Paresh Rawal, who is perhaps one of Bollywood's most talented actors. Akshay Kumar, who is also a developing star, did a pretty bad job. John Abraham, what's wrong with him? Is that what you are doing? I think he should thank God for having a pretty face, otherwise he would have won Razzie prizes in India if he had such prizes in Bollywood. Asran is a great talent but superfluous, as before. <br /> <br /> A scenario that did not speak of Boeing Boeing in 1965 was quite poorly framed. First, Bollywood people just can't do anything original. Besides, they don't even know well. The movie jokes were so superfluous that they had a pain to sit. Priyadarshan may be a star in the south, but he just doesn't fit a decent Hindi movie. Audio editing is amazingly messy. I can go on and on this issue, but the bottom line is that Bollywood should be shameful for making such a movie. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that some people felt a loving movie. What's wrong with you? This is why Bollywood is where it is. Did you know that Bollywood makes more films every year than Hollywood, but most movies are outrageous because of such famous films abroad. I'm in India and I'm totally disgraceful by Bollywood for this piece of cup. Movies like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were just terrible. These are world-class movies that are the best of this decade. But Garam Masala is probably one of the worst in this century. Period. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 10.
