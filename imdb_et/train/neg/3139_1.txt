First of all, I feel right to comment on the film because he is a long-time student of the Titanic disaster and a member of several Titan clubs. I really don't care how much the prizes and awards the film won, but it's still a terrible film for me. Cameron had the resources to make the "right" half-documentary of the disaster, but unfortunately decided to turn it into a romantic pattern. The fact that so many people around the world have fallen in my mind only shows sad common sense and common sense that film critics and the audience are on these days. Who said all movies should love the hero and the heroine? In fact, the most real events are something else but the romantic and Titanic disaster was certainly not one. I think it needed a better script and a director's half-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible. I threw in almost the last order where "dead" lovers met other lost passengers and crews who break the applause. Is this a smart movie? Ask yourself.
