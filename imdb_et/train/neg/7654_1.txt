I remember reading the terrible and terrible comments of this movie when it came out. I wanted to see how terrible it was, but it was out of theaters for three weeks. The only other movie to manage is Gigli. <br /> <br /> When the movie came on DVD, I bought it to see how terrible it was. I couldn't believe that this movie was very terrible because it was possible. After that I see, I understand. First of all, let me say that this movie does not contain some cool shots. At first, there is a nice shot that shows that the weapon has been inserted, which I thought it was clean. And the way monsters die in this movie is cool to look at. but it gets old after you see it for the first time. <br /> <br /> Let me start with the worst thing about this movie: Tara Reid. If bad behavior was a sin, Hell Tara would have finished Reid because he's so terribly terrible in this film that it's unthinkable. And of all roles he plays the curator. Now that he played a buggy, empty-headed toy, maybe maybe I can forgive him how he's dealing with his character. Apparently Uwe Boll didn't know it, though he seemed to think that if he took off his shirt in the movie, people would see it. She just didn't realize that making her in the middle of the movie at the wrong time made the movie even more fun. And is it a Mexican song or something during a dry humping scene? I couldn't say. <br /> <br /> What brings me to the next complaint: Uwe Boll shows some of the worst leadership skills you see in the movie. I mean, I'd give the dead home to F (and I'll just do it for very few movies), but HotD would have at least B compared to its screwed spam. The film begins with a very, very long story that causes immediate confusion (and is perceived by the terrible narrator) and from there the cuts are really, really stupid. There is one point where Slater and Reid look at a building that is destroyed and the screen is black. When he comes back, Slater and Reid take pictures everywhere and suddenly they have joined a whole army. Ah? <br /> <br /> And nobody bothered to check this movie for errors. At one point, the team breaks through the glass, but the glass breaks before that. Tara Reid's earrings change colors in the middle of one scene and after Slater's passing from a deceased comrade, you see that he is getting up. <br /> <br /> Story ... I was really gone. Something about an old tribe that frees darkness and someone "opens the way" or something and all the evil monsters. It's just a pretext that you have a lot of weapon scenes (the technology is so advanced that this movie never needs to be reloaded), which quite simply WILL. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie, hoping to laugh when it was incredibly stupid. I didn't laugh, but I think it's stupid. Very, very, very stupid.
