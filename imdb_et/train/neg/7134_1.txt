So it has come to this. Fast, expensive cars that only the top 1% ever drives. Girls next to them in the magazines. Level 2 and non-name participants. Cheap ad impressions from niche culture. <br /> <br /> This is Hollywood's garbage. Don't do me wrong; I love thoughtless activities with flick as much as the next man. But please, do this collection of Braintru, who celebrates this stuff, stops, take ten, breathe, cheerful "Woooooosaaaaaah", then scroll back twenty years and remember what films enjoyed once a day? Then MAKE some of these movies again? <br /> <br /> I have nothing against poker, but the whole pop culture explosion he has enjoyed over the last five years is ridiculous. Everyone and their mother are now thinking of their Maverick (not that half of them even get it). Some leaders said, "Hey, what do you want to hit $ 9.50 demographically?" "I know sir. 18-35 market." "Ok, let's give them poker, girls and fast cars." "Great idea, sir." The result? The movie I've seen on Spike TV late at night and more often than Dolph Lundgren. <br /> <br /> Now, don't misunderstand me, I'm not a movie snob. The overall artistic flick like an English patient does not swim in my boat, but the general films that should not have been made directly on a DVD also disturb me. Only the adolescent power transmission devices have their engines rotated, and I imagine that the engines at the top end of their IQ range will see it for what it is: spam.
