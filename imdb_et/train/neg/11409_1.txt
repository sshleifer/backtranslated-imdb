Indeed, the trend of the 80s, which was a frustrating "horror film", began. I was the target of this repellent trash, and I was outraged now. <br /> <br /> Where we start. Let's see, tuning: You can get people back if they die of violent death. So the ridiculously weak assumption is an excuse for the butchers in a terrible way, because it is necessary to live back! It could have worked when playing on top black la la-animator or something. But no, it is played directly. In a wagon that has been awakened, there is one frightened family that is one of the few scenes at least when their death is out. But almost everything else is on the screen. There is actually a scene where a zombie townspeople kicks and kills a young girl who is walking around, all filming it and playing with several cameras. Then his face, like the filmmakers lovingly and time-consumingly, appears in timed photography that his beaten face is carved into the skull and rebuilt to look "normal" again. This, of course, happened with the slipping of Jack Albertson behind it. She loves to ride an ambulance / heart, playing old Tommy Dorcey songs, I think it should be cute. <br /> <br /> Finally, even the Sheriff's undead and the doctor will kindly attach his rotten hands. It is not clear why the sheriff is not with the other townspeople who are killing children who kill children and slice their faces, stick the needles in the eyes of the burnt victims, and so on. <br /> <br /> I don't know really what people see geek shows to give it any rating. It's not scary, the twists are ridiculous and generally sick. It's not even well done to see it boldly or to enjoy a level that can look at the bad HG Lewis movie. It's just a god-terrible trash that has been made for people who displace this kind of meaningless holes, and the people who have been paid for it. <br /> <br /> Sadly, Albertson was even involved.
