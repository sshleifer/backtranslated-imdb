This terrible movie brings together every Asian stereotype you can imagine in one terrible package. Grubbing up money, devious Japanese businessmen are sending silly, but lovely cop Pat Morita to restore business secrets in Detroit. Here he meets Jel Leno, who immediately refers to the murder victim of Japan and calls Morita Tot. It's all down there.
