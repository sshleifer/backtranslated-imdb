Nothing like watching giant robots fighting in the desert, and Robot Wars is doing it. Of course the actor is insignificant, the dialogue is sub-par, and the characters are one-dimensional, but it has giant robots! The special effects are actually quite good for the period. They are certainly not as polished as today's standards, but it contains minimal computer graphics and uses miniatures, so it is outdated quite well. Its drawbacks are easily overlooked, given the short duration of the films, and it has some humor in the tongue-cheek in parts that make it quite enjoyable. I would recommend it to any giant robot fan or cheesy sci-fi who is looking for a slightly disturbed time.
