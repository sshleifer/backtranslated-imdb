Where was his criticism of democratic administration and republicans? After all, he had earned 17+ years in a government agency where his influence did not benefit. Oh, I forgot eight years when he was the second most powerful country on Earth. The film is pleased to show the images of young Senator Gore, asking why a NASA scientist was forced to make a conclusion in his research, but did not ask Clinton / Gore's accomplice in global warming. Probably too close to the election year or maybe it would harm Hillary's options '08. In both cases, he is a political coward and a bitter side. He does not offer any criticism of consumption, does not criticize capitalism, and in no way is the history of industrial development, which has led us to this time. Gore yourself as any real problem with our environment. Mr Gore, if you really want to make a campaign film - shorten it and name what it really is.
