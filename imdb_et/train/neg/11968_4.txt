It's just typical of Bruce Willis, the action schtick. Watch it with some popcorn and your friends. Rent it to save money. <br /> <br /> None of them is realistic. The battles are not realistic. The soldiers are not realistic. Victims are not realistic. And why did Tom Skerritt's character Willis talk about CARRIER DECK? What is it about? He can't do it inside the ship? <br /> <br /> Of course, Bruce W. There are a lot of medium explosions. <br /> <br /> If this movie exactly represents the Navy's SEALS, don't stay in Africa, waiting for them to come and save you! <br /> <br /> The noble attack in the village plagued me the most. "The front row seats for ethnic cleansing" ... as Bruce looks at the killing in town. So what does he do? He climbs the city to his belly. Yep. How many died when they moved around? Oh ... you need a body number, and I think if this one African man was so important, why didn't he get a chopper with the elderly and children? Can he say "Duh?" Finally the film was very dark. Not only on the plot, but so much happens at night, it was hard to do what was going on.
