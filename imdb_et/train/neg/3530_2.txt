When Ritchie first exploded the movie scene, his films were laughed, witty, well-run and original. If it were possible to compare his leap from his first two attempts and almost all of his last two trips, one should take into account - has Ritchie been known? Is he really talented? Does he have real original ideas? Or is he just a pretentious and egoistic director who really wants to be Fincher, Tarantino and Leone all in one colossal and unorganized heap? After looking at Revolver, one might think that everything went wrong? What happened to his great sense of humor? Where did he get all these mixed and complicated ideas? Revolver tries to be smart, philosophical and short, trying to be an intelligent psychoanalysis, trying to be a complicated and complicated thriller. Ritchie makes a great deal of effort to meet all these many goals and invests in large scripts in existential music and numerous plot twists. Ultimately, all that is meant to be a seriously disconnected, unstructured and ultimately unfriendly movie is for the audience. Its plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that even though Ritchie tries to give her a spin at least, she should be punished even for trying to leave it as her work. So what the audience will end up with is a terrible scenario that is intertwined with many pretentious onliners and cadres. Fiction. Its goal is high, but inevitably the spaces are empty. At the same time, it falls on its carnival face and just can't do everything it wants and achieves.
