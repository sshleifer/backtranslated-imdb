I've walked about 6 movies all my life. It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I don't know how I sat in an hour. I had to be in the coma at night. I saw it in the theater when it came 8 years ago. I couldn't even remember that name, but I knew Penelope Ann Miller celebrated it. It really had to influence me to comment on my time. Yech! Vomit! Barf!
