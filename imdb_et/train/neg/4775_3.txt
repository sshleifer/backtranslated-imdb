What a waste of time is complete. The film begins as a clone of the Saw series, but even worse. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely terrible. The end is ridiculous, and the story does not contain twists, not surprises, and just a bad ending. I liked some of the characters and I was hoping that everything was tied at the end. It just won't happen. It is a complete "wrestler" ending with no good actor. I can't believe I spent watching this time. It's not "fun", as some people put it. The mask guy rubs people who are connected and forces them to think. The community is stretching and should have let the main actor first.
