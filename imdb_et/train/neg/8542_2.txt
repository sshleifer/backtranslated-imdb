I work my way through the Chilling Classics 50 film package and WITCHES 'MOUNTAIN (El Monte de las brujas) is similar to film 17. <br /> <br /> The film had nothing to hold my attention at all. The plot was inconsistent. The dialogue seemed improvised. Operation was bad. The characters were atypical. The best scene is the beginning of a ridiculous woman forced to burn her seemingly delicate daughter. But the only connection that this scene touches with the rest of the movie is the leader, Mario, who has ever the most amazing mustache. But this is so. <br /> <br /> The film was not effective at any level. The music was too intrusive. The lighting was very dark so some scenes are almost completely black. It's really a hassle - what else to say?
