If there was a zero rating, I'd give it to that movie. It was the second time I tried to watch it and I couldn't do it from start to finish. I can't believe other stars can only assume they know the actors or are a hidden audience! Action is daunting, the script is blah, the child who plays Nicho shows zero emotions even when he is threatened. The "south" accent of Amber's mother's acting actor is ridiculous - I am from Georgia and I have friends from Texas - believe me NOBODY speaks like this! No emotion seemed real in every scene. The subject is very serious and deserves much better treatment.
