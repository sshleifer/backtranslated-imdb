Two old men are sitting on a park bench. I don't really have problems with this scene - the only problem is that it is not a scene that is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Yup movies are no longer a low concept. They are also no longer boring as it is, but it is even worse because these two older men are chalk and cheese. One of them is Nat Moyer, a Yiddish Communist, the other is Midge Carter, who is a former golden glove. Let me see now, a Jew and a black man sitting on a park bench to bypass. Well I think it's possible, though unlikely, but if this film has such an unpleasant scenario, why play a Jewish stereotype? Why turn them into a brilliant tribal rousers who take the Hebrew oath? It is a little ironic that the Jews at the beginning of the film were exactly the Jews they saw in the Nazi propaganda films of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Stereotypes set aside the problem I am not RAPPAPORT. s is written for a completely different meduim than a cinema, it is based on a stage release and it shows. Walter Matthau's dream footwear through the role of Nat, while this commentator slept with almost the entire film
