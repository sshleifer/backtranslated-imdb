"Creepshow 2" is a little more than the pale imitation of the original, created for little use than the name of the previous movie. It even amplifies the mistakes of its predecessor, which was often predictable and difficult. Still, for the first time, there was quite excitement to make up for its periodic balls, which resulted in uneven but generally quite fun. There are few valuable moments in the queue, so the transparency of the stories is even more obvious. From time to time, it gives, but mostly drives only there. <br /> <br /> Like the original, all the stories are revolving around revenge and just a common theme of desserts. A wooden indian picking up reveals his owner's killers. Teenagers eat water monster. The careless man returns to the wrecker. None of these spaces is bad in itself, but the inspiration is completely inadequate. There are few surprises and fears. This is an example of textbooks about non-motivated, numbered film making. It doesn't help that this inexpensive-looking movie suffers from a flat director's style, though frankly there wasn't much work to do. Finally, the second story is best, but not much. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, performances are good at best. George Kennedy, who is the owner of the bad shops, does enough, if not particularly inspired, work. In contrast, Dorothy Lamour is quite good as a guilty driver who gives sympathy to his situation, despite the predictable and superfluous material. However, most characters are quite thin. One might think that "Creepshow 2" would have been better. George Romero, who directed the original, returned a pencil of the scenario, based more on Stephen King's stories. Make-up artist Tom Savini turns to some good and gory work. Why is the movie filmed? I think Romero didn't really want to make another movie, but was forced to do it for financial reasons. It was a decade of horror after-effects, clones, rip-offs and what didn't, so it was definitely inevitable. I can imagine the guy writing the script in haste, raising his salary and running away. I think he had to do what he needed to finance his projects; we can't blame him. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 (out of ****) <br /> <br /> New World Pictures
