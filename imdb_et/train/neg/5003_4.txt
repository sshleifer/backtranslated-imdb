I am embarrassed when writing this review. I say that because those who read it know that I am sitting all over and that it is embarrassing to even admit to strangers. But I just had to warn those who read viewer comments about IMDb before watching the movie to watch it. That's the least I can do. It's a bad movie! Trust me. The plot is buggy. Action is amateurish. Leadership, camera work, kits, costumes, etc. are all the second. Let it go.
