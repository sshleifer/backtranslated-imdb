There is nothing really good about this fucking festival. Randolph Scott, a homosexual cabinet living with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years, is the least wooden and boring. In the 57's he was obviously too old for these romantic roles, though it is not so important here, because Gail Russell looks so much older than his 31 years and he is so ugly because of his chronic alcoholism and chain smoking. Lee Marvin plays his usual poor role, but saving this garbage is not enough. Thanks to God, they no longer do western peoples, they are only dated, racist old films that glamorize weapons and murder. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
