The first part, Che Cuban, is about that part of his life. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che earns too much undifferentiated wounds (remember, Che was a doctor). It ends when Castro wins the revolution; Che never gets to Havana. The second part, Che Bolivia, is to guess what. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che earns too much undifferentiated wounded. <br /> <br /> When I realized that it should be "epic" (I never knew anything * but the title before it started), I naturally thought of their greatest epic, David Lean, of Arab Lawrence. More about it later. <br /> <br /> Not to be racist, but besides what I have already mentioned is the fact that there are too many characters that are very indistinguishable - unknown Spaniards who look the same, especially since they carry all " Che "beards and wear all Che fatigue. As a result, the viewer is unable to identify anyone other than Che, Benicio del Toro (even Fidel has a very small role). Although del Toro is terrible, think of Peter O'Toole as "Lawrence" as the only noticeable sign: Alec Guinness, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, etc. You get the idea. <br /> <br /> Other characters are interchangeable, causing loss of reference. When Chei's fence is killed, you will not regret it because you do not know who they are. Even if Che is killed (I don't think it's a spoiler), there is no public empathy - he's just killed. <br /> <br /> He is too one-dimensional to associate as a human. Apart from being revolutionary in moral law and only from Jesus, the only thing we learn from Che is that he is married to five children (he is talking about another character near the end). What was his motivation? Complete mystery. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Soderbergh is deliberately on Lyn. Like Soderberghi Che, Lean never lets you know about Lawrence, the Arab mystery. But at least Lawrence had a friend (Sharif) and companions (Guinness, Quinn). He was so brave when he was insecure - i.e. Che is like a machine, about as warm as a Terminator. <br /> <br /> Earlier this year there was another war shot, Mongol. Che makes Mongol out like this is a wonderful life.
