We have all seen some infinite epics in our times, but it really does attract all of them! The film is so long and so slow that, just from the perspective of things, I felt much older when I left the movie hall. Almost 4 hours in length, it may be a TV series. <br /> <br /> What starts as a promising comedy is slowly losing its pace. Nikhil Advani has stripped the plot of about 6 love stories and he does not get justice from any of them ... There is no link between them at first, and links within the last 20 minutes just seem to be forced to unite the story. <br /> <br /> Silly dialogues (most of them repeated in Hindi cinema over the years) and stupid cinematography are exacerbating the situation. <br /> <br /> Priyanka does not realize that she really needs to play her role instead of just looking for a glam screen ... Perfect waste of waste without having to act skill. <br /> <br /> And then the loud-humorous Govinda and my face-twists are better than Jim Akshay Khanna, who keeps his lungs at the top to irritate already tired viewers. <br /> <br /> Only a good part of the movie is a love story by John & Vidya and a nice actor / comedy couch & Isha. But they are so good in their roles that it is these two pairs that could justify the movie without interfering with the other heaps. Their glory disappears in the middle of other lines that do not meet the standards. <br /> <br /> My opinion - the director made two separate films (may be more!) and some novice assistants interrupted all of the documents to sort them, so the director had no choice to show it all as one movie ... < br /> <br /> See it only if you want to test your patience !!!
