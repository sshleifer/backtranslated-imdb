I would enjoy this movie, but Van Damme just does the same old old garbage from time to time. Poo knickers are fighting scenes as usual. The only thing this loser missed was that the Russians would eventually be killed. This movie is a very doggy dog, who does the highest quality, please, please, please, Van Damme is learning some lessons you need. Anyone who loves Van Damme has problems, it seems sad that the only way Van Damme ever works is when he writes a movie, makes a movie and plays a movie on the screen. AVOID VAN DAMME AND GUARANTEED BACK FIRE. I'm going to give this movie out of ten out of ten, because it was better with sandman. To offend the injury, I wasted it on the manure
