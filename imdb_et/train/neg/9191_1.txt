Well, I had to sit on the computer and write the review right after I watched the dragon. Why? Because I have to tell you all about how bad this movie is. It's incredibly bad. Just promise you how bad it is, I offer this little detail about the movie. During scenic scenes, which usually consist of people who shoot or shoot zombies, they mix up scenes in a video game. Yeah, you heard me right. This movie really sucks. In fact, it makes me think that these days, ten dollars will only cost theaters these days. And how is corn filled stuff like this? There is no story to talk about, and the film has nothing but a casual stepping stone and really cheap killing. I'm very disappointed about this, knowing I was watching it. OK, I'm buggy. It's so bad that I can't even find words. EVALUATION: Out of scratch *****.
