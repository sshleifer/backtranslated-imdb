MST3K dudes should see this movie dog. Basically this is a Hollywood clever hack-actress who can't act. And he has this strange obsession with the taxi driver's movie. What does this stupid actor do? She dyes her hair blonde and starts acting like the laughing hope of L. A. surfer that it will fill her. You're laughing at so many unintentionally funny scenes in this movie. As if the actor's dude's girlfriend's heart is broken and robbed and says, as they say, "How do you do it to me?" And why does he cry? Cos she painted her hair blonde and became a surf guy to get the show concerts. This movie doesn't make any sense! The actor who played the Benson Governor is also in this, and he plays a stereotypical right-wing politician with a lotus funny joke. This movie hits you, trust me. You talking to me ?!
