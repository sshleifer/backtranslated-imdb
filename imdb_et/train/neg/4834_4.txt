I was waiting for Kathryn Bigelow's film with great expectation after the endless leap and the 6 Oscars he got. Unfortunately, this is not really a good movie. The picture of the situation seemed to be accurate and plausible on all the lists, but besides that, the story was just incomplete and the direction of the film seemed insecure and casual. The actors made good efforts, but for me, I didn't get what the film was trying to do. It's not as atmospheric and thrilling as the Full Metal Jacket, not as epic as the Brothers Band, not as an action packed like ... well, nothing. I can hardly understand why this was so much mentioned, and why people "jump" to "epic" proportions. Think of you, given the caliber of films of recent years, I think there's not much to choose from.
