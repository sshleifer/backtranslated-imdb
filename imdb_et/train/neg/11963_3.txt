I like Billy Crystal, and I thought it would be nice to watch this movie because I know she admired Alan King and they would be funny. I thought I had seen all Billy movies, but couldn't remember it, and now I know why. It's so full of clich√©s and fake emotions; you get the smell (and going!) of every scene. Billy is not even very funny. He's too busy trying to cry tears or show his anger how badly his father put him down. Alan King himself is quite pleasant, as is the sub-block to be extra in the movie. But what a coincidence that Billy just happens to his father like a big health crisis, etc. Etc. Or that two busy doctors can just surround their activities in LA. And when the end is over, boy, will it come soon! Almost as if the writers realized that they had painted themselves in the corner and the only way out was to make a death scene. In most cases, disappointment with some good humor.
