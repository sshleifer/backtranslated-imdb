if they gave me the opportunity to use negative numbers. This film was truly pious. I went to theaters, assuming it was terrible, and it managed to overcome my expectations somehow. <br /> <br /> The script was weak, acting painful. I wanted to walk out, but my friend was driving and wanted to pay off my money, I think we were both disappointed. <br /> <br /> Breast growth when girls got their super power and changing hair color was just wrong. Eddie Izzard just seemed wrong when she was a super villain, she came so strangely weak and stupid. Jenny Johnsons (Uma Thurman) came out as psychotic and strange as Matt (Luke Wilson) friend Vaughn (Rainn Wilson).
