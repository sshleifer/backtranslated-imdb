I have a nice movie collection and it was added to it. Number 274 is accurate. <br /> <br /> The title was at the beginning. Splatter University. I thought it would be a great horror movie. Did I ever get lost. Don't do it wrong, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could have been a lot better. I love all the movies but it was one that was more of a laugh than intimidation. Poor sound quality, poor performance and bad shooting are some of the areas that could have been improved. 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The film is ideal for laughing. If you are looking for one of these movies, this is one!
