First of all, I would like to apologize for my bad English. <br /> <br /> I am not a HOSTEL-hardcore fan, but I liked this movie. But Live Feed SUCKED BIG TIME! I've never seen an excellent example of a gore movie, but hey, who's surprised? Working in Live Feed was ... well, not there! I have seen some have commented on it because it has to be a school project or something. Okey, but not in the media or in the high school. It wasn't a class at all! And what is the story? A truly sad place to stay at the hostel. And what is gore? But psychopathic torture scenes that should make your courage and leave you with cold sweating? It was the most disappointing film about! Short, fast and NO edge. More for execution than for torture. Okey, where the buckets are, but it didn't even look real. Slaughter and violence reminded Braindead more of a hostel or a Saw movie. And Braindead was fun! Okey, I laughed a few times in Live Feed, but it was more disappointing than just having fun! <br /> <br /> So instead of wasting 80 minutes watching live broadcasts, check out something else!
