You get a total of 5 writers, each writes a different story with a different genre, and then you try to make one movie. It's an action, it's an adventure, it's a sci-fi, it's west, it's a mess. Sorry, but this movie smells. 4.5 gives it an amazingly high rating. That means it's a movie that makes me think I could write movies and I could hardly write.
