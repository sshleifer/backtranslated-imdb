I wouldn't say it completely suck, but if it wasn't for Netflix, I wouldn't even have it in my house. The eccentric president of Steve Martin's healthy food chain is gradually falling. He's not just funny. He is the second LONG striker of SNL, which refuses to work only on the next SNL movie. The Elmer Fudd Lispiga-born coach is about as funny as the original. Amy Poehler just goes through the same movements he would like with a 7-minute SNL skit, which is just as funny for the SNL recently. The only thing about this movie is that Tina Fey is easy for the eyes. The end was predictable as soon as you heard that his character could not get pregnant. The subject could have opened up for other comedy experiments, but it seems to be easy to boil, not really fun or fun.
