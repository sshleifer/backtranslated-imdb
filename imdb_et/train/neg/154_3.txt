This has been viewed on the DVD in the original language in English. Whether the subtitles were very bad or the actual dialogue did not make much of a story and gave some character development. There are quite a few HK letters in it, but the film doesn't need their presence to make it better or worse. It's just bad. Light and color scenes made in CG are attractive for thin colors and shine, but before long it can be overwhelming. If it does, think of a child's film that has cg mainstream, fighting scenes, and jamajone. I'm sure I realized what was going on in the movie, but the whole story was pretty weak.
