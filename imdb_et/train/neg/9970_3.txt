People who really liked the Problem Child (1990) have to check their heads. Who should think about watching a malicious little boy so that it would be devastating to others and make it funny? The film is never funny, somehow somehow in the beginning. He wants to be a comic, but the writers don't realize that slipping is not funny when the bears are attacked or hit by baseball bats. It can be funny in cartoons, but not on a movie screen. <br /> <br /> The young hero of the movie is Junior (Michael Oliver), who is at the door of the parents of the educators after giving birth. for adoption. Families reject him because Junior tends to give them a hard time. <br /> <br /> Then he is thrown into the orphanage where his nuns are terrorizing, and writes letters to the convicted bow-killer killer. Michael Richards). Soon he will receive Ben and Flo Healy (late John Ritter and his wife Amy Yasbeck) who die to get a child to be like any other parent in their neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Junior becomes a member of Healy House and "Little" Ben is interested in him, despite the fact that he is destroying camp training, wearing a bear or throwing a cat at his "Big" Ben (Jack Warden), a grand politician. <br /> <br /> I think we need to take care of Junior so we can root it when it gets revenge on people. Her new mother, Flo, is a slut, her grandfather is completely selfish, and one little girl who paralyzes the adopted children is kind of spoiled. <br /> <br /> But what Junior does to get the last laugh is not funny, it is mean, cruel and sometimes life-threatening. <br /> <br /> What is a movie message? Should children solve the problems of violence and vandalism? That they should look for friendship by writing convictions? They certainly don't want to be a bad guy. Junior is not one - he is just a sadistic little tear. It used to be a time when the children were beaten by others. Now, everyone laughs when Junior beats baseball with kids. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that this movie has been marketed as "family comedy". Worse still, the problematic child is rated PG. What was MPAA thinking when they saw it? There's a lot of embarrassment here and the average enthusiasm for thinking about sharing between PG and PG-13. <br /> <br /> Kids enjoy it, but parents are shocked by what's on the screen. And for most people, a problematic child is considered a classic "guilty of joy"; a film that someone disgracefully admits, although the overwhelming opinion of the more serious viewers is that the film is a piece.
