This guy is pretty bad, but in no way do they do the kind that adults over and can experience stolen thieves at every turn. No, he is not as big as he is a child with severe emotional problems. A nice couple who wants to receive, sucks him and if the husband is a little more willing to give this child a chance, he is not. Through the strange Michael Richards character and always annoying Gilbert Gottfried and you have yourself a very bad movie where here and there a couple of laughs. I prefer the sequel to this movie, as I like it, that they brought Amy Yasbeck back in a different way, because there are one to several characters in this movie that are completely unlikely. Even the boy is first rather annoying in it and they cool him down. The plot is simple enough, although the future parents will go against the child who thinks it is great, if the orphanage throws a party when they leave, they will soon realize they have little hell. Add that little hellion to the convicted person. Not sure about this character, at first I thought it should be his real father or something. Not all that good, but I pick it up for Culkin's boy every day of the week.
