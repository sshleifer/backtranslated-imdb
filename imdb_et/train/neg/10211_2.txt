Except for the recognition of some nice cinematography, I can't say anything positive about this film. One real problem is the protagonist's dilemma whether to stay with friends of his childhood in the world of misery or to leave and start his life. Many "emotionally powerful" scenes do not go with this plot and because of bad behavior they cannot create the desired atmosphere. The director will only be able to present the Anthony dilemma, and finally, there will be a simple solution. The characters don't seem to evolve, though it's hard to talk about any character ... maybe Sonny. Next to him, the actors cannot play much and if any of them have to do it, they will become suicidal amateurs. I do not know what destroyed the film any more: a superficial script that throws away all the possibilities of a parcel or bad behavior that disturbs any appeal.
