Incredibly confusing, sprawling and finally ridiculous ("horses, oh my God, horses!") Triller. Sometimes it is terrible, but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for horror. See how the last 10 minutes all "magically" do exactly what the plot needs to "resolution". Richard Lynch's typical eccentric performers. Video transmission is a real cinematic work that cuts scenes in half and makes the movie even harder. 0 of 4 stars.
