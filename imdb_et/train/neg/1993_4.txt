Franco Rossi's Six-Hour Quo Vadis Italian Mini Series 1985 is a very curious beast that creates an absolutely convincing ancient Roman world that has actually been hit (very few long shots, no big city images), but plays the drama so much in favor of classical literature and historical clues that the story disappears in the background constantly. <br /> <br /> Moving structure (most episodes are played through voices through stars) and the lack of narrative urgency makes the full six-hour version demanding and demanding at the same time, and certainly too enthralling, but it has something. The two main strengths are the characterization of Petronius (fortunately, Frederic Forrest, whose own voice is almost certainly flat in his dialogue) as a man who has spent so long looking for a smart corner to survive the court effect he is unable to feel emotions, and Klaus Maria Brandauer is a unique Nero as a wannabe actor, whose moves and actions are calculated according to how his "audience" gets it. Elsewhere, Max Von Sydow briefly appears for some episodes that are rewarded with the most impressive and truly moving scene in the show, where he meets a baby while leaving Rome. This is something that the show could do more, but it seems too often that all potentially emotional, inspirational or exciting moments break down with a lower key. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Francesco Quinn is an amazingly anonymous hero, mixing with walls and coming less than a Roman officer as a quiet, lightly meaningless but unpleasant man working in the same office as you who don't say much about office parties - you know who you think is called Dave or something like that. Budget constraints are very visible when his meeting with Lions Christians and Ursus battle with bulls is such a decisively low key that it just goes over you before the show just suddenly loses interest and suddenly ends. <br /> <br /> Not a trip that I especially recommend, but I'm afraid, but when you start it, it's not completely without its small benefits.
