I spent almost two hours watching a movie that I thought was worth a look at with all this good actors. I couldn't believe it when the movie ended and I had no idea what happened ..... I was crazy because I could have done that time by doing something else. really had no idea. Thanks to those who guessed it and explained it .... right or wrong, it's better than nothing! Who was the dark-haired film we saw a few times? How did First Lady know her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the film, Kate said she would finally know the truth. Does that mean we're going to end the game 2?
