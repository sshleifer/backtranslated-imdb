I bought Bloodsucker from eBay a while ago. I looked at the parts and found that it was too many times to review. The excessive "blood" in the beginning is simply outdated - not to mention the sound of the wind. My friends and we made a very low budget movie and the effects went beyond that fucking festival. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with this movie is to read too much. I knew one of the actors - believe it or not, he was my THEATER teacher. HA! <br /> <br /> Final decision: Don't worry about this "horror" flick. <br /> <br /> 3 stars (out of 73 possible)
