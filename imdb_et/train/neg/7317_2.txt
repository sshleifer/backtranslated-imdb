Having read other reviews of this movie, I would like to share my view that this is one tough movie to see if you are not a complete Brooksophile. When I look at a purely objective observer, the film is an unbalanced narrative that gives us more thoughtless neuroses than those that can be absorbed in one session. It is quite difficult to look. The character of Brooks (Robert Cole) is so insecure and uncomfortable that it is difficult to associate with him - not to mention from where he stumbles from one dysfunctional self-absorbed situation to another. And he should NEVER make a topless scene and expect them to be taken seriously in a romantic context. No man could wear such an exposed foliage and would have had to turn on a child like Kathryn Harrold ---- if he wasn't, of course, Albert Brooks controlled by Albert Brooks. <br /> <br /> "Modern Romance" has fun moments ----- but they are fragmentary and rare. More often than I felt that I would be a limited journey with a thoroughly unpleasant person and I would like it to end. This confirms the problems that may arise if too much control over the film is placed on only one person --- someone who has no self-discipline to step back and see what is going on clearly. <br /> <br /> As most people probably know, the film's director James L. Brooks actually did what he imagined. Six years later, he made Albert Brooks a very successful "Broadcast News". James showed us how Albert can design a reliable and fun comic. Albert promised us to see James (usually not an actor) make a rare comic book in a surprisingly effective way. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Modern Romance" have now moved on to the next praiseworthy message. I'll tell you that ----- there is enough pain in the world without having to find it in entertainment.
