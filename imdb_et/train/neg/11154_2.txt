This move was on television last night. I think the time filler because it sucks bad! The film is just an excuse to show some tits and ass in the beginning and somewhere about half way. (Not bad tits and ass). But the story is too ridiculous for words. The "wolf", if it is what you call it, is hardly shown to have its teeth completely rescued. If it is fully visible, you can clearly see that they had CGI-based interns, because the wolf runs like a running track, and the CGI fur looks like it's waxed, all shiny :) <br /> <br /> The film is full gore and blood and you can easily see on the spot who is going to die / cut / eat next. Even if you like such splatter movies, you're frustrated, they didn't do that good job. <br /> <br /> Don't start with the actresses ... the girls scream everything every 5 seconds. But when someone asked me to do bad things to give me a few bucks, hey, where do I sign in? <br /> <br /> A general boring and laughing horror.
