The second night could not sleep. So I got up, I turned to the handset and this movie was turned on. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers threw more than they could chew. As ambitious as "Forrest Gump" was. But Gump reads a fairy tale where an exceptionally lucky man leads us through the era. The TGMB simply relies on tired clich√©s to tell the story. Almost like a Broadway musician, where actors have to shut it down. The purpose of each character was to fill the silly 60's archetype. <br /> <br /> Take a look at how we introduce Finnegan: hugging your black servant and getting a framed picture of MLK. Criminey, talk about a heavy hand. Why not just give her a t-shirt that says "I Heart Black People"? <br /> <br /> Sunshine: "Isn't it free love, man? Oh no, I had no time." <br /> <br /> Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not the square of UCLA." Excuse me? There was nothing in LA in the 1960s. Instead of showing what made Berkeley unique, we just hear what doesn't go there. <br /> <br /> Not even remember the name of a black child. He was just a proportion used to show how other children racially tolerate. <br /> <br /> The time is that pieces of the period don't have to be that cheese. Take "Dazed & Confused". See how we introduce football to the hero Randall Floyd. We don't see him before the football field. In fact, we never see him playing football. We introduce him in the classroom, inviting his nerdish poker friends to party. It's much more organic, more serious than that. It is a refined women's room over the Gilligan Island discussion. Serious ideas can grow in the most common settings. But real life is like that. <br /> <br /> Some of the warm comments here indicate that the themes of this movie are still relevant. I agree! That's why I feel this Baby-Boomer pornostalgia is disappointed with it.
