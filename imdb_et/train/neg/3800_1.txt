It is not an easy task to name absolutely the most miserable crap in cinematography, the candidates are so rich, but Nemesis 2 has been my personal favorite since I saw it. It was so funny that we had to rent it the next day, and again I laughed so hard that I was literally rolling on the floor. (This usually only happens when I see Monty's Python's "Antarctic Scot".) <br /> <br /> Over the course of the film, the overwhelming sense of what-heck-feel is firmly against the viewer. I'm completely confused that this clumsy home video made it a production step. It should be a sequel, but it has no obvious connection with the first film. The hero has the same name, but this time "Alex" is a female, although we looked at the movie to stop thinking of all the muscles and barbarian nomads! <br /> <br /> There is really no plot at all, it's just a long-term chase, but it's so slow and pointless that calling this chasing scene makes this sound more interesting than it really is. There is almost no dialogue at all, which is just as good in terms of its quality, and then the film comes to an abrupt end after a blatant action show with a lot of gasoline explosions without ever explaining what it was. Fortunately, it never gets boring because it's always stupid and fake that is terrible! <br /> <br /> Terrible movies are usually just annoying, but Nemesis 2 is such a perfect mess that excessive severity and perfect abnormality is that it is really fun. Rent this movie or buy it even, you won't be disappointed!
