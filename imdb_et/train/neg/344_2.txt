Let me really make it clear about this movie. I didn't look at it because of the plot of the movie, I look at it for shiny sex elements. That's the way the movie is so terrible terrible that I have to miss the sight of seeing the divine body of Trac (Mandy Schaffer) and grounding my eyeballs for a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert The first scene in the movie was already up to me ... you see a woman who paints something by the lake, in pure bliss and calm, then the beautiful girl approaches and asks if she could paint next to her. When they both ended, they showed each other what they had done ... and the woman painted VINEYARD, HOW IS LAKE INFRONTIDA. What kind of screwdriver would such a mistake be? And in the second scene, Trac can kill his teacher lover with a shredder and then swim away and no city police ever doubts him. I mean HELLOOOOO? MANDY IS NOT VISITING HIGH? His fingerprints are all in God's god boat! After that it becomes worse when Mandy is around, playing a "cool" sound effect that sounds like a hissy fit cat. It's also a real pity that Rosanna Arquette is in this movie. I feel like he has to celebrate this super low budget with soft porn. The same goes for JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who also has stars in this movie. In summary, 2/10.
