After hearing this movie for years, I finally decided to rent and watch it. Let me start by saying that I'm glad the rent was free from the local library. This move was slow, boring, unrealistic and the plot didn't make sense. After two hours, I was ready to put this core in the city of Texas and put their group of characters in their misery. I understand that the taste is subjective, but believe me, I just don't understand the hippo I've heard about this movie. Dallas gave this film a good overview of Texas. Hire it only if you want to understand how movie studios can pay enough money to assessers to convince the public that a bad movie is good.
