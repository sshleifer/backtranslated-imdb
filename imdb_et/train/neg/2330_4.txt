I liked how it started, with some special special effects, especially for a 50-year-old movie. There was a pretty impressive landscape. But the film strikes quite early with some very foolish dialogue, as men try to flirt with Anne Francis "Altaira Morbius." <br /> <br /> Looking at it in the 90s after a long absence, it was fun to see Francis again The film has mostly been released on television and is still in operation. It was also interesting to see a young man, Leslie Nielsen ("Dr. John J. Adams"), whom I would not have recognized if there was no voice. <br /> <br /> I watched half of this movie before boredom became almost overwhelming and I had a strong desire to go to sleep. I appreciated these VHS tape replay in stereo. but it was a weak effort. This is one of those overpriced movies where the "elite" thinks it is "hard" and "thought-provoking". It's a mess. It only appeared to be "intelligent" because the other 50's sci-fi movies were so stupid! <br /> <br /> Some if early scenes would have seen on the grand screen what I wasn't writing at. Maybe another look - this time the 2.35: 1 widescreen transmission would make me change this review.
