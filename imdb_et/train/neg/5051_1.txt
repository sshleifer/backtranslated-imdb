I'm both entertaining and disgusting people who claim that this movie is so precise about Vietnam and NEVER there. This movie is about the same for the whole Vietnam War, because beating Rodney King is true for all police officers. Yes, bad things (and did) happen, but in general there are people like you and me. They have morals, they didn't kill the machines, they don't make drugs. Freedoms were an exception in Vietnam, not a rule. They happened much less often than "hype" led you to believe. Oliver Stone has the ability to make films that show the Vietnam War as such a brutal blood region, but are actually based on as much as Star Wars. If you honestly believe in Vietnam's stereotypes, do yourself a favor and learn the truth. Fact: Viet Cong and NVA did much worse things for South Vietnam than any soldier in the US armed forces. Fact: World War II soldiers generally treated the enemy generally worse than Vietnamese soldiers and they were WELCOME when they came home. The old Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; Although the war fought badly from a political point of view, no one could ask more of his soldiers, and it is a great service to argue that such "mostly true" fiction is how things really were.
