What do you get when you mix the cliff and the undirected pace and the group of characters you don't care for, and the unsuccessful attempt to create an attractive visual style and even more clicks and a weak sense of humor and really big budget? Why, you get one of the most intolerable movies ever made! Of course I refer to Domino. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the things people say when watching this movie: <br /> <br /> "Ooh, wow, the story has been talked about sequentially, which hasn't been done a billion times before. And much more skillfully as in this movie. "<br /> <br />" Wow, look at all the flashing and grainy film texture and work The director is trying so hard to do things for artistic and visual style creation! It's just too bad that none of these effects adds anything "It's not so good for the film, and it doesn't make sense for the scenes they are, and it's too bad for most of them to be so irritating!" <br /> <br /> "I've heard that about twenty thousand movies were exchanged for the dialogue!" "I've seen this scene about thirty thousand movies before!" <br /> <br /> "That's it!" <br /> <br /> hours ago? this should be surprising? <br /> "I can't believe how big this dialogue is. "<br /> <br />" How long is it? I feel like I've been watching it for over four hours. "<br /> <br />" I have no idea what just happened, but I don't feel particularly motivated to try it. "<br /> <br />" Is it still over? "<br /> <br />" I want my money back. "<br /> <br />" The songs in this soundtrack have been misused here. "<br /> <br />" It is ironic that all the churches they use will reduce the impact of everyone. "<br /> <br />" UGH. "<br /> <br /> And finally," Maybe I should end my friendship with the person who suggested this movie to me. "<br /> <br /> All in all, this movie has failed. fire and this movie plays in the only room that is not flammable, you should seriously consider burning alive. <br /> <br /> (If I sound bitter, I just spent more than two hours watching this movie and enjoyed it very much.)
