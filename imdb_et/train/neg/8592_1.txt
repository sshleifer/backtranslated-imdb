Making a film that limits prequels and the "real" Star Wars trilogy would even be charged by a great filmmaker. Mr Lucas is not the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> A good person in the dark needs a good actor ... Mr Christensen is not an actor. <br /> <br /> The first 60-80 minutes are predominantly boring, but only a few pockets that still have much lighter saber fighting, but there is a lack of edge because you already know the main characters remaining in the original Star Wars . <br /> <br /> Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) is very short here and the best idea is that Jar Jar Binks is silent! <br /> <br /> No, the movie will not only allow the Chancellor to turn on the Jedi and he will have one big (long-term) sequence on the fall of the stage
