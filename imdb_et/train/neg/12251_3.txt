Oh, CGI. Blessing when used correctly. It is a sin used by people who have no idea what they are doing. Unfortunately, this is not the only thing badly used in this awkward jaw. <br /> <br /> Ok, someone who has read the comments I posted has probably noticed 2 things. 1: I like low budget horror movies. And 2: If you have a cute guy in a low budget movie, I usually run them out. So, we can just get this way right away. This is one low budget horror movie I didn't like. Functioning, mostly, is a terrible, ridiculous effect and script rivals with Battlefield Earth as the worst thing I admit this year. As for the resident cute boy ... Dax Miller (Bog) won the prize. This boy is hot! And surprisingly, he is not just a tinted body with beautiful eyes and a lovely butt ... he can actually act (well, as much as possible on this strange film). Now that we have housework, let's go on with it. <br /> <br /> The Cliff Notes version has a story here (don't worry, I'm trying to give you nothing) ... <br /> <br /> The film crew is driving to a remote island to film a movie from two surfers (a lovely boy and his friend) who surf the sharks. To them unknown is a rather large salt water crocodile located on the island. Croc appears, chaos arises and people eat. Roll-end credit. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, this movie captures a lot. It started pretty well, but soon it went stupid and stupid. The main character turns into lunch (quite humorous) and our other heroes provide one liner at the expense of the victims. Also, if this crochet is at the top of the food chain both in the countryside and in the water, what are all the sharks? If this thing can eat a 40 foot boat, I don't think a couple of dusky sharks would stay around. FX is some of the worst I've ever seen. CGI is terrifying and they have even managed to turn the animatronic crocs together. Attention, filmmakers. National Geographic. Discovery Store. Croc Hunter. They know what crocodiles are. Obviously, they did not refer to one of them in view of the monster observed at the end of the film. And what is a pirate / drug thrust? Did you just need another reason to abduct a woman? <br /> <br /> It's funny how we get little sub-genres in the film world. With Alligator and its aftermath, Lake Placid, Crocodile and now Blood Surf, it now looks like "oversized crocodile / alligator" movies should now become their category Blockbuster. The alligator was good. Lake Placid was good. I even thought that the Tobe Cooper crocodile was good. Bleeding, sucked. <br /> <br /> My Class: D-
