Oh what a failed movie! In Los Angeles, at the heart of the universe, from the POV of Hollywood filmmakers, this film seeks to be a deep social commentary on the nervousness of a modern American. <br /> <br /> Stereotypical, fragrant characters who are crossbreeding with very different socio-economic backgrounds in their daily, bad lives. The plot is scattered and desultory. Several unimaginable plot controls keep the movie going, like: timing, an abandoned child who has left a weed, a murderer who threatens a lawyer, a boy who travels through the night sky city, a boy in a summer camp. <br /> <br /> And through all these events, one constant help of sociological knowledge spread through dialogue is because the characters compare their life experiences. One sign tells the other: "If you are sitting on this thing (Grand Canyon), you will understand what our people are, ... these stones are laughing at me, I can say, I and I am concerned; real humorous for this Grand Canyon". <br /> <br /> And another character event about this meaning: "In this country there is a gap, an ever-expanding gulf between people who have things and people who are not I ... it's like this big hole on the ground opened up, as big as ... Grand Canyon, and what has come out ... is a rage of rash and rage causing violence ... ". <br /> <br /> Apart from the terribly unnatural and forced dialogue, in addition to the low, scented character, the local tempo is agonizingly slow after the foolish plot. Action is weaker and more perfect. The film's tone is secret and self-satisfied, the script's contempt for viewers. <br /> <br /> This was a Hollywood-approved film project that boasts of being an omnipotent guru looking high. They think their film is a surprising revelation for the humble, ignorant filmmakers who want to learn the true meaning of American social change.
