Who wrote the script for this film does not deserve to work in Hollywood at all (not even live there) and these participants have to find another job. The most terrible hour of my life and a few minutes ... and I only looked to see if it would improve, which unfortunately wasn't for me. <br /> <br /> Even at the end, the credit gave me anxiety. I think there were not many people behind the film that they had to roll the credit slowly ... very slowly. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a great "How not to make a movie". Too bad I can't give 0.
