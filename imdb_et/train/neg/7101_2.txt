I'd give this movie from ten, but I'll give it two. Reason One thing is that Shah Rukh Khan appears on the film, which is not really the reason. The last point is that Rani appears in this movie and makes Kamal with smoochi. I love Rani very much and I have the honor of being a great actor. That's why I didn't enjoy him in the movie that kissed Kamal, but he's not big. Anyway, this movie is enough for a noticeable bedroom that made this movie noticeable. Is it good or bad, I think it's a completely garbage movie that made me wake up. I'm a fantastic critic, you see my other 250+ reviews, when I click on my name, I have a great taste. The film is not fun, there is one thing and if it is expected to be a hard hit with cinema, then why is there no morality in this movie. His biased film that is not a real story and it smells. Looking at how Kamal kisses these actors, makes me sick, but man can't kiss.
