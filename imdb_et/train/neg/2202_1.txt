This film makes me think that the others I saw with Combs are an accident. The plot had more holes than I think I've ever seen in a movie that's more than a "b" movie. It was so ridiculous that even the memories of the past of the combs in the camp could not save it. Considering the script, I have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas. I'm totally disturbed that I paid Blockbuster prices for this trash. The fact that this was done on television was something that would have helped me to prevent this fear and, frankly, something that filmed this poor should warn you. Avoid this movie.
