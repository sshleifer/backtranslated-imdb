The landscape is beautiful and the dog is cute. Moreover, this film has nothing to suggest. Jack Warden is pleasantly brilliant as usual, but the script is so terrible that even when he comes out badly. The plot doesn't make sense, dialogue is stupid, and there are many minor mistakes. But the dog is cute ...
