Really bad sequel. Part 1 was a lot of funny moments - Part 2 is just bad (boring) and apparently made out of fans for money. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Otto Waalkes! <br /> <br /> The only amusing moment in the movie is Helge Schneider, who seems to be with other characters. It's easy to find him ... <br /> <br /> Manuscript is sloppy / non-existent. The director should do everything in his power and stop working immediately. Action is worse than a class 2 school game. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is terrible, but who can blame the operator / sound boys who had to work with such an unauthorized director?
