as an inspiring director himself, this film had an exciting view of criticism. Shot with lower end digital camera probably with 35mm adapter for DOF. Editing is good, sound effects are not too high. I would have given her 7 movies, but this story is not so interesting. It is more on the drama side, with the characteristic developments than the glow of horror. Frankly, this film would be good if we were still in the 50's. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a family with a dry field, and that's exactly what it is.
