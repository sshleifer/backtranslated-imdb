A terrible and terrible wolf. The young "Red" carries a full make-up and very short shorts. I went for about 20 minutes and realized that it could be a pedophile dream. "Up-beat" music sounds like something I would hear in a striptease club. I think this movie is a sick joke - it's not a family movie. Joyful, glad I look at this daughter, I don't want her to think that families have to watch a child's porn as usual. Very bad, very sad it is sold as a family movie, Joey Fatone is probably embarrassing. And what is advertising as "special effects spectacular" ??? Impacts look low on budget, terrible.
