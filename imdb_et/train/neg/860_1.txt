Kubrick replies to the king. In the spring of 1980, it seemed so promising, I remember. Then a movie came out and Kubrick's bodybuilders have since slipped with the kingdom. <br /> <br /> Royal bodybuilders say that Stanley Kubrick took a great fear story and destroyed it. Kubrick's cultures don't give King's story. They're talking about Steadicams, tracking pictures, camera corners. This is a film they require: it should be treated separately. As happens, both bearings are correct. Sorry. <br /> <br /> When one sees it as a pure king's novel adaptation, "The Shining" is indeed a failure, a wasted opportunity, a botched narrative gambit. <br /> <br /> I accused it of Kubrick's scriptwriter. Writer Diane Johnson (author of Le Marriage, L'Affaire, Le Divorce and others) is a novel writer of social behavior. Perhaps he was chosen to grasp his marital relationship or family dynamics. But the little Blue-collar city of Sidewinder, Colorado does not exist on any map of its Francophile universe. <br /> <br /> Kubrick Anglofil apparently found her inborn. He is, of course, a true author. Given his own strength, his "The Shining" scenario - his mishmash of abnormal psychology, rationalism, supernaturalism, and presumed reincarnation - is simply a logical analysis. <br /> <br /> I'm ready to consider Kubrick's "Shining" on his own terms. I'm even ready to do anything other than the usual horror genre movie. But it also fails as a natural study of isolation, alienation, and madness. In both ways, the film is filmed quite a lot. <br /> <br /> Are Overlook Hotel Horrors Real? Or do they only exist in mind - first of all, as Danny Torrance suffers from sudden nightmares, then his father's hallucinations? Notes how each time Jack Torrance speaks with a "ghost," he actually looks in the mirror. It is noted how the hotel's frozen topiary-hedge cookie symbolizes Jack's complicated, twisted psyche. Very deep things. <br /> <br /> If Overlook's "ghosts" really are a manifestation of Jack Torrance's growing madness, who exactly lets the trapped Jack out of the hotel kitchen's dead bed so that he can go on a rampage of his climatic ax drive? <br /> <br /> And can anyone explain that Nicholson's black-and-white photo (helpful with "1921") is tuxedoed - will it appear on the left-hand side of the hotel and after the hotel closing-seconds on the hotel-ballroom wall? Do we have to seriously conclude that Jack Torrance's Bad Craziness results from some "past life" experience? (And if you swallow it because if reincarnated people should have accurate physical copies in the past?) Kubrick may not have known his story. Maybe I just wanted to create a mood of horror. Anyway, the film tries to mitigate its narrative contributions - that way, rational, and supernatural. As a result, the story is confusing. This film has not improved with age and does not improve with repetitive views. <br /> <br /> I do not deny that a few moments of fear, claustrophobia and general creepiness have been scattered throughout this long period of time. long movie. But those who have been looking at elevators slightly in Danny's vision are absurd and ridiculous. And Jack Torrance's infamous label lines ("Wendy, I'm at home!" And "Heeeeeere's JOHNNY!") Only punch the dramatic tension of the film and scatter your narrative energy. (I know: I was sitting in the theater and listening to the audience who smiled at the comic relief: "Whew! We are glad we don't have to take this stuff seriously!" Finally, Kubrick is completely at sea - or otherwise completely cynical - during the scenes where Wendy is driving empty around the hotel when his wife catches his son's son. Lobby full of mummified guests, everyone sitting there dead in their party hats? Yikes, now I'm afraid. wanted. Shelley Duvall as Don Knot's female version of The Ghost and Mr. Chicken is best kept silent. <br /> <br /> This movie just doesn't succeed - not customization, not your own terms. It probably deserves 3 out of 10, but I give it to 1 because it is so highly appreciated in the forum.
