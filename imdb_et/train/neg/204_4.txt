The perfect murder is when a woman (played by Mary Ellen Trainor, the wife of Robert Zemeckis, the leader of this episode) who murders her husband with poker, has been unsuccessful in accepting a visitor when he starts moving outside his body. Claus's suit (played foolishly by Larry Drake). He lives for his life, trying to find a man's death. He decides to use an ax when he has finished Santa's killer, who is unable to chop down a woman's head to kill the murderer of her husband. Santa's killer locks him in the closet and continues with the girl's girlfriend, trying to relieve her desperately. <br /> <br /> This TALES episode from CRYPT simply recovers tired material that includes the old "Santa Kills". theme, while also adding frequently used (add a museum) murders - from her husband-to-man routine. It's essentially Trainor, who is trying to find a way to prevent the body from catching, while keeping a safe distance from mania. There is nothing refreshing or new about this plot, which is quite moving through the movements. None of the highlights of the exhibition.
