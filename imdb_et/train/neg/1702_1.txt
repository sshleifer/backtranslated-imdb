Let's face it here: the only reason someone bought it is the only reason someone looked at it, and the only reason someone could claim it is because David Lynch did it and you want to get David Lynch's children. But guess what? Even David Lynch can create a piece. <br /> <br /> Maybe Lynch wanted you to go beyond normality and experience absurdity as a pure knowledge object. Perhaps scary, cofofistic, and chicken-scratch visions mean something from the place of humanity in the world, from our relationship to reality, to its absurdity. <br /> <br /> Instead, it just tells me one thing: I just lost $ 20. <br /> <br /> When I insult my offensive, I can crank Hansen high and let me bleed with ears. If I wanted absurdity after absurd, I could just put it on the plate and watch it be 33 minutes. <br /> <br /> Dumbland has one quality of redemption - it's meta-meta-funny. That means it's so bad that it's not even funny because it's so bad. But this fact is a little funny. <br /> <br /> If you hate yourself and hate your money, buy Dumbland. If not, save yourself embarrassed.
