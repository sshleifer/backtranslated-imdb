I knew this movie was not amazing, but I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm a fan of Luke Wilson, so I thought it was potential. Unfortunately, a lot of movie dialogue was very fake and bright. I think Aquafresh gave some money to film production, because they dropped some tips seriously. There's a shot where the Aquafresh sign pulls out of you so you can't figure it out. Perhaps they would have had to focus on writing and acting more than once if we could fall into Aquafresh's products without being annoyed. The moments of the movie were, but I'm glad the theater didn't see it.
