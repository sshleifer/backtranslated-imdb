OK, it's very rare that I complain about something I do for FREE. So I think this movie pushed me to this limit. I saw it at the Hollywood Cemetery for FREE and walked very disappointed. One of the audience member's questions to a director who uses native American references just like "bookends", instead of getting a better bow to the movie, basically tells what this film FAILED is. <br /> <br /> Native American REFERENCES --- Native American references really felt at times and lived. It is obvious that this director and writer tried to solve an arena that they never played before. They should have adhered to the old wording "write something you know". If they actually experienced it, it certainly didn't show in the movie or the beauty of this unique culture was not given correctly. <br /> <br /> Clichés and NOSES --- I agreed to watch this movie because it was indie. So I thought it was a bigger expectation. "Little Miss Sunshine" was indie and saw it before it became so popular. Before it even came out for extensive release, I was already looting how it strikes. UNFORTUNATELY I couldn't say the same "expiration date". "Sunshine" led us to cliché incidents, but the filmmakers were so clever that the result would lead us in another direction, avoiding the "cliché" trap. On the other hand, this film had no chance of falling into the trap because it was TRAPPED from the beginning. Psychiatrists, Hendrix couple, etc. I hate to say this, but the best and WORST movie I saw this year were both indies. "Little Miss Sunshine" is the best and this film is the worst. I wish I could say otherwise. <br /> <br /> But I congratulate the filmmakers for coming out of their family at the cemetery.
