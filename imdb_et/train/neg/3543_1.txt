For a couple of years already lurking. I have never been posted here, so maybe this film is worth it, but I doubt it. I just looked at it on DVD, being caught in the movies due to the disease and never looking at it. I had not read it widely, certainly not for a few months even thinking about the film. That was just what a friend got in the shop, so he looked. <br /> <br /> Bad error. <br /> <br /> The picture I was talking about in the summary is on a trailer and poster. Jason Statham has the hair straight down. Like no other GR movie. Or any JS movie I've seen. At least not in the quantities shown here. And Ray Liotta's panties should be warned beforehand. It's scary and funny, but not ha-ha-humor. It is almost a -Office-but-slightly mutated and so-unsuccessful sense of humor. They both say the same thing: "This movie isn't like what you expect this movie to be." <br /> <br /> Now, assuming the previous, extensive movie viewing experience, this movie has some things. Similar: <br /> <br /> () Coherent, <br /> <br /> () Interesting or interesting, <br /> <br /> () There is no complete and complete distance to navel viewing, <br /> <br /> () Something more meaningful than a dirty bad realized fabelle, just an ordinary eastern mystical ideology dressed as a "cool, modern, self-conscious art form," <br /> () . <br /> <br /> As you thought in my tone, it was unable to thoroughly check any of the boxes above. Instead it was: <br /> <br /> (x) Poorly edited {tempo all over the shop, 70's-amateur high-8 style jumps, incomprehensible "plot" "delivered by hackneyed flash-back assemblies, I could go ...}, <br /> <br /> Shot like a depressed 14-year-old goth who would just spent the weekend watching Truffaut and Godard with lining being pulled <br /> <br /> (x) So he's behind the whole "I'm really smart, I" motif / message that he has decided to repeat it every 20 minutes or just, make sure that stupid people (ie everyone who doesn't like it) are convinced by the audience that they get to the point, <br /> <br /> (x) The real waste of my time. <br /> <br What about some people's undoubted ability to "get" something about it, good. I'm glad you did it one poster said something that attracted my attention: under 25 years of age it was better understood because of editing. delta accessible, not less. As for the "enlightened" brigade of "Genius," then the onion onions and grow. There is nothing more than a self-serving and self-serving person than people who say why another person does not know great art because they do not understand the "craft / material / month cycle / filaments that are extremely reasonable" by the "author" poet / artist / palm reader / idiot savant uses his vision / great scheme / unity to explain Gaea / great dog disease. <br /> <br /> More people for me and for many, its garbage. <br /> <br /> Movies, art, stories, poetry, something that is meant to look at another person should be involved and moving. In some way, be it metaphorical, spiritual, emotional or whatever you have. <br /> <br /> The only way it spent me was to move forward, two hours closer to my own inevitable death. "The biggest trick he ever pulled out was that you believe that no part of this movie meant anything at all" <br /> <br /> And, please, please first roast my buns for me.
