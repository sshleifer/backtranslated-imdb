The poorly developed plot line, which makes almost no sense for the final downturn for bad dialogue and divorced scenes, is bad behavior (even Peter Falk can't find his way) "Finding John's Christmas" is better. Ms. Bertinelli's presentation is without depth or emotion, like her companions, William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt for Noah's love. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the daughter of a single father, Noah, is almost unbearable to watch, not to mention singing. But who can blame them with such material. Michael J. Murray's script is at best a minor. <br /> <br /> Every year, I look for TV guides and look forward to some really classic Christmas and inspirational holiday movies appearing on small screens. Movies like "Miracle on the 34th Street", Ernst Lubitsch's pleasant "Shop around the corner" and of course "Scrooge" 1951. There are Frank Capra's classic "It's Great Life" and "Meet John Doe". Hey, forget the classic. But "Home Alone" or "Home for the Holidays" with Holly Hunter and Robert Downey Jr. <br /> <br /> My gift is for you. Your time would be better when you search for "Finding John's Christmas". Merry Christmas!
