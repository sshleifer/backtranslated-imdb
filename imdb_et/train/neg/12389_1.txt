Chris McCormack (Margaux Hemingway) is violently raped by a sister Kathy (Mariel Hemingway) teacher (Chris Sarandon). He's going to court, but he's totally free. Kathy then shakes! <br /> <br /> Returnable and sick rape film. This film was promoted as a dramatic rape. This is a badly written and (mostly) badly acting drama. He wants to be a rational victim of rape but captures our face. But, quite frankly, Hemingway's behavior in this order is so bad that he loses any real influence he might have. Study scenes were boring and predictable. And the film went too far when 15-year-old Mariel was raped (luckily it wasn't shown). I admit that it brought a great ending when Margaux grabbed the gun and let Sarandon die. But seriously - because of the rape of young people is violent. <br /> <br /> Operation doesn't work. For example, Margaux was not an actor. He was certainly a beautiful woman (and the real model I believe), but his action was much desired. It reduces the film. Mariel was just OK, but it was one of her first films. Sarandon does what he can as a rapist. He wasn't bad, but the terrible script worked against him. <br /> <br /> I remember that, as we screened out in 1976, some women rose up and rejoiced when Sarandon was killed so that it could be some people. I found it boring, simplified and really sick. 1 all the way.
