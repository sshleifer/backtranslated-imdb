I ever promised that I would never go out of the movies (a personal policy that made me suffer from a variety of bars, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact), but Mr Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a truly terrible experience. Anyone who sees this movie thinks the Austrians are an unhappy and pathetic heap. It shows a world where love and humanity do not exist, a world in which people humiliate each other for one reason only, to repel their unhappy existence. Choosing a documentary style with non-professional actors (most of them looking directly at the Austrian shock-cartoonist Deix's imagination), Director Seidl wants us to believe that this is a real life in the suburb of Austria (Europe? Western?). The viewer is confronted with the violence, madness and deterioration of the genital organs, women and disabled people. But this is not social criticism. It's just a pure shock without aesthetic value. Instead, you get a bad actor, bad cinematography, bad movie making. If someone needs such a movie to understand that things are wrong in our society, then that person must live with the eyes closed. This is the pseudo-social criticism associated with the sled. And it sees people terribly exhausting. It shows ugly people - this is not the reason why I hate it. But it depicts an average person ugly and misanthropic. And that's why this movie is really despicable.
