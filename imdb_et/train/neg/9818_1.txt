In my opinion, this film raises a number of pressing questions. First, how has Jennifer Tilly managed to maintain the career of all these filmmakers with this ridiculous voice and the very limited hammy facial expressions she uses? Second, what on earth were people responsible for thinking about this offensive and deeply repelling movie? And thirdly ... considering that people were perverted enough to decide to do so, there should not be enough in the system - studio, distributors, or anywhere - to prevent it from actually being stopped and released. You should really look for a very long way to make another movie so deeply disgusting as it is ... and it hasn't even been paid as a horror movie - which, if it can be considered a genre of any legitimate movie, is definitely. The film strikes the worst madness, violence and abuse from start to finish and has no redemption qualities at all. I'm not really in favor of censorship (what I don't believe) ... but I don't really see how anyone might think that doing something like that would make something positive.
