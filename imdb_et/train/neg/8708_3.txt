Like all Carnosaur films, this is a joke. How dinosaurs move, reminds me when my sister plays with her dolls because they can't be stronger or fake than they were. <br /> <br /> The plot didn't make any sense. I mean, first they're on the bus, then in the store, maybe they're on the boat. And let's be serious, does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can stay with a cargo plane or on a ship? I thought the biggest animals were dinosaurs and now they can move to the bath. It seems stupid even when you think about it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave it is that it is still fun. I found it better than the first one (not yet seen by another). Just, don't rent it. I saw it on television and that's a good thing I did because I didn't want to rent money.
