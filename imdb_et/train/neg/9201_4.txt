This is a film that represents the fear of the 80s (and even today) D & D. Fear that people who play D&D (or some other role playing in this game) are "sucked" and lose the ability to distinguish reality from fantasy (and continue killing trees, child victims, suicides, etc.). A good movie for anyone who wants to blame society for living objects, but anyone who has played a role play, a video game, or even played it will play as an insult to their intellect. This is D & D for Wargames computers. Plus as a movie, it just sucks.
