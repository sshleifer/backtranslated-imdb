The best thing about this movie is that if you are a fan of Sonny Chiba, this movie will give him a lot. Chiba speaks; Chiba creates; Chiba despises; Chiba takes pictures with the camera; Chiba strikes and kills live sushi from a whole host of bad guys; Chiba sits on sofas and chairs and looks thoughtful / meaningful; Chiba is driving his car ... <br /> <br /> I enjoy Chibat as an actor and martial artist, but even for a Chiba fan, this movie may be too much for Sonny Chiba. It's obviously something empty for him. And no, I don't put "Street Fighter" in the same category because "SF" plays his ruthless, immoral anti-hero and shares the camera with intriguing friends and enemies. Here he is in the front and middle almost all the time and he is trying to be Batman, Captain America and Bruce Lee rolled into one. Toshiro Mifune and Chow Yun Fat could not pull it out for the entire length of the feature film, and Sonny just takes his greeting. At least he could have changed from time to time. <br /> <br /> The movie is further interrupted by a completely free and badly made introductory sequence (probably the American version of the front of the film touched) and a funny cheer ("Viva !! Chiba !! Viva !! Chiba !!) that starts doing things wrong foot. There is somewhat amazingly amateurish and inappropriate dubbing - Sonny (or his usual English stand-in) probably couldn't interfere with the American version of the vocal, so they got a somewhat bad command with a completely different and smoother voice and dialect, which is quite jarring from the face we all know and love "Street Fighter". <br /> <br /> Even with all these drawbacks and over-exposures, it can still be a small classic, but camera work and fight scenes are hopelessly cheeses. I'm ready to believe that Karate actually works when someone is as amazing as the Chiba character should do it, but the director and cameraman grounded their stakes with beating and editing fighting scenes with weed control so you can't really see what most of the time is. It's not all bad: there are some decent shots and compositions, and there is at least one memorable and spooky moment when bad guys appear in the client's bedroom in a truly inventive way. <br /> <br /> And like a real plot ... forget about it. For the "bodyguard", Chiba's character is something idiot. The scenario depends on her mistakes and reviews, which will make her (and her "client") repeatedly in dangerous situations so that she can get out of them and after 30 minutes she will even make the toughest decisions to think that this man should be any good. (Likewise, if his character had really removed Japan's drug trafficking, he would have taken his client's neck for 10 minutes and shook him until his teeth burst like a chestnut until his small secrets fell out ... and much would be useless Death and Conflict.) <br /> <br /> However, this movie is far from the bottom of the barrel. It's still Sonny Chiba, and he's still having fun watching. I paid a box to get it from a favorable DVD stand at a local mega mart, and I think it was worth it once.
