It is interesting to read the comments of the viewers regarding the Omega code ... many overwhelmingly positive comments were almost literally lifted from the TBN programs ... the film looks like it would have been made to go directly to the video, in addition to the three -partner-to-host migration series made for some by another religious group in the 70s. Don't remember that? You can't remember it in one or two years. This is the first movie I ever saw where it meant it was your religious obligation to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save the souls ... very disgraceful ... it just shows that when you're on TV son, you can also play a high quality Hollywood producer who lil no ladies tenth money ...
