The film is as fun as the sunshine. Sheriff Pataki is a complete retard that loves doing something better than sitting behind his fat, making a ring of smoke on his swollen cigars and drinking while the doctor acts like a zombie version of Nicholas Cage sucking up all the "blood" , which actually seemed to be a fruition. <br /> <br /> Most of the drawings seemed very frightening to even call this movie piece. The rest of the characters in this movie are a waste of time, the end was terrible, the contours were cheesy and the scenes were terrible. What more should I tell you about the viewers there? My suggestion would be to get your Rabies when you've been watching the movie. If you didn't get your fresh shots, this movie could give you a mouth.
