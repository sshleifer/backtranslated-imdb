This movie was stupid. Bad everything. Why is it that we, who love western films, are beaten ten times nine times by renting the West. It seems that if you don't see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner or Tom Selleck on the cover, it's not worth it. Most of the time, Shiloh Falls' core business took place in 1892, but the revolvers used were models from the 1860s. Even the shooting was bad - one scene recorded a marshal of six shooters about nine times and could not hit any of the three big men who were only about 20 meters away. I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes. Perhaps those who participated in this film could have learned the lesson at Sunset Carson's show school.
