I've only seen Gretchen Moli in two other movies (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco) and she doesn't remember her, but she did a great job as a naive girl who depicted pictures because it made people happy. <br /> <br /> He didn't really think what he was doing was wrong even when he left the business and found his religion again. <br /> <br /> His photos were definitely today's standards and are funny, seeing men with cameras all excited and politicians despising the evils of pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night and Good Luck) played a big part here. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed the most outstanding biopsy for the most famous girl.
