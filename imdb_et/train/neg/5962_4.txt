Paul Naschy made many horror films. In terms of quality, they tend to vary from quite good to unobtrusive trash; and, unfortunately, the fear of the grave rises closer to the latter. The plot is just your average story of a witch, a wizard or (as here) killed, but not before you agreed with those who did it ... etc. one thing leads to another and pretty soon will be condemned again good. The plot is slow, painfully boring and the film seems to be pointless. The characters pull out the diatribe lines and never provide the movie in any way. Paul Naschy wrote the script and, if you ask me, he should act because the dialogue is extreme, and it is only meant to make the movie even more boring. Carlos Aured, who also led Naschy to the broken doll and the devil's curse in blue eyes, offers a more boring direction here that the dialogue doesn't help the movie. Sometimes such films have a certain charm for them; but not even the grave is feared. This is a painfully boring film with little or no interest.
