When the kidney stone ran through its healed urinary tract, the kidney stone was turned off, but nothing better than to let the painkillers forget about halfway, then I did with the film cable. I wouldn't want anyone to think I paid for watching this movie or renting it, or ??? sky hides! ? that I looked at STRAIGHT. <br /> <br /> Having played this sensationally frightening video game and eagerly capturing dead spaces and terrifying spaces that fought with a chariot (type 27), a hanging guy (type 041) and other impossible sentinels, my curiosity that the game was moved movie screen. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. <br /> <br /> The banal plot revolves around the group of "crazy kids" a Scooby Doo? s going around the island shaking the world, whatever it is. (You kids today with their hula-hoops and their mini-skirts and their pat With Boone?) After thousands of boat masters in cash to drive there (stupidity that creates their own rhetoric network), they find "rave" abandoned. <br /> <br /> Is the "house" mentioned? supposedly a dead house? but most of the operations take place in counterfeit outdoor conditions and in other places separated from any similarity in the haunted place of residence. <br /> <br /> The fallen camcorder acts as a rebound filler that shows the island ??? Party?! Is it all? Oh, so this "rave" thing is just a "party"? In large traditions of "used cars" to "pre-owned" or "shackle" as "post-traumatic stress disorder", the word "party" is now too square if you have drug additions, silicone implanted, metrosexual jagoffs? <br /> <br /> It is known that the party broke the zombies. Intelligent thinking stops here ?? <br /> <br /> I don't think pinheads, who themselves call screenwriters and directors, understand the zombie's revival hints. Zombies Can't Die? they are already UN-DEAD. They don't blood, they don't feel pain. When their bodies are completely destroyed, their animation continues. At least this is my jaman's witch priest tells me. <br /> <br /> Which means that .45 firing into their "hearts" is not going to stop them or machete the torso. And a shotgun blast on your chest will certainly not produce gout blood. At least in the logic of the video game, the shooter pumps as much circle into each monster that it is completely destroyed, leaving a frightening wall that cannot revive itself. <br /> <br /> However, every actor-slash-model gets the moment of their matrix-round camera, killing zombies on all fronts, with individual bullets and karate chimneys on the chest. Seriously, these zombies are less effective than the Stormtroopers "Jedi's Return", who throw them away with Ewoks. <br /> <br /> I think the movie writer Mark Altman, who is not too much - "Free Entrepreneurship" felt compelled to enter Captain Kirki's reference to the character of Jurgen Prochnow, who was in dire need of milk money to make this aromatic manure run appeared. There is also a reference to the role of Prochnow primo in the great "Das Boot" when one untrained B-actor mentions that he looks like a captain of a U-boat. "I don't know how the target audience of this movie is the target group of square pigs that pulled any butterfly's references to other films, as when Prochnow declares," Tell the girl against her little friend "by presenting her machine gun moment. /> <br /> For a demography who is not able to understand the concept of the video game Sisyphean's meaninglessness (ie the game ends if you cannot win), it is just a nonsense movie of frantic hence dying all over time, with the exception of the heterosexual couple of attractive white people. <br /> > The better use of this film's little but misused budget could have been casting in action by the School, although Ona Grauer's left chest did a good job, as did her right bra and these slomo scenes: priceless, especially the last scene where Ona tried to act, as he is bowed, but looks like he just eat ice cream too fast. <br /> <br /> Try to do something like this structuring my time with my time, I pulled out my digitally restored 35-year anniversary, a special edition, a wide-screen Anamorphic DVD "Manos: Hands on Fate". ? drugs were appropriately brain-stunning - now HERE was a high-quality film making ?? <br /> <br /> (Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)
