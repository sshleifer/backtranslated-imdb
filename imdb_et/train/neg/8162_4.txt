Your attitude to Prom Night II determines how much joy you take from the movie. If you expect a horror masterpiece, look elsewhere. If you like fun movies that are quite fun to watch, then you like it. Lisa Schrage has a lifetime playing Schrage's rage at the top of Mary Lou's and Wendy Loyd's channels when she "conquered". <br /> <br /> Not a classic cinema, but a fun five-hour kill with a bad tip. <br /> <br />
