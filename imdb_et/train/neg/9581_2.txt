This is the only thing I can say positively about this movie. Cleveland is a star, I've been there and never saw the city. Beautiful river and city views. <br /> <br /> This movie is moving at a pace they expect you will not notice the lack of real significance. People run and shoot weapons without consequences. For example, Rob Lowe is shooting at the house of a character - two cars are stolen, but the police don't see it much later. The anti-rental murder never seemed so unlikely. <br /> <br /> Who wrote this movie should have countless stories at the end of a movie. Many of the participants in this film are so much better. I check the date of the movie just to make sure it's not written during the writer's strike, but unfortunately it wasn't. This movie is currently rotating on Universal HD, unless you want Lowe to break, there is no reason to look at it.
