Man, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1) Adam Arkin is More Than Ross Geller 'Friends' <br /> <br /> 2) A lot is wasted (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) this amateur script. <br /> <br /> 3) The movie is suffering from a terrible pace. It jumps through confusion and confusion. <br /> <br /> 4) The story doesn't even make sense. Why does he want to break a football race? But fool with violin music? None of them has been explained. <br /> <br /> 5) It's not even funny. It's like a number of accountants trying to fix it, saying, "Look at me! Look at me I'm funny!" It was a bad attempt to make another "Love in the First Bite". <br /> <br /> I like the films of Larry Cohen, but the man he failed here. I couldn't wait to roll the credit. Terrified frustrated.
