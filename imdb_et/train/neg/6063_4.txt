"Horror Masters" have proven themselves as a poor arena of "messaging" programs, and while there may be a case for Joe Dante's "Screwfly Solution" (one of the best episodes of the series, period), most of the efforts to do so have come across as alasi-hard and unimpressive (nothing lets the horror more than a soapbox). And Pro-Life simply defends reactive views with ultra-violence; The young Angelique (Caitlin Wachs) we saw through the forests hit almost two doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) who just happen to work at a local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angelique's father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is a stone-cold, right-hand holy roll that does something to prevent his daughter from getting abortion. If anything else, Pro-Life was somewhat buzzing about its controversial issue, but John Carpenter treats this whole business with astonishing indifference - he seems even less interested in making a movie than the script itself (which is bad); the slow pace does not create tension and simply crawls the ambling plot. Even though Dwayne and his sons are sticking to a clinic, weapons are burning, this is a stunning non-event; Later, when the doctor is tortured with "male abortion", the scene must be released and unnecessary - trying to write a film. Poor performances (Perlman is unfortunately wasted here) are becoming a script, and Carpenter's direction feels exhausted as "Pro-Life" is the source of his next hot meal. By the time the spider-creature with the man's head and the man in latex monster fits the corridors, you just have to think about what you were thinking about this mess ...
