Believe it or not, this movie is worse than number three. is slower, the performance is worse, and the story is very weak. It's not much to say about this movie. number three, and I would have thought it was impossible. It's very slow for 90 minutes.painful, actually. if you really want to see this movie, you should try to find a cheap rental. It's hard to find (for purchase, that is,) and probably a good reason. like the third number, this film has nothing to do with the first twin. I can do my best: 2/10 without warning
