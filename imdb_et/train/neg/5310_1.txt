I don't know what this other review was about. This is definitely not a bimbo movie, I really don't think there was one good looking girl. No, it's just cheesy, poorly made, Ed Wood-style scientific literature. And it's bad. I can't even tell you how bad it is. I saw it late on the cable and I was in shock. The fact that this film has ever been released is offensive to us all. The actors were either friends of the producer or spiritually slowed down, the special effects are a joke and the pace is surprisingly slow. But for me this is the best music. A monkey could write a better theme toy with xylophone. Don't try this thing, but if you ever see the cable, look at it. You'll be surprised how bad the film is.
