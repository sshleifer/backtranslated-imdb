I really hate this show! I looked at one episode and I knew this exhibition was really terrible. The story lines are so badly written and executed and the jokes are really bad ... I mean it's just sh ++ ty rip-off from the Dexter laboratory and Johnny Quest. gene nurses and a talking dog; home-father and intelligent, extremely busy mother ... Like oh-my-flippin'-God! Their father is a mother-f ** family-maker, not gay! If my dad is a home maker, I'd die myself! Shame that is ... Really I would. <br /> <br /> I have nothing else ... this travesty, but only 3 words; read these 3 words to describe it: <br /> <br /> · Flat, stupid, and above all ... · F ** K UP! That's all I could say, that will definitely make my EV-ER list of my worst animated series! If I had it.
