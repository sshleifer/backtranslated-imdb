Soon after watching this movie, you understand why it didn't even bring it to the theater! This film does not deserve a "prequel" tag. Instead, it is a widespread topic in Hollywood, previously ripped off with good movies with catastrophic predictions, after-effects, etc. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film hit the whole place like a ping-pong ball and the character's evolution was non-existent. I was serious about watching comedy at some points in the movie because the actor was so bad. P Diddy must stop laughing at his terrifying action, he always made me laugh. <br /> <br /> The only good thing that comes out of this movie is Jaclyn DeSantis, who looks good in this movie, and actually enjoyed watching the movie while watching it. <br /> <br /> If you're a big Carlito's Way fan, I suggest you don't look at it. However, if you decide to look at it, treat this movie as if it were the original, because that's exactly what it did.
