Charlotte's deadly beauty and lethal blow make the film cooler than it would otherwise be. The story is so poor and Charlotte's character dies so stupidly that you don't know if it's the end they thought of this movie. I wish someone could say there is an alternative end, but I'm afraid it's not. As for the rest, I would say that they just didn't work very well; though the guilt must be put on a poor manuscript. This film reminds me of Rush Hour 2, where Zhang Ziyi dies in an absurd way, because he was the only one who had shown theft throughout the film. I can give this movie 2/5
