I caught this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival. I had not heard much about it; the only fact that it was a dense thriller was digitally shot at a very low budget. I was hoping to catch the next big Brit-Flick. But I have to say I was seriously disappointed. "This is not a love song" is followed by two criminals who, after a farmer's young daughter accidentally fired and killed, got into a cat and mouse deadly game when the locals decide to take things and hunt them. The real problem is that this is another example of the style of British film. Camera corners and editing are completely inconsistent with the story, as well as the top performance and the amazing use of slow motion, which only makes the whole thing a dear home. Repeatedly trying to watch the film nervous and sharp, which instead comes up both fun and over (Cue's pathetic, compulsory drug scene and countless, meaningless camera zooms). No amount of cliché obscures the fact that it's a pretty bad story. <br /> <br /> We have seen this type of thing several times before and made it a hundred times better, especially John Boorman's masterful "Deliverance". But in the last movie we took care of the characters in the characters, in this movie I just found that I want to hunt and kill as soon as possible. Even this would not have been so bad if their opponents were intimidated or worthy, but there is only a stereotypical, inbred-looking rural collection. Again, the second offensive, overwhelmed cliché that comes out. Are you sure there are some nice people in the country, filmmakers? <br /> <br /> "It is not a love song" has been protecting a couple of good, pausing moments, but it's hard to see anything other than going straight to the videos or pushing a very limited movie. This is not the last year's low budget hills that have plunged into the Mountain Dog "Dog Soldiers". Perhaps the British cinema can actually start again when the right money stops for the wrong people.
