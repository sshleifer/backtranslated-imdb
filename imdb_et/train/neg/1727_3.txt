We have a lake. We have an animated meteor. We have a killer stop-motion dinosaur with mites. Okay, we call this movie THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What else do we add? Hmm, two idiots called Arnie & Mitch to define the final definition of "comic relief". We also had a sheriff who doesn't really go in this movie and no one listens. Aw crap, we're over half the movie and we forgot to insert a bad boy! Don't worry, introduce a man with a mustache, let him rob a shop to show that he is a bad guy, let him jump somewhere near the lake, ask him to ride through the woods and do it just to get him like dinosaur snacks. It should work. <br /> <br /> Complete, clumsy confusion, this movie. Its logic spins your mind to force you to laugh. The first film with Dave Allen's "stop motion supervisor" feature. After that, he joined Charles Band for several years, until the mid-nineties, when Band ran to pay him money, I think. The dinosaur effects are charming and the whole movie is accidentally funny. Unfortunately, this is the only good thing to say about it. <br /> <br /> Good bad? Yes, yes. There should be sufficient reason in the lecture to list it. If not, Arnie & Mitch will do the tricks. 3/10 and 8/10
