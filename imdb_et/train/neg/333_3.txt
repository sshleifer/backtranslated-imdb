I remember when the Golden Child appeared in 1986, the critics universally putting it on, and I am so bad that it stopped more or less Eddie Murphy's shine career, so I think this film has something that goes for it. > <br /> It's going to a bad start where Buddhist monks kneel in front of their child with an empty expression. Bad guys enter the temple <br /> <br /> The baby is sitting in an empty word <br /> <br /> Bad guys cleaning the monks <br /> <br /> The Bad Sitting <br /> <br /> Bad guys Pull the giant bird into the cage and paste the baby inside who is sitting ... Go guess? You get the impression that even if they took him to bed at Michael Jackson's wonderland, he still gives the same empty expression, this film would be better titled "WOOD CHILD" <br /> <br /> a movie with a very strong pop soundtrack. Obviously, it would have been slow and funky, but now in 2004 it looks very dated. Not only that, but it completely breaks with a bloody hole. In fact, this is the main problem with this film (And the boy is serious) - the whole mood seems to change from the scene so much that sometimes it is like watching the scenes of different films. I blame the director personally, but it should also be noted that both the screenwriter and the producer should share the same charge. Did anyone know what movie it should be before shooting? It is part of fantasy, some of the martial arts, part of the movie, part of comedy and it's all nonsense
