This sequel is a complete transformation of the first film. A totally useless movie. Basically, he first took the first sceanrio of the first film and edited it in Omen IV, except this time for the female antichrist. It ends in the same way as the first one! Music is too busy and annoying, and because it's pretty much a copy of Omen I, it's extremely predictable. It's not a terrible movie, it's not terribly done, there's much worse movies, it just didn't make any sense. The 2006 Omenian Revolution is much worse, even more meaningless than that, so I think it is. If someone drove a gun with your head and you had to choose to watch this stage or the 2006 line, I think I'd choose it.
