this film, I do not call it "film", was basically nothing and mostly did not work for the time of popular action. yes, the war was in full swing (intended), and this film treated the soldiers and our audience. <br /> <br /> But let's do something a little more with the substance. <br /> <br /> Loved to see the young Buddy on the rums. music was good all the time. <br /> <br /> But another offspring will get old fast. <br /> <br /> I didn't even know Zero Mostel! so if you are one of the "biggest generation" as they say, you will enjoy this ... <br /> <br /> movie.
