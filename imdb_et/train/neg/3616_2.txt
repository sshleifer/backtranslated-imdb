If you only look at the cover of this movie, it's cool. DO NOT. The film itself made me sleep. It was a slow pace, the violence was minimal, and the relationship was bad. The action was the material of the lower feeder and the graph, although it would have been cool for some film, was badly shown here. They even kill the unique character of the whole movie! I'll give him two of the 10, because the only thing that was good was turning the plot at the end. In addition, you can save this movie in the trash.
