When I saw a preview of it on television, I thought "it's a good werewolf movie," but it wasn't. it wasn't scary at all! the action was good, the plot was terrible, the military offer was just stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel might be better than that. The film changed the sound as Arron turned into a werewolf, instead he turned the psycho and a bit of a doctor's throat. If you've read some other comments about other movies, everything is positive, but it's not just because the story was terrible. One in 10 max. I'm sure everyone was waiting for a werewolf, but I bet you don't expect it. Beyond Loch Nes was better than this movie, hell, all the movies on the sci-fi channel are better than this movie.
