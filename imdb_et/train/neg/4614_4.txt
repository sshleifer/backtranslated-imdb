It tells us how this film was nominated for the seven Oscars and won one. Not because it is uncertain or because of the collective powers of the creative team behind it, it should really deserve it, but because it has won Prizzi honor in every category. Some say that the old Hollywood pioneer John Huston had lost that point during this career, but I don't buy it. It wasn't until last year that he wrote an excellent article in the darkness study VOLCANO in Mexico. Prizzi's honor, on the other hand, is a film of star power, good intentions, and a decent script, which proves to be a big backlog. <br /> <br /> Female love gangster general tone and plot hit-man prefers quirky crimedies that caught Hollywood storm in the early 90s, but the script is too complicated for its own sake, motivations are off and the whole story seems uncertain as to exactly what it is trying to be: romantic comedy, criminal drama, gangster saga, etc. Jack Nicholson (making a Brooklin accent that works perfectly for De Niro but sounds insecure about Jack) and Kathleen Turner in leadership roles seem to be in paid mode. dreaming your way through some parts. Anjelica Huston, on the other hand, values ​​the better, but her performance is sabotaged by the motivations of her character: she begins her father's filial sacrifice, she proves that she supports the former spouse, then becomes a respectable bitch who wants a plate with her head. <br /> <br /> The film's colors are washed as it was done in the early 70s, and the direction of Huston is as interesting as everything else. There is a promise behind this story, and maybe the hungry driver has said it might have been better, but the left looks like a movie that no one was really interested in.
