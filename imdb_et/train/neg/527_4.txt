Create to die in a movie that is much smaller. Vanessa Redgrave dies, but before she goes, she starts talking to her daughter about the story of her life and secret love ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that has the look and feel of being a great movie just because they have so many great actors and actors so it seems to be something other than what it is. Not so bad, but Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Clare Danes, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all who give fine performances) expect more than a funny story that is a bit more as harlequin romance. <br /> <br /> Wait for the cable.
