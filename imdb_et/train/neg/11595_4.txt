STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Alice, at the end of the last movie Freddy, is now trying her Adjust life again. But his unborn child carries a spiritual presence - Freddy, who is trying to get back to his world. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that directors who received their big break led Freddy's films - Charles Russell (Eraser, The Mask), Renny Harlin (Long Kiss Goodnight, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2) and Here at Stephen Hopkins (Lost in Space, Predator 2.) But while Russell and Harlin did the work for that, Hopkins IMO has done something that must be quickly forgotten, a story. <br /> <br /> The story is obviously stretched as far as it can go, Freddy's ridiculously father himself and a ridiculous spiritual spirit. Even after about an hour and a half, it's all quite tiring and of course not scary at all. <br /> <br /> "Bon appetit, bitch" catch-phrase is the only memorable point of this second. smart very forgotten entrance. *
