I felt the brain dead, I'll tell you. This is the worst film I've ever bought. (from my ignorance I thought it was the same name as Peter Jackson). The performances are so terrible that they are ridiculous. The special effects have not seen the test of time and look awful. The script promotes such a television movie, looked at the average distance. The cast looks like they have taken Joey Tribbian's lessons, have a look at everyone and stay with it. I have never been confused with the pros until I started watching it. Whether it is a dream or no plot is not so terrible that frustration within a few minutes. Avoid like plague.
