The mirror. Mirror (1990) is a flat film. Why did I see this when watching younger movies? Who knows? Maybe I was one to punish myself, watching one terrible movie after another. I don't know, I think I had a hobby during the teenage years. Rainbow Harvest tries to console in the old mirror. Soon he will learn the terrible power that this antique mirror uses and uses to defeat those who have wronged him. Such films, the power provider, have a nasty side effect. It changes her inside and out if she likes it or not. <br /> <br /> The movie's mess, which for some reason was restored to d.v.d. few years ago. I do not know why. They should have left it on the shelf and collected dust. People love this movie for some reason. If you do, I'd like to know why. So far, I don't like this movie and I have no reason to look at it again. <br /> <br /> Not recommended at all.
