Give me your money back! Give me my life back! Give me some credit. This movie was worth the vomiting. Useless and time consuming. What a waste of energy and totally pointless. Okay, I understand the premise and the idea, but give us a break! Next time give me the money and let me spend it. Missing child, mothers regret, accused spouse! Clich√© yes ~! Get Life! I'm sorry, but this movie was a complete waste of my time, my money, and my being. I'd rather look at the eggs cook! There is no real explanation of why this happened. Prison? Why? Loss? obvious, but why? Action deserves what I do here, and cinematography a Do I do it for pay? How much did this movie do? Well this silly stupid hired copy. That's enough
