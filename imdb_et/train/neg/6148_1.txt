First of all, the film was not true to the facts at all. I saw a documentary a few days earlier and the film was not something like that. First of all, Nash was a genius in mathematics and it should be what the film should have been about the story of a man who was treated and who found love at the end and so on. There are also many scenes that were just wrong - the scene where he was riding a bike took place in his early university year, not afterwards. In my opinion, Russell Crowe did not fit into this part at all because he did not see an intelligent / individual type, so he couldn't really play. It would have been nice if he was more focused on math (similar to Pi) and not too dramatized lovelife. At this level, ABM was too hollywood-ish and too superficial to be great. Personally, I think he was not crazy or paranoid and he was something because people with this caliber know more than we "smaller mortals". 5/10
