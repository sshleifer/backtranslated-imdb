Swedish action films have in recent years evolved into something that imitates American tempered action films such as "Heat" but with a low budget. This film follows the same recipe as "Noll Tolerans" and "Livvakterna". However, it is obvious that they are trying too hard in a cool and tough movie. <br /> <br /> The story has been seen before, the dialogue seems artificial and the actor is very poor, especially the main actor. The film attempts to paint a picture of hard-boiled military robbers who have no regrets, and a female researcher who has completely lost the past, but is at the same time rationally operating. It doesn't work very well. <br /> <br /> The bluish-cast photo style no longer looks fresh and hasn't been well done in this picture. Only very few scenes really look good. Sound is also pretty weird and it sounds like a real dialogue after that. <br /> <br /> The main quality of this movie is Stefan Sauk, though not a convincing leader of the SWAT team's portrait, there are some really funny features. Music is also pretty good.
