If you plan to see this movie, look again. I usually don't post my comments on television, but it was a waste of my life that I have to do something productive to get a bad taste out of my mouth. Criticizing this movie takes too long if there are so many things to do with it. I'm just saying, never see this movie. It was a complete waste of my time and it is your waste. Anyone who wrote a positive review of this film is one of two things; completely wrong or worked for the company that produced it. Again, I guarantee you really regret watching this movie!
