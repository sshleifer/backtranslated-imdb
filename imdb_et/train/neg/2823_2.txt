TiVo recorded it because of Angelina Jolie. It was 2.5 stars. It seemed promising. It went downhill quickly. <br /> <br /> Even Angelina is much overwhelmed. He's about 20 years old and he's 16 years old. There are three characters that should be Italian. All others are Italian-American. I thought the local Italian accents were good. The young man is cute, my wife says. All others in this movie are fat Italian woman. Even men. <br /> <br /> I should have known that when Dick Van Patten was cast as a randy doctor, it was a bad sign. The two pairs who travel around their children are like four Italian Stooges. <br /> <br /> My wife doesn't release the remote control. Hopefully he didn't take makeup, clothes, or decorating. It was a sick and twisted combination of nervous and harsh. It was a cold war. <br /> <br /> The left ventricle cut was not enough to disturb the pain of watching the film. When this movie appears on your TV, make yourself a favorite and make your head on the TV screen. You're glad you did. The only movie I've ever seen was worse than the "Hamburger: movie". Or "Deadly Friend".
