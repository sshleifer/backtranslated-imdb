I should present it by saying that I am a fan of Dolph Lundgren. It turns out that some of the more fun action lines are imaginable and detention is probably my personal favorite. * Spoiler *, though there is no such thing as a Dolph spoiler, because the scripts are so absurd from the start: a chase scene with a disabled child wearing a gun when a boy with a machine gun at Harley runs through a high school hall and a boy wins? Good game, Oscar goes to detention. Dolph, if you read this, thank you for a laugh, for an old friend. <br /> <br /> In summary: A terrible movie that is guaranteed to laugh. I recommend inviting some friends on it and forcing them to sit. Fun.
