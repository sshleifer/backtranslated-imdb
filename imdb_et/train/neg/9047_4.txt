This film was forever impressed. I watched it in high school in high school and I was alone this night at home. I think I lost the respect of Robert Reed as an actor who was a big fan of Brady Bunch. I also thought Chuck Connor's role was terrible and evil. But this film influenced me so much that I am now a volunteer female prisoner who is doing Bible studies and church services and is trying to change women's lives one by one. I am interested in the fact that so few people were watching this movie. No one of my friends watched it and my family is still married when I discuss this movie because they didn't see it.
