As we all know, Hollywood enjoys historical events that change for enjoyment and 44 minutes is one of these Hollywood movies. For example, bank robbers never returned to the bank when they started shooting at LAPD, but in the movie, what we see is that they go back twice! Another example is the number of LAPD officers who have shot at the end of the movies, far from the truth! But of course, Hollywood must have a good bloody end to * add more blood and courage. Some events were combined and many leading actors played a variety of people, but that's what Hollywood has always done, why complain? I think the only sad part is that I watched about one hour of documentary films from TLC that were much better than that!
