How could such good actors as Jean Rochefort and Carole Bouquet be in such ... a ... in such a case? I can't get it. It was terrible, very baldy played (but some of the few leading roles), jokes are stupid and absolutely not funny ... I'm not talking more about this movie except for one little tip: Don't look at this wasting time and money.
