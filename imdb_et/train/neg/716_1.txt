This movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen. There is no storyline, the gags are only slowed down and there is nothing else that would make this movie worth watching. In the whole movie, Fred (oh god, which is a funny name. Ha ha) doesn't ask himself how he came from the plane to the middle. There are a lot of stupid and absolutely wonderful signs whose names should be funny. e.g. : Gandalfi is called Almghand, Sami is called Pupsi ... and so on. I never smiled during the movie. Gags seem to have been made by people who have a negative IQ. When you laugh when someone's hair is trapped in a door (it happens about 5 times), this movie is perhaps for you. Another funny scene: they try to guess the codeword of a closed door (don't ask why - never ask "why" in this movie) and the code word is (ha ha): manure. So if you laughed at this example, you might like this movie. For everyone else: go to Youtube and see "Weed's Lord": it's a lot, much more fun.
