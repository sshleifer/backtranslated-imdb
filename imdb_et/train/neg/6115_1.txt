Tarzan's character is subjected to so many clichés and so many bad interpretations that those who hope for a different version (people like me, who liked Tarzan's books as a child and who have always wanted a movie version that followed only a few books) should know, how the last renditions stack. Some IMDb reviews address this point, but here's my $ .02 <br /> <br /> I'm only aware of double "emotional images of Tarzan, namely Greystoke by Christopher Lambert and Disney's animated version of trying to portray Edgar Rice Burrough a rather interesting character (son, who is a fairy-tale English nobleman, after the death of a monkey tribe who raises him alone and who becomes a "master of the jungle" because of his superior human intellect before returning to England and demanding his second identity), not the usual Hollywood jungle A man whose origins remain unclear and whose trademarks are his famous yoke, his mysterious inability to speak English despite long-term exposure to people who know the language, his habit of turning to vines, his strength, his heroism, etc. The only thing these two characters have is the name Tarzan and the fact that both of them have a woman Jane. Ron Ely's TV version is a compromise: as a Burroughs character, he speaks good English and is adept at both cultures in the way of JamesBondish, but he is not Lord Greystoke and is not Jane. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is in the third category of Tarzan films, and I hope it falls into one category because it's terrible. This category uses all the porn that is the vehicle of all things. Jane, played by legendary bad actor Bo Derek, is in Africa in search of her father, who is not a professor of thought, fighting the jungle, looking for something that has never been specified. Although his father should have been lost for a long time, he finds him effortlessly. Richard Harris is the father's best thing here; She sees the movie as stupid, so she has a fun and amazing way that reminds me of Peter O'Toole's deliberately stupid work in New Pussycat. The Father explains Tarzan's legend ("a spirit or spirit" that he says - steals King Kong or worship unfairly) to his daughter, who is now familiar with the monkey. Soon after, we hear Tarzan's shameful cliché. The father dies, which strangely seems not to be seen by his dedicated daughter. And then ..... <br /> <br /> Then Tarzan appears, but says nothing. Indeed, he does not say anything during the whole movie. He and Jane fall in love, and they almost do nothing when he says love-poetry is next to the screen. End. It's a plot. <br /> <br /> Well, not exactly; there is also a scene where Tarzan fights unreasonably with the boa constrictor - the most unusual boa, because it is the only poisonous person ever seen. Jane treats a tooth with a chimp who helps to wring clothes to bind her to the wound (I'm not doing it!), And that's just one of the many excuses she'd take for clothes <br /> <br /> I always look for something positive , but this time it's hard. Let's see ... well, it's unfair to criticize this film with orangutan, although we all know that orangutans do not live in Africa; After all, classic Tarzan movies used Indian elephants, didn't they? You must also admit that Bo Derek is beautiful on face and form. (But in this case, why didn't the devil just make it a model of art? What does he say about the film when it gets pretty boring to look at a pretty woman? I haven't really decided if it's positive or negative that they never showed my feet .) But now I understand: try as I can, I can't end up with a positive comment. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you're a bad movie buffer. I am here.
