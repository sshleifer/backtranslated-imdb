Sundown - where you have seen the weakest and most dorked vampires, accompanied by one of the most inappropriate, most aggressive dots ever written - and Shane's vampire, who are all laughing and spoken words, so I burst half a laugh and rolled my eyes the rest. <br /> <br /> Vampires don't seem to have any special powers at all, except for the strength (sometimes) that can turn off the lamp (once) and ... it's really. Can you ever imagine Dracula reading the worry because he ran out? Also, virtually no other film, Dracula, ate it for breakfast, skin followers, and use his bones as a toothpaste. <br /> <br /> The main plot of the movie is that a family of four is caught in a vampire gang fight - Dracula vs some old geezers. It could have been a good old B-flick fun, but too dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took this movie a little too seriously, and ends up destroying the remainder of the movie that the clay bats have not destroyed. and a ridiculous scenario. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's too funny to be funny. Of course, it has some fun moments, but they are little and far away.
