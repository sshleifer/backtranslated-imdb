Man To Man is trying to be a good movie: it's in the right place in his heart, he wants to be epic and he has the message that everyone will undoubtedly appreciate it. But there are also some problems with this picture. She tries to be so hard to be good and get the message that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged. So it is only enough that the pictures that this image uses are simple - the person does not let the viewer decide what he / she deems to be right, but grabs his or her message with his or her head. Joseph Fiennes sees it in his role: he does his best to look, really move, and all the other emotions you can express in one facial expression his repertoire offers. Add to that, the movie is too long and loses its speed to the end, which would make it easy to conclude that Man is not worth the man. But there are enough points to defend it: it's fun, it has some humorous scenes and show-steal Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course, it should not be compared to humanist masterpieces such as Elephant Man (David Lynch), but you leave the theater alone. He's trying to grab your heart (even if your brain thinks it's too clear) and succeeds most of the time.
