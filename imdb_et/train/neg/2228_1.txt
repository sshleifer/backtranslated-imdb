This movie is weak, the box cover says East LA's toughest Christmas and it's really Santa Ana, James Cahill acts as a closet queen who takes all the harsh boys in a tough Chlo gang. It is fake, boring, pointless and lazy, I tried to get my money back from the video store that this movie was so bad about. It was also far from the gay-erotic end of what the video box announces. James Cahill should act in Gay Porn .James are in every scene, he can't save his life. The movie is Eva Longoria, who is hot, but James can't even !!!!!!!!! I sometimes felt that I was watching Gay Porn and it was turned off by the whole movie. James clearly wants to be with men, but rather to submit to his gay wishes that he will win the gang members over and over again. His martial arts skills are, at best, minimal, some real gang members accepting him and his weak skills and hanging out.
