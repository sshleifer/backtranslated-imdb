... it was so that I could say goodbye to everyone how terrible this film is. I looked at it for almost twenty minutes before I started thinking, "Oh, it's pretty bad." And frankly, I would have given this movie one star if it wasn't for Esai Morales (though he had very little time). He is the only well-functioning role of the film that is a shame because I like Gil Bellows ... or at least I thought I did. <br /> <br /> As I looked at it, I began to think back to my role in Shawshank Redemption and realized that it was not as good as I thought it was. The problem: his prison / harsh man seems to be just that; the dialogue sounded like it did a very bad impression. Has he ever met someone who speaks like his character was RECOGNIZED? I doubt it, but maybe he should be. <br /> <br /> And worse, it's they managed to inject a little prison philosophy and make it unrecognizable, especially if you think that rhetoric is spoken by a "rasta" who was so strong that it seemed unnatural. <br /> <br /> I usually don't slip such a movie, but when I saw I felt that I was being deceived and lied, and I thought I should try to save someone from watching the movie. <br /> <br /> I say BOOOOOOOO.
