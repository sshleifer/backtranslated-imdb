This is one of the longest hateful and cruel movies. Unfortunately, I stumbled upon it because the presence of Donald Sutherland gave him disappointment. [This is the last time it happens.] <br /> <br /> Lesley Ann Warren's character was annoying and stupid as they came. There were smarter characters than his killed movie. This is just one of many things in this movie that asked me, "Where is justice?" <br /> <br /> Why is late night cable full of sadistic rubbish filled with pathological chaos? Most of these films seem to be particularly problematic for women and seem to focus on being terrorized and murdered. This film could have been a bit tense without being sick and twisted. All that ends is changing the viewer's stomach with the disease and insulting the viewer's intelligence. <br /> <br /> Casting is wrong. I think they first made Sutherland and used her to attract others to her like Lemmings. <br /> <br /> I'm hitting myself with a waste of time, giving it the chance to waste.
