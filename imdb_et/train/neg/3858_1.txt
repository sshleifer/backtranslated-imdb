What a terrible, TERRIBNE movie! One of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. Usually I love such movies, the whole "Boy meets an eccentric woman he likes, but he's already tied to someone who's not right for him ....". I was expecting something predictable and I didn't mind. Movies are always fun, mixing the right amount of romance with comedy, but not that! Every single joke falls and "romance" makes me vomit. The title character is one of the "please kill me" characters that I've ever seen on my television, "eccentric woman" not very eccentric, rather peculiar and annoying. The "second someone" is the most reasonable and mature person in this movie, but it is just as annoying. Such films suck, don't do it, don't waste your time.
