What would be his first scenario, based on his own story about "Turn About", gives William Faulkner a strange story of loyalty, sacrifice and truly strange relationships. Originally the story was only about tone, youth and Cooper, but MGM had to fulfill Joan Crawford's second contract to fulfill his contract, and Faulkner was committed to creating a female role. Crawford insisted that his lines be written in the same truncated style as his co-stars "Young and Tone", which brings a lot of unintended fun, as these three interact with a telegraph-like transcript that sounds like Monty Python's vision ("Wuthering Heights" semaphore). Seriously, almost entirely, the minority sentences make Henry James read from Ernest Hemingway. <br /> <br /> The film also reflects some familiar Faulkner themes that have an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister (as can be found in his "shrine" and elsewhere). When Young makes a proposal to Crawford in the presence of Tone, ALL THREE HEIGHTS replace the rings engraved with each other in their childhood. The proximity of Tone and Young is also noticeable, especially when they go to their Thelma & Louise fate. Frankly, it is horrible. <br /> <br /> Not as horrible as this New Yorker, as a recurring theme that is a huge cockroach, Wellington, which Crawford is happily catching (and shown on the games - I Young came to be a gladiator. Blech. > <br /> Let's say that there are some nice performances, Young is particularly involved in the scene where he has been taken on a Cooper fighter plane, and Roscoe Karns is admirable when Cooper is driving, despite his inability to express himself through a realistic dialogue. a nice moment, torturing your brilliant tears about his fellow Young's fate. that Howard Hawks movie is the most exciting part of the whole picture, but not enough. I'm worried that it's 75 minutes of my life when I ever return.
