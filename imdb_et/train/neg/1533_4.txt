I don't spend much time or energy on this comment. I just want to add it, because all the comments were so positive that I felt I had to just let people know that not everyone was so excited, not to mention intellectually provoked by this effort to create an enchanting philosophical cinema-puzzle. Some scenes seemed promising, playing with visual dimensions, but couldn't keep the rest. I felt like I had stoned stones for the first time, with semi-philosophical conversations with other adolescents. <br /> <br /> What a pointless attempt to raise Dutch cinema to new heights. I would look at Jesus as a Palestine, without any pretensions and direct humor, also raising questions about the life and reality we create ourselves. <br /> <br /> Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard or Tarkovsky and never is.
