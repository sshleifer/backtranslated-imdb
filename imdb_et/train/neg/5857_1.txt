WWF Survivor Series 2001 <br /> <br /> It was one of the worst events of 2001. Perhaps his biggest mistake was that it didn't follow most of the previous Survivor Series. There was only one series of survivors. And this Survivor series game lasted 45 minutes. What's more, anyone with a working brain would know that it would end with Rock versus Austin and The Rock that dominate his team. And don't let me get started before the event preview. No matter who won, it was obvious that no one was going to die. Not all this pointless leap was necessary. Regardless of what it is, it was just a wrestling event. <br /> <br /> And like the rest of the games: the first meeting was a Christian who defended his European title against Al Snow. It was a good fast paced match and its good vision that the race was fair. William Regal v Tajiri was bored and we've seen it 2 or 3 times earlier. Edge versus Test was good but nothing great. The best of the evening was the label titles that match the steels. The fight Royal continued for 10 minutes and no one cared about who won. The title of the women was not great. No, not the slightest. The main event must be the most hypocritical game of history. The Alliance lost, but thinks that every five months the superstar of every Alliance returned. The game itself was bad. Rock eliminated 3 of them and Jericho was eliminated 2. Rock was too familiar to be in action at the beginning of the invasion. Jericho was the one who threatened the whole game. If I wanted every 2 to be eliminated early, it would be for them. Everyone knew that Kane, Big Show and Undertaker were just falling guys. 7 games are not enough for the Survivor series. If there is ever a Survivor Series as bad as it again I will come
