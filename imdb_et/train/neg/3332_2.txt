I bought this movie for sale, so I didn't expect it to be a horror film at the same level as Nightmare's Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977), but I thought it would still be quite an enjoyable look. But it did not prove to be enjoyable at all, but the exemplary and general film was fun, like the ways to "kill the killer" murders for its victims and how all the killed people just happen to be young blond women. It was a stereotypical horror film. I say this for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Three safe blonde women, most of them are killed. 2) One survives when called in the dark while being killed. 3) Surprise surprise, help arrives in the form of a shotgun! <br /> <br /> Using three simple points, I've saved two odd hours, bringing together this horrible excuse for horror, so you're happy enough not to watch it.
