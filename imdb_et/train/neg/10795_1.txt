Would anyone tell Shaq that it would be good for basketball. This movie was not even a fool of fun. In this film, shaq plays a genre who lives in a boom box, which is not a gene lamp instead of a generation. She should help a little boy playing the same annoying francais cappra. This film had the strangest style of water management, which was terrible and I think anyone who likes this flim is afraid to admit it.
