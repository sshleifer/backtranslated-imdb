I grew up with Scooby Doo, where you are, and I still love it. This is one of my favorite cartoons with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and Pirates and Tom and Jerry. This exhibition is good for kids, the voices are good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect like Scooby and Shaggy), the theme setup is acceptable and has a nice animation. But it is quite disappointing. I usually don't mind Scrappy, but if he appears to be the main character, it quickly gets annoying. Scrappy is a little more annoying than normal. Half a year has passed since the first year, it was not like Scooby Doo. And jokes and lines were generally flat and unoriginal, very little monsters or mischiefs. All in all, not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: get a clue, but this exhibition is disappointing. 4/10 for animation, voice, theme gateway and fun for kids. Bethany Cox
