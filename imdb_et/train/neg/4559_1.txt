I am surprised that anyone involved in the production of this series actually recognizes responsibility. The script is so unpleasant that it needs to be written by someone who failed the exam for the Canadian Comedy Association (and that says something!). If you want, go out with your binoculars, but there's nothing that is visible. Ronnie Corbett had to demolish this garbage. The rest of the majority is so lacking in some kind of action or comedy that I am surprised to have lasted from the first episode - over correction. All I can say to those who have been entertained is that they have to be very entertaining. And it is obvious that the production costs must be â‚¤ 100 episodes. And if anyone thinks I'm commenting on a foreigner who doesn't know English humor, I have to add that I'm really English.
