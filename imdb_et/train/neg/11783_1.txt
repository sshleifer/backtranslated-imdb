What a ugly movie! Worst of the worst! This movie is just as fun as a dead stupid. No talent-what-so-ever-actors, stupid plot. Who wrote this script?! Was there a script for this script that drove, or did the director accidentally look at the recording button on his camera and then decided to make the movie when they went? Is it meant for children's film or comedy? My younger brothers are in 6th grade and he and his classmates made their own amateur film for their school project that goes beyond this geeky movie. It's not just an excuse for this flick!
