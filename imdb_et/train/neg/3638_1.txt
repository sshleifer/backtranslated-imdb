The film depicts France's unresolved problems with a colonial heritage in West (Francophon) Africa through a younger woman, France (here symbolically representing her nationality) with a psychoanalytic prism. It is often tempting and complicated for a young woman to arrive in her past with a traumatic moment and the desire of the people to reach a "second" when it was "owned" and shaped. This is reflected in how it focuses entirely on the idea of ​​traveling (or traveling) from the present past; to remember the reality of the undeniable modern political and economic realities. <br /> <br /> All characters play a symbolic, though limited and convincing role. France, which is meant to be both a visual and a totemic image of modern French society, leaves indifferent to its situation, as it still seems to be the same naive child she actually enjoyed as a child, her reality seems to be more. The rest of the rag-tag band is simply forgotten. Black Africans are saying that they are violent impressionist portraits of former colonized nations, now colonized by poor director handling. They are not just dark and frightening backgrounds, which blythe-type France is surprised to look for in a world it never knew, and hoping that it will never be found in Cameroon.
