SLASHERS (2 out 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Not a very good movie ... but I liked the idea ... and the filmmakers showed it had to work under a very small budget. The film is an "episode" of a live Japanese reality show that sends several contestants to a closed "danger zone" and has been sent to them with three costumes to kill them. Nutritionist, if it exists, will win fame and happiness ... everyone else will die dead. The main drawback of this film is that the actor is pretty bad. No "real" person seems real at all. The killers of the killers are fun ... because they represent cheesy and over-the-top cartoons of popular contemporary horror types ... and that is exactly as they would be if it were a real show. The film is pretended to be done in one ... one operator who watches the "danger zone" around the competitors and everything is viewed from the perspective of his camera ... but the lights flash on and off continuously (hide "cuts" from one move to another, imagine) .
