I just got to watch this DVD at home. We love the West, so my husband rented it. He started to apologize to half of me. Saddles, costumes, accents - everything was off. The part that made me so crazy is where the man didn't let the "collector" with his bow and arrow when he took the ghost of the fat boy. His only excuse was, "He had only two arrows left." We looked at it all the time, and like someone else said ... too many bad things to point out one of the reasons why he was sucking. This means that the fact that the boy happened to have the evil stone of the collection in the same month and day found what it was? And why was there a garden in the grave where everyone died on April 25, but the people whose souls the collector took still walked around? If you want to have some beer after a movie, it can be your movie. But if you want a real Western world, you hate this movie.
