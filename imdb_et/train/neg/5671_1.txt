If you want to see that animals are skinned alive, their heads were crushed, the dogs that crushed my men, crushed them, then that's for you! But if you are somewhat normal and do not have to see the cruelty of the animals, it must be done. This movie tries to shock the viewer and it certainly does. before that, the slaughterhouse's footage (BTK film) shows and such video should not be allowed in horror. see the movie and see the actual killing of the animals, not what we rent the movie. It was a very hard horror blower, it changed my belly. The whole movie and the team need their head to check.
