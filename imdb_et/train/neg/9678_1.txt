I'm sorry to say that this was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Although it is visually fascinating (eg the use of color was absolutely stunning), it was rather boring and disturbing (see father / son incest). <br /> <br /> What's more, the music is completely inadequate and if you think of the great tracks of Michael Nyman (who wrote most of the soundtracks of Greenaway movies), you can imagine the difference. <br /> <br />
