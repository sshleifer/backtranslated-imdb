It seems to be one of those movies we think we should, but I didn't. He seems to be trying too hard to be "artistic". All flash without content. It has some beautiful scenes, and one of them is nice to look at, but they all come together and it becomes a difficult task to just sit through it. I rented it because of the glowing reviews on the video card and the fact that I am a big Shakespeare fan, but I was very disappointed. I found it a bit pretentious and sometimes boring.
