It is really terrible: painfully irritated stylists who are perplexed and grumpy for inconsistent dialogues that take place on scenes that have no purpose, no beginning, no middle or no end, without a clear narrative or even cognitive intent, all in service an uninteresting and almost unrecognizable story. What's even worse is that the movie's "style": suddenly shot the cranks down the crane with a long head, and without any reason there are sudden droplets or wobblyhand sections: all this "style" just earns an almost incredibly big misconception about the project and the almost insulting gap in the material. Definitely a candidate for the worst movie ever made.
