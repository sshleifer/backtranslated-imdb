I should endure the teenage, high school anger and family conflicts for almost the whole exhibition. I really don't care about high school girls for their relationships. I've spent my time in dealing with such problems at Hell, and I don't care about a fancy teenage that passes the "lite" versions of the horrors. I want science fiction. That's the only reason I'm here. The exhibition had a few seconds of scientific literature. Finally we see proto-Cylon. It was good but with one problem. His red eye point locks onto the object of interest. We all know that Cylon eyedots always scans back and forth, giving the machine a world map. The red eye will never stop back and forth. <br /> <br /> I hope writers will improve this abuse before the second episode.
