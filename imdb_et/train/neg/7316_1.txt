When I saw a preview of this movie, I didn't expect much to start with the second level teenage horror movie. But this movie was absolutely terrible. And it's generous. <br /> <br /> First of all, choosing a movie was terrible. You do not feel sympathy (or any illness in this matter) characters. The act was so terrible that I just waited and hoped God was a terrible thing. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there are points in the movie that had no connection with the plot. Can anybody explain to me why a boyfriend is shouting "PANCAKES !!!" at the top of his lungs, when he went into Jackie Chan's moves that I have never seen, and even biting this man with the virus? Why does a child's father become angry with a virus-infected guy and go again to find him? I felt the confusion and surprise that I literally said, "Where did hell come from?" <br /> <br /> I just couldn't believe what I saw. I really thought I had seen some bad movies, but I have to say that Cabin Fever brings them all up. This movie made me want to and I was going to dump it again. Then blow my brain out. <br /> <br /> Please save yourself one and a half hours and make something more productive. Perhaps the right grass is the right choice.
