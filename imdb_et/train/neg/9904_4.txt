"Gung Ho!": The Carlson Story of Makin Island Raiders was made in 1943 with the aim of raising the morals of the American people during World War II. It best shows that cinema can be a propaganda body. The value of this film is only a collection and an artistic one. Propaganda in the film has a direction and the participants are meaningless to evaluate. Watch this movie if you are interested in finding out how the film's propaganda functions work or if you're a very small role in the movie Robert Mitchum. If you want to see a film about the Second World War, they are much better and more objective. I appreciated it 4/10.
