It was a really bad movie. I have a large number of Italian Horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and so on, even our good friend Lamberto sometimes comes out good. I found that the first two "Demon" movies were very fun - they were so bad they were big, but it's just so bad that it's really, really bad. It's intense bored, the story never goes anywhere, and I hated these signs - my wife attacked her husband and a little nervous pain *** her husband crazy about me, there wasn't enough of a story dedicated to Ogre. probably the best actor in the whole movie. I turned it on about three-quarters of the way, because I was very, very outraged! Do not worry.
