This movie is so stupid that it just goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous. I wanted to look at "The Fall of Darkness" and thought it was a movie. Boy, what's wrong! I quickly transmitted as much as I could and could not get rid of the eternal moment. I just envy people who were paid to play or work on this movie. They were actually given money for the money. Isn't that amazing? I mean in this movie that a man is killed and cut into a piece of wood in a wood mill and a couple of minutes later, mother and boy are talking calmly at the table, if nothing happens and drink coffee. Please! Come on! Who is giving money for such films? Oh, and the "tooth fairy" was flat. Not scary at all and it was obvious that it was a boring stuntman who carried a badly made make-up.
