It's not just a bad movie, it's one of the worst movies. it is so bad that I found it quite enjoyable. actress, oh my god, script, you have to be a kiddin. How can you imagine a writer in such things as: - A child doing fireworks at school, fireworks so powerful that if someone hits him, they drive back a hundred meters and explode. The girl is trapped in a trolley, the killer is trying to open the door. he gets a cage, but the wire is not long enough. she first makes an extension cord, oh horror, and when she's done, she drills through the door and drills her head through the killer. WOW - and there are many more examples. Oh yes, and what happened to George Kennedy, he was big before (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool hand Luke)
