The Omega Code was a cinematic contradiction model. There was a little (but very little) good action, mainly by two prophets and Rostenberg, who appeared only once and had no signs. Otherwise, it was definitely bad. The plot line was rather weak and based only on a partially questionable Bible interpretation. Definitely not one year's best.
