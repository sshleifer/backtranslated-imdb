I have a copy of VHS about this, I think they (television networks) should play it every year for the next twenty years. So we don't forget what was and we remember that we don't make the same mistakes again. Like some people in the director's board they don't belong to. This film, Rappin, is like a musician of a great character, for those who can't sing or act. This movie is just as fun as driving the blind to the city by bus. <br /> <br /> John Hood (Peebles) has just come out of prison and is back in the old neighborhood. Obviously earning time for all sorts of crime. John goes back to the old street and is greeted by kids, old ladies and his peers who dance and sing all the way. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it if I was sentimental or if somebody smoked a medicine pot for glaucoma prescribed by a doctor. In both cases, it is poorly managed, scripted, acted, and even produced (I never thought I was sitting on it) with the ghost life satire "Hood". While I think the story's redeeming part is wannabe gang through sequences and dance numbers, his friends care about their neighbors and want to save and clean the ghetto. Forget the Sonny spoon, Mario could have won the Oscar for this rape. Oh, if you find yourself wanting to laugh foolishly and three quarters embarrassing, then drink first. <br /> <br /> Please look responsibly. (No stars, better luck next time!)
