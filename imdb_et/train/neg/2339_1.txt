This rotating film looks more like a combination of MTV music clips than a real movie. There is no real story and you ask yourself, "What happens?" but nothing happens. The only good thing is Eric Cloecki, a disappointed writer's story. Other people do not seem to have anything in common: why bring them together in a movie. Music lets you watch the worst movie. When I open the tap and spend with Bach's music, most people want to watch it, but it's not a movie. The director should learn how to write a script with a film of 100 minutes or more before directing the film.
