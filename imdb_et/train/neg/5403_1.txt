I gave this movie to only one star because it couldn't be less. <br /> <br /> Scientists have developed a formula for reproducing any organism. In their lab (downstream of L.A.) they create a T-Rex. A group of industrial spies bursts to steal the dosage form and the rest of the film is one endless leg. <br /> <br /> Of course, the T-Rex (rubber doll) gets rid of it and starts to destroy it. It's an amazing ability to sneak up at 2 or 3 feet away without notice and then bites your head quickly. <br /> <br /> One cast member escapes from the police car and leads the rest of the movie through the city without a target. He has such a higher spiritual ability that he can't even control the radio. He never tries to drive to a substation or donut shop and seems hopelessly lost. <br /> <br /> T-Rex destroys the entire city, with relaxing weapon battles and buildings (cardboard games). blows, but no police car or army, no one else appears. Such action must be commonplace in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> We can only hope that the sequel is not planned.
