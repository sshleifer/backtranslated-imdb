First, let me say that the first 20 minutes are great, the monster looks great and CGI is reasonably done. It's a shame that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment, <br /> <br /> ******** SPOILERS DOWN ******** <br /> <br /> From the opening plan we we see, this movie, which is anti-American, usually does not disturb me such stereotypes (we get enough of Hollywood from the British), but here's not the finer thing how Americans do brain-dead morons. It goes beyond the point of reality, and your left thought was whether Yank had raped the mother of the director. <br /> <br /> The grieving scene was really bad and part of the movie where it starts to go downhill. <br /> <br /> Here we introduce the Olympic aunt and drunken Uncle, who is walking to the monument and starts accusing his father of his daughter's death, then strikes him before they all begin to scream at the floor. Hardly realistic tying during the crisis! <br /> <br /> The whole virus side effect is ridiculous. If Americans know they don't have a virus, why are they wasting time, money and resources exploring? The US government agent orders nothing for innocent Korean brain drilling, making Americans evil (or stupid), not helped by the fact that this guy was a comic. <br /> <br /> The movie is hunting for a monster. The special forces of the US and Korea are destined to find the creature, though they are invisible through the film. The only person who scares the whole of Korea is the main family and some casual tramp that will come out to save the day! Of course, some US / Korean representatives are trying to stop them. <br /> <br /> The sister only came with the film so she could make the final result. It was a clich√©, you knew it would happen, but to make it worse it will do it all! and my last resentment, how the hell was this child at the end? The monster was swimming with the head of water for about 5 minutes! Why didn't the monster eat the children first?
