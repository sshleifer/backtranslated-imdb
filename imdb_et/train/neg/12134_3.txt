This face should be a great movie, great casting, a plethora of options and one of Hollywood's best camera for the first time. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear why it was another 8 years before space decided to re-direct the movie. This movie doesn't work on so many levels. In a movie where there are not many deeds and most scenes are on the table, it is imperative that the manager give a break and continuity. Not so much here, the big pain is terribly under-utilized, nothing more than big, late John Spencer, the plot is in the grinder and something you haven't seen in another TV movie. There's so little character development that you don't have to take care of for any main character. At least we know that cosmos has a lot of companions and influence in Hollywood studio to escape with such a bad flick
