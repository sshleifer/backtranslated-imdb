I'm not going to comb the obvious peterbogdanovichia shortcomings of TLPS. Instead, I look at the positive aspects of the overpriced celluloid pigment in this film. <br /> <br /> 1. Peter Bogdanovich succeeded in making a film that can be completely damaged. This fact alone makes the film high up and the top of all its flat filmography. <br /> <br /> 2. Bogdanovich had shown how astonishingly generous some happy boys might be, sharing Cybill Shepherd's (then-gal) fabulous body and breasts with his male audience - and not just one, but two times . Brava! Undoubtedly highlighting this cinematic festa del siesta. <br /> <br /> 3. TLPS hardly has a scene where there is no stereotypical land music in the background. (Peter tried to make it a clear point that the film was set in the deep south of America (as if it was not obvious), so he created this point further and further ...) How is that advantage, ask? Well, when the movie finally ends and the monotonous country music finally ends with tired ear-drums, you'll start to experience a strange joy: "The movie is finally over!" It is pure joy. <br /> <br /> 4. The film gives all the women who look like Cloris Leachman. I hope that they can one day draw a much younger and perhaps even more beautiful boy. <br /> <br /> 5. Cloris Leachman's biography (which I don't understand technically as part of TLPS) gives hope to all women who look like they will miss Miss Chicago's beauty ticket one day. (Provided they have enough money to bribe bribes.) <br /> <br /> (You think I'm joking with Cloris, who has won a beauty event, right? Well, look at her bio and then we'll see who laughs last. ..) <br /> <br /> 6. The film was shot in black and white, saving us the face of Cloris Leachman in its original natural non-glory.
