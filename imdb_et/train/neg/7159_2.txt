I thought I would never find a horror film as bad as the "Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre", but this film competes with it. <br /> <br /> I'm not the one who sleeps when watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after Trance started. I woke up and started looking at it. Why did I earn it? The whole movie was torture, I have to look at it quickly to see it as a whole. <br /> <br /> I can't stand why one of my favorite actors (MR. WALKEN) could do that. I have to think he did it for the director, or he really needed the money because the movie after the film he was doing would destroy himself; and so fast ... <br /> <br /> What is a movie? it is not scary, stupid plot, characters are terrible (but I liked what Jared Harris was playing), the effect is very bad, lack of death and blood, etc .; it has something in three words. And I mean it. Can't stand the way the director can make such a movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, when I got more frustrated, I saw in the video cover that the movie was presented by "Stephen King", I guess he wouldn't get that crap, would he? (I rented it in Argentina). I don't recommend it in a million years. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this movie with 10 out of 10. (As I say on the return of my "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", there are always inferior movies, so it doesn't deserve 1/10
