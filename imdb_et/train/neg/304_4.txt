This film depicts Ruth as a feminine, hard drink, gambling, overlaying a sports figure with a little baseball. The early life of Babe Ruth was quite interesting and was for all purposes, and this goal was left out of this film. Also, Lou Gehrig was barely covered and it was well known, good bad or indifferent, it should have been better covered than it was. His life was more than all bad. He was an American hero, an icon designed by many baseball players for his life. I feel I am fair about the memory of a big baseball player that this film completely ignored. Shame on the makers of this movie to take advantage of their mistakes and not their size.
