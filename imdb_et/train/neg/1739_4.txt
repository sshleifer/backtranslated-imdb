Looking at it in Lady In Ermine, I was wondering what Betty Grable did in a project that seemed to be directed to Marlene Dietrich. Someone over the 20th century Fox may have decided one sex symbol is as good as the other. Darryl F. Zanuck should have felt better. <br /> <br /> Betty plays in the 19th century Italian county whose domain has been invaded by the Hussar army of Hungary, whose captain is Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. His ghostly ancestor, whose portrait hangs on the palace hall with the rest of his outstanding family tree, does not see Dougis, and some other intruders, have little or no similarity about 300 years earlier, when he dealt with the armies. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the current Betty has just been married to Cesar Romero and the invasion has reached the most unattractive moment before things have come. It gives someone a bad attitude, I guarantee. <br /> <br /> Fresh, healthy All American Betty is NOT an actor who is seductive and mysterious. Perhaps Marlene Dietrich would have put it over, but with Betty it will fall over the presidential candidate yesterday. He and Fairbanks are not at all chemistry, though Doug is as charming as ever and someone I can see. <br /> <br /> Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin are writing the score for this movie and it is now the Oscar's best song. This Lady In Ermine's way to honor the Oscar fell on buttons and buttons. <br /> <br /> Ernest Lubitsch died in the meantime and Otto Preminger finished her in In Ermine. I can't believe Lubitsch was in the lead here. Also, you won't see it when you see this Lady In Ermine.
