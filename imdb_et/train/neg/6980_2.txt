Historically Accurate? Hmm ... Maybe ... when you slip and the light falls on that particular subject. But the basic accuracy is not compensation for the unpleasant, uneven and inconsistent plot, carton dialogue and inadequate conclusion. The main characters are only testimonials; embarrassing stereotypes, ranging from "mysterious and noble" American Indians to "thin but sadistic" British officers. Unfortunate and indecent exchange of history in American history. I want my money back.
