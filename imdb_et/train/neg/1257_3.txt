If there is one thing that worries me most about seeing a bad movie, it's seen by experienced filmmakers who should know better. The "transformation" of the Apeside planet could have used some imagination, not to mention the essential elements of essential development. Nova, the girl's original planet girl, was better developed in this version than Daena, all she doesn't say in one word. Certainly, much better was expected from Tim Burton, a man who has so far combined with the incredible intelligence, spirit and humor of visual imagination, all of which lacked much of this production. <br /> <br /> The main problems were the plot development. The first big mistake allowed people to talk. This was the main difference between the monkeys and the men who made all the difference in the original movie. Even when he was silent, his ability to communicate was one that marked Heston Taylor as different from other people. In the current film, Mark Wahlberg encourages the slaves to rebel, but there is no overwhelming reason why they have not left blank and taken back. They are clever tool users and have the ability to interact with plan-making, something that does nothing to silence. He doesn't save the stars to save them. Indeed, since he comes from a technological civilization and finds himself before the beginning of the technology, without (first) any gadgets that would help him, Wahlberg should be disadvantaged, not the people who are used to it. <br /> <br /> It was sad to see Helena Bonham Carter working so hard to create some sparks between her and her missed brick wall Mark Mark Wahlberg. His best scenes were with the criminal Tim Roth. <br /> <br /> People were ignored until they were required by the third law, where Daena began to show real interest in Davidson (Wahlberg) and young people. boy suddenly became a feisty gung-ho freedom fighter. It was a development of poor character. (Especially Estella Warren showed that she could have done much more than the script was given). Wahlberg's confusion about what these people see in him is definitely shared for me because he has barely interacted with people all the time. <br /> <br /> Creating monkeys: half plus and two cons: Ape makeup had a great makeup, especially Michael Clarke Duncan, who has incredibly expressive eyes (which was why he was so good in Green Mile) and makeup design enabled him to use them fully. But the monkey's wives didn't see anything on earth, not a monkey or a man. The minuses were the monkey jumps, which saw as realistically as the Flash Gordon rocket: jumping monkeys saw that they simply unleashed a catapult, they had no long-term grace of true monkeys. Second, poor mixing of sound - when gorillas roar, it is obviously duplicated from some animals, probably cats, making them ridiculous and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> In the original film, the different "human" things make the monkeys and say they are being treated as light-emitting ("I never knew a monkey I didn't like." "Man sees, man!"). Here, monkeys speak only in fact, just as people in the 21st century do, and there is no humor at all. The only real original idea was to write Ari with his feet. <br /> <br /> Nothing changed me more than the "V-Ger Star Trek" at the end of the movie. First, the monkeys were probably able to read Roman letters in the distant past, so that they would know the name of the forbidden zone in partially hidden form. Secondly, the mysterious title that gives the name is simply covered with sand, which Wahlberg just brushes, which every monkey could have done centuries ago. This moment was much worse for me than the endless end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Such things, however, are typical of most modern science fiction. In the 60s and 70s, they generally had no budget to make convincing futuristic kits, but they did deal with truly original themes and ideas that were truly fancy. I mean 2001: Space Odyssey, 1967 Monkey Planet, THX1138, Soylent Green, Silent Running and 1972 Solaris. Apeside's first planet even used the only scientifically valid and physically possible method to move forward in time. This film, however, contains almost every clich√© of bad science fiction: space storms, anomalies, and wormholes outside Star Trek; the planets of the solar system and their months seem to be big globos together (in reality, from one planet, all other bodies, even their months, are just light points); a normal rocket-powered shuttle that drives from Saturn to Earth in a few minutes instead of years; two thousand years old equipment that burns and works completely when the hero pushes the button. Nothing comfortable with a bulletproof inner glass. In a modern environment, you need to explain why * it was bulletproof, but because it is a "science fiction" that you don't need! <br /> <br /> Overall, Burton is the most disappointing film.
