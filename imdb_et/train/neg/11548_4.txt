Jeez, only in the 70s ... Antonio Margheriti brings us this spicy western hybrid and the kung fu flick that is developing around the treasure hunt. The trashy cogeneration spices between the Shaw Brothers and the Italian one-off company include humorous storytelling, exile events, and some very annoying R&D. Extraordinary campy moments are served by Lee Van Cleef's unpleasant wig, leather-covered biblical psycho-armed forces, Yancey Hobbitt (Julian Ugarte, who should have done as many vague European genres as he did). -Exciting dialogue, fun background music, and completely ridiculous sound effects associated with various small events (especially the jump made by Lo Lieh). <br /> <br /> Although this little piece falls on Turkish territory and it is nice to see Van Cleef and Lo Liehi on the same screen and you can't deny that duo's charisma. Don't wait too much and get a lot of it. <br /> <br /> It's my truth. What's yours?
