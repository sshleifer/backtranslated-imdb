It seems that such films appeared in the 1970s. And the fact that I cannot recall one of them is the dimension of their impact. These are what the novels call "pot boilers". They are hardly more than the stars of the film in the eyes of the public. <br /> <br /> We have Micheal Caine, Peter Ustinov, Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison and William Holden; more than enough names to get a rubber shed. The taste of every hero is satisfied. Although it is suspected that most audiences were still disappointed. <br /> <br /> Their talents are simply thrown away and I do not know that the stars are so much money and the reputation is still desperate or in some ways incomplete. Such a film does not give the CV a gold medal. Sometimes the actors should choose their leader, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that it would be a mess from the very beginning. This ridiculously uneven music of the youth-jazz scene, which also weakened every time a random noise was needed, was in the atmosphere with the elevator. Who imagined the use of a jazz band when the scene depicted the stunning jungles of Central Africa or the endless Sahara with camels and palms? Certainly this is a serious fool. Ennio Morricone would have known what to do; and his results would have reduced the atmosphere and tension to raise his rating to two. This director should have been struggling to see "Arab Lawrence" or even Sergio Leone's Westerners; he could have learned some things. But then again he wouldn't have done that. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock played a shameful effect in his movie "Frantic". Later he was repaired with equal effort, looking at Harrison Ford. In each case, the confusion associated with his disappearance and the chasing tension was real. When Michael Caine would otherwise be forced to work a little bit of brain and bravado, Rex Harrison kept a pop-up where he was like some old old genii to run back when the narrative stumbled. At least photography was quite good, often using a very beautiful environment. But then the stupid music must spray and hit the atoms that this little atmosphere has created. <br /> <br /> The action scenes were also developed and inclined so that the wrong choreographic sequences they might have staged for the first time - the drama of the year. And, of course, players have to fight against jazz - as you do. <br /> <br /> And this is about as much a comment as this point deserves. Except that the script was also very sad. <br /> <br /> Keep your hobby on it. Even if it contained the letters of your favorite film, you are certainly disappointed.
