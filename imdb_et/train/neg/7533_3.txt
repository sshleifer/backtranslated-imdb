The film had some pleasant aspects. Maybe too much for my taste. It seems that the writer / director would desperately try to make us feel the inner conflict of all his characters. Not once, a few times ... but all the time. <br /> <br /> It's television, not cinema. <br /> <br /> The train station location was well chosen and I enjoyed the performance of Sascha Horler as a pregnant friend. <br /> <br /> I felt Justine Clarke coming. His reactions to things felt forced as the director tried to tune the themes of the film through the expressions of his main characters. I also cannot believe that the director can make wonderful Daniela Farinacci an incredible presence. <br /> <br /> I don't understand that pop music has chosen the whole sequence. This is a lazy device, especially if pop music doesn't come to the movie and / or where the lyrics look very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> This means there is wind-free quality for the film, which gives Australian warmth and local attitude to originality. It creates an atmosphere of warmth and sunshine. Especially with amazing animation sequences that save the movie from total mediocrity by infusing it with passion and hand-made charm. <br /> <br /> I'm curious as to why the dialogue seems so redundant. "Who knows if there is a god? Like a man sitting in the sky, tells us what to do" or whatever that line was. <br /> <br /> Maybe one of the most embarrassing moments was a friend who returned home from a cricket to inform his wife of "quit smoking." <br /> <br /> Anti-Smoking Trade? TAC ad with some delicious animation? I had to leave the cinema with a 50-minute mark - it was too much.
