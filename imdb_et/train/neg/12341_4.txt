Terrorism is not just a matter of the 21st century. Before the Scary Movie series, there were some genre examples, mostly in the 80s. However, as mentioned in the franchise, most of these films have been hit or missed. Some like "Elvira, the lover of darkness" mostly rise upwards, but others like "Saturday 14". and its sequel can't laugh. But all such films are one of the greatest culprits, and it is "Transylvania 6-5000", which is a waste of time for many reasons. <br /> <br /> Pros: An excellent set that does the best. Part of funny humor is fun. Dirty, but catches the theme song. Some good places in Transylvania. <br /> <br /> Cons: Threadbare plot. Mostly tedious pace. Most humor just doesn't cut it. Monsters is given little to do and little time. I thought it was supposed to be a scam movie? Flat closing, which is likely to make viewers hate. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: It's Comedy? If that is the case, why are really funny bits so little and far away? Comedies should put us on the floor, not roll our eyes and wake up to get to the end. I can't believe Anchor Bay released this tired spam. I admit that this is never the worst movie ever made, but it's not worth the time or money of someone, even if you are a fan of some actor. See 'Transylvania Twist' instead. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 2/5
