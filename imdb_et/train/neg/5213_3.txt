As others mentioned, this movie is similar to THE FLY (both versions) and lesser known sci-fi flick ALTERED STATES. The big difference is that these two films were well made by people who knew what they were doing and were good at it. METAMORFOSIS did not have these advantages. METAMORPHOSIS is a potentially interesting story of science fantasy with the wrong people and the wrong actors who played a role. <br /> <br /> The story is followed by Dr. Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock). genetic treatment of aging and death. If the university it is working on threatens to reduce funding, it decides to inject itself into an aging serum. As a result, Dr Houseman will spend the rest of the film slowly as a lizard. And yes, looking at a good doctor's ongoing process, it is a great pleasure. It's really so bad that it's good. Some lines are classic: "What was that?" "Worry ... past!" <br /> <br /> Many of the reviews I've read about this point are how stupid and ridiculous the last five minutes of this movie. I just want to go ahead and spoil it: a good doctor is going to get into the confusing half, a semi-lurking thing that seems to be the man in the costume of Godzilla's costume, when the police finally suppress him. In the final scene, a somewhat unpleasant baby is seen with a small pet's gut, which he claims never to die, and the film's hero, Sally Donnelly (Catherine Baranov), will probably decide that the little lizard is the final embodiment of Dr. Houseman. The camera then gives the church face closer; I think it's the director's way to show us that the lizard is EVIL. Yes, it's funny, but I fell laugh so I can't complain. I am sure many of those who read it did exactly the same, because the only way to watch this movie on a DVD is 50. If you've recently bought a box set and haven't watched this movie yet, it's really worth your time, even though I just broke out for you. This movie can also be free online for free.
