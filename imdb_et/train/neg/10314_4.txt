Like someone who likes the scenes of excitement and this intriguing real life story really intrigued, I was optimistic about this movie, but too many obstacles came to that good story. <br /> <br /> BAD - I'm a fan of Robert Duvall and many of his characters, but his role here is a boring insurer. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is brilliant and beautiful Kathryn Harrold is a real garbage mouth. Of what I read, many directors had replaced each other with this film and it was too bad. You can say that the story is not right. I also did not get involved with Will's Williams' Cooper. He should have been exciting, but he wasn't in that movie. It is also a sad comment that the offender is a "hero of the nation", but I admit that I also take root for rooting. <br /> <br /> Not everyone was disappointed. I can't complain about landscapes, Orgon's lush green forests and the desert of Arizona. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see this movie made again and better because it's a unique story.
