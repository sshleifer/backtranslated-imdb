If you want to buy a good Jason Scott Lee movie, I suggest you: <br /> <br /> Dragon: Bruce Lee's story <br /> <br /> Rapa Nui <br /> <br /> Timecop 2: Berlin "is a terrible movie. Amazing production value. Awful action. Awful script. I wouldn't like to watch this movie as someone who seriously believes it is high quality entertainment or America's awareness of Hollywood in America (this movie doesn't.). <br /> <br /> I would say, at least, that this movie is a satisfying entertainment on a rainy day if you ever came to surf. If you're curious, maybe you can rent from Netflix, but this movie is definitely not sure. <br /> <br /> If you are one of the few people who looked at this movie as a tool to raise awareness of your Asian-American film and were disappointed, I recommend the following movies for your personal viewing. These are well-written movies with high product values ​​with talented Asian-American actors: <br /> <br /> Better luck tomorrow <br /> <br /> Mulan
