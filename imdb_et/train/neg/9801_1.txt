I remember the example that was on television when I was a boy back in the early 1990s, and there was some rage about children whose horse leotards make kung fu to each other and ride on plastic in dinosaurs. This was called the power-lord. I remember small children going to each other and then shirts and items were banned in many school districts all over the country because this exhibition taught children how to fight each other to solve their differences. <br /> <br /> I never saw it as an exhibition, especially when the better shows how The Tick played at Fox Kids. Most older teenagers always looked at the power attackers in a ridiculous and frightening way, and it is hard to wonder why. Video is at best ridiculous. Colored ring costumes look like things you would work with, and dinosaurs look like a plastic mess. Then you get to the actors and of course these really ridiculous discounts. All the boys run around with earrings, half of them wear 90s and they always wear the same clothes every day, and then they become force transferers. <br /> <br /> Toys are especially ridiculous, and it was a joke about many late night conversations. And, of course, the two worst films ever made, and I mean the two worst films ever made, were based on this show, where almost every critic hit both movies and exhibitions. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers is nothing more than a bad telecommerce for a particularly bad toy trade. As an adult, I don't look at it tenderly, but rather as the second embarrassment of the 1990s, showing fashion and boys' earrings.
