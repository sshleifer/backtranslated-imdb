Marlon Brando had long lost interest in making this film. His "Swede" is the worst of his career and that is what he wanted. He's not moving. Instead, he is simply acting in a strange fashion and amusingly entertaining his shameful circle. The scene where Brando climbs over the toilet is probably the worst and fun time in cinema history. As we feel that he falls to the front of the toilet in the head, it is hard to believe that we look at the same actor who played A Streetcar on the beach, on the beach and the godfather. <br /> <br /> I think the real question is why Marlon is behaving in this way in his later years. Was he sick in the film industry? Was he as a complete and perfect fool about himself? I think we never know. But this film is an exciting study of what bad behavior is. <br /> <br /> On this note, look at your fellow veteran Donald Sutherland when he struggles to cope with his lines, embarrassed to agree to participate in this travesty.
