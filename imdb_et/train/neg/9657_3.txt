1) I am not a weapon expert, but even I see a difference between US military riffs and World War II. In the film, we see the privates armed with "M1 Guarantor" (invented in 1932!), Not authentic "1903 Springfield" (aka "Silent Death"), who prefers to use World War II. Difference - M1 can load 1.5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire! M1 was semi-automatic, Springfield needs recharging after every shot. A little difference?! 2) The German Army uniforms have also been borrowed since 1940. Especially - helmets. German helmets until the end of WWI have an important pike, we don't even see one in the movie. And if we do a little additional search in the archives - how much is this a real story? I'm surprised at how many "truths" can be filmmakers for cheap copying.
