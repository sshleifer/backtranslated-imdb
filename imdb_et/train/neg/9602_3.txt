Daniella has some questions that are under her attractive appearance. He starts losing his mind when he discovers a distant relative (who he recalls) that was burned as a werewolf. He gets a little wild when rubbing his furry men and pulling out his throat. He finally finds that a man who helps prevent his inner beast, but when others destroy his bliss, he extracts his violent and furry revenge. <br /> <br /> The werewolf wife is not a very clever film, but it is a good crowd. A fun time could have been poor functioning / duplication / translation and production of ordinary cheesiness. But it is moving slowly, but it has enough nudity to keep you awake?
