I sat through this episode of almost one episode and just couldn't take it anymore. It seemed like I was already watching dozens of episodes and then it hit me ..... There's nothing new here! I've heard that joking about Seinfeld, I saw someone fall to friends, that happy days had almost the same story, etc. No actress is interesting here! Some of them were good at other exhibitions (not here) and others were in the profession they would never have had. Avoid this stink!
