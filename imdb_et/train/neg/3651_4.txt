I was looking for a very funny movie. Instead, I got a movie with some funny jokes and many who just didn't work. I didn't like the idea of ​​bringing Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty's descendants. It was confusing. It would have been funny if they just got a new one, instead of Moriarty resurrected. Some things were funny. Burt Kwouk was very funny, as always. McCloud was funny on the horse. Hawaii McGarrett 5-0 wasn't even like McGarrett. Apparently, Connie Booth is very good with accents. He is from Indiana, but he played quite well in English and New Yorker. Unfortunately, he was not given a lot of script. I was expecting a more fun movie. Instead, I got a rather confused movie with a bad script. Rather ironic, because both Booth and Cleese were in this area. Maybe they started to break up in 77th.
