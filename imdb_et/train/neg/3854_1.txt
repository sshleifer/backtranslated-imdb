Julia Stiles is a talented young actor with a lot of potential under the guidance of a reputable representative. Obviously, the person who led him to this travesty is not someone who cares about his career. I was sitting in a theater surrounded by teenagers who left the droves to find another film that pondered who thought this film would be pleasing to anyone. It was badly written, the casting director might have put 1 or 2 minutes of effort on the characters and the director probably didn't care.
