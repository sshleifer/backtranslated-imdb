Like most people, I was interesting when I heard the concept of this movie, especially when "filmmakers were attacked", which seems to have highlighted what the mobile was angry with the pictures on the cover of the filmmakers. Then, to watch and discover what they mean by "attacking filmmakers", some kids threw a stack of stones and a lot of people complained loudly and said, "Somebody should beat these two kids." Total production. What I think is related to the subject of the film, lying and manipulating, to satisfy unnecessary, stupid children with more money and time, in the sense. <br /> <br /> I don't know what great truth the viewer has to take away from this movie. It's like Michael Moore's "Roger & Me", but when "Roger & Me" was blinking at Moore's people. It is totally wrong and totally naughty. Wow! Do you think that people who have suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited if they have food? What pulls! And this is not so much: "Look at the influence of capitalism and Western media on blah blah blah" because it was not just that their counterfeit market had comparable prices to competitors, that is, as many people in the movie say, prices were absurd low, nobody mentions that they should have known that it was counterfeit, how much they paid from the lot. It doesn't prove anything except that poor people go to a store with low prices, bravo guys, a way to stay under the people. <br /> <br /> Five foolish practical jokes to play for the elderly. You should be very proud. How about your next film a documentary about Iraq and how people really bring joy there, if the walls are not bullet holes and then say, "HAHA! DON'T KNOW! Media!". <br /> <br /> Morgan "Please Like Me" Spurlock triggered this movie with a wet thumb and is not surprising because Spurlock, as one of the hits that the documentary world wonder prince seems to be throwing its mass behind any silly sound concept to remain relevant in the world, that doesn't really need him. <br /> <br /> Avoid like a plague.
