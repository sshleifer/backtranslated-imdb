It completely destroys me, why Godard is so serious - and one plus one is a great example of his intuition, both as a filmmaker and as an "intellectual" polemic. It is hard to believe that Godard actually believed all this Marquise and Maoist Cant. Anyone with a half brain can develop their "isms" bankrupt and how many people they destroyed and destroyed, even if Godard made their films in support of them. As a filmmaker, ask yourself: would you have boring voice commands that read annoying political spirits in your audience, and then, if you could not do anything else, sketch the second voice to the first voice that had lost the audience after the first 100 words in any case? Brilliant, Jean-Luc! As for Godard, who wants to film with Rolling Stones: of course he did; wouldn't you? It was the only guarantee that for the first time we saw such a meaningless garbage: the Stones genius, which conceals a gifted and striking political idiot that has been disengaged with the camera. The book shop scene was not even the worst side theater, and it was an insult to the intelligence of babies who were practiced in it - as can be easily seen. Copying, allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artless mess was a satire of making the mainstream film, is nothing more than a safe way out to offer those who clearly see Godard's spiritual intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience. Chronic, Godard's one-time big friend, Truffaut, with Nuit Americain, made the best film ever, and Godard did the worst with Le Mepris! By the way, Godard did not chose with Stones for the devil. That's what they did when the film "Barnes Olympic Studios" started filming.
