One of them is the highest rating I could give this movie, given that zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Pee Yew, a nonsense confusion in the film, where there are many wasted b-list participants who have done a better job, wrote and directed a guy with twelve-year-old mindset who jokes and strikes in foolish punches, and poop and fart jokes. For example, the character of Gene Stapelton (Ding-Bat from All in the Family), which talks about the character of Marilu Henner, that she "praises both ways" sexually, was a cheap test of humor that shows the film's total stupidity ... You want a good, funny humor? Rent Animal House, American Pie (Part One Only), Old School or Office Space.
