This film is fairly known as one of the most terrible examples of propaganda ever produced. The disease's persistent equation with the disease is simply pathological and even worse that it will become credible for a few seconds <br /> <br /> because of its recurrence. The fact that something such a raw material works, even if it is short, is in itself a lesson. You have to have a strong stomach and be sure to grab yourself to sit through it, and I wouldn't want to try if you have no reason.
