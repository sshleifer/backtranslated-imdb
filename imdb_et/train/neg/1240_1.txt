I think everyone was quite disappointed with this sci-fi flick. First, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing, this is a remake of what should be classic. I found it boring, harsh and ridiculous. Once you've seen it, you know what I mean. Almost all of Imdbis say it's a mess and a boy. If you haven't avoided it. This is snorer. 1 out of 10.
