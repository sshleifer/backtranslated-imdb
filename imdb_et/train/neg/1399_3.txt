Ouch, what a painful Sci-Fi movie! And this is especially sad because opening 15 minutes was so fast and full of potential! In the introduction, we observe a number of nervous security workers and hired men as they pursue a doctor who escaped from a mysterious lab with secret files full of sage. As he begins to show up in the lab with the allegedly terrible and inhumane events, he has been executed. Numbers? Since then, "action" has shifted between two places, the aforementioned laboratory and the rural areas of a corrupt senator (or something), and it quickly becomes clear that the tests are actually confusing. More like boring, pointless and vague. Scientists chose four random people without living relatives, and it's really really important for them to tell the truth, even though the gigantic machine reads the content of their thoughts anyway. They all hide the dark secrets of their past and people suffer when they appear; but I don't see how these tests could cause a dangerous device for humanity. Maybe I missed something, but I doubt. Interactions between patients and doctors are even less interesting because none of them have personalities. Basically, the "brain machine" simply deals with the lives of a number of flat people living in a terribly furnished room. The film could have been shorter than half an hour if it wasn't built for thirty standing buildings! Relocations from the lab to the wool and vice versa are shown once every five seconds. Whether the makers really needed upholstery or they just assumed that all Sci-Fi viewers are morals that can't see the change of location themselves. Already for the tenth time, just for the tenth time, the abandonment of abandoned pools is quite annoying, I assure you. James Best's perception of being an admirer of a mental problem is quite decent, but one man can certainly not save it because it is an absolute waste of time. Avoid!
