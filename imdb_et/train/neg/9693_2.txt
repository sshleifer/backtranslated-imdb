The "Bonjour Triste" burnt plot has been taken from the first novel by Francoise Sagani, who became the best seller, although God knows why. For young people who want to get rid of a potential parent, they may have a certain complaint. Do not take into account that David Niven plays a playboy father and Deborah Kerri step-by-step in-perspective. Unfortunately, too much Jean Seberg relies on his weak shoulders. She is beautiful and easily fills a corrupted teenage picture. The problem is that he can hit but he can't act. Anyone who saw her in Joan of Arcina's Otto Preminger St. Joan - in the first film by Seberg - knows he couldn't bear a 19-year-old movie. This film, including Preminger, fulfills the first promise. It was his second film; he was now 20. What was Preminger thinking? Can Niven and Kerr compensate for Seberg's lack of ability to act? No chance? The character of Seberg is at the heart of the story and quite convincing, though he may be physically 17 years old, unable to meet his emotional demand. I don't know if he was a successful actor in his short life because he didn't affect my consciousness in his later pictures. But anyone who thinks this film is better than mediocre needs a taste control. In spite of Niven and Kerry, this is a youthful fashion that is done by a young young girl who desperately needed action training.
