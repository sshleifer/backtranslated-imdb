This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only has the skill to act, but the script is incredibly low and flat. You actually hear a serious dialogue, which means "I love you more." "I don't love you more." I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour, I couldn't take it anymore. His "South Girl" charm just doesn't work and is really quite annoying; His attempts to knock down humor fall to the plane, and he offers such lines as he reads the script directly from the page. Poor Luke Wilson. Didn't he read the script before he agreed, or did he make a big profit promise to Papa Joe (Jessica's father and film producer)? Hopefully, he now knows better than another to sign up for such a movie. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate seeing that painful vision in his form is a bad dialogue. <br /> <br /> I also think that the previous commentary, which gave this film to 8 out of 10, was probably either in the movie or hired Papa Joe to give the film a better rating. No one in their right mind finds this movie in reality. <br /> <br /> Jessical has a lot of money, right? Maybe buy some exhibitions?
