I got this movie on AZN. It sounded like it would be a good movie, the Japanese "green card". I can't say I've never liked an Asian movie, on the contrary. Some of the most amazing horror movies are Japan and Korea, and I'm a huge fan of John Woo's Hong Kong movies. I'm not unfavorable to bright films like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favorites), so I thought I'd like it. Well, I'd rather drag my wrists and drink my blood as I watch this laborious, poorly-acting movie still. <br /> <br /> I think director Steven Okazaki needs to spray with water at Qualude, because no one was the personality of this film. And if a character DID tries to act instead of rhythm or two, their performance was forced and incredibly fake. I do not believe honestly that anyone would ever have acted before ... The only person who was real was Brenda Aoki. I find it amazing that it is being promoted as a comedy because I never laughed. Even more surprising is that CBS morning news called it "refreshing comedy". It was neither refreshing nor comedic. And the end was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think about such things. <br /> <br /> HOW TO DISCOVER this movie if you don't want to see a boring predicted plot line and wood. I really think "Bensonhurst spike" is a better movie than that ... and I went to this movie!
