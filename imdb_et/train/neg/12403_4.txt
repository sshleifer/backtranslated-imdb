ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE (1940) is the ninth (ninth) film in the series and shows the direction he will inevitably head. The signs ANDY HARDY (Mickey Rooney) and JUDGE HARDY (Lewis Stone) were front and center. The rest of the majority went too easily, knocking the clock and the amount of control. The series rises once again and is at its moments, but death has fallen. The Lewis Stone series also continued the character of JUDGE HARDY in a sympathetic manner. The rest would be professional, though less and less. Mickey Rooney, on the other hand, would continue his character as there is no curriculum. Andy's response to any situation was naive and incredible. Even after he was a veteran of World War II at the LOVE LAUGHS ANDY HARDY (1946), his reaction to any "teapot temple" was the same as the minor. <br /> <br /> This movie is clearly illustrated. ANDY gets into a number of incredible situations that would be solved with a simple explanation. This screen writing device was known as an "idiot image". Stretching an insufficiently written scenario. Maybe it was less Mickey Rooneys' fault then director and writers. Probably George B. Seitz led one too much and a stronger hand was needed to control Rooneys' excesses. To see our review of the entire series, contact YOU 'ON ON YOUNG ONCE (1937).
