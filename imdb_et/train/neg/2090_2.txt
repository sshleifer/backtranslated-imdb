I understand that this should not be a BSG and I can handle slow-paced exhibitions if they are interesting, but I find myself completely connected and bored with this series. <br /> <br /> The BSG formula seemed: Action + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Mystery + Drama <br /> <br /> Caprica's formula seems to be: Bland Drama + Moderate Scifi <br /> <br /> Maybe it will be more interesting, but during the 3rd episode I can hardly watch it. In fact, this is at the bottom of the weekly watchlist. This is a sad situation. The Syfi channel destroyed his Friday night. What happened to the glorious days of SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG on Friday night? They had a good thing there.
