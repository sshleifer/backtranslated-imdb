At first glance, this documentary / fiction / comic is quite fun and thought-provoking. Of course, if something provokes thinking, it can be controlled. The reality is that film that combines metaphysics with innuend and inferred conclusions. The link between "What Bleep ..." between science and spirituality is not really rooted in science. The Transcendental Meditation Study mentioned in the film states that group meditation can reduce crime in the area, D.C., Washington. In fact, the HRA (Homicides, Rapes and Assault) crime rates in 1993 were about 30% higher than the average crime rate in 1988-1992. At the time of the study, the kill rate was not absolute. In fact, any claim that links metaphysics with science is debunked. <br /> <br /> My conclusion to this information is that this movie is either a bad attempt to joke with people or a joke. In both cases, I suggest you waste your time. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a long-term film about science that can create thoughts, consider Mindwalki (1990).
