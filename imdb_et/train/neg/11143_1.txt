Hi, I'm a friend of werewolf movies, and when I saw Darkwolf's title that hits the shelves, I was like "hmm, simple and nice at least. Althou ... I don't know why I haven't heard it before." <br /> < br /> First, the movie starts with tits. Lots of tits. Tits pretty much all this movie budget went. Who cares about the werewolves effect, just pay enough for the actors to get topless shots! biker. Not even a super-tough look, but as the old wise woman says in the movie, "she's much more powerful and dangerous than you've seen before." Just describing him as a tattooed biker-type man. Pretty original. I even looked twice when they first used "red glowing eyes". I mean to my god that "lets plant-red-points-on-the-eyes-computer" effect has been used since the 1970s. Here it just seems ugly! And don't start me werewolf with 3D-CGI. As mentioned earlier, like a bad and old video game. And finally, like me, werewolf movies, as I said. They prettymuch always build a werewolf legend of their own. Darkwolf also builds wolfeworld, about the foolish hybrid werewolves and legends of the old bloodline. BUT. It's almost instantly after the recruitment rules are created, "everyone killed by the girl" kills randomly. What just doesn't make any sense, why not barely tell us the rules of killing if they don't even play them ... Aplus wolf-points are made with sony handycam or something, mostly filming floor and walls. Just add the noisy noise and you have the effect of super werewolves. Gore is partly OK. But if the wolf drops everything with an open hand, but basically placing a hand on the victims, it just doesn't make me trick ... <br /> <br /> Really, the WHO makes money to make those piles into direct videos, they're not even funny bad movies, just sad.
