Toss out all the stereotypes and false information you have heard about the half-devoted Mormons, and you will see that they are all a film of ridiculous excuses. Finally, Kurt Hale's fortune has changed (thanks to good) and hopefully it will be a long time before we see any of his qualities in theaters. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was amateurish (I think they used some camcorder scenes). The slip of the plot was very unpleasant. You really didn't understand why someone did something. It was like I had sand in my eyes and my pound sat 300 pounds, it was so painful. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't give this film a negative evaluation was that the scale didn't let me.
