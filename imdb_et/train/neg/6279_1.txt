No, <br /> <br /> Basically your looking at something that doesn't make sense. Don't ruin the movie to people who really want it, see the picture I explain. <br /> <br /> Ordinary everyday woman walks down the street and finds herself driving her own car. He monitors him and many events take place during the time that covers him and his family. <br /> <br /> I made a specific account to comment on this movie, how it wrote terribly. The action was great, the events were great, but the story was just somewhere - it could be added enormously and make the world an epidemic. I'm not sure what the writer was trying to do, usually at the end of the movies most of your questions will be answered, but this film is questionable to you, just what happened and 1 hour 20 minutes just didn't go. /> <br /> The spoiler starts _ <br /> <br /> They had this area between two dimensions (behind us and the glass) that came into our world and killed us. It wasn't all made on film and you never know how it happened or why it was or when it happened. Nothing has been explained during the movie. The main character should not be the main character. At the end of the movie, the guy who finally turns it off and runs away (his sister's boyfriend) should be the main character, but unfortunately the movie ends in 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for $ 10, threw it right away .. don't waste your time. I really hope that nothing will be done.
