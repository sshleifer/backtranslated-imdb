Well, at least my theater group did, lol. So I remember, of course, watching Grease because I was a little girl, though it was never my favorite music or story, but it still has a bit of a special place in my heart, because it's still fun to watch. I heard terrible things about Grease 2 and that is why I decided to watch it, but my boyfriend said it wasn't all that bad and my friend agreed, so I decided to do it, but I called them, just laughed. First, the first plot was first stolen and it wasn't really smart, not to mention that they just used the same characters but different names and actors. Tell me how pink women and T-birds continued for years after the ex-gangs left? Not to mention that the creator is facing the enemy of the motorcycle, the gee, which striking similarity to the first movie and their T-birds was just stupid and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Another year at Rydle and music and dance have not stopped. But when a new student, Sandy's cousin, comes to the scene, she's in love with a pink lady, Stephanie. But he has to adhere to a code where only Pink Ladies must hold T-birds so that the new student decides to train as T-birds to win his heart. So she dresses up as a rebel engine cycle bandit who can drive well and fight evil cyclists from the easy beat of T-Bird's butts. But does he tell Stephanie who he really is or can he find out for himself? Well, know for yourself. <br /> <br /> Fat 2 is like a funny TV show that didn't work. Gang did not click and the first Grease did, not to mention the French return was a bit stupid and unbelievable, because I thought he had finished Rydell, but apparently he didn't. The songs were not so memorable; I'm glad that Michelle was able to bounce back so quickly, but it's probably because she was the only talent in this stupid little stage, I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you're curious, but I warned you, it's just pathetic attempt to get more money from famous music. <br /> <br /> 2/10
