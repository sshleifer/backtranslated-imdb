Let's just say it in words so that even the filmmakers would have the opportunity to understand: this is a very stupid movie, even with a dirty script, a flat animation and a story that is as original as a thumbnail. Don't worry - if you don't need to find any way to attract mentally disabled adults or extremely slow children. They can laugh, especially if they are behind their meds. The film is a special offense, which is ridiculous - not only the filmmakers probably think that children are idiots without brains that can be captured with entertainment, costing around zero, but they hardly even break the sweaty gag here and there that the adult can find fun. Frankly, this movie was royal. Shame on you for such a low worship.
