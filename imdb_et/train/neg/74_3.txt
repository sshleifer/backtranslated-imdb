They built this sort of fantasy-man snow river, meet Butch Cassidy and the son of Sundance, and just for a romantic touch, Ned and Joe can play high-talent, rich young men of eternal young women. OK, there are a lot of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also many well-documented facts, still leaving room for artistic creativity in creating a good historical drama. I mean, it's not Robin Hood's story, not Arthur's legends, not Beowulf, no one whose life has been hidden for so many centuries, that their life and times of holidays are 99% believed. It's just a couple of lives. My grandparents were already school-aged when Ned hanged. <br /> <br /> So it's stupid for me that the imaginative imagination of this movie is a serious attempt to tell Kelly's story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel "The true history of Kelly Gang", I was eagerly waiting for it to be similar. But no, in fact it is that Mick Jagger much fell in love with 1970 Kelly was probably much closer to reality and a better film in general, which doesn't talk much about it. <br /> <br /> It's nice that it only cost me two bucks to borrow a DVD! I give it to 3/10, and that's just because some Australian shrubs nice shots make me generous.
