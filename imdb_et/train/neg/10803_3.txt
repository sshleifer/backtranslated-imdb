OK, so after watching this lively movie and wasteful hours and so many minutes of my life here is a basic summary: Genie leaves the ghetto boom, gives this child 3 haired hairs, the boy wastes his wishes, I forget what, shaq sucks during the rampage and I think this is the case. <br /> <br /> So I laughed, I cried ...... but mostly I laughed at the sham comedy that came from the great actors. nba player / rapper and boy with hairy hair. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to college kids who sit with some of their close friends on some beers and have to laugh seriously. <br /> <br /> I give him three out of 10 only a b / c movie based on 3 magical desires. <br /> <br /> If I had 3 wishes, this terrible movie would have been deleted and everyone would do as Hollywood does not waste money on doing so.
