This review is usually all spoilers. If you are planning to enjoy this movie, don't read this review. <br /> <br /> This is a problem with children's TV today. It's all so patronizing and embarrassing. "Wow, it was fun, isn't it?" No, it wasn't. And unfortunately, it also seems to have penetrated into children's films. And that is the "reindeer flight". Indeed, in a few years I have not seen the "reindeer flight", so some points may be blurry, but I remember to be impressed with this time. <br /> <br /> In principle, the story is followed by a lecturer who is given a book for Christmas. Now the lecturer is a reputable scientist on the aviation activities of some animals. I think it was bullfrogs. Anyway, through this book, the Lecturer / family man learns that reindeer can fly exactly like bullfrogs. Apparently, this book has been written by hundreds of years ago by a scientist who disappeared in northern Poland. Now, if it were for me, I would throw the book out of the nearest window. Flying shrubs are a natural phenomenon, but flying reindeer is a fantastic and completely unrealistic concept. But, the esteemed lecturer is not me, so I think it explains why he decides to fly to the North Pole, leaving his wife and child home without knowing where he has left. Of course, things go awry and before he knows it, a flying reindeer has fallen into his private car and he has been enticed by the North Pole. <br /> <br /> Do you still follow that? Good. <br /> <br /> Her family is naturally devastated. I'd be too, I mean, what a wonderful Christmas. Elsewhere, Mr. Lecturer finds himself in a hidden city in the North Pole, where there is a dwarf and one tyrannical figure dressed in red and white. Instead of trying to escape immediately, as I would have done, he welcomes all the open arms there. This hidden civilization of hidden monsters and he welcomes them with open arms. Oooo-kayyyy. They eat the story that they are Santa Claus elves and they spend all year round, making toys for them that they don't have. And Mr. Lecturer agrees. He even agrees that Santa is actually a scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago or whatever. There is only one problem - they don't want him to leave. The world cannot know about their secret existence. After all, before they know it, McDonalds and Starbucks would be at every corner of the street. <br /> <br /> Still on? <br /> <br /> Mr. Nice Boy now finds a book and assumes he's gone to the North Pole. Boy, wouldn't they be embarrassed if they discovered he was just walking? Before the audience knows it, they will shoot down to spend Christmas on the most authentic winter wonderland on the planet. At the same time, the sick gentleman's lecturer becomes ill with all enemies and decides to leave. I don't remember exactly, but I remind him that he has a Santa Claus at the gun. The fight of fire occurs when the dwarf is attacked and manages to escape on Santa's Friday. When Santa is hot and eye-blown with his heels, nothing, because of any miraculous compassion, he finds that he is driving his family plane that is looking for him. So he jumps on his plane, the planes fly back and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> The fact is that over the years, some shocking movies have been made during Christmas, but because they're the festive charm they're going to miss. And this is the charm that is completely absent from the Reindeer Flight. something that insults intelligence (well, obviously, but it is a child's film and so can get out of such things) or something particularly offensive, but there's no problem with that either. It just doesn't know Santa. And the movie, all about Christmas, is a big mistake. But hey, I don't think "Reindeer to the target group?" Why should they? They have all so calmed the sedatives that they probably couldn't write "Christmas". <br /> <br /> I'll give him three out of ten. If that were a TV movie, I'd add two more stars. We all know how bad they are.
