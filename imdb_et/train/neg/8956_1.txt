Quite unfortunate prequel for the first two films, it hasn't got any first stop or other interest. Focusing on men who run a "cube", it basically removes the tension inside the cube, because we just don't care about the characters. Much of the film is just boring and it will become really terrible with the glass-eyed boss and the green-eyed mad sea. After that, however, it just falls into unintentional fun. The end is appropriate, indirectly linking it back to the first. The script is terrible, best acting mediocre and direction unimpressive. Much less follow-up.
