Dr. The Fu Manchu Fiendish plot, featuring Peter Sellers with characters created by Sax Rohmer, is unfair to the end of the sales career. The plot was very simplified and, if it had been done, it could have worked well, but its execution was bad. Part of the reason why this film was not so good was poor dialogue, cheap laugh, dirty leadership and an uncomfortable feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete. was really the only thing that keeps my interest in this mixed picture. I found that with the imagination of the sellers, the infamous Manchu, whose random lines are remembered, has been foolishly made. For example, there is a situation where Fu Manchu is confused about what a man is, in which he says, "Ah, you all see me the same." I don't want to admit it, but I laughed out with that line. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, strong strong characters attracted my attention, such as Helen Mirren like the backstabbing constant, David Tomilson as Sir Roger Avery (including his last film, not the way to end his career) and Sid Ceasar (who gives the FBI for Al Capone's working relative). These characters also kept me looking. <br /> <br /> The kits were also nice. Oriental design and English society developed in 1933 in this elegant picture. <br /> <br /> Frankly, my suggestion is to watch a movie when you're a Peter Sellers or Sid Ceasar fan. Otherwise, you are on the right chewing aluminum fixation.
