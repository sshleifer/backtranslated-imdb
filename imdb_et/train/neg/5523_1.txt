The Georgian rule must be one - if not the worst film I've ever seen in my life. The whole film has a very surreal feeling that made me beat, "what?" at least eight hours at least 7-10 times. <br /> <br /> Advertised as a trailer as a film of three generations - Jane Fonda as a Matriarch, Felicity Huffman as a Daughter and Lindsay Lohan as a Rebellious, Sexual, Little Clad Grand-Daughter, The Viewer Thinks It is a Clich√©, Light, Chick -flick about raising and having a family. <br /> <br /> Tell the wrong after many animals have "funny" things in the background of "central" scenes, and not to mention five minutes focusing on the old woman who comes to the doctor. a week that his diapers change, or the fact that this film is actually Lindsay Lohan's character, which his father has sexually abused, creates a Georgian rule for his cinematic genre: unjustified, terribly acting and inappropriate comedy that deals with extremely serious problems most uncomfortable, a more surreal, strange way. If Garry Marshall wanted this film to be a drama / comedy, he would have had to watch The Royal Tenenbaums. Lateral. Junebug. And so on. And so on. <br /> <br /> The only way I feel I get the reader to understand that the Georgian rule is terrible to create a hypothetical situation. Say the film, a 40-year-old virgin, was the main character because she was sexually molassed as a child. But instead of taking the film, it should become more dramatic, the stomach laughs and comedy, with all the characters' reactions being fake, inanimate, the people who pretend to care. <br /> <br /> Throw yellow parrot, Dermot Mulroney as the flattest, non-dimensional character that could have cut this badly written script, along with a man who throws away all his religious beliefs and morals to be uncomfortable together too tanned with a girl who does not share any of the same interests as her, as well as unnecessary car chasing, unreal characters trying to associate with each other, and you have the Georgian rule. <br /> <br /> I found this film to be offensive to any of these people who fight against filmmakers, screenwriters, actors, editors, etc. Who has many more talents and they can't notice. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie: my rule. <br /> <br /> And if you need it, you will have enough drunk before your hand.
