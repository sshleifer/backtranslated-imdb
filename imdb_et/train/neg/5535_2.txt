I think the biggest failure can be boring. Bad is actually better than boring. This thing doesn't breathe. It is an interesting fact that this is happening in Cambodia. Several Americans made 30's films in Cambodia. Nonetheless, the conflict is a little difficult to figure out. Even the movement of troops is a bit confusing. What drives it to an amazing stop is a love story. Why are these two men so perfect that I don't know. I thought she should continue to use her zombies (as they are) and forget about her. The film is simply run by. The perfect microcosm is where one of the main characters follows the Cambodian priest through the water to reach a secret place where hieroglyphs (or whatever) explain how to turn people into zombies. I thought they would never get there. One man takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. Another man hides behind some columns. He takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other man hides behind the bushes. This is a short film. Then there is bad behavior and insecure dialogue. I really have a lot of patience with B movies. It's impatient. By the way, a more appropriate title would be a hypnotized rebellion.
