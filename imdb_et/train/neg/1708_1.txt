OK, I don't have to say too much about this movie, besides: I've seen over 4000 movies in my life and more than 2,300 of them were horror movies. Although I have some difficulty in deciding what is best (unlike my favorite, which I can tell you is George A. Romero DAWN OF THE DEAD), I can tell you without any hesitation that Todd Sheets' ZOMBIE BLOODBATH is the absolute worst horror movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> You can't say anything positive about this movie. Action, Dialogue, Leadership, Make-up, Music ... All aspects of this movie are just so far from acceptable that it is, in my opinion, ever even released. <br /> <br Even if you are a graduate of a horror or zombie movie, please see my warning and DO NOT waste your time on this garbage. It's no pleasure to watch it. You can't even laugh at a display that is exhibited ... Believe me. Please.
