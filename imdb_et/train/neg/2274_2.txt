Well, I hate Hollywood, but I love cinema, so I have to watch these tough movies in theaters. And I was hoping Vanilla Sky would be good. I was hoping they would keep the original "Open their eyes" exactly the same, or make them own. Well, it happened so little as well, and it sucked. <br /> <br /> It went well. I love Radiohead. I wish there would be more. But finally we listen to The Beach Boys' good vibrations. Talk about a wide range of sucking. They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a few others, but why they didn't have to cancel the GV at the peak. It was more annoying than confusing or blatant. Especially if he has nothing to do with the disc. At least some meaning behind the songs. Kid A = primary. No matter what. <br /> <br /> He made a bang with the club scene. It was cool. Otherwise, the film was one big arrogance. Just as viewers would get a movie. Those that could read its subtitles and the rest did not. It's that simple. All the motivations collided. I didn't think of Diaz's motivations (if they weren't before the chicken soup night?) And some other. And I hate Kurt Russell. Stay overboard. Tom Cruise can't work (especially for this type of movie, ie Eyes Wide Shut). And the elevator. I get it. Anyway, they tried to improve the original with crappy american rock soundtrack and crappy corners and good film printing and glossy processing, and it would have helped if the crowe hadn't screwed it up. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Great disappointment.
