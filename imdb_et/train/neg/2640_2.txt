Trying to think of something like SENTINEL would be quite difficult. There are many problems. The result is terrible and loaded with plot holes. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas marks Pete Garrison, a secret service agent who "lived one" Reagan during his life experiment. Years later, we found Pete, who was appointed to the Whitehouse family, mainly as the first lady's guard (Kim Basinger, L.A CONFIDENTIAL). Problems arise when we see Pete's close cooperation with the first lady and the sudden threat to the president (David Rasche, UNITED 93). When Pete fails the polygraph test, he is an unpleasant representative of David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 TV series). your people. His only trustee is the first lady, and he doesn't want anyone to talk about each other's related feelings (that's why Pete wasn't the first in the polygraph). But is Pete really innocent? Or is he just trying to buy time until he can kill the president? If he is innocent, how can he help prevent a murder attempt in secrecy? <br /> <br /> One big and overwhelming problem with this film is that there is no reason for the presidential threat. Isn't that what the film should be? You might think that! But the audience is never given why the assassin (s) want to kill Prezi. Hmm. Anyone forget to forget this script somewhere? <br /> <br /> And what about David Breckinridge (Kiefer )'s new partner Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA WAY)? It looks like he was put on the film strictly as $ $ candy. What was his purpose again? Did he do anything other than nice pants and a low cut blouse? <br /> <br /> Sentinel's basic premise is that there are as many problems as ridiculous. "What is ...?" the answers will surely express those unfortunate people who watch the film.
