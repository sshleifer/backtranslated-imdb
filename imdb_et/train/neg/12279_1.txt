Although this seems to be a fairly old show (2002), I looked at my first episode last night and I have to say that it must be the worst. . . I've never been commenting, but I was so shocked that there is a show that is obviously trying to get up, and I just assume that it was their target group, children under 12 years old, or people with less than average IQ. <br /> <br /> The last night's episode contained so many divergent stories, trying to include every possible plot summary that could be imagined and trying to declare friendship, family, religion, and politics !!!. <br /> <br /> The main story they had in the episode was: Frat House wrongly misunderstood too much alcohol - Death turns out to be a senator's son who wants to investigate the FBI. Death is actually a murder of peanut allergy. Senator thinks it may be his sworn enemy and the best friend of childhood who did it because the senator took his money for his legislative vote, but finally got a conscience and said "no" means several millionaires. Everyone suspected, but everyone has a normal alibi (a former girlfriend married to a teacher who had to lie, a disappointed student reported by a victim, was a changing experience, an enemy of senators did not pay a desperate student to kill a son of a sworn enemy, she gives money freely to many people students). Throughout this time, this teardrop hero is his niece who is "at this age" and who has a drunken boy whom he finally dares to talk to with his aunt, but only to let him because the girls say he is not good enough and so that they stay with them. Don't worry, he's going back with a boy after he learns the truth about life and "in" girls drop him, Aunty also explains that God is the only one who can really rely on (I was almost sick here) <br /> > This "drama" becomes even better when Sue and her FBI team know who the killer is. . . your laugh, I'm sure. . . <br /> <br /> This is one of the Frat boys who only one year ago discovered that he was accepted and that his true father is an international terrorist and he is trying to impress his father who kills the boy and the planting bomb at the funeral. . . . . . . Characters are cardboard whose functioning is a cardboard, continuity is a cardboard, a story is a cardboard Anyone who says they love this example is a brain for cardboard <br /> <br /> Why its writers are showing they have tried every event to pack one into an example, which means that they probably have no faith in the development of the character or the participants who are able to take out a simple plot. Watching this show is like watching "Last Action Hero", where Arnie kills 5,000 people with teeth, except Arnie is a better actor (wow, never thought it would be the day I'd say!) <Br /> <br /> Simpson's beloved character "comic book" in words. . . . <br /> <br /> WORKING TV SHOW. . . . . EVER.
