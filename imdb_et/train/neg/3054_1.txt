The NSA, CIA, FBI, FSB and all other snoop agencies should look at this movie to get information about how people spy. (because MST3k commented on this ... "Sanatal is dirt every time! Santa's hips come far and wide! The hell is not hidden from the organization") <br /> <br /> From telescopes that may be over a million miles to the ears that hear everything. It is amazing that CIA does not have Santa Claus in payroll. <br /> <br /> Satan's dance course is fun. Pitch ... he's so pointless. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor in this movie is huge. Very small budget, but so fun to watch. I recommend looking even more at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version. <br /> <br /> You even laugh with good kids. <br /> <br /> I will give it 1 to produce 10 cheeses and pure cheeses.
