I rarely comment on movies, but I have read other comments and I can't believe that such celluloid garbage is accepted. I know there are certain people who have their own agenda, but what makes it possible to do it on merit; badly acted, badly shot, and the story seemed to be the way the director did it. I'm not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film, where little kids are involved, because the filmmakers have probably known what they wanted and what their audience would want. I can say that this is a terrible movie, the content is poor and offensive, production is amateurish and I am glad that they could not legally make such a movie today
