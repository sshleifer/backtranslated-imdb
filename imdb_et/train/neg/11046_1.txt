This is probably one of the worst films ever made. Bad action, bad special effects, bad plot, bad things. In the last 15 minutes, a cat is introduced to the cat, which all sounds great. Malcom MacDowell needs to have to pay the house, otherwise he would have had to sell Hollywood Blvd. I just don't know how you can go from Clockwork Orange to that mess and head into the mirror every morning. I could have done better special effects for my bath. There is no consistency. it is so bad for drugs. Action. Do they have to smoke to be bad? The gun either takes the blue flames or the balls, makes its mind. A bad girl and another girl in the movie are watching so much that it is confusing If it's called Seadly Wake 2013, she has nothing to do with the movie
