Tony Scott destroys everything that might have been interesting in Richard Kelly's clich√©, split, burnt-out scenario. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model who fell out and became a mercy. It's his story ... "sort of." <br /> <br /> The problem with this garbage is that there is not a lot of story at all and Scott's extreme graphic styling for each image acts as a distance mechanism that makes us indifferent to Harvey's chaotic life. <br /> <br /> You just don't care about Harveys. Knightley plays her as an unpleasant, cynical who has done nothing to justify our respect. He strikes people he does not like and puts his clothes and obstacles where the situation requires it, but he is not the least real and Knightly is also not the least convincing. <br /> <br /> The film is boring. It's also loud, and it's mixed with one annoying source music score I've heard for a long time. For the last twenty minutes, Scott's "True Romance" climax is a bad repetition, where Domino's gang meets two of the bad guys who are - surprise! surprise! It is designed to shoot at each other at the top of the Las Vegas casino. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this potentially fascinating confusion has completely hit Scott and becomes a confusing, pretentious, pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation. . It is not an artistic brave or experimental piece; it is a failure at every level because it does not give us any access to the lives and dilemmas of its characters. <br /> <br /> Mickey Roarke looks good like a glowing ballhole, but he disappears into the background as the "narrative" progresses. Chris Walken turns to another embarrassing chamber and Dabney Coleman, always confident, hasn't been used up enough. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the multi-layered trimmed surface of this movie. It's still no matter how hard you polish it.
