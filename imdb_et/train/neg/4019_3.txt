Dakota (1988) was another Lou Diamond Phillips starring vehicle. This film is similar to the later release of Harley. There are some differences, but both are the same. I don't know which one came from. I think it's a secret of one life. But they're both worrying "kids" trying to live there. Bicycles are horses instead. They are basically the same film and they are both hellish. If you are serious L.D.P. then I suggest you look at both of them. You get L.D.P. If you're a game, go for it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended except for L.D.P. fans !!!
