One of the most "literate" Lone Stars, whose time is spent on character development and communication, dialogue and action. Open scene defines a star (literally) of gamblers, Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler) and his friend John Scott (John Wayne) rodeo (say Roh-Day-oh), both of which are a little chunky. The film follows their adventures as they strive each other for the best of Mexico's Juanita, and later for the noble name of Mary Kornman, who is inevitable with the evil brother (though he was wrong with the true cable and wants to repent). And, of course, they are wrongly accused of having two crimes and they have to serve in prison for a long time before they escape and release. <br /> <br /> The highest point is Scott constantly and deliberately Mars butt in his grocery store and tapping the ladder he stands to allow him to catch and grab. It seems a bit modern for the 30s, but it sounds better than it really is. Unfortunately, many of the other exciting features of Lone Stars are very inadequate. Not Yakima Canutt. Cheaper and poor use of riders falling off horses. No George Hayes. Tedne Stooge-like bi-play between Scott and Charlie, Charlie turning to Scott, Scott stomping on his leg and then punching him (repeat two more times!). Qualified Paul Fix is ​​underestimated. Eddy Chandler himself, here in his big letters, is not really unbelievable as a randy half-brother. The villain looks too old and fat. So Chandler, who spent his later career in another 300 films, is a hopeless meat. Mary Kornman, the twentieth year of "Our Gang" (see "Mary, the Queen of Tots" in 1925) is cute in John Wayne scenes, but that's for it. The seeds of the better western part are buried here. <br /> <br /> P.S. An ultra-short, painted version that looks good, moves so fast, it's over when it flashes more than once. Fortunately, however, the scenes of Eddy Chandler are embarrassing.
