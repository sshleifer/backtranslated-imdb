I was very surprised that this movie was as good as I saw in IMDb after that. It's really one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies. It seems like a good movie at first, but when he arrived, I couldn't believe how bad it was. This voice command destroys everything! Imagine that you are open like this and then listen to what he says. I saw the movie in German so I don't really know what he said in English, but ironic stuff like "Yes, it doesn't hurt ..." ... what is it? Tell yourself "think something else" and then forgetting your pain just thinking about your girlfriend is just ... stupid. And his mother ... how the hell does he see something like that? Someone has to tell him, his son died in surgery (which he had to wait). In addition, he found some stars in Jessica Albas' bag. plus that "he knows hospital" things ... and then he takes "one second" to figure it out? What the hell? ^ ^ And it ends ... why is the police interrupting them? The patient died in surgery, that's all that happened. This drunken doctor doesn't know anything else ... and then they're gonna hit them all, even a girlfriend? Why ??? Despite all that I think Christensen did a bad job, but it doesn't matter to me. I watched this movie with friends and we were all very disappointed ... As I said, one of the worst films I've ever seen is.
