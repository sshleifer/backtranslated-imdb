Awful, just terrible. This proves my theory of "power of the star". It should be a great TV because the man who drove (battlestar) Titanica is the same guy who led this shlop schtick chick. Find something that is a thousand times more interesting, like watching TV without picture and no sound. 1/10 (I rated it as high b / c that there are no negative results in the IMDb.com rating system). <br /> <br /> -Zaphoid <br /> <br /> PS: My theory of "star power" is: the more "star power" used in the show, the weaker it is. (This is called indirect proportionality: quality 1 / "star power", less "sp" changes for better quality, etc. The other way to watch it is: "more is less.") <br /> <br /> - Z
