I had great hopes for this movie because I enjoyed the book so much. But I don't think I'd have understood the film's premise if I hadn't read the book. The film is a noble attempt to show the despair of the people who are trying to break the bonds of powerful government government, but the book is much more painful. Corrupt state officials have a comfortable, almost luxurious life, while ordinary people struggle to meet the needs that are essential for survival. Perhaps most people know their leaders and rulers, regardless of whether they are actually emphasized or repressed. Orwell's dystopia seems like it would be possible in many places in our modern world. Several years have passed since reading the book, but we often hear references to Big Brother, the think tank and Newspeak in the media and in casual conversation. Obviously, many people who use these terms do not understand where these conditions came from. I strongly recommend reading the book.
