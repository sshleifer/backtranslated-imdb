I think I've seen worse movies, but it can be as harsh as the standard of these bad movies. The killer monster is really very bad, basically his boyfriend with some green body suit. It is much worse than the B-film goes, but does not believe that it was something that was a star, no hell. In fact, it had a lot containing the substance, but it was still stupid. Basically it's just a bad low budget horror movie. But at least it's not as bad as titanic that the film sucks balls, it just sucks. The blood seems really fake in this movie. This is one complaint about the whole new fear of the new millennium, the low quality gore, is stupid. A good scary death scene with really fake blood is so stupid. At least there was a nice shower
