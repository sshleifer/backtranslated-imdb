I just saw this movie on television and I have to admit that I was a little surprised that it was even. There were so many cradles, confusion and bad editing that the old episode of Sesame Street would have been better to watch. The action was OK, but please, you really feel "direct video". The cast / team made this movie a bad melodrama. Yes, there is a message in the movie, but just wait ten minutes before the end to listen to it. Trust me, you don't even tell the difference.
