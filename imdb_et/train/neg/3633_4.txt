The ten actors who portrayed Philo Vance in the series seemed to be Edmund Lowe's most enjoyable, but in this script, the audience is ahead of the famous detective. After all, if jockey, Douglas Walton, stare at the empty space, apparently hypnotized and says something like "I have to drive and kill," I felt that it was stupid that no one else would have died after that. The police thought it was suicide because he said he was doing it! After the hated horse owner Gene Lockhart is shot and killed, Frieda Inescort does the same, saying he is going to die, and then jumps deadly from the bus. I laughed when Lowe finally nervous, "I got it," as if it was a revelation. The guilty party, however, was cleverly hidden and there was a significant relationship when that party began to hypnotize Lowet to jump out of the roof.
