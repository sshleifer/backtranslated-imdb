It was obvious that this film was intended for the audience of Chick Flick, to whom I have sat quite a bit and enjoyed the most. But it was a very irritating attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan (who turned into hell). His actions were superfluous and seemed to be superfluous to his colleagues when they relaxed in their roles. This movie could have been more, because the budget for the settings, actors and decent story was the right one. My wife and I agreed that it was Muck at the end, because the movie ended up in a painful embarrassing high! Better luck next time, I hope Miss Graham sticks to the kind of movies she's like Hell.
