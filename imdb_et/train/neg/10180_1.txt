This movie is a disgrace to the Major League franchise. I live in Minnesota and even I can't believe they are dumped in Cleveland. (Yes, I know when the real Indians were pretty good, and the twins had taken their place at the bottom of the American League, but still be consistent.) Anyway, I loved the first big alliance, liked the other, and always expects the third when the Indians finally end up in the series arrived. You can't say it wasn't a plan after the second movie was finished. What happened? Anyway, if your original Major League real fan does a favor and don't look at this spam.
