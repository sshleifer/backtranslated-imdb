Cheezy's action film plays with Dolph Lungren. Lungren is a one-time soldier who is back for study. But the changes in the neighborhood and the student body have left him frustrated and he decides he will hang it. Things get dicey when looking at a number of detained pupils, some robbers take to school, which is the basis for military robbery. His Dolph versus bad in the fight against death. The jaws dropped back to the late-floor era of films where bad guys and some bad women were daylight. What a stupid movie. I can't believe people did this way, it's an action movie that was likely to go away before the low budget, counterfeit exit kits, and bad lines were even flashing in the eyes of manufacturers. See how late the cars in the movie are going through the school (don't ask) they get into the security tower (ask it because it looks more in jail than in high school) and break this barely constructed form (it doesn't seem to have happened in previous techniques). What are the gods of bad movies? Actually, I'm overwhelmed because it was directed by (?) Sydney J Furie, a really good director who made films like "Boys in Company C". Did his ability fail or was it hopeless if he didn't even get the trouble? It's a turkey. Traceable but turkey still.
