Office work, especially in this age of computers, multifunctional copiers, e-mail, voicemail, snail, and temple, is a mature territory with satirical capabilities that have been previously "Clockwatchers" and "Office Space," and very successfully. This latest addition to the temple / humor pool, but the Haiku tunnel, leads Josh Kornbluth and Jacob Kornbluth, does not live its predecessors and leaves a laugh somewhere outside the door, waiting for the chance to sneak in. Unfortunately, this is not an opportunity for the audience; so what you get is nice to try, but as the man once said, there is no cigar. <br /> <br /> As a narrator / star of the movie, Josh Kornbluth (playing Josh Kornbluth) (directly in the monologue delivered to the camera) is a pure fiction and takes place in a fictional city of San Francisco. This is an innovative, if not very imaginative, waiver of responsibility, not everything that is funny. However, what is being followed is what all - like disclaimer - just isn't that funny. <br /> <br /> Kornbluth plays Kornbluth, an ambitious writer who supports himself as a temp. This is the right job for her, which gives her time to slip from time to time with her novel. But when he goes to a lawyer, Bob Shelby (Warren Keith), he's doing a good job the first day, and Shelby sends Prime Minister Marlina D'Amore (Helen Shumaker) to Kornbluth to persuade her to go. . The idea that the same company is working full-time will initially strike in the heart of Kornbluth, but it will cave and write its position. He's nervous about that, but at least now, the other secretaries admit their presence (which, of course, does not pace him), and if things are too harsh, he has seventeen important letters he has written - that he just has to post out - come back (he he has retained them because posting is a simple part, and he needs this "something easy to do" reserve if everyone gets too much of it). But these are "important" letters and by the end of the week, Kornblut still has a reserve on the board. And it doesn't understand the genius that when Shelby learns about it, Kornbluth's days when the furry boy is over. And quickly. <br /> <br /> The Kornbluth brothers, who not only drove, but together with John Bellucci, also wrote the screenplay of this film, should have taken Ben-Bener's comedy out of the book, where he says, "If you play it directly, they laugh. " But they weren't and the audience didn't. For comedy, even looking at it as objectively as possible, as the main character (like most supporting characters, in this case) "plays" funny - as it is, he knows he's funny - he's never. And that's what Kornbluth does here; Instead of being "funny", in Kornbluth's opinion, he is an insecure and pretentious, difficult mistake, because by allowing it to sabotage his movie. <br /> <br /> Trying to understand exactly why this movie doesn't work is for two main reasons: leadership that - if not necessarily "bad" - is at least careless; and second, performances, starting with Josh Kornbluth. It just seems that Kornbluth is too impressed. Unlike Stiller or even Steve Martin - who both use self-healing humor very effectively - Kornbluth probably has an ego that just doesn't allow himself to be put into that light; it seems he needs to let his audience know that he, the real Kornbluth, is actually a lot smarter than Kornbluth. And he can't get the past that does him, as well as the movie. Instead of giving a million office workers who see this movie, someone they can communicate with or with whom they can identify, Kornbluth influences the inextricable way that is just to dispose of the people he is trying to reach. So what all of this is, is a case of poor leadership and convincing behavior, and if you consider that the scenario itself was a weak, inexplicably narrow focus (considering the potential of the rich subject), it's easy to understand why it's just not driving. <br /> <br /> One of the most savvy of the movie is Warren Keith's performance by Shelby, whose exquisite delivery is convincing and that-- - by itself - is quite humorous. However, its effectiveness has decreased as Keith has to share his scenes with Kornbluth, which somewhat overrides his positive contribution to the project. <br /> <br /> Shumaker and Sarah Overman (Julie Faustino) are able to keep their heads over with their respective performances that are commendable, if not completely memorable; they will at least track their scenes and Overman will even be able to raise Kornbluth's performance if it is just a moment. But it's still not enough to save the day or movie. <br /> <br /> Supported by Amy Resnick (Mindy), Brian Thorstenson (Clifford), Jun Lomena (DaVonne), Joe Bellan (Secretary of Jimmy Mail), where Harry Shearer, a guessing leader, appeared as a guiding leader which asks the answer to the question, "What did he think when he agreed with it?" In every working environment there is a situation where one way or another inevitably turns into a comic cannon for someone, and the films depicting these situations are always with us; Good (see paragraph 1) can even become a classic on its own. However, the "Haiku Tunnel" will undoubtedly be a very long time since its fate is elsewhere - the only thing known as "Darkness". I appreciate it 1/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
