I love the killer Insects movies they have a lot of fun to watch, I had to watch this movie because it was one of my favorite horror books by Shaun Hutson. <br /> <br /> I've met him and I wish I listened to him when this movie was terrible as he said it was after he said I was still dying to see if it was bad. <br /> <br /> Plot: People die mysteriously and gruesomely and no one has a clue The reason is only. <br /> <br /> Only Mike Brady, a healthcare professional, has a solution, but the authorities are laughing at the killer theories of his killing. <br /> <br /> Only when the body list starts to rise and the hunger expert in England starts to wander around, will it look like Mike had the right idea. <br /> <br /> This movie is the most touching thing you see in the movie! The hunger of this movie is fast (then normal) and it seems they are moving the scenes quickly! <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing like a book at all, the book was ten times more terrifying, ten times overwhelming and had a lot more story! <br /> <br /> I didn't like this movie at all! Like I am a big fan of Slugs and another book called breeding! Both books are great <br /> <br /> Read the book and watch the movie, maybe you like more than I gave it 2
