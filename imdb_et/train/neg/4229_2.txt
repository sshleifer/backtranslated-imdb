I'm a big fan of low budget horror movies like this, but come on! It must be the worst monkey S @ # t I've ever seen! I ignored the comments posted on this website, suggesting that it would get into my taste in horror, but I missed it. And let's see: <br /> <br /> Wardrobe: Consists of cheap portable kits and painters' supplies from home depot. The masks were made of tin foil. <br /> <br /> Gore: Gore was pretty good, I gotta give it. But Ittenbach's Burning Moon was better for a low budget movie. <br /> <br /> Acting: It was terrible! I didn't know about duplication. I find it humorous like "Premutos" by Ittenbach (a great movie). The fighting and action sequences were pi $$ bad. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Don't look at Schnauz movies. There are many better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach, whose films are the same gore and theme. Check out Premuto, Blood House, Schramm and Necromant.
