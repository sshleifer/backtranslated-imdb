I didn't know what that movie was like when I went to the theater to see it (about Satanism, etc.) because the trailers of the last movie looked pretty interesting. Okay, Roman Catholic mythology? I did not like good intimidation and honesty, I just felt that I was really watching a good, frightening movie, not a loosely drawn religious farce that was trying to collect cheap excitement by taking some chicks bloody every few minutes! <br /> <br /> I try to keep away from spoilers (!), but I find it very strange that an atheist, who becomes a dead priest, can suddenly get into the wounds of Christ (is there no stigmatism prescribed) Would it be deeply religious?) Ma I think he hangs with losers, loser things, behaves like a typical rebel, al, and here he is the wounds of Jesus Christ? Come on now! <br /> <br /> His perplexed scenes, thrown back, shouting, blood everywhere, turned a dozen times quite annoying. It wasn't scary or scary, just disgusting. But it was quite painful to look - these sliding scenes were very annoying ... <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: If your Catholic doesn't see it dirty. If you don't, it still doesn't see it.
