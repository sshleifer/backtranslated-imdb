"Sleeping with the Enemy" is predictable, "is there before" a thriller that never seems to be inspiring any desperately cast and a team to try. I can't believe some of my friends are telling me to see it in movies about 16 years ago. <br /> <br /> The lack of complete originality of the Ronald Bass scenario (based on the Nancy novel) does not help, nor does Joseph Ruben's exaggerated direction or Julia Roberts' very average performance. Supportive casting, including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson, does nothing. <br /> <br /> There's not really much to say. Just give her something. <br /> <br /> Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Center Melbourne
