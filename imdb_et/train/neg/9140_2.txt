Phew - I don't know what to say. This is a film that can be very good with stony stones. Some actors reminded me of John Waters' early offer. Maybe I should take it back - I don't want to roll Waters as a director / storyteller. <br /> <br /> I especially loved a lawyer who accepted the "complete faith and credibility" clause. This is "complete faith and credit", by the way! <br /> <br /> It also reminds me of "Conrad's boys", where the main actor is a writer, director, film editor, etc. multi-level entrepreneurs who are probably the best for experienced filmmakers with technical ability (albeit a stunt, some might say) to pull something out.
