The jailed prisoner near Juma gets rid of his chain and manages the retired Sheriff who is responsible for killing his wife (as well as the hidden golden stash that is hidden by the scriptwriter). Attempts to bring the Western genre to modern violence of the 1970s and brutality are not even in the same league, as some of the new split West, which came out of the late 1960s. It is an impossibly simple and square, and female characters are surrounded only by punching bags and possible rape victims. Like the former sheriff who ordered back, Charlton Heston once gives one of his most beautiful, least inspired performances (he has one good moment trying to read letters and drag his glasses). James Coburn, like a half-crazy half-breed, is pretty much on autopilot, but Coburn has the ability to make even more scary dialogue and situations somehow and unpleasant. It's her show all the time. * 1/2 from ****
