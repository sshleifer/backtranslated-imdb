Think, "Clerks" costs $ 250,000 in total. How the hell did they spend $ 45 million to make this glorious music video? Practically unknown cast, two or three sets, no special effects I saw ... I know it has to be spent on a scenario that is well-designed, economically stressed. Shoot that bar set has to have a bundle. Anyway, I think Jerry Bruckheimer would not be dead, doing nothing less. I'm just surprised that he didn't drag anything. <br /> <br /> It wasn't a terrible movie anyway. Female managers seemed to have good chemistry and the soundtrack was OK. IMO It just seems a pity that this rather mediocre project could have been done for $ 5 million without loss of output, and another $ 6 million for $ 5 million.
