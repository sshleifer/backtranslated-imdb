Someone told me that this is one of the best adult movies. Since then, after seeing this movie, I have discredited everything that this person told me. It's just terrible. Without long descriptions of different scenes, take my word for sex scenes at best uninteresting. At the beginning of the movie, Jenna was in normal street shops (she looks good), but it's all downhill.
