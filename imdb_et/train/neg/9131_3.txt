I can't believe I looked at it again last night for over 25 years ... <br /> <br /> Some time ago I watched 6 Fu movies in a row ... Boris Karloff and all 5 Chris Lees. The last 2 lads, both of which were directed (and I am using this word loosely) by Jess Franco, were terrible. At that time, I missed it, recalling that in some ways it was WORK. <br /> <br /> Well, I looked at it. Never again. Do you know what's worse than a terrible movie? In fact, WELL-MADE piece S ***. And this is also FIENDISH PLOT. This is a very good looking movie. Great production, kits, costumes, music, photography, editing, mostly good casting, some decent behavior ... <br /> <br /> ... and absolutely, positively, one of the film's statutes! !!! AAAUGH !!!!! The first minute of the movie is so deceptive ... in the case of a decent movie, this mistake can be made. And then they start singing "Happy birthday to Fu" ... and it goes downhill. Taking Burt Kwouk (of whom his captain says, "Your face is familiar.") He randomly casts out the Fu elixir to fire the fire, resulting in condemnation of torture, burial and one of his ears, the closest thing to the joke. It was like someone decided he wanted to make a "campy" movie - so ridiculous would be funny. RIDICULOUS, that is ... FUNNY ... this ONLY. It is sad at all, as it is clear in the first few minutes that someone did a lot of research on the Fu Manchu series to get so much "right". A different script - really FUNNY one or dead SERIOUS - could have-- could have been a classic hand. A film that should have forgotten the fear of those Jess Franco atrocities ... instead of making them excel in masterpieces is equal. <br /> <br /> At the end of the 1970s, the whole momentum of the 30s classic characters was restored in films that were universally terrible. Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tarzan, Lone Ranger, Charlie Chan, even Doc Savage. I'm not sure it can be the worst. It took a great deal of self-control not to move fast on this whole section, especially about any Sts Caesar (FBI leader who was also Al Capone's cousin ...) what do you mean? It's not just that the ideas in the movie aren't funny ... they do NO SENSE often. Like when they "appear" police officers embody a king and a queen, and we stop people from "listening" to dance hall routines such as singing, dancing and riding a bicycle. How many drugs did the writers of this thing have to take to understand any of them? <br /> <br /> As I said, shame ... and the real waste of all this talent, including Peter Sellers (who played both Fu and Nayland Smith), Burt Kwouk (who was Chris Lee Fu's movie of his time), Helen Mirren (a police woman who falls in love with the evil and damn steals the movie in the last half hour!). I'm starting to wonder if anyone will ever make the "right" Fu Manchu movie, or if fans have almost everything in Karloff?
