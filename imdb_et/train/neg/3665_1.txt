Obviously, this happens when the director allows his 14-year-old nephew to overwrite the dialogue if he allows himself in the meantime to be alcoholic; As I said earlier, although I've always wanted to capture one of Paul Naschy's werewolves, this cruelty was my introduction and, as it is undoubtedly terrible, I intend to continue with other entries in the series, albeit very gradually despite some high profile disappointments, like Joe Dante THE HOWLING (1981), I love werewolves in general, but frankly, I quickly lost the "plot" of this movie and just stood watching my absurdities on my TV screen as it was. They were mentioned too much here, but I have to say that the two that hit me particularly much were the schizophrenic nature of the werewolves' personality (ie, going to a robbing beast one of the shooters, a zombie-like country very much - as if he were walking at night and sports at random midnight a completely different wardrobe ... and yes, I knew the reasons for this in advance), but also the "Opera Phantom" Wolfstein character look! But what I know - perhaps the hard-to-beat version of this confusion has been a good-natured horror class!
