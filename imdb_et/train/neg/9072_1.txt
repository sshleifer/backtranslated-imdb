This film has no plot or focus. Yes, it should be a dirty, stupid comedy, but the screen writers don't know what the movie was. Even the title doesn't go with the film. It should have been called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Never Win" or something like that. No characters are developed and no one cares about what happens to them! The girls' roommate (from the 70's show) was the only person to look at. He was fun and stole any scene he had. Others need to ensure that their own college diplomas are in the works because they need a career other than acting.
