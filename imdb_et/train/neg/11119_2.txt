Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes compete in basketball courts. Okay, that sounds good. It leaves a lot of comedy and good story. However, such an event did not occur in the boring minutes of this pathetic attempt in many subsequent films. This movie was superfluous, slowed down and ridiculous after the first 20 seconds. Woody Harrelson played one of my favorite t. characters from Woody Cheers and I was expecting him in this movie. But after seeing his "show", I have come to the conclusion that he should stay in the foolish world who is a bartend. His actions were both dull and poor as film. Another unrealistic actor of the film was Rosie Perez. I liked Perez movies earlier, but I've decided that the reason I enjoyed other deeds during my career was that he wasn't the main character and he didn't have much talk (Do the Right Thing). But now, White Men Can't Jump, he became a central character with many lines, meaning that the audience has to set their incredibly annoying and whimsical voice. So after listening to this movie (loosely used term) and Rosie Perez, much more than I appreciate, I can now say I'm a white man and I'm ready to jump. . . twenty floor apartment building.
