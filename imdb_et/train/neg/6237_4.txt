The statistics for this movie were well researched. There's no doubt about that! Al Gore will definitely present his case very well and it is no wonder that this film was praised for what he got. Al Gore is definitely quite an actor. She sounds so worried. But activities speak louder than words! Throughout the film, political tidbits and references to his political career are throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is an honest man who not only talks about talking, but also walks to walk. When Carter thought we had to save energy, he turned down the White House thermostat and warmed the sweater. <br /> <br /> Al Gore tells us that we must save energy and claim that we are creating global warming when traveling in our private driveway. How much energy does his jet use and how much greater pollution does it take? How much energy does it take to heat the Gore pool behind your manor? It would be nice if we could save electricity by using smaller devices and making it a point to take advantage of something. But if we did, the energy company would react to 50% energy savings, calling it a "50% reduction in revenue" and getting their losses by raising interest rates by 50%. So "just turning it off" wouldn't be a very good idea. <br /> <br /> This movie is a hidden appeal that allows Big Goernment to control everything that is to save the earth.
