ET's obsession with Dannielynn Smith is despicable. Leave the child alone. With constant attention, he is likely to grow more psychotic, depressive, or worse. Think of Princess Diana and how she longed for privacy. Now the poor little rich girl Ashley Olson just wants to be alone. No wonder Greta Garbo became a hermit and said, "I want to be alone". How much does ET do this little girl? Does ET have anything better? I bet there are many people who really don't care about what his birthday cake and balloons are. By the way, I have never heard Anna Nichole ever won over these cases over her will and her legacy. Who pays for the lifestyle of Larry, Howard and the little Dannielyn? Could it be ET?
