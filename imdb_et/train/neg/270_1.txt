I look at it now pink (Serbian TV channel) and I have to say it is crap. Low, does not work, was too sloppy, who did this series? OKAY. The film was great in 1994 when it came out. But the series? <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can see how idiotic lines are in the character speech. I mean, did they pay anyone to write that someone was in the studio? It's not SciFi. <br /> <br /> The movie was a bomb, a series sucks.
