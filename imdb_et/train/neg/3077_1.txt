Hobgoblins ... what concept. Rick Sloan was the captain of this movie. He had a brilliant film with actors who were unable to act. In addition, he decided to write a script based in some way on bad acids. Put it together, you end up with a film that sucks more than a store filled with suction cups and vaccine cleaners. This movie was very painful. The pain it caused is about equal to the pain caused when your genital organs are carved with a spoon, and then the whole wounded salt and hydrochloric acid.
