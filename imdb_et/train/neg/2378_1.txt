Why would each scripted participant have read the legitimate actor reading each script? My God is even embarrassed to even look at it. I can't imagine the shame that these people have to feel is part of it. There are also obviously some contradictions about whether there was a movie cabinet in the film on the Phoenix River. He was not credited, but his role list here (IMDB) gives him credit. BTW ... Rain is his sister to those who have previously asked. This movie proves that no matter how many great names you have. Sow ears do not make silk wallets. I love Lorraine Bracco, but it was just sad sad sad ... Maybe someone can explain the reason for this movie. It doesn't have a loving, fun, or even comic feature compared to what's all wrong.
