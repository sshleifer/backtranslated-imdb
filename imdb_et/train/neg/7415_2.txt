What do you call the horror story without horror and story? <br /> <br /> This is the most irritating thing in the movie: I feel that writers have never decided what's really going on in the movie! It's different to find out, give clues to the viewers, and not to reveal it completely, but here's the feeling that the scriptwriters don't know it, movie characters don't know it and the audience sees no one knows! (Remember "Cube"? Even this movie knew more about itself.) <br /> <br /> I've been using many 80's horror / gore movies, and this film has deep roots in these films. But many important things are missing. We don't really know anything about the characters. They continue to repeat repetitive blank lines. The story is not really developing - it never goes anywhere. B-action in these horror films is OK, but there is not much to do in the script. We don't care about the characters. There is nothing to remember about them. There is not even fresh humor or unnecessary sex. And most importantly - no excitement, chills. They show Lord's monsters one by one, but their characters don't really tell the story. <br /> <br /> I believe that this story, character development, and atmosphere can be achieved with a minimum number of crew members and equipment. Oh yes, filmmakers did it before - and more - about 20 years ago! At the end of the film I felt the audience's embarrassment. Too bad.
