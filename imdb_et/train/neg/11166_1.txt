I'm sure that the Jack Blacks recesses Nacho Libre's character completely fun, but that's not the case. You can say to Ol Jacks, who has time to whale, playing with the smell of dazzling Mexican friars to become a wrestler, but this movie is a complete misfire in all departments. <br /> <br /> I just sat there through most of the film's thinking, "Should it be funny" and "It's a guy from Tenacious D?" The truth is that the film has nothing to offer. TRANSFER! This is a sad script with dirty characters and really naive behavior and direction. You look at endless moments where you think something is funny, that will definitely happen, but it just isn't. I was a dull dumb about 10 minutes, but though it would definitely distract. It wasn't. 90 minutes later I barely managed to prevent aneurism, it was so painful. <br /> <br /> It's like, you remember years ago, when you saw something with your stupid actor, even some of them really early before they were famous, and you would be really embarrassed that the actor mentioned was actually in such a crust. Yes, it is. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed some of Jack Black's earlier films, such as Shallow Hall, and I am very looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny, but come to the people. If you do it to us again with Jack, I have to go there and put my knee pads or something wrong. At least you get serious talking. <br /> <br /> I know it's a clich√©, but it's one of the worst films I've ever seen and for so many reasons.
