I watched the movie "Flock" because of the casting of Gere and the Danes, and the story synopsis was interesting. It was one of the WORST movies I've seen for a long time (and I've seen some turkeys.) I've never been online before, but this movie was so terrible that I had to do it. I think the problems start with a script that was so amateurish that it is incredible. The story becomes zero and the dialogue is so thin that it is nausea. Poor Gere, he deserves so much better. As a Gere / Danes screen matchup, because the terrible writing one does not believe either sign of one minute. I bet Gere wants her to be able to buy a negative purchase, whether it was possible. It is a shame to see that talent is so badly wasted, not to mention that I want to get my 2 hours ago. (I know what you mean. How do I really feel?)
