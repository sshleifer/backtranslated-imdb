Stephen Feinberg, who was a procologist and was one of the writers of the film, died in early 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, a year after he said he was a writer in Hollywood before, mainly working on TV shows. He asked me not to see the 'tunnel vision', but it was too late, I had already seen it! In fact, I had seen it for years when it appeared. At that time I didn't think it was such a bad movie. However, when seen as an adult, my opinion was somewhat different. Yes, it's a bit calm as well as dated. Steve admitted that this is not a very good film. That said he was a little proud of the prokologist's sketch.
