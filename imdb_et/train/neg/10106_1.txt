Yes, I am sure it can be a nation. . . when four of them were all four corners of the world and the other two cloned a few billion times. Man, I'm really happy to see this movie in FEAR.net instead of renting it. I'm a big fan of George Romero's movies and I'm pretty sure he's probably too laughing when he saw this movie. I mean, what about the raccoon girls like zombies and walking like Charlie Devils? It really also helped that the music composer chose a funny fashion show for music when zombies walked to their killer, especially to the part where they go to the store / police station / apartment / apartment / storage room. in the background of a gong and a living woman claimed a closed furniture store. I couldn't even tell what the nationality of the killer was, and the fact that his accent showed that some nations did not help. Well, what can I expect from a movie where they throw a random fight scene without a good reason in store where they will probably ship on the air around the world. So, for all those who worship the Mystery Science Theater 3000, or if you want like C Craptastic, it's a movie for you. . . or not.
