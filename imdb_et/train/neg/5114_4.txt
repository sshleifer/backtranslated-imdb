This movie was bad. Bad action, bad leadership, bad writing. But it wasn't funny. It was a boring way bad. I looked at "Surface Air" because I thought it might be a laugh. It wasn't. Don't make the mistake I made. There are many more enjoyable ways to spend one and a half hours, such as drying a color or reading a dictionary. Seriously.
