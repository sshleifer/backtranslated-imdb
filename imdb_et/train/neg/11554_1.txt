This film is embarrassing for film making. I can't believe it was even a comedy - not funny. This script was not only cruel, but also cast. Gail O'Grady is just a big actor, but beyond that ...% 99 rest of the pain ... ouch. Pretty much everyone else ... wow is hard even ... wow. Here is the number one rule for comedy: "DO NOT CLEAR". There are many very talented actors in Canada who can do drama and comedy - none of them used it. Canadian nepotism and directors contribute to the preservation of bad filmmaking in Canada. I understand that this is technically a "US" movie, but look at the director, actors, location, etc. I just saw Bravo - they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to show this movie. Again, there are a lot of great movies that don't get airtime and they show this nonsense.
