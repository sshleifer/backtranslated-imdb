I remember when I first saw this movie, I was in the sixth grade. Before I saw it, I had listened to its original Broadway recording and I really loved it! But when I saw it, I was like what the hell ?! A lot of musical songs have been lost from this movie that shout out loud! Who decided to do all this?! <br /> <br /> I am really a very big fan of Gene Kelly, but this movie is probably the worst music she ever did! The film seemed more like Hollywood than the beautiful Highlands of Scotland. And who the hell decided to cut out all of Meg's songs from the movie?! <br /> <br /> I'm ready to bet that when they saw this movie, Lerner and Lowe probably said, "Who in the world decided to do this in our masterpiece?" Well, they were right to say that, if they did, they were probably crazy because Hollywood turned a pretty blank movie into their big music. <br /> <br /> Song and action by Kelly, you went through the hearts with flying colors, but you are in a movie without much text. <br /> <br /> So if you want Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner to have a good movie, that's not it! <br /> <br /> 3/10
