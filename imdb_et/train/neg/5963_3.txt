This film begins with the execution of a witch practitioner and her lover. His head is cut and buried separately from his body ... sounds like "The Thing, which doesn't die", isn't it? Well it plays a bit like that, but when the body is headed back, all the interesting and terrible deaths are made and the film moves very slowly. I mean, the movie is only 88 minutes long and I was thinking "When does it end"? The characters in the movie are mostly idiots and they deserve much to be really stupid. The villain is also very bad because he is moving slowly and you really do not know how he can do anything, given that he is afraid of jewelry. The only thing you need to watch after looking back at your head is that there are so many lines that blink that you actually start losing. I still want to see a horror film, not a soft nuclear color, and when the horror film is a way to move slowly with many slow stretches to be even more enjoyable. And do not read the back of the box because it made it like there was meat eating zombies who attack the city, there's no ... just a small scene where three or four zombies are attacking the house and are so easily excluded from being in the movie at all factor and their the scene is pretty pointless. So mostly I say you should avoid this movie if you don't find it very cheap.
