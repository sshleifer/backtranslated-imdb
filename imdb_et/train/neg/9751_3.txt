The only reason I don't give this movie less than 3 stars is that it's not quite parallel to a movie like Manos: Fate. The biggest crime in this movie is that it is a dull and terribly unforgettable British game. The prerequisite for this film is the potentially promising, all teleportation concept, but the direction they went with was completely uninteresting. It was more about film funding and finishing than design lasers. The actors were wood, aging and aside. Just like the love story of two scientists - something other than intriguing. I could never say what the attraction was between them because chemistry was non-existent. Nor did I really understand why the main player who they saw faced the decision to kill everyone he met. At least for now, I know that I should always give someone a fair debate before I cut off my research grants, otherwise they will be abducting, deliberately killing with revenge music.
