Bo is Jane Parker, whose long-lost anthropologist's father (Richard Harris is the most inconsistent career in the worst role of a career) is something in Africa. He is following him (how?) And tells him about the stories of indigenous peoples about a giant monster whose night beating can be heard throughout the jungle. Appeared by Ape Man himself (Miles O'Keeffe, who has the best film dialogue) who saves him from the bad guys and falls in love with him, leaving them enough time to torture naked in two hours when horny monkey looks and rejoices. Normally, I have a very different attitude to all kinds of films, but this is the only exception. This is never a movie. If you do not agree, you have not seen it. (Notes: Newsday called it "unendurable" which is the best single word summary I can think of. Maltin Movie Guide comments that they almost had to think of a rating lower than BOMB.)
