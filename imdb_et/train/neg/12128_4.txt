If half of this movie is strangely familiar, it means you look too much for this gory Italian cult! Because you see, the infamous demigod, Lucio Fulci, not only brought this film, but also took the liberty of using the most sadistic killing sequences in his (and more easily observable) "Kass brain". A scene that has already opened, where a prostitute is brutally an ax, in a later film by Fulci, and one more handful of killings and mocking moments. Andrea Bianchi "Masssacre" is unfortunate because searching for a sadistic murderer among the horror film crews is all but it is good entertainment, but it is still a good entertainment if you're a cheap nervous spooky trash. A consistent script introduces a whole host of contradictory characters who are all potential maniac, but none of the red herring Biachi comes true and you can bring out the killer almost immediately. Whatever it is, the really misognic effects and the hilariously awful action of the band are. Every time there is no bloodshed on the screen, as between the first and the second murder, the "mass murder" is slow and almost intolerable with its own dialogues and thoroughly explored photography. Fortunately, on the other side, there are women who are told about gardens and men who are repeatedly burned with struck studs. Music is crap and the use of shooting places is unimaginable. My suggestion would be to skip this puppy and go straight to the "Cat in the brain" mentioned above. It has all the great moments of "Massacre" and then some.
