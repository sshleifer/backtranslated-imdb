Hawked as the most common film, whatever, GUARANTEED ALL OFF - Guess what? It worked, I am offended that we threw out that money for rent. Two friends and I were bored and we decided to see if all of this bull on TV was true. Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage to us! It was by far the worst film I've seen since Hollow Man. I generally avoided the nervous, but I got into it. Since then, we have been beating those who recommend renting it, and the privileges of choosing its films have been lifted. There's nothing funny about this movie ... even the "dickman" adventures were the best sophomore. Color me p *** ed. Probably due to some important reason, the value of the production was crap ... no ... just suck. NEVER HERE! for some reason. Not even with a large number of illegal substances, this film would be funny. It says ALOT. Please, that love is all that is sacred if you love your peace of mind - don't watch this movie. It's a lot of things - silly, pointless, and worthless. But the main thing he was trying to do was insultingly funny - it failed. Crash and burn.
