This flick was a blow to me. I think small girls should try to be something other than swimsuit models, home-makers or lovers, because it seems to be everything they ever represent like anyway. It is really sad to see that the work and life of the artist have been so unfairly misinterpreted. Uncertain (or perhaps supposed to have expected it), all of Artemisia's character and everything he represented was reduced to the standard Hollywood female character; pathetic, physically flawless, helpless little creature that does not show any character trait that actually got its place in history that is being violated here. However, it was unfortunate to see that a large part of the audience in this area was too poorly educated to understand the incredible gap between the message and the reality of the film. To portray an artist who is in love with his real rape, someone he actually accused of accusing him of rape even during torture just pisses me. If the director had nothing to say, he would have had to keep his story for a real person.
