One of the cornerstones of a low-cost cinema is the well-known, classic story and its abandonment. The Phantom templates are no exception to this rule. The Scene receives the opera fantasy and gives it over to the 80's shopping center. But the purpose of "Phantom" is simply to get hold of those responsible for scattering their faces and murdering their families. Special effects give good dispersion, especially when body parts begin to appear in yoghurt foods. Pauly Shore has a small role that does not allow him to be as unpleasant as one would expect, mainly because his fifteen-minute MTV fame had not yet arrived. If you are looking for some good laugh at the expense of participants and a special effects team, check out this flick. Otherwise, look for something else.
