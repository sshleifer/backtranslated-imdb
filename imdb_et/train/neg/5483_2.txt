I just blew four dollars for renting this movie! Why Alliance Atlantis would promote such a poor pretext for a film that is beyond me. But even more surprising was that the relatively good reviews that a few Canadian newspaper critics gave about this movie. I'm tired of the media that justify the movie just because it's Canada and low budget. It's like they expect the Canadian films to be bad so they give it a good overview, no matter what. <br /> <br /> Now about the movie: The actor was below average (except for the leading man who was really good). The quality of the film was bad, which I think can be expected from an extremely low budget. The script was absolutely terrible. For example, the story that revolves around a management building, a female drug dealer who flops with one of her clients, can hire her to fix and steal bikes, the sole purpose of which is to accidentally destroy SUVs. There is a lot of supposed destruction of these gang members' bikes in these activities (I don't know how he can't just buy new ones because he should be that big drug-related association between Vancouver and Toronto). In any case, the story (which is not evident before going through the film) is that a drug dealer plans to build buildings in the Toronto area to try to make houses more affordable - if not to live in the area. <br /> <br /> - I need to say more. <br /> <br /> The shame at accepting such a movie at the Toronto Film Festival, Telefilm for its support, and Globe and Mail and Georgia Straight newspapers that give such biased comments. <br /> <br /> Film should not become a special treatment just because it is Canada!
