I saw this movie the other day in the film school class, and I didn't see it before the Almodovar movie, but I was expecting it to be good. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a meaningless film where a couple of laughs were mixed for two hours of boredom. High heels are just a set of random scenes that could have worked in their own separate films, but they don't add any meaningful whole. Or so I thought. The next day my film professor spent the entire class, explaining all the hidden details of the film, such as how the mural painting of stereotypical flamenco dancers is some comment on the lack of identity. Spain as a nation has evolved under a fascist regime. Apparently, the whole movie is full of smart little visual tricks and references, as it is. <br /> <br /> Great, but you know what? It's still a bad movie. Making a good movie takes more than depth and complexity - you still have to give the audience attention, paying attention to the fact that the viewer should be interested in all the fine tricks. High heels give us strange, astonishing signs, but they tend to keep them in a daily situation that has been recycled from other films, and Almodovar doesn't seem to use them to make any point. For example, what is the Hitchcockian surprise revelation that appears at the end of the film? Why is it even there? Just surprise us? <br /> <br /> There is one funny scene related to news delivery. And this is the only fun moment. The rest of the film is just a pointless film reference and visual tips that probably only exist to show us how smart Pedro Almodovar is. But no matter what my film professor says, the film takes a better good trick.
