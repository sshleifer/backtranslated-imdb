I can't recommend this movie date as a movie. Gary Oldman's semi-autobiographical review of the life that lived in the Southeast London heritage is violent, the Becket report from one of the Dante hell circles, frankly. At the heart of this is Ray Winstone, who has done this before but never did. The movie opens her order drinks at the pub bar - that's all - and you've been caught up in the feeling of frustration, self-sensitivity and barbarism that she exhibits in a variety of ways during the film. It is a working master class. <br /> <br /> Of course, such a drama of stigmatized and destructive drama like this one and Winstone fits with Kathy Burke as his long-term wife who swallows and ultimately rejects her intolerable behavior. Charlie Creed-Miles is able to turn to Billy as the son of a melting pot pharmacy, although he has sometimes thought of exactly what he promised. Gary Oldman directs actors to maximize claustrophobia in their councils. 4/10
