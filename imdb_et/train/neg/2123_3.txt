I'm going to UCSB and take some classes with CEO Alison Anders. He is a great teacher and director, so something he put his name on was thought to be pretty good. This film, like a selection at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, seemed a good choice. <br /> <br /> Although this movie contained some nice shots and cinematography, the story and coherence were actually something he was trying to achieve. My main problem was that it was someone's first movie and you probably can say. Bad action and even worse scenario stopped this movie from the ground. The soundtrack had nice music that gave the feeling to the main characters who fought with sadness that led to his departure and now back to the place. I just have to say that despite some of the right craft in the movie, this story and performance actually prevented it from being good.
