If films like Ghoulies hang from Gremlins, Hobgoblins will sink into new low dumps like Ghoulies. These barely animated furbs have some kind of scheme to fill fantasies (which mainly include groteque character sex dreams), but that has nothing to do with anyone, except to allow the director against his kinky erotica against erotica. They show it in the circle of hell 8, one suspect. There is no real plot - just "goblins - kill!" and humorous humor, and an easy attempt to awaken the audience.
