The 80s were not very kind to a one-time big star Charles Bronson. Since 1982, the "Death Race II" and ending with this truly frightening movie '89, Bronson's scriptwriters seemed to start each other at the beginning. "D.W. II" was a little imaginative in depicting Bronson's character as a rape and suicide of her daughter (also the rape and murder of her caretaker was shown in nasty details). "10 to Midnight" was a kind of awkward movie that made you get after the bath. Nothing will redeem it. Other films such as "The Evil the Men Do" and the remaining "Death Wish" films split the lines between high camps and high barrels about their serious brutality and revenge. I'm not sure if the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) got tired of the look, the older Bronson who destroyed enough youngsters to be his grandchildren or what, but their filthy finish (and terrible scripts) usually destroyed the little energy they have caused. <br /> <br /> "Kinjite" - the last of these films - is quite well done, but really takes the cinematic uncertainty. In this movie Bronson: sodomizes perverted john; forces the pimp to eat his Rolex watch; allows the second prisoner to rape a male prisoner; makes incredibly xenophobic comments, among other things, which I have forgot to forget. It also depicts the rape of a young Japanese girl (luckily it was off screen, though very indirect). <br /> <br /> What did people do when making this movie? What was Bronson's thinking when he decided to destroy his career with these terrible films? For anyone interested in your best movie, check out most of the movies he's done in the 60's and 70's, such as "The Mechanic", "Death Wish", "From Noon til 3", "Once in the West", " Red Sun, Great Escape, Great Seven, Rider in Rain, etc.
