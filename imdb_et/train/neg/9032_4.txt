I have never understood Garbo's complaint. He has always met in his films, not all that appealing, and that annoying voice that could have dropped the part of the tube. He was also a very limited actor, like Gloria Swanson, who stayed better at the quiet age. In this last film, his performance is very medium and uninsured. He is struggling hard, but it does not come at all because the script is even worse than his action. Get the air in skiing scenes, which is the only fun thing here). <br /> <br /> There was potential, but the script failed in almost every department, wasting every actor in it. Douglas and Garbol had a good chemistry together, but it is not even Ninotchka on the ground, which I also overestimated.
