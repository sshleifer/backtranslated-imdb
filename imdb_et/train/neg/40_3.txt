Laura's model works in South America when she is kidnapped from her hotel room and taken to the jungle. They demand a great release for his release. Peter is hired to get his home safe and has a bonus when he gets both money and a girl back. Peter was taken to the jungle by a helicopter with Jack. They try to fool the money for Laura, but the plan goes terribly wrong and they have to rescue the helicopter. The helicopter has been photographed and must also retreat from it (still not doing well). There is also a variety of jungle roaming. In fact, it's just a naked black man with strangely big eyes and breathing problems. He starts killing some robbers, and Laura flees only to stay with some primitives. The rest of the movie is a bit blurry really. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not a massive Jess Franco fan, but it's just his second movie I've ever seen, but even I can say it's not really one of his best efforts. Movies are dragging quite slowly without anything happening at all. The whole thing could have been easily edited in a 25-minute TV show. Too many people who walk through the jungle and have just been raised. <br /> <br /> Devil Hunter is ill-illuminated (Infact I don't think it would be illuminated at all), poorly dubbed, malfunctioning and slow, but for some reason it didn't carry me. I think its main reason was some funny bad scenes in it. For example, the scene where Laura Street walked is obviously shot on a real street when crowds stop shooting directly on the camera. Another funny scene has one killed gang hanging on a dripping tree when one of his friends is standing under him, screaming, which seems like minutes. Then, for some reason, the head of the tree's head just falls and hits him under him. It must be seen as believing. Then of course there is the actual devil. It's just some naked black men who, despite having big eyes, have a very vague vision. was banned. Now, why it wasn't, I have no idea. There is little gore and it is hardly a shocking film. Minus nudity, which I would have said it could get away with almost PG. The only thing I think is that it was never looked at and added to the original list word of mouth. <br /> <br /> There is not much reason to watch this movie if you are not a massive Jess Franco fan. There's a lot of nudity to keep you from falling asleep, as well as some bad scenes that you might be laughing at, but otherwise I would just pay a fee for a ticket to South America and get lost in the jungle. Probably it would be more fun. <br /> <br /> 3/10
