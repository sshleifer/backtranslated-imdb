Although a bit more polished technically than the previous film, BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES, it is such a weaker performance on a plot that is a less exciting and leading man who just isn't Ray Milland's charisma. <br /> <br /> This means that many actors and characters will continue to play their role and be able to hold the flag. John Barrymore is also present, opening the entire movie through various extreme disguises. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it is BD's second endless night as he and his cohorts are pursuing an effort to save the poor girl he is going to marry. Tips are stupid, but they are often made fun by supportive actors.
