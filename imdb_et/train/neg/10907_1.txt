I was waiting for a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow, which I enjoyed. However, it seemed forever. It is one of those clips that enjoy the sad placement of PG-13 but is not suitable for the baby. Jokes are not just low or f ** t jokes, they are crude oil, lewd, and many acts go beyond the bounds of bad taste, but beyond legal and moral dignity. Many scenes are crushed to get a PG-13 rating ... too bad ... it could have made a bigger splash than an R-rated movie when funny fell in. (Override? Probably.) Don't recommend this movie. It's a waste of time ... and I'm a movie lover and I'm ready to give something. After 45 minutes, the film seemed to be finally ... and the boy was ready for that. The end is peculiar but does not save the rest of the rent / trap. 1/2 star (glad to see it as a freelancer ... would have been sick to pay for the hard-earned green backs of this service)
