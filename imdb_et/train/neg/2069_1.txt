I went to see it at the Esquire Theater in Cincy, OH and - I hate my life now. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeves would have been a more credible boxer. <br /> <br /> A movie that was painful, but seeing Bret Carri personally saw despair at her top. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie was to see that BC hit the face that seemed to be "C". battery. The jury is still over. It was a dildo and it was slow. Yes, yes. <br /> <br /> "Let the face on the left only ... people become famous with demanding things!" Bret Carr B. Carr pulled the chicken suit into a reversed psychology, migrating on the streets of Clifton, bashing his movie. He should. It's right to shoot. <br /> <br /> My soul felt fond of it after that. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is not charismatic enough to be the leader of the cult or smart enough on this issue. This is the feeling you get from what the brainwashing, impressive neo-yuppies for Bret Carr's work have shown, by Bleepesque. <br /> <br /> This is an emotionally drying experience that just thinks about writing this movie, so goodbye. <br /> <br /> -Name
