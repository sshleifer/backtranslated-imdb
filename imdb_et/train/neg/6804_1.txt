It must be one of the 5 worst films. Seeing the plot was intriguing as Passenger 57. But the latter film was somehow much better. The plot has been developed in the worst possible way. Just some of the awful moments of the movie, the flight crew is standing at the flying 747 doorway and trying to close the door without a 250-mile hour wind?!? The aircraft then lands a few miles away from 8000 feet, which is impossible even with 747 pilots with thousands of hours of experience. The track (perfectly straight) is led to pull the flaps, HUH !! Come on the valves to ensure low-speed lifting when using the reverse engine on the track and giving you maximum power! I can go ahead and make little and mostly big mistakes in the movie, but my answer will be the English dictionary size. This is the movie you want to leave, take my word!
