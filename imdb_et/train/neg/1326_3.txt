Nonsense to drift on the second coming of Christ in the form of hippie and albino, looking at Sandra Locket. You don't know what's going on on the screen when playing the "Suzanne" song throughout the movie until "Suzanne's second coming" is over, because you know it hard, no matter how hard you forget the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Logan Jared Martin, an off-the-shelf reinforced filmmaker, is getting out of a century's movie, but it's so rude and unpleasant that no banker is ready to fund his project. If you are planning to go to your logan, this couple is in a seaside cafe and is fascinated by a young woman, Suzanne, Sandra Locke, who reminds her of someone she knew in another life: Jesus Christ. <br /> <br /> Logan's assistant and all-ward Clavius, Richard Dreyfuss, somehow got a $ 740,000 loan from the bank to finance Logan's masterpiece, which he will work on in Suzanne, attracting him to his talent as an actress to get her interest. against your movie. Not only does this lead to Suzanne leaving her boyfriend Simon, Paul Sand, but later Simon is depressed and feels that she can take her mouth alone and blow her brain out. <br /> <br /> The film also features two somewhat interconnected sub-lines associated with a young autistic girl with Dorothy, Kari Avalos, who has been treated by Suzanne for autism after all others in a psychiatric hospital where he was committed, failed. It is not really known what exactly Suzanne did in the hospital, but it seemed that he was some sort of regular or optional; did it have to show us the audience that he, like Jesus, could heal the sick? <br /> <br /> There's also a newspaper columnist and a great-time businessman, Jackson Sinclair, Gene Barry, who seems to be either going through a very difficult mid-life crisis or seeing a Bible-like vision that changed his life forever. Sinclair had been looking for the meaning of life and what it was all through the film and wanted to know why all this suffering in the world was like the movie she was, and she seemed to find the answer when she first found Suzanne eyes. Sinclair got a bit of thinking when he almost ran from his shore to kamikaze on his private car driver David Rasmusser, who got sick and tired of his strange and crazy hallucinations, like riding along the Pacific coast. <br /> <br /> "The Second Coming of Suzanne" continues with a number of interrelated sequences that are likely to perform or begin to fill with this director and film editor for a while, and then go to the last scene in a mountain-like transcendence of Christ, because Logan has all the cameras. It turns out that the crazy Logan got so caught up in his masterpiece when he tried to knock, helplessly and tie up the real crossing of Suzanne, Jesus Christ about 2000 years ago. <br /> <br /> Difficult to sit through and almost impossible to follow "Suzanne's Second Coming" puts you in the same kind of torture Suzanne has done for Logan and filmmakers. The film tries to be artistic, but it is just an excuse to cover this brainless and non-existent story, and even worse is the dreadful and amateurish action of everyone.
