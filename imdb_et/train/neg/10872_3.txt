Here is an indie movie that I really want, but finally it didn't. The absence of a script (boldly announced in the main headlines) really shows the picture and kills it. Story is a meaningless confusion that is not worth thinking about. I began to miss out within 10 minutes, then I suffered for the rest of the 40 minutes - hoping the best - before the chapter was beaten (graciously) to the end ... even that it wasn't an extraordinary effort. OZARK SAVAGE is clearly trying too hard to be smart, raising its best sequences from EVIL DEAD 2 and MATRIX. As a result, OZARK has little in SAVAGE that hasn't been done before and better. This film would have been much more fun than 10-20 minutes long, but as a function it seems just padded and forced. Of course, short shorts are not money, so I fully understand the financial reasons that I expect them to motivate for 75 minutes. Director Matt Steinauer shows great promise and wish him good luck.
