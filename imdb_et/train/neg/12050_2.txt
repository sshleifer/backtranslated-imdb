I had read some positive comments about this movie and I was really surprised when the whole thing was scary. This film is not between the story of AIDS and the story of "Ghost" / "Blithe Spirit" because this film cannot always do what it wants to be. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mark are gay couples with an "open" relationship - Simon has the desire to have anonymous (though secure) sex. Mark is HIV + and he and Simon no longer seem to have sex. When Mark dies, Simon, who has been rejecting his father for years, tries to turn off his emotions, tries to clear his memory and just become a bachelor. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was very different. But Mark returns in a strange way and fuses his various clashes, while Simon opens and recognizes his true feelings. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Simon is such a selfish SOB, impossible to recognize him as an empathy for most of the film. By the time he should be more sympathetic, it's too late to take care. Mark, on the other hand, follows Demi Moore's traces of "Ghost", crying very much during the film. <br /> <br /> After Mark's return, the tone has a strange switch. Suddenly, we get humor, TV show "Bewitched". But it won't last long. When Simon's emotional health is at stake, the whole thing becomes a mawk, where amateur experiments try to jerk their heartbeat. Finale, where the golden muscle-boy angel drives the tear to Mark, while the frightened, grieving Simon stays goodbye, is simply amazing, mainly because it is not deliberately funny.
