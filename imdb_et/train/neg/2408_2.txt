This film talks about a young scientist who creates a serum that revives the dead. He uses it first for his brother when he dies to the age. His brother then infects other gang members. In some scenes, zombies are walking very slowly and in other scenes they run quite fast, which makes little sense. Action is mediocre, but the story doesn't help the movie. Makeup consists of blood in the form of zombies. The budget for this movie, which I am sure was very limited. I believe the film would have been better if the story had been a more original and better budget. If you don't see a good zombie flick, you can't see it.
