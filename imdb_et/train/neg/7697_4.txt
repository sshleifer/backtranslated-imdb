This mini-series is actually more fun than some others who have much larger budgets and greater aspirations. SOTD stays between the entertainment spectrum "Kung Fu" and "H R Pufnstuff". If it wasn't that long (nearly 3 hours), I think kids would want it a little. It has an adventure, an act, "scouting scenes" and not too much romance or other "icky" things. If you are young, you are not too critical of rubber swords, swinging actions and repetitive scenes. (At least two scenes in the movie are repeated in the same way as in the old magazines to bring the audience faster.) Finally, children usually accept an American English dialogue that comes out of Asian mouth. participants. (Not to mention the fact that several leading roles are played by non-Asian players.) <br /> <br /> I gave three stars to this film, but I felt that the director, the producers and the cast deserve additional credit at least for the project. This film is not art, but as in the house of your house, it actually took time, effort and discipline to do it. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, it is not advisable to use your time, but it may be left to the kids to enter the mini cab. <br /> <br /> Oh, yeah ... hey, IMDb! Dialogue is preferred and traditional spelling. Your spell check seems to think the dialog is the right spell. Although "dialogue" is acceptable, both Webster and OED consider it an alternative form.
