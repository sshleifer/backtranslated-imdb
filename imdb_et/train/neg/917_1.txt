This film was a very bad taste. The script was very bad. I feel very sad about Gregory Peck, who took on the role of one of the greatest generals of this history in the adaptation of B-film. The film was politically incorrect and honestly sensitive to others who fought against Japan in World War II. There was a scene where I almost vomited, showing Macarthur in a bunk in Corregidor, where he talks to troops like an experienced politician when he comes in contact with a wounded, one-legged Filipino soldier. The soldier who bleeds and dies succeeds to sit upright when he sees the general, and says, "no papa, mama, no uncle sam and Macarthur will not give you a little ass to let the Americans" never give up from the Philippines. " I am livened up by Macarthur's words and give him a smart greeting. I mean, if the United States, as a great savior of the world, would be more inclined, tell me because it takes a cake. It showed that the Filipinos are in trouble for girls who are unable to respect and it must have been based on the redemption of the Americans, obviously and deliberately overshadowing the contributions of the members of the USFFE (Far East United States Armed Forces), who are Philippine volunteers who were integrated during the US war during World War II, who died alongside the Americans who fought against the Japanese who walked parallel to the Americans in Bataan's death route and defended Corregidor Island by launching a guerilla attack after Macarthur la screamed to Australia with his famous "I'm coming" call. My late grandfather, the Philippine World War 2 veteran, and the USFFE soldier were one of many who fought for Japan with honor and love. I think this film does not give them and thousands of others the respect that Macarthur supported to produce intelligence for his famous return in the Leyte Bay.
