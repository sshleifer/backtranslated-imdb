(spoilers) Wow, it's bad. I did a double take when I looked at the old Star Trek episode the other day - it was where everyone got infected with this space disease and then gets a little nuts - and there was Stewart Moss, namely that it's not a likely "hero". at night! He played the first team member infected, who dies from terminal depression. I thought he was watching his movie too many times, causing depression. This movie is full of really unlikely people. The film has no redeeming character, not one. It is very difficult to feel bad when Dr. Beck has become a bat (or whatever he actually changed) because you just don't like him. And you don't like her bush, bitch woman or nasty buggy Sgt. Ward or Dr. Mustache Love ... So why would you invest time or energy in this movie? If there is no empathy with the characters, there is no reason to take care of it. Not to mention the terrible cinema that made it look like they were filming the film with urine, and five cents of bat effects, many of which seemed to be pieces of paper that were thrown into the fan to simulate the bat horde. Not the worst movie I've ever seen in MST3K, but below the bottom, definitely.
