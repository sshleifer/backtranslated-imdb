This movie was exhausting. and not as some have claimed. First of all, the main character is a very unpleasant gingerman. Secondly, WTF continues with this van-love. Basically there is a plot: the boy wants sex so buys van (which fairly is quite cool). Incredibly, as he looks like a new one, he appreciates a lot of chicks! And he fails with some. Then he really appreciates the hot chick and understands that he loves this foolish bird who played hard. Then he pulls the races with the hot chick boy. And he hints at his van. At this point, danny saves the devito day. Although he didn't have to do this, he was a ginger boy when he tilted the bath. I gave it to the 2nd, because I'm ready to assume that the 70's Vanning subcultures have no chance, and also because the 70's horse is.
