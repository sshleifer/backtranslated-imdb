I usually try to criticize movies but my GOD !!! It was the worst film I've ever seen. Bad action, bad effects, bad script, bad things! The plot is followed by a group of teenage clich√©s on the way to a distant island (which occurs in a wide range of daylight). When the group arrives, everything they find is a blank dance floor and bloody clothes. Having decided to find out what happened to the rest of the party's visitors, the clan has left the mission through a zombie-infected forest. During this crusade, they are assisted by a police chick and a captain who has just the right number of weapons for every child. They also meet with Jonathan Cherry and another survivor. In principle, the rest of the movie is a sequence of poorly targeted activities, including a too long shootout outside the "dead house". This fight came with hair-shaped Hollywood violence, HOTD video clips clipped, and sloppy matrix-esque camera rotation. One character even volunteers sacrifices to save others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because some of his face was scared by an acidic zombie, after he had erected a creature for a long time after a disability! Should I Damage That Man?!? <br /> <br /> All in all, there is no point in seeing this movie if you don't want to see how terrible it is. The theater where I was was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I waste on seeing this sh * t can easily cover the cost of doing it. GRADE: F
