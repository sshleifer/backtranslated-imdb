I was all excited when I saw ads for this movie because I read the book recently and enjoyed it. The film didn't meet my expectations. Having read the book recently prepared for me, let it be great, as often happens when stories are translated into films. Characters do not fit well with the book. The direction was weak. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There was no real connection with the viewer about what was going on. The dialogue did not explain enough what was happening. It just shone and hurried. All in all, I was very disappointed with the movie. I think if you haven't read a book, it may be okay. At least, it can tempt you to read a book that you probably enjoy. <br /> <br />
