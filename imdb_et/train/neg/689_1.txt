What is this? This must undoubtedly be the biggest waste of movies, settings and camera. I know you can't set your expectations high in the 80s, but it's too stupid to be true. I caught $ 0.89 for this movie and still feel my money back. Can you imagine who is using HOW? <br /> <br /> Who is the violent killer of this movie and what are his motivations? In fact, you couldn't care less. And why should you? The garbage makers didn't care. They didn't try to create a little tension. Director (Stephen Carpenter - I think it's much easier to find such a name) also made tribes (1986), which was quite enjoyable and recently made by Soul Survivors. Also a complete mess, but at least that was Eliza Dushku. This junk is debut with Daphne Zun !!! (Who?) Yes, that's right, Melrose Place chick. His very memorable character dies about 15 minutes. after opening credit. He's the second person to die. The first victim dies right in the first minute, but nobody seems to notice him later and disappears who cares? The rest of the participants ... they don't deserve the actual participants, are totally uninteresting. You hope they will die of a quick and painful death ... and not just their characters <br /> <br /> My humble opinion = 0/10
