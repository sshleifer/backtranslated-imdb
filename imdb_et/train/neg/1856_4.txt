I'm so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie! Jack Frost was my introduction to films produced and distributed by A-pix entertainment, and all that this company does is pure crap! First of all, and it is very important, never look this movie sober! Why should you? Unlike many other bad movies, I find it deliberately bad. I just can't get over how a snowman is fake, so it's always just a brief indication of how it's moving is the best! This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaay better than Michael Keaton's piece because it was too good a film, and this version is so bad.
