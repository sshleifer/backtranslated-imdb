Ok, well, I rented this movie when I was cut off on bed, and let me say it never helped the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about a man who buys a car when he goes through a medium life crisis, he loves a car more than anything around him, one day his wife decides to borrow a car. Since I don't want to spoil (not to spoil anything), let me imagine "Zany" (and I use that word lightly) that follows. <br /> <br /> I had to fight to stay awake through the bed of one minute of sleeping, and I would like to say that if you're ready to record a movie and think you're adventurous, don't forget it's a movie wastage printed. <br /> <br /> Then I could be wrong ...
