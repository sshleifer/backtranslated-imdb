this movie is terrible. The characters are absolutely incredible and wildly contradictory. The plot is terrible, and some of the scenes in the classroom are worthy of and make uncomfortable viewing. <br /> <br /> The quality and characterization of the script indicate that only secondary school students wrote this film. the total lack of credibility of the school environment suggests that in fact the writers probably did not come from high school. In most cases, the action was also weak, even though it was just a poor script and plot, I'm not sure any of the participants could have watched this movie. <br /> <br /> said the sound track was OK and the cinematography was nice in places (though editing was bad).
