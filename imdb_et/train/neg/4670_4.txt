Such adaptation as in 1949. * The Heiress *, based on Henry James's novel. * Heiress *, who plays Olivia de Havilland, remains a well-respected work, although less true to James's original story than this new remake that preserves James's original title. This is the story of an uncomfortable but loving daughter (Leigh) who is dedicated to her father (Finney) after her mother's death at birth. The Armenian father keeps his daughter in no way remarkable and finds him and all women easy. When a young man (Chaplin) with a good family and a little fortune begins to treat, the Father is naturally doubtful, but the feeling that his daughter cannot interest anyone is convinced that the young man is a fortune and forbids him to see him. Leigh is a controversial actor? most love him or hate him? and she always has a special knee and tenseness to her style as she works through teeth. He's not bad at it, and he's doing his role relatively well? it is just an uncomfortable role for every actor, making the audience want to grab the character of his shoulders and shake him until he reaches his senses. Although the character gives a lot of sympathy, he is not very pleasant. The very beautiful and enormously appealing Ben Chaplin (previously seen in The Truth About Cats and Dogs *) plays his role with the exact mystery necessary to keep the audience away from his happiness or being in love. Maggie Smith is one of the best actresses in life and significantly enhances her level of aunt. Of course, Finney is wonderful as a father who threatens to destroy her daughter for disobedience, but her daughter is willing to risk losing her. But does his deliberate defendant want him without his own happiness? This is just one case where * Washington Square * differs from * The Heiress *. Another example is the ability to hold it. This is a beautiful movie that is just as annoying as a dripping mixer, offering too little a story about a long movie.
