SWING! is an important film because it is one of the films produced and acted on in the other 30s. Many of these films have just so badly deteriorated that they are invisible, but this is a pretty good shape. It is also a good opportunity to see many talented black performers from the time immediately after the flowering of the old cotton club - the time that has been forgotten today, <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, when the film is historically important and has some beautiful performances, there is also confusion. The main plot is very similar to the era of Hollywood music - including the prima donna who destroys the exhibition and the unknown surprise who doesn't come from the day to save. However, the writing is sometimes divine-terrible and a bit unpleasant - and projects from black America that some may find a little humiliating. This is because, before the plot really goes, you will be treated with a non-accountant who lives in your hard-working husband (a popular stereotype of time) and when he is caught (who, by the way, completely transcends that role), they have a struggle that looks like WWE Smackdown Scene! And one lady wants to cut another lady with a straight razor, which is really a trashi scene! Later in the film, when prima donna behaves terribly, her husband hits her face and everyone praises her! The film seems to want to sometimes hear the lowest common denominator in the audience PLUS, but they can't do it well - some of the worst things I've seen for a long time. However, if you can look at almost every production (trash characters, bad behavior and direction and poor writing), it may be worthwhile for you to see a great song and dance dance - you have also forgotten a black culture glimpse. Just don't say I didn't warn you about the show - it's really, really bad!
