Before I start ... let me say that I fully believe in God. I believe in heaven and hell. Kay, now that it's out of the way, just want to say that in the world those moles who call themselves "hosts" think they do it? The last time I checked that the host did not discriminate, I was confronted with hate-filled beaches on television, or try to put my beliefs on every regrettable soul carrying the channel. Under those crazy, idiotic, conservative, biblical, Fred Phelps lover Pat Robertson does every day. I'm all for free speech, but because then it involves a man who says quite a lot that if you risk your ideal lifestyle, will you be sent to hell right now? This is just a great example of why religion is the cause of many SOOOO problems. One day in our classroom we had a substitute teacher, so we decided to watch TV because the teacher didn't give us any work. And we (against many men's will) looked at the 700th club and, of course, that the chunk was in the Bible and spoke of the Bible, and he said Simon is "God says homosexuality is a sin" and I actually heard a boy go "Hmm I guess that he is right. " WTF ??? Seriously, if the host tries to think of people that someone else's sexual orientation is a big sin, they must seriously take that host, record them, and throw them out of a cruise ship in the middle of the Arctic.
