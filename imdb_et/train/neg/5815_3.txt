I was really looking forward to this film preview and it was accepted, but after watching I was very disappointed. Slums is a totally unsuccessful film mixed with the reality of annoying family life with Todd Solondz. The story draws along and every scene is worse than the last one. Maybe I missed this point, but if this movie is an example of every girl's growing experience, I'm happy to be a man.
