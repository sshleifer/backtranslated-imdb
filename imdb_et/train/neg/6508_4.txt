This is an old Frankenstein presumption. A renowned scientist dies in a perplexed accident and his father, the brain surgeon noted, saves the brain. It is then placed on its own design robot. His brother, the electric genius, gives the "colossus" a boost to the thought. The whole project will go bad if the creature gets frightening. <br /> <br /> Special effects have not been developed. No script. And it's humorous that it's not a little scary. Well, very young children think it's good. If you are awake three times in the morning and it happens ... at night, at night. <br /> <br /> Leading characters are Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolff played Colossus.
