If you ask first, it was really better. See Sarah M. G., she is a real, average, cruel girl, look at Amy Adams, who is just a little stupid hanging around. He's nothing! People don't love her! Secondly, Sebastian was cute and hot on the first film, now she's a "baby face". The story is not so good and I don't understand. Why they didn't do it first, that's the beginning. Open actors, something story. It's not cruel, it plays. The first one has better actors, a better story and its average. I think music is better for cruel intentions 1 and music is better for cruel intentions. 3. This is not the worst movie I saw, but with the first one big, big and big.
