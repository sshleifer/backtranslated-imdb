It's hard to believe it's a sequel to Henry Fool. It is hard to believe that the same director and actors participated in both films. Although Henry Fool is refreshing, witty, comic, Fay Grim is slow, boring and doesn't go anywhere. Where's the spirit gone? I'm overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> 10 years when I saw Henry Fool and many of his dialogues and scenes are still alive in my memory. Fay Grim is a painful watch. This is not to blame for the actors who are good (Parker Posey) or big (Jeff Goldblum) - the fault lies entirely in the plot, in the dialogue and even in some filming (little budget is no excuse). Great disappointment. <br /> <br /> Sorry I couldn't pay attention to the plot, I was so bored, so frustrated ... if you liked it, Henry Fool may not enjoy so much ... two movies are absolutely nothing to do with each other ... there is no continuity in the personality of the characters ... it is all a cheat to lure Henry Fool fans to follow. <br /> <br /> I turn it off now - Henry in some Taliban prison?!?!
