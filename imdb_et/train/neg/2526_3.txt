I do not agree much with what has been written and said about the supposed "masterpiece" of this new wave of Germany: <br /> <br /> 1) There are significant mistakes in the simple exposition of critical plot points, such as Maria abortion and Oswald and her husband. agreement between the parties. How many viewers realized that the husband agreed in return for a substantial monetary reward not to return and restore his wife until Oswald was dead? <br /> <br /> 2) The end is very satisfying because it is arbitrary and casual. The original scenario called Mary suicide after reading Oswald's will to find that her husband had actually sold his marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria runs only with a water mixer over her wrist to suicide. Maria will then be pressed together if she does not have to accept and live with the consequences of her self-deception and moral compromise. <br /> <br /> 3) Fassbinder is trying to force the public to be forced into a private, political personal. Contrary to the claims of critics and "experts", it does not believe it works. Based on the dramatic events of the film, the historical radio news of the radio broadcasts, or the twilight of the German reconstruction, does not make these historical events an integral part of the drama. <br /> <br /> The selfish ambition of Maria's poverty and prosperity is meant to bring about a parallel transformation of post-war Germany's economic miracle. Maria is therefore meant to be a woman who is specific and reflective of her time and place, but in reality she is unoriginal and non-specific. Women have affirmed their independence by self-improvement for their age. 4) Finally, there are several unmistakable consolations and amateurs - the Fassbinder drug addiction and the resulting impatience and inattention have had an impact. Unknown people speak on the screen without ever seeing them; music is sometimes intrusive; and melodramatic substitution replaces random operation. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, a movie that understands the country's intentional collective amnesia for the Holocaust will never mention it.
