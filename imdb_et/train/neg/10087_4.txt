This is probably the first entry in the detective "Lance O'Leary / Nurse Keat"; in later O'Leary films he played much younger actors than Guy Kibbee. <br /> <br /> A group of relatives (all played by well-known characters) gather in the old house (at the rain) of course!) to tell the rich relatives who are going to the coma. <br /> <br /> Although they expect it to recover, any mysterious move, including some murder, will happen. br /> <br /> horrible movie; worth seeing!
