Having found this movie high and low, I found it with the least anticipation of playing in the Sundance Channel very early in the morning. Why I was looking endlessly for the little vanity project that Chuck Barris did in the recent times, I have no idea. The film is just terrible. Scripted part about weeks. Of course, the highlighting of the film is to see the actual performers who were "too hot for the TV" or rejected for some reason. This part is still awful, but it's fun that was enjoyable in its own way. Now, when I saw what I was looking for so long, do I look at it again in my life? Surprisingly NO! Take advantage and just look at the much better "dangerous mind testimonies" or find the old copies of the actual exhibition. The girl is working where the pop-ups just cease provocatively, but she had to endure the eyesight of Jay P. Morgan that the audience would probably have made me sterile. In retrospect, I'm so happy that it was a huge flop, because if it was a huge hit, it could have been "The $ 1.98 Beauty Show Movie" and that my friends would definitely have brought Apocalypse. > <br /> My class: D
