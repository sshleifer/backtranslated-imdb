I didn't finish this movie for some reason, it was terrible and it's just an actor. I wasn't even sure what the film was about that it didn't make much sense and the violence was terrible. I mean ususly that I like a naked movie (lol), but it was just sick of what happened. All the symbols bothered me and it was just full of loud shouting and the camera shook in parts and it looked like another project, but without good features. This is one of the worst films I've seen for a long time and I would like my time back. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone or even consider it. (N)
