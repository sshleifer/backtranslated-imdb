Absolutely nothing happens in this sloooow, annoying, thrilling thriller led by Amenabar's usual co-owner Mateo Gil. The film, which in some way deals with the effects of searching for boredom and excitement, actually does nothing and seems like boredom. The only mildly pausing moment is the climax of the film, which takes about 30 seconds from the entire embarrassing 100-minute minute, and is solved too easily. The plot lacks complexity or reliability, and while the idea is original, how the story comes up is arbitrary, and any plot device or twist is caused by external disturbances (deus-ex-machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens to him, without forcing him to show any initiative or ingenuity. If you're a fan of the genre, look at "Tesis" instead.
