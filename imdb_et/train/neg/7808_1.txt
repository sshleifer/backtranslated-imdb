I'm a huge fan of Michael Madsen, so it goes without saying that I bought this movie without renting it or anything ... This movie was so terrible that I didn't even bring it back to the store, I wouldn't want anyone else to be subjected to it, I just threw it in the trash, don't forget that money, it was worth to throw it away. Action was not so bad, it wasn't good or anything. The story was terrible and the end was something I despised. He was a broken man, an alcoholic. his life was a bunch of junk. I thought his horse, peanuts, was a terrible device to show his childhood innocence, the dog would have been much better. I also hate religion, so this ending was undoubtedly angry with me. Jesus greets everyone ... I hate to know people like the great Christians and Catholics, and time shows that God does not heal all or anything. It was a terrible movie if u had the chance to see it, go through it or even better buy or rent it and throw it away and leave the ground in the morning
