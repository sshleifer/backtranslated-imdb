First, the leader, Brad Dourif, is KOOK. If you are trying to take this movie seriously, I guarantee he will destroy it for you. If you don't take her too seriously, she's really fun to watch. As with another reviewer, I loved this scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif proclaim their love for each other - skipping the flame out of their hand in the car. Another great matured scene was watching John Land, who was a dirty radio show manufacturer who got roasted and flailing around the room. In fact, I found the movie in the last 15 minutes to be a non-stop laugh - I'm not sure if Tobe Hooper meant that.
