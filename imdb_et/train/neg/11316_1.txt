The knights were just the beginning of the line, the pilot, can be said. Plot (I shouldn't call it that there was no plot) wasn't at all logical and a lot of mistakes like [warning, I'll take the plot]: <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, someone said there was only a couple of them cyber (bad guys), but after the climax Nea learned that there was a lot left to the left. And it was said that the cyber were hard to kill, but after a month of training, Nea could kill one shot. <br /> <br /> The film was just a pure shot. I wasn't at all surprised when I found out that the leading star was a kick boxer. <br /> <br /> There was one positive thing in the whole movie: it's really a big laugh. and I'll talk to my friends about it. I recommend looking at it if you need laughter.
