What happened to Peter Bogdanovich? Never been a bright director, a trail of a blazer ... now scraping the bottom ... Is it the same guy who led the "Last Picture Show"? Here he takes a somewhat interesting (though far-reaching) assumption and makes it a bubble that loses taste at the moment you first bite ... Dunst is not bad, but Izzard is like Chaplin, and all the other actors seem to have cast their "appearance" "and not because they were right for that part. Damage. I'm going to rent "Paper Moon" again.
