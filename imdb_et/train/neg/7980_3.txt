This service comedy, for which Peter Marshall (brother of Joanne Dru and later the perennial Hollywood square) and Tommy Noonan were jumping like "new Lewis and Martin", is just shy: some random fields are added, everyone speaks fast and nothing works right - there is one scene where Noonan throws grenades to officials and politicians in crowns; they are about five feet away, Noonan throws them in and the general reaction is that everyone is on fire. <br /> <br /> In the midst of frightening, which is only relieved by the pulling Julie Newmar, there are some moments of brightness: Marshall and Noonan occasionally deal with double talk and argumentation, and their timing is almost perfect - they were clearly a busy comedy couple. <br /> <br /> This is Turkey, unfortunately.
