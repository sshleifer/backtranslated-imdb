College students who speak of a condemned dormitory are hidden by the killer. <br /> <br /> Dorm, which dropped blood (aka Pranks), is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans. The film's production values ​​are quite small and the story is mostly quite routine, even the red Baltic herring has slipped. In fact, much of the gathering of the story is quite forgotten, except for one or two murderous assassinations. However, the film is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax (in the atmosphere) and by one rather bold, unusual conclusion. <br /> <br /> Cast is mostly weak. Stephen Sachs has a lot because he makes a pretty nice sort. Also look for a young Daphne Zun as a malicious student. <br /> <br /> All of this is a pretty ordinary B slasher quest, but the final is worth the enjoyment and this viewer recorded the movie in full ho-hum. <br /> <br /> ** Off ****
