A young boy comes in a lot of money and starts living. Unfortunately, the man whose money actually happens is very bad. He wants his looting back. If he finds out who is bucks, he will try it back. He misses that little child who is just happy to fall into the hands of the evil man. Looks familiar, I bet. Very predictable, interesting at all. Come on something a little different, ok guys?
