Live! Yes, but not hitting. <br /> <br /> True Story: Some time ago, the Dutch TV station announced that they would launch a new reality show. Race rather. The main participant of this exhibition would be a woman who died a terrible thing and would give the kid one happy person with progressive kidney failure. Real. <br /> <br /> The state and the international media were all the story like flies, saying it was terrible, immoral, what-it-world-coming, and so on. In a sense, I had to agree. <br /> <br /> When months passed, tensions were set so that the government was mostly busy with the question of whether they should show this show, rather than working in the country. <br /> <br /> The exhibition aired and until the last moment they moved. And until the last moment the country was in arms, the prime minister made speeches, every newspaper that wrote about it, all in the country where they breathe. And the net pushed. Television towards the new border. And they certainly did it. They pulled out the envelope. <br /> <br /> The exhibition flew and we all watched the sick woman who chose the right candidate to get the kid so that she would live, she would die right after that. <br /> And at the last moments of the show, it turned out to be a partial hoax. The woman was not sick, but all the candidates were. No kidney auction. The whole exhibition shows that the debate on ads and ads and the build up of a fantastic climax throughout the month was a public stunt to focus on the problem of the major shortcomings of organ donors. The man who set up this network died of kidney disease. <br /> <br /> It's now on TV. Leave everyone astonished with astonishment. <br /> <br /> Don't give me a bad, poorly managed flick for a woman trying to get Russian roulette show on American TV. <br /> <br /> As if. <br /> <br /> Spoiler * As I believe they will get it through the FCC. As if I believe that it would come through free expression through the US Supreme Court. As if I believe in a ridiculous ending, where this woman pulled it out and has problems with conscience, because some of the boys let themselves in the air. Instead, look at the current man with Arnold. At least he had a half good end. <br /> <br /> Spoiler * This is a terribly bad movie with a ridiculous ending. So he finally ends up knowing whether it should get us to the public better after leaving the theater because there was some justice? Don't take my word, but I'd say it: leave it alone and look at the test pattern instead, get better quality.
