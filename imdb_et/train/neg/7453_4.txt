Wonderful actors. <br /> <br /> Lousy script and not too big a direction. My main problem was that I just didn't care about any of these people. Not the killer, not the victims. The settings were pretty drab. The character of Dennis Quaid was so badly written that I didn't even care when it came to the end. She got her child back. Great thing! I wanted my money back.
