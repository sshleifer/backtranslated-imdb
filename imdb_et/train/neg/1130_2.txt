A long-term drama that can't make any real point. So he became an actor - what then? He learned to love - a big deal. There are certain eccentricities among characters and dialogue and situations, but one that is bad for the film, often causing it to be absurd. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix, playing a leading role, speaks and behaves like a semi-slowed person, so there's no choice to watch a movie as a slower girl doing it in the theater world - it wasn't obviously the point. We are told early (in this "Barry Lyndon" story) that he learned to hide his emotions, which certainly explains his autistic stone surface, but the film suffers for it. He basically moves like a zombie and his success as an actor is not quite plausible due to his lack of emotions. Sometimes the film had a dull, sleepy feeling about Dogma 95 movie. Is this one? I wouldn't be surprised at all. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix is ​​the sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the recent Phoenix River. Nepotism works rarely. <br /> <br /> If you would like to see a list of my Hollywood Nepotism with more than 350 images / posts, please contact me by email.
