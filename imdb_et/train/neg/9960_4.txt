MY BROTHER TOM <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> By following a sexual abuse episode in the hands of a trustee, Jessica (Jenna) Harrison) is a relationship with a strange boy (Ben Whishaw) whom he meets in the woods. Unfortunately, Whishawil has his own secrets, no less worrying and much more dangerous ... <br /> <br /> Doura's drama created by brave productions Harrison and Whishaw, where two relatives spirit dive into mutual love for nature after their experience is proven in the "real world". Unfortunately, their friendship breaks when the harsh reality begins to invade, leading to an inevitable tragedy. Filmed by Dom Rotheroe and captured in a digital video format, the scene is remarkably eye-catching (too many uncomfortable close-ups and sloppy hand-held camera moves) and takes time to find your feet, but dramatic profitability is quietly profitable.
