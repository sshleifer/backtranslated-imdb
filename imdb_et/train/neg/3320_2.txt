I had honestly somewhat high expectations when I first saw this movie, but it turned out to be one of the most boring films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> First, the pace is incredibly slow, so it looks much longer than it is (and it is not short). I am sure that Jane Austen wrote the book, made it many pages long, filled it with a description, and did not intend to read people one day, or it could pull and lose the appeal that "Emma" certainly did. Now this "Sense and Sensibility" was a slow pace, but at least it was a lively line to make up for it, as well as some good performances! <br /> <br /> It brings me no 2 errors, which of course is working. Although I don't really get anyone involved in this movie, I'm sure they can do a good job, but I didn't see much in this movie. It was like people were trying too hard to be funny, too hard to be a "top class", too hard to be British (well, some of them) so they all just came as a set of actors and not people. <br /> <br /> # 3. As I said, it looked like an actor, not really like the people they played. Maybe it's good because the people they played were not that nice. Why did everything like Emma do? Of course he was happy for the rich, beautiful people in front of them, but he was a terrible courage behind them. When his friends were "ugly", he didn't even want to go behind him. So, why is this girl so big? Why do people have to tell stories, "just laugh?" Of course, snob could not even do that right. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow like Gwyneth Paltrow and his "Emma" doesn't change my opinion exactly. <br /> <br /> Well, it's easy to see that I didn't care about it. I'm sure it's a lovely book and everything, but some books aren't really meant to be a big screen, and "Emma" is one of them.
