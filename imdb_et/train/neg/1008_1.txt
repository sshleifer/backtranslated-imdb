Edison's plot was decent, but one actor destroyed the film. Justin Timberlake destroyed the film with the line announced during each movie. He is by far one of the worst actors I've ever seen and should get the same fate as the whole F.R.A.T. team. <br /> <br /> Whether it was an emotional scene, a scene of action or even a silent scene, Justin Timberlake was able to destroy it. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time watching this movie. Don't even bother with this download, dwarf porn would be a much better option. <br /> <br /> Justin, when you read it, stay with the music. Even if you are not good at it, you have done an excellent job of defying people thinking about what you are actually singing.
