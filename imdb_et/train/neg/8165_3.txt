It's a ghost story. This is the story of cannibalism. It's a revenge story. This is a very badly made film that has a lot of violence. I think it follows inexpensively every time you see it. It has a normal isolated place, screaming campers heading to the desert. Quite intensive scenes are allowed. It's just so boring. Bad editing and all the work. There are ghosts who sound like they talk to the trash. I'm not quite sure what the rules are about ghosts and psycho with a seed cork. It also has a great challenge where a man eats a piece of meat that is actually left by his wife. One of my friends asked me why it was necessary to show such free and sick violence. I'm afraid it's another step in our desensitized development. Three are not wisdom here, the tongue is not the cheek, but the sad waste. A lot of blood; small plot.
