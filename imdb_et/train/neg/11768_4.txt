This reboot is like a processed McDonald meal compared to Ang Lee's very good but very underrated 2003 The Incredible Hulk. <br /> <br /> Ang Lee's The Hulk is a comedian comic book. Hulk takes time (about 40 minutes), but when he sees the conflict in the core of our protagonist. He does his best to avoid losing control, but if he admits he gives his rage, he likes it. <br /> <br /> Now compare it to Edward Norton's turn, where the conflict is not in his personality, and he will change Hulk when he gets excited and his pulse rate is 200 beats per minute (not 183, not 197, but exactly 200). For this observer, it seemed similar to the use of midi-chlorans in Phantom Menace, which tells us how strong "force" is with one, as if mystical abilities could be measured by blood analysis. In the 2008 film, all Ed Norton's Bruce Banner has to do their pulse rate below 200, which is monitored by a device attached to his wrist. And for the record, it is extremely difficult to get a pulse of up to 200 even for a very inspiring ride, especially for a physically fit person. <br /> <br /> Emotions run with Eric Bana Hulk. He has repressed memories of his mother's death and father's role in his early life. On the surface, he is calm, but there is considerable anger there, enough rage to heat the Hulk when it is fired. But Hulk never deliberately kills, even his attackers. Mostly, he just wants to get away or close to Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). He can't cope with his shooters and, in one critical scene, he will save the destructive force that bounces him. <br /> <br /> In the 2003 film, there are visual effects, but if necessary. Action scenes (and there are many of them) are needed on the plot, unlike the 2008 movie, where action is added to perform operations. <br /> <br /> In his attempt to make this "refugee" story, Ed Norton is losing focus on how Bruce Banner looks like Hulk. For him, Hulk is a dangerous side effect in the experiment. And Louis Leterrier, director who rose to Ed Norton's cue, does not add any emotional dimension to the Banner-Hulk relationship. The story can be summarized as follows: Banner continues and Hulk beats behind, Banner busted and Hulk kick butt. Repeat as necessary. <br /> <br /> The only thing that went against the 2003 film is that it may not be the same as the 2008 version for comic books. However, even if I am a fan of comics, I would prefer a movie that is not a comic as true as a fan-fan dream, but that is every day a comic-loyal but made and breathless version of the 2008 version. Maybe Ang Lee should have read more comics. Iron Man, who is also in 2008, is a great example of a movie with heart at its roots.
