"Sex Diary" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsion. Probably a movie marketing scam, this flick is a stylish shoot good cast and little else goes for it. The bottom line, "The Diary ...", should believe us that our sex addict is characterized by the world's most stupid women, side-by-side babes who have nothing better than panties to fall under his whim, and there is no work despite being a restaurant. At best, this flick would have been a good drama. The worst, cheap cushioning. "The Diary ..." is neither, nor anywhere. It's for the trash. (D-)
