Hey, if you have a little over an hour to kill and find the color too exciting, I would recommend it. If you like b-movies like me, that's good! Aside from the fact that I do not recommend renting it, I wait until it is on the tube to say that the 4th ring is on the free access channel of your cable / satellite supplier. The band that followed this track was on the road a few years after the journey, and they didn't sound as bad as the comments of the two small towns I found for them. So good again, you will find grass that will grow very fun, but look good if you want to see how NOT a low budget movie can get.
