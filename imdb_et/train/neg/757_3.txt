My children watch this play every day, if it is. This is a great program for younger children. But they have to stop showing the races again and do some more real shows and get rid of Rooney and Deedee YELLOW TEETH. Fashion is the only doodle bop with pure white pearl and kids mark these things and ask if two do not educate their teeth? Has the exhibition ever arrived in the United States and, if so, where to find its timetable. And one more thing if we could add. You have to hide so much in fashion. Sometimes, when you jump out, where do you scare the younger children and whats the rope? What does it mean? the other then wet all the time. They have to add newer things to their show, not the same thing. Children lose interest.
