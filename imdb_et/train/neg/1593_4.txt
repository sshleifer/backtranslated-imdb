Many of the leading characters of Hideo Gosha's 1969 "Hitokiri" movie were real historical figures ("Western" in the order of names): Ryoma Sakamoto, Hachite Takechi, Shimbei Tanaka, Izo Okada, ___ Anenokoji. The name "Hitokiri", a historical term, refers to the four super-dimensional groups who, in the mid-19th century, during the commands of the leader of Loyalist Takech, had a number of key features in Tokugawa Shogunate. Tosa clan (ie ultra-nationalist, imperial) faction. What was that? Sorry, you can't find out in this movie. "Brilliant History Lesson" Really! <br /> <br /> No, Gosha is much more interested in showing you the usual bloody slicing and cube and (absurd length) non-very bright killer Izo Okada's inner torment. as the publication of actual history. For example, Sakamoto was someone of historical importance, considered the father of the Japanese Empress Navy. The closest Gosha comes to a history lesson where Sakamoto, whom Takechi holds for a loyal fraudster, comes to Takech Manor to try to let him down. He talks about the international political situation where foreign warships are in Japanese ports and Japan, which is too weak to protect them. Want to know more? Sorry. Gosha interrupts this potentially exciting lecture in the middle of the sentence (!). So much to inform your audience of the turning point in Japanese history. <br /> <br /> The film left me completely confused about the goals of the two sides in this fight. For two and a half centuries, when Shogunate held central power in Japan, it was an institution dedicated to the prevention of social change, to maintaining the feudal relationship of society. It was a fear of external contamination, both ideological and technological. In keeping with this spirit, he banned firearms, these "leveling" instruments in Europe and America, where the peasant could have resisted the samurai. Throughout this period, the emperor was nothing but a spiritual form. <br /> <br /> However, in the towns between the feudal areas in neutral zones, a new class of merchants, landlords and artisans emerged - a class known in Europe by its French name, civil society. Inevitably, when this new class gained strength, it rubbed against the borders of many feudal societies. As in Europe, the king (emperor) became a civil society in the fight against power against feudal aristocracy. But the political leadership does not always understand the interests of the class it serves. When a foreign country arrived in the form of US ship Admiral Perry's "Black Ship" in 1853, the Japanese elite crisis was thrown away. Their army was not suitable for these aliens. They also heard about the deaths of British and French imperialists in China. What should Japan do to save its weak neighbor's fate? Surprisingly, some of the isolating Shogunate elements tended to open up foreign trade to become part of their advanced technology. This is the position that Sakamoto represents in the film (barely). On the other hand, the emperor-loyal ultranationalists, represented by Takech, believed that they could have been abandoned by foreigners if they only prevented the other group from "selling the country." So Shogunate's murders are murders - and we're going. <br /> <br /> Takech's motivation was the biggest puzzle for me in the movie. Gosha suggests that she fights mainly for her personal promotion, not for a loyal cause. Can we represent it as a whole loyalist? (Do you care?) <br /> <br /> Many reviewers have this "Goyokin" movie that Gosha did in the same year, at a good price. But when "Goyokin" is splitting, halting, the adventure thread, which the hero deserves sympathy, is "Hitokiri" bursting, almost no good or no hero. Sakamoto could have been the hero of this film, but we are not allowed to feel - or what he stands - well enough to achieve that status. <br /> <br /> Given his excellent points in the five previous Kurosawa films, Masaru Sato's score here was very disappointing, sounding like a "Bonanza" episode. <br /> <br /> Barry Freed
