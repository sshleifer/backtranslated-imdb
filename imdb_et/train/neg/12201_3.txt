All in all, there is a whole lot of money. It's not nearly as good as the original. A script written by both Stallone and James Cameron (at the same time he wrote aliens). Most of the activities are written by Cameron and the political aspects are written by Stallone. <br /> <br /> Sly was in physical condition when he did it, and Rocky 4, and he looks great or above the steroid eyeballs, depending on your point of view or opinion. <br /> <br /> Rambo starts in jail and is visited by Colonel Trautman, who asks him to go on a special mission that could serve him as President's grace. Finally, he agrees and goes to the Charles Napier-led briefing camp, where he plays a suit of Washington, attempting to place himself in the former armed forces at Rambo. <br /> <br /> The mission is to find out if there are any remaining races in Vietnamese camps. Rambo was chosen in the camp he was in, where he had previously been a prisoner. He has said that it is not a rescue task and he is just about taking photos. <br /> <br /> After a bad attempt to get down from the plane, he loses most of his kit, meets his contact (who turns out to be a lovely woman) and drives down to the river with pirates in the camp. <br /> <br /> He thinks he is still in jail and rescues one. As 3 escape from the Vietnamese army in their river boat, these pirates are betrayed, but they are all killed by Rambo and forced to take a walk when their boat is almost blown and blown with Rambo. board. <br /> <br /> Rambo is betrayed again and abandoned when Napier orders a rescue helicopter recall. It is clear that Trautman will return to the base to recognize that survivors are not expected. <br /> <br /> Steven Berkoff will appear in Russian Spetznatz Colonel and Rambo will be tortured and will eventually escape only more Vietnamese forces and Spetznatz. Many of them kill the Rambo at the end of the chopper and save most of the prisoners to return to their base. <br /> <br /> He is against the desire to kill Napier for his abandonment, but destroys Ops center. <br /> Weak plot and very weak end when Rambo walks around the sunset.
