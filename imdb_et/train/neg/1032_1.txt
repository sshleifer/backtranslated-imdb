Although I've never been an original Scooby-Doo fan (due to its terrible production values), it seems like Shakespeare, compared to the grave we brought to us by Hanna-Barbera! Undoubtedly, Scrappy-Doo is the most annoying and terrible character for children (and includes both Teletubbies and Tommy's tapeworms). Whose bright idea was to create some kind of short mutant dog and allow him to speak and then get into Scooby-Doo characters?! Whoever it is, deserves to die or look at this exhibition (I think death is better). The bottom line is that the little dog is just uncomfortable, annoying and nervous - and it's only in the better episodes! After many years, it would have been better to simply terminate the franchise than to create this mess! I see why they made a Scrappy-Doo movie in Scooby-Doo's live movie - virtually everyone hates him!
