I saw this movie in a real cinema (probably $ 2.00 one) with my cousin and uncle. We were about 11 and 12, I think, and really scary movies. I remember being so excited to see it because my cool uncle allows us to choose a movie (and we could never do that!) And so disappointed! Just boring and not scary. The only redeeming thing I remember was Corky Pigeon Silver from Veneer, and it wasn't that big, just someone I know. I've seen bad movies before and it's always been the worst in my mind. This was due to what I remember, one of our collective $ 6 of the most boring, non-frightening waste and film waste. I've read a few comments that say it's worth a look and I say, "Too much of his own", but I don't even worry. Not so bad that it's good.
