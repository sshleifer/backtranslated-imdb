I love comics. Although I have problems understanding my understanding completely? The visual style is unique to all its dirt, dust and decomposition. So I thought I knew what I was. Surprisingly, did I understand the main plot? but some very bad decisions are made in this visual style. <br /> <br /> I mean - really bad looking for "CG Actresses"? ? Why?! It doesn't work at all! Horus - and other Egyption gods - have been successfully made in CG and very close to the comic. <br /> <br /> I think with the real participants this film would have been a cult film. <br /> <br /> What a shame.
