I'm all about thinking of the great epic of the American Revolutionary War. That's not the case. (And that was not the issue with Emmerich / Devlin / Gibson THE PATRIOT. But I'll land.) <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in the old MGM Studios (now Sony) public screening right before it came out. The dear period, written by Auditor Robert Dillon, was welcomed by a large audience, directed by Hugh Hudson (FAR) and starring Al Pacino. <br /> <br /> But it didn't take long for people to chew in their places, whispering consistent comments about Pacino's terribly wrongly accepted place - he was supposed to be at the frontier of American ancestors in Scotland (!) - and Nastassia Kinsk, who had recently traveled England(!!). Then the story started and it all went down quickly. What was the plot that drew the absurd coincidence; for the second or third time, when the alleged lovers Pacino and Kinski stumbled upon each other, it became a bad joke. Donald Sutherland was unhinged as a British officer / child. His accent was also on the whole map. I don't think English was there. <br /> <br /> Many people left. Those who stayed tried to stifle the strangers, then blamed publicly. I missed it - I thought at least the battle scenes might be good. I was wrong. Inexplicably, Hudson decided to shoot them with hand-held cameras, not even with Steadicam, which pulled the wrong "newsletter" of authenticity, which destroyed the scale. <br /> <br /> For the audience a few lines in front of me: (late) Gary Franklin, Channel 7 Eyewitness News. I can say that the rest of the men's behavior was with him. And surely, the next day, in his television segment, he gave a movie to his notorious '1-10' Franklin scale to 10, stating passionately what attacks made a screening at night, who clearly didn't know the art when they saw it. What is this buffer. <br /> <br /> After this catastrophe, Pacino didn't see the second movie for nearly 4 years. Hugh Hudson's career never recovered. You can't say I didn't warn you.
