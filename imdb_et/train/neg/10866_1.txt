Let's see where to start ... bad action; I'm not sure if I would even call it because it is more than a non-strenuous script reading. The actors did not even feel in their parts and seemed rather inanimate and hopeless. Of course, it was a nudity scene, but it couldn't record this movie from its inanimate characters. <br /> <br /> The main character is a rapper for people who actually do it. The lyrics were not a rhythm or stream and seemed more like a futile rants. <br /> <br /> Budget? Did this film even have a budget? It seemed that they used less money when I saw a YouTube video. Bad lighting, props, bad sound production. Bad special effects if you want to call it so far. The story could have been good if people actually seemed interesting, but there was no life for this flick; I don't care who drove it. <br /> <br /> I have seen some really bad pictures over the past year and it is definitely very bottom. Don't waste your time or want to listen to this impartial review. Check the ratings, you see that the 1st fast crosses 10, something in the meantime. I'd like to be a little closer before I waste my time. What a suck-fest!
