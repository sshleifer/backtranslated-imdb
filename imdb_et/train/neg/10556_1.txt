This is a good example of how not to film. <br /> <br /> There are very few constant cuts between meaningful dialogue, the context of events, and seemingly unrelated scenes. The result is a confusing, helpless viewer; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director's comments. <br /> <br /> This movie is much related to human cruelty and tries to show how wrong it is with an emphasis on child abuse. It includes some stocks related to real and terrible acts of violence, including warfare executions. Although it works in the context of the film, I feel that the ideas behind the film could have been presented without using such extreme content. This film is not absolutely weak on the stomach or easily offended, and should under no circumstances be shown to minors. <br /> <br /> The climax is anti-climate compared to the rest of the movie. If you do not hear the comments, if this happens, you will probably be left with it. <br /> <br /> The director's comment was a one-time, "sit man and let him talk without a cut" comment. Although it may not be bad, the director gets a lot of trouble and often spends time complaining about his college, filming conditions, collaborators, bad film and ten other things. Continuous negativity worsens what is otherwise an important means of understanding the film. <br /> <br /> The movie was fired for 16mm for years and Super8 for four years at an extremely low budget. Therefore, video and audio quality is poor. This alone does not make it a bad movie, but it makes a bad movie worse.
