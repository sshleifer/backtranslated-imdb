Greenthumb Grace has remained uneven after the deaths of his spouses, so he pays the bill to grow bay. It sounds promising and more and more reliable Brenda Blethyn doesn't disappoint, but the material is sitcom-thin. There is actually a scene where Grace asks the young gardener "Give me one" (a toke) and she thinks she is asking for sex and doing everything uncomfortable. Yes, it's humor, so the nun would be bored. Grace's saving doesn't seem to be aware of what he wants to be: stunning cinematography and a dignified pace of memory make Ryan's daughter-in-law, while the mild frightening of citizens in the country can be removed from every episode of the Antique Journey. It accelerates after the first hour, but by then it's too careful. The climax can only be unpredictable if you introduce the most disgraceful Deux ex Machina I've ever seen.
