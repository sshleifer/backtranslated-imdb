The processing of Anthony Shaffer's classic game in cinemas will not last long. Having recently suffered through this cable, I still congratulate myself for not wasting money on the ticket. Directed by Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter and star / producer Jude Law, it was misleading that by their prestige alone, this travesty would be infinite for 93 minutes without a long original or fun. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine increased his reputation to play the second leading position in an excellent 1972 movie. Now, he seems to have the intention of leading the destruction that Laurence Olivier played in this version. (Both were the best actresses of the Oscar, but lost to Marlon Brandole GODFATHER.) Looking swollen and washed out, Caine moves through that part that has less depth than Batman butler. He had already made himself appear to the guests in the terrifying remake of GET CARTER. What is next - ALFIE II or MAN MONTH WHO CAN KING? <br /> <br /> Then, no one will benefit from this misplaced Pane adjustment, who thinks that frequent curse and the added sexual angle can compensate for the lack of wisdom of Shaffer. The direction of Branagh depends on the bluish illumination and the breathless equipment that would not stay in the second level nightclub. No shadows or dense, superfluous close-ups will not help the law to overcome your boring screen person. The result is a failure as a straight and detective thriller, almost forgetting the purpose behind the headline. Caine's film could be considered a bad dream by this company. Mr. Shaffer, who wrote the 1972 scenario, as well as Hitchcock's FRENZY and several Agatha Christie adaptations, must turn to his grave, wishing he can make a real murder or two!
