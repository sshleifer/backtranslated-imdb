OK this movie was really "unique". Carrie Fisher was the most talented in the film, although she says she was a coke problem during the film. but he said he didn't remember that much. well thats his excuse, but whats everyone else? I can't imagine they all had a coke problem. what wasn't all so bad that I think the plot was OK and had some pretty funny moments. even though the part where the man gets this thing with his head was a bit violent to my taste. Oh well I think I was disappointed because Carrie's fisherman is so fantastic and this movie didn't make him anything.
