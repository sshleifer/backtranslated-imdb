This movie is fun, not good. The struggles are terribly bad, but sometimes they try to shock you by breaking bones, and even this happens only two or three times, certainly not enough to call it chocolate. Fixed combat means that the hero can step into an open field where 10 people hit him when he is, pulls a gun, starts shooting and doesn't hurt. <br /> <br /> The story is empty, the boy awakening, the memory disappears, he begins to fight for what he is good at. Five years later, the memories come back, take revenge blablabla. <br /> <br /> Not worth your box, not really worth your time if you don't get drunk or get bored.
