In general, over rated movie with strong cast and some clever dialogue and of course Dean Martin songs. The problem is Nicholas Cage, he and Cher have no chemistry and they are a central love story. Cher does almost completely with his response to Cage's changing accent and the tongue of the control body. Drilling simply does not play its role. He is trying everything he can think of and what is an actor rather than a real person, and what a love story needs. Cage has had the same performance problems in other roles that require more Jimmy Stewart type characters. Cage takes these roles, perhaps because he likes such films, but his own actor energy is not useful to them, although he has tried it repeatedly. He should leave such roles for less interesting actors who are fully committed to the film and spend their energy and remarkable talent more on attacks and films where he can be his crazy interesting himself.
