The only reason I rented it was due to an article by Fangoria Magazine. The article made this movie interesting. Well, that's not. It was a very boring, amateurly written and directed film. All the participants in this movie are terrible, except Faye Dunaway, who is always happy to watch. But too much time was focused on Gina Phillips and her ridiculous meetings with the deaf and Duilio Marzio. Marzio is such a thick Argentine accent, you only understand the words of every pair he says. Nicholas Pauls also plays Gina Phillips with great love. Bottom line: This movie is not scary. There is only one good scene and it's a movie for the last five to ten minutes. I would have given this one letter, but I gave it to three just because I like Faye Dunaway so much. But even he wasn't that big.
