This is the first of the collections I have seen, and it certainly hasn't made me any other vacation ... although I've heard that at least a few of them are decent. I don't know, it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't much for me. Your main dysfunctional cannibal family in the suburbia-type mamma and the father died, the family sold the farm and moved to San Francisco (?), Where they continued their food sources where possible. The best part of it was the horrible sister of Goth, who of course calls a school that ever leaves. Anyway, of course we have a butcher shop in the basement and so on and so on. This family is sort of like the white bread version of Sawyer Clan, they are disgusting and they do bad things, but they do not go into the soul. I see a lot of comments from people who liked it, and I think I don't know what I miss, but I found it to be very mediocre and I wouldn't want it for anyone, really. 4 out of 10.
