I saw this movie once and I never want to see it. <br /> <br /> This movie is about Preston Waters, who is a lucky guy who always seems to be his family and who always seems to be in cash. All this will change if the banker runs over Preston and gives him a blank check as compensation. Preston uses the check to withdraw $ 1 million from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him control). Preston then buys the mansion and says he works as a mysterious and rich supporter named Mr. Macintosh (named after his computer). After that, he gets crazy with money. <br /> <br /> This is a great idea on paper. But on the screen it's one of the most wonderful movies I've ever seen. First, it is too unbelievable. I know some parts of the film had to be incredible, but I draw a line to a twelve-year-old boy who goes out with a thirty-year-old woman, and puts a small fortune on an imaginary person. It was also a low film with a weak effect, a predictable plot line and signs that are more memorable. The characters were either cheesy, top, annoying or underdeveloped. But "juice" was a funny sign. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip it.
