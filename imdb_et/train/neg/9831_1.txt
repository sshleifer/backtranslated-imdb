I was trying to watch this movie without being able to really sit there because it requires a "good" message; The problem is that it is obviously made according to one particular scripture passage. In my opinion, the interpretation is misleading for many people. In addition, I am a film maniac and acting in this film was totally unacceptable. Never before would I have liked a negative score to rate a movie. So, if you want those who do not have authority, to be able to declare incessantly, then I get this movie anyway. This comment is also a warning to the sci-fi pleasant or loving people, because the title also deceives many people. It was an unfortunate film, because the basic idea was to have opportunities and these opportunities were wasted. The only redeemable quality of the film is that it made me realize that the Time Machine symbol should probably have shown a little more moral resentment in their unusual behavior.
