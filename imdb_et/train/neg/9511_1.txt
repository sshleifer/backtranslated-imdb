I wanted to see this movie since it was first advertised on television. I went to the town of Tinsel to see this last night at 7:40. I'm sorry the day when my ticket to this trash can be wasted when I saw something better. First the bunch of sexy trash bin and clich√©s started. They exaggerated how love works in reality. All the girls were stereotypes. The boy was too stupid for his age. Pregnant girls who barely got pregnant women laugh. Bank robbery was completely boring, which was also used in other films. Their escape car was the old beaten Chevy van, who claimed they had no breaks. Hey, why didn't they get a nice daughter for robbery instead? Maybe it increased the audience's opinion about the film. This movie was very low with a low low low low budget because there was nothing damaged and destroyed. In this film there were many things that led to Christian nuts. Hi, I was even waiting for a car chase scene because all the bank robberies have cars, but I've never been. So I appreciate this movie b, which stands for low budget and 1 out of 10 stars.
