An island scientist is deeply saddened by the loss of a son who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: why not my dead son hammerhead shark. Well, who's not? It is a bit difficult to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark that kills everything is constantly called "Paul". Also, William Forsythe as a MacGyver-kick-ass-save-late-sure hero is not reliable. On the other hand, there are some hot chicks who actually make you look at the screen when shark Paul bites another death. In fact, I find bad b-movies pretty amusing. But for my taste it would have been a much better movie than it would have said 1 million bucks less. Then it can be fun.
