There are so many funny things about this movie that I can't name but a few: <br /> <br /> The character of BOGART: 1. His name? Whip McCord (too simple, so I'll leave it off. Boy, this makes Humphrey good.) 2. His long, curly hair and stupid shrubs. 3. His black Bart Bart-up, with spurs! 4. It is not sure what the lipstick it has been wearing, but it is not too weird. what. 2. The man has swallowed his hat throughout the movie! Don't they find a suitable hat for him? Even small? !!?! 3. His pants are too narrow behind him. 4. It blows smoke too much from your gun when you know what I mean, and I think you're doing it. <br /> <br /> If you are a casual Bogart or Cagney fan and think that it has changed at a pace to see it in the west, do yourself a favor and forget this idea. DO NOT ASK HORSES! (That is, if they don't see it boring.) <br /> <br /> In all justice, I admit that the West is my least favorite movie genre, but I've seen a lot more than that. br /> <br /> The Oklahoma Kid works at comedy level or high camp. Otherwise, it is a watchful watcher. Therefore, look at it only if: a) you need to see every west of it b) you are TRUE Cagney or Bogie finalist c) any of the above comments has turned to you. Woah ?? ..
