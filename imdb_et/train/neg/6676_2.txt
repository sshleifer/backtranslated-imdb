I may not have been the greatest Blair witch, but I still appreciate this effort so I waited for Altered, especially after reading the huge ones that were thrown into various IMDb comments. "Unique", "Intelligent", "Class of Future Culture" and so on ... you have to wonder where people are going to describe this bad effort. <br /> <br /> Because, unfortunately, has changed, poor, weak film that does not respect any respect. Rumor is not funny. The fear and gate are not scary. And from any "thinking" point of view, some poor spouses in this film showed serious deception, because there is certainly nothing deep or intelligent about this confusion. <br /> <br /> OK, so we know there's nothing to look like. Is it at least acceptable? Does the experience make sense? Unfortunately no. For starters, get very bad act. It is not a stretch that most B-films these days work better. Content? Bored and dirty. Dialogues? Many amateurs make it better. <br /> <br /> This is really what riddles are controlled. I did not expect much progress from Blair Witch, but at least small steps forward. Instead, it seems that our director has deteriorated over time, with all the previous experience fully attentive. <br /> <br /> If there is a big mistake in Altered, this is the main set. A large part of the plot is located in one place where the main characters are limited, but Sánchez has not provided a person. Considering that Blair Witch plays an important part of the forest and has the same character (antagonist if you wish) as three students, you think the director would understand the same thing here. But no ... there is no personality at this place due to the lack of direction and lack of details. <br /> <br /> There is nothing salvagable here. Good fans of "Blair Witch" Death are better after Daniel Myrick. Although his production is far from golden, it shows a better structure than Sánchez and some of Blair Witch's lessons (unfortunately weak stories but still).
