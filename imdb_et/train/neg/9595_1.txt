In the recent move to bring Asian movies to America, this is the last movie to be released here. As a big fan of all genres of Asian films, I browsed this network and found it to be released to the US market, so I decided to review it in time and rent it in a local video store. br /> <br /> Trust me ... the stages of action are incredibly disappointing, the tiger and the iron monkey catching this movie out of the water. Jet Li falls asleep looking at the sequences. If you're looking for martial arts entertainment, your time would be better with Jackie Chan's flick. <br /> <br /> Besides ... you think you look at martial arts around Girl died of her parents death. A good hour in the middle of this film is full of dialogue, a lack of action, a lack of intact tangent plot, pretty much nothing with the assumption that we encounter. It is more related to the relationship between him and the boy and his boyfriend with a conspiracy group, where the producer / director did not devote time to oblivion, but devoted some of the film that dragged the problem. Would it have been much better for them to cut and develop the story themselves through another film and focused on the martial arts aspect. <br /> <br /> Speaking of this, I really don't believe in the Iron Monkey choreographer, doing the Princess Blade action. I was completely offended by the frequent use of slow motion and a quick camera change to portray the physical speed of the killer. I just didn't buy it. <br /> <br /> Please ... I warn you not to waste your time / money on this movie. The prerequisite is intrigue and the trailer can tempt you, but I am positive that this film is not suitable for the public (perhaps in Japan, but not in the countries), and this is the worst film presented to the Asian film industry.
