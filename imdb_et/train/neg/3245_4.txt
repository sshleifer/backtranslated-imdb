David Mameti's film debut is a series of real-minded movies, a movie that puts you in doubt about everything and everything. I saw it for the first time recently and couldn't figure out what it should be so big. <br /> <br /> The film features Margaret, a female psychologist, who is also the best-selling author. Margaret is disappointed with her profession and the inability to really help anyone. He is trying to fix it by helping to solve his patient's gambling debt with Hail called Mike (Joe Mantegna, who is the only reason to watch this movie). He discovers that Mike is actually a professional confidence man when he almost falls victim to the fraud he immediately after his meeting. Interestingly, he returns to see him and asks him to show him how the artists work (he intends to use it as an object of a new book on psychology). He then falls to him and accompanies him for a long time, which he and his companions have created. <br /> <br /> I don't know the details, but at the end of the movie it turns out that the whole movie was complicated by Mike and his crowns to bring Margaret out of $ 80,000. <br /> <br /> First, the great turn to the end was very predictable. All the scenes in which male men acted were very obvious by staged actors and strange lines. Not only that, but the audience (and the main character) knows they're dealing with men, so it's really such a big surprise when we discover that Margaret has been herself? Moreover, Margaret is arguably an intelligent psychologist who is a human reading expert, but she promises to avoid too easily - and remember she knows well that Mike is an artist. <br /> <br Secondly, we believe Margaret had been connected from the start, but in order to work ultimately, he had to do a number of things that conmen could not have predicted. First, he had to decide to pay his patient's debt, allowing him to meet first. Had he not done so, the whole con would have failed. I just have to say that it is quite unreasonable to assume that the psychologist intends to take on the patient's gambling debt. Not only that, but what are the chances that men would be on the right spot at night when he decided to show? Did they just show this bar every night hoping they would come and see them? Another thing that had to happen was that it was impossible to predict that Margaret had to look at Mike again and ask her to teach her trade tricks. What are its probabilities? And yet this whole assumption is based on this assumption. <br /> <br /> Another problem I've had is the end. Margaret discovers that she is connected and decides to get hold of Mike. First of all, Mamet leads us to believe that he is going together, but it goes down, so the final ending is putting his Mike in the airport luggage area. Somehow it seemed just a cumbersome and uneven way to finish the film, talking about the artists moving in their trade. Not only that, but he didn't even take the money he stole from him. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the film will leave you blank and empty. And if you, like me, predicted that Margaret was going to be merged, you'll find the same dissatisfaction with this revelation.
