This is a very blurry and inert Shakespeare's most viable game. I can only guess that the intention was to make the game playable and understandable to an audience who hadn't been in contact with Shakespeare before. In doing so - although each line is clear and every intention is obvious - they have cleared the game of life and made it a smooth caricature. Somehow it's really boring - a very wonderful material that has such a wonderful material. <br /> <br /> The actor is at best forgotten - Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro. Others, however, do not value so well. April Shawnham's hero is a pouty, breathless head that often provokes prisoners. Jerry Mayer Don John is a nonsensical comedian at Snidely Whiplash level (although Snidley was much more enjoyable). <br /> <br /> F. Murray Abraham (you know, the man who killed Mozart?) Not in this version unless he was hidden and his name removed from the credits. <br /> <br /> Given that the manufacturer, Joseph Papp, is, in principle, a god of theater, this production is not only disappointing, but also head-scratching. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about it. Instead, look at Branagh's great Adot - his version is full of vitality and humor, saying something wonderful.
