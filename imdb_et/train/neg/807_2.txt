I didn't expect much of this TV movie. You need to set the bar lower than the dwarf limbo for any TBS movie that plays Antonio Sabat Jr. However, he was disappointed, even if it was not a good bad film. <br /> <br /> Each scene was rotating, as if someone scanned dozens of movies and TV shows on the script, about big business conspiracies, and said, "My job is done". It's all a clich√©, all predictable and even worse, that actors are forced to see how they take it seriously (even if the plot is ridiculous). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. See "X Files" if you are in a mood for paranoia. They do it better. Also, let someone know that sitting through a "deadly mistake" is just that.
