Fred I Ray is a sad director, even when the B-film directors go, but "Haunting Fear" is probably one of his best films. Yeah, it makes the butcher a great storefront "premature burying" and yes, it's badly afflicted and uneven, but it's also quite fun. Scream Queen Brinke Stevens is better than normal, a fragile housewife whose worthless husband (Jay Richardson) plans to take away with her because she needs money to pay for a gangster (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many of the early 90s, gives the film the best result as a slutty mistress. You also have the small roles played by Karen Black as a psychologist, Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Berryman in a nice time in a better scene. The end did not make sense!
