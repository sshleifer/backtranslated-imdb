If Mr Cranky had appreciated this, I would be tempted to simply copy my review and paste it here. But as he is not, I have to go to it myself. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives 0 to this movie 1 is that Malcolm McDowall works great. But not even he does not save this movie from disaster. The director must be really confused when he worked on it, because it is just a set of scenes that were thrown with a very little continuity that resembles a bad 70's movies. Worse still, both the actors and the directors showed that they were passing, which apparently showed how bad the original script was. <br /> <br /> The story is not even worth discussing, although it revolves around a futuristic company called Proxate Corporation, which brought together a team of insecure people to bring dangerous goods to Nigeria into an old container / slave ship. This ship's computer is a baby that is stored in a glass jar and connected to one team via USB 12 or other. The company should have been called a prostate corporation because the entertaining value of this film is equivalent to an exam of the same name. <br /> <br /> I can't honestly find one scene I can say was fine in the movie context. I only looked at it until I had a touch of avian flu and this film reminded me that there were people who were actually worse than me - especially Malcolm McDowall. I don't hold it against him because he's a great actor and every big actor has the right to have a bad movie in his career and it's a doosie. <br /> <br /> So if this is not the only movie store you rent or you are a man and you are not a doctor who does not do prostate research this week, and you feel this is a bad thing, give it one really wide Place, unless, of course, if you're really communal, buy a copy to support Malcolm and then use it as a beverage pack.
