I read foolishly back this year about the DVD cover about a year ago and said to myself: "It seems funny, plus is Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose!" I paid $ 15.99 plus tax. I took it over to a house of friends, and we both stood by how badly written and acted. Wooden performances are numerous. All the "fun" and "outstanding" performances that you promised never seemed to have come. After 90 minutes, I hung my head in shame knowing that I could never get back for 90 minutes or $ 15.99. I literally cried, because if it could be considered "comedy", I didn't want to believe in movies anymore. My friend and I constantly informed our movie about the horror of this movie so much that he had to see it to understand how bad it was. During this holiday season I watched it with him because he didn't want to see it alone. It was my next terrible mistake, because when I looked, I was just angry. I started shouting at the film and I'm not talking about the film period. Anyone I know has even seen this movie has agreed with this worst vision. My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends, but this movie couldn't even record. The fact that this film is not on the 100th lower IMDb list is amazing. The fact that his rating (at the time of writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
