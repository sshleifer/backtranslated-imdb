Good actors and good performances cannot hide the meaningless script, bad dialogue, and behavioral patterns that don't change anything you don't care about. The most interesting character is David Berkowitz. No character - no growth, no interest, but some suffering for some particular reason, without teaching us anything and not even entertainment.
