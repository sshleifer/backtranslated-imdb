Oliver Hardy wakes up with a ghost and soon learns that his uncle will come to see Ollie's new wife and baby. The problem is that they do not exist - Ollie apparently showed them up! So, it's within her and her husband's reach to find a child with a child who agrees to create her family. <br /> <br /> This is not a very unique story idea, as I have seen at least a few other quiet short short short short pants. The best of them was Bobby Vernon's NOT MY. It is much better than ONE TOO MANY - probably a big part of it was because it was done ten years later - when comedy became a bit more complicated and based on a less meaningful blow. Now, I'm not against physical comedy, but in some tiny movies, people who start firing wild with firearms, hit and strangle each other, and so on. Unfortunately, the end of ONE TOO MANY is just what they do. None of this makes sense, and it would be just like the story ends. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not a milestone in entertainment. It's not just enough to look at it if you're not an obsessive silent fan like me.
