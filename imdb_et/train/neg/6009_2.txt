What is it with the Americans and their religious gobbled-gook? To think that it was the best-selling novel, it's incredible, but really good action and scripting are needed to remove the movie. In this case, all good actors have gone to heaven and we will remain Kirk Cameron's CNN-type journalist (!) Who is trying to discover why many people are just lost. Oh yes, there is a sub-block of evil world conspiracy and famine, or something. The good news is that it is done so cheaply and with such a dialogue that it has all its unwanted laughter in its entertaining value. Not recommended for anyone with a three-digit IQ.
