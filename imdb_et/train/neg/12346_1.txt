The main prerequisite for this film is the political comic. I think those who do not know anything about the reality of the military are probably a "sensitive" film on gender equality. Indeed, the commentator recently said: "It allows women to know that they can do something they want to do." What a flap! No one, a man or a woman can do anything they want to do, and unfortunately Demi Moore "caches" to SEAL Hell Week at the beginning of 27 weeks in the BUD / S program with a few sessions at the local gym and his desire to be SEAL just doesn't do it. Supposedly, the most difficult military training program is about 80% of dropouts - those who voluntarily give up, are unable to compete on the physical level, often suffer physical injury during training, or fail to psychological harassment. I never reached the plethora of creative and supposed message of this film. In the real world, Demi would not last for the first 24 hours of this harsh and lasting physical exercise. Willingness alone does not. Leave this movie a pleasant way of thinking and spend more time reading the best description of what is actually going on in this training to read Dick Couch (Crown, New York 2001) "The Warrior Elite". Call at, Demi! <br /> <br />
