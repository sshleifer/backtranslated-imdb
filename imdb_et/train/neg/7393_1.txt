I'm a big Steven Seagal fan. Hell, I suppose I will weigh as much as he does, even though I don't have a street certificate for a sports car-moor-ponytail. Having expressed my bias and affection for the American nerve stage and the hero of the screen, I find it difficult to say that this is his worst film. I'm not sure he could make the film worse. <br /> <br /> In his defense, the major problems associated with this film appear in post-production. It is painfully clear that this film had to have a different story. This results in disgraceful calls, where Steve's voice is not synchronized with almost dubbed voice. Editing is a pee-hole, and generally it starts bad, gets even worse, and finally you want to have reviewed the Da Vinci code. Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> After that I don't know what to expect from Steve. My friends are laughing at me for listening to my CDs. Is it time to start checking out some Van Damme directly from a DVD nut tree? If you are tempted to watch this movie, hang your eyeballs and rinse them in the toilet. The life of darkness is better than 89 minutes.
