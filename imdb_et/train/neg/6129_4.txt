Judging from this movie and the same year made STRONG MAN, I wouldn't place Harry Langdon at the top of the list of big silent screen comedians. There just isn't enough. Perhaps he was developing his style but sabotaged himself by taking his first great achievements too seriously. In any case, all of his tricks resemble the bigger funny men, but he has no Keaton acrobatic skills and Lloyd's proud ingenuity. He also undermines his personality by dressing and walking like a Chaplin tramp. Her trademarks are childish innocence, craziness, and a tendency to respond to accidents when they see puzzles, face to face, or touch her lips to the tip of her forefinger. The comedy in Langdon's films stems from the fate that is present in his journey through various obstacles he seeks to overcome in naive or naive ways, or with minimal physicality, such as throwing stones at an approaching tornado to drive it, supporting a collapsing building with two or four or ignoring boulders, lifting boulders. so that they roll under him. In a story about a footwear artist's son who combines a competing company's footwear with an off-road football competition, he manages to win. There is nothing here that Big Three hasn't done much better.
