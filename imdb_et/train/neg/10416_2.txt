Before seeing this movie, I would have said that I loved everything Kathy Bates made. Now this is an all-minus one. James Woods is pathetic ... not his character, his acting. Someone should have told him that "poor" is not synthetic dirty or unknown or clich√©s. Ditto Randy for Quaid's stereotypes. The only redemption function is Henry Thomas, who is not a strong enough actor to carry this outraged confusion. If you enjoy the country, you enjoy the landscape. That's the best thing I can do. <br /> <br /> I'm a serious fan of both independent and original movies, but it's just terrible.
