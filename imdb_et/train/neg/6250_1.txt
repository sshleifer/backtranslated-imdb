I liked this exhibition once. This means that until I understand all of its errors. It is so unrealistic. I know it is a fiction, but it is not even the least believable. Here's why. ** People's Spoilers ... ** Should we really believe that like Yugi's boyfriend would come from Pharaoh of ancient Egypt? C'mon! He's the biggest nerd of the Earth's face. And what is Pharaoh's (Aemk's and / or Yami's) hair? Last time I checked that Pharaohs were shaved (except for a little head of hair) and wore fancy caps. , can legally manage a successful business, still having time to go to a tiny school, such as "Domino High"? Pooh-leeze! First of all, he must legally be an adult to run a business. And it would really make him too much of a boyfriend because he would be the only adult in his class. And secondly, why should he participate in a school like "Domino High" if his business is successful enough for him to participate in a fictional snob academy? In addition, his brother's side plots are so brave and flat. Every time you turn around, the kids are kidnapped by the gons. * Yawn * Something new, nothing new. <br /> <br /> Joey is a poor child living with a shameless father. He says Joey is making money for his entire school because his father is an alcoholic, but he never sees anything like work. He doesn't even mention the job. And his sister Serenity is a complete moor. Why would she have chosen such a beautiful type as Tristan to choose a duke (who dressed her brother with a dog costume and publicly humiliated on television)? Is he really so helpless? Different characters throughout the exhibition, getting into the demonic forces, will be demonized by their soul to steal their stolen and mental illness. (Oh, it's child-resistant, NO.) The way is a typical girl-woman type whose only purpose is to be a Yugi / Yami girlfriend. And although he has some cool points for him, he just doesn't have enough time to shine as the main character. <br /> <br /> Animation is just terrible. All characters look sick and anorexic. Perspectives are terrible (especially when they take close-ups of someone) and the colors look good, but not the stars. The Millennium Puzzle can send souls to your body. If so, how did he not save Yug's grandfather first when Pegasus stole his soul and saved himself from returning it? <br /> <br /> All this is commercial. The only plus half is "Yu-Gi-Oh: a demarcated series" by LittleKuriboh. <br /> <br /> Please. Do something worthwhile. Look, look at the Abridged version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
