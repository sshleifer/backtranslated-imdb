In the dark alone, Uwe Boll's strokes in nuts in Hollywood after Dead House of Dead. <br /> <br /> If this proves how much the Boll master manipulator is. After Artisan had died out of the House of the Dead, it could be assumed that Lion's Gate Films, which had traditionally been credible, freed AITD only under a contractual obligation after the acquisition of Artisan's assets. Because the AITD is an even greater example of the total absence of complete filmmaking ability, plot exposure, and simply conventional stealing from other films, as it was supposed to be cool instead of being installed in the film framework. But then that's the thing, isn't it. Boll doesn't try to make a single movie because he's not trying to drive alone in the dark. He just tries to manipulate Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Alone in the dark, like the House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne, and others 3 or 4 projects that are "announced" or "pre-produced". <br /> <br /> They are not aimed at films, but at investment portfolios, each of which is prone to production, claiming that the Boll Tax Act and its investors will be able to use it in the next two to three years, the more bombs it can release during this time, the more money and its investors will be able to. barely make a good movie, how bad a movie will make you a coin? The result is such films as horrible in the dark alone. <br /> <br /> Only in the dark, like all his films, is only the cynical exploitation of Hollywood's current smooth film making trend. /> <br /> And for those who support Boll by calling him wrong or the next Ed Wood, congratulations on making a cult picture out of a man, but just making it easier for him to get investors, but giving him a reputation. /> Read more here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&threadid = 21699 Leave aside just do not ask me how he can get his list together. If the participants are not in any way due to investment disruptions, this secret is still undiscovered.
