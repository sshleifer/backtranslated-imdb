So this guy named George sits alone on his birthday when two women appear. George's wife is in a hospital that takes care of her son, so when she's gone, George gets in the jacuzzi and loves both girls. It's not a big scene, because it really doesn't show anything. After that, the birthday party wakes up the next morning and the girls are still in their house. They make her a nice breakfast, but George is not hungry. George is not very happy and he is trying to ditch them, but when he comes home, the girls are still in his house. The girls have had enough with George and they don't want to eat them anymore. They both turn out to be bigger psychopaths and use George in their little madness game. I liked the girls doing just what they wanted and mixing George's house. George wasn't really that good for his two guests. When George said he was a married man, he didn't really feel that. George looked like Tom Tucker from Family Guy. I was two girls all the time.
