I was really looking forward to seeing Nana after seeing Renoir's amazing debut, Whirlpool of Fate. I had read that Nana was generally considered her best quiet film, so I had great hopes. Unfortunately, it seemed like a big step forward. <br /> <br /> Catherine Hessling is the main problem with this movie. His actor is up, except for the silent film. His behavior is rather similar to what one would expect in an early teenage film, not in the late 20th century. He usually has the same face that reminds me of constipation pains. It was also very difficult to believe that every person would fall on the femme fatale. There was nothing fascinating about him. <br /> <br /> The film was quite long, the camera's work was uninteresting (besides the horse race) and editing was boring. The story reminded me of Puskora's box. It is interesting to compare these two because there are only three years between these films. The Pandora Box simply resets every level where Nana fails. <br /> <br /> This movie is only for Renoir graduates or very serious silent movies.
