Okay, I really don't think anything worse than the PR series. There are many bad things in life ... fraudsters, liars, etc. But seriously, Power Rangers has a GOT to be at the bottom of this list. Do you mean something more stupid than five or six teenagers (who don't even act as a regular teenager) dancing in a different costume with a different color so you can talk to them? Fans, have you ever met a real person who gets into a mental wall and rises almost immediately and continues to fight without injury? Power Rangers are for five-year-old boys and believe me, I didn't like this show even when I was five years old. <br /> <br /> I think Dino Thunder is an exception. Teenagers like teenagers, and Tommy Oliver actually works as a teacher or not. This is teen-humor, although the fight is flat, I don't hate Dino Thunder. <br /> <br /> Many people say Power Rangers are crap, but I wouldn't. That would be an insult to the devil. So on the face, five years old guys, Power Rangers are garbage.
