This is exactly the kind of film that most disturbs me. Great cast, great director, great story, they all destroy a scenario that goes somewhere ... and doesn't say anything while you are there! There is no depth here. There is no depth of characters, depth of plot, depth of surprise, tension or common sense. We know what's happening, telling us how they are going to solve the problem, solve the problem, throw us a surprise near the tip that can't create tension, then they stop the movie sharply. Destroyed opportunity. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Glenn Ford leads the UK (and one French) actor who is all fantastic, wrongly doing an incredibly impressive work on one-dimensional writing. One of the absolute favorites is Herbert Walton as "old Charlie", who offers exciting humor and warmth to the dark and serious film. I also thought that the film had this great look ... all the shadows and fog ... very much the film's noir. <br /> <br /> While actors do the best they can, and management is enjoyable, it's still not enough to recommend watching the movie. There are much better Glenn Ford movies: The Big Heat, Gilda, Affair Trinidad, etc.
