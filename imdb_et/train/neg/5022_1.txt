Oh dear, this film was bad for various reasons. I had been waiting for a very small score for this film and was surprised by the overall score. Sorry, but to evaluate it, like many, it's a joke! When you get a single picture / monochrome movie trick that was a nice idea, the movie even drags a 66-minute drive. The credit order at the beginning was so annoying at the age of the boys wearing a flat tire and changing the wheel that was needed! How slow were the guys hooked up with Campbell and actually led? They didn't seem to bother him ... sigh ... I'm just too glad to get it free with the special edition of Evil Dead!
