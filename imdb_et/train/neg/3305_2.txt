I don't see what is funny in this movie. Humor seems to be meant for corpses. It's slow. The story is too easy to be true. Characters do not create much sympathy, some not important characters aside. Nothing surprising happens. What did the writers of this script think? "Oooo funny! Let's make some old ladies high in the pot! Let's do them ... we strangle! Let's do them ... we act like kids! Oooo, yes, it's totally brilliant and original!" <br /> <br /> This movie has been upset by films for the last five years.
