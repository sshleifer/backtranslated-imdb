I found it a real task to sit through this movie. The sound track was not the best, and some accents made it harder to say what was said. There was little to move the plot, and often the action stopped and there was a long-term conversation that seemed to be next to the film. These conversations were exchanged between the family groups, and the observer tried and united what the common thread had to do with them. It is rare to appreciate the movie as low and do it in that case, because the whole viewing experience leaves me with the idea of ​​"so what" and "why did I waste it at the time."
