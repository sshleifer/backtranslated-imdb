The previous poster has obviously worked on the film. This is a joke about how bad it is, and no one would look at such a movie as he did. The mention of the names of all the actors and what they used to be is a sure sign that he is in some way involved. <Br>> <br /> It is now in Cinemax, and I was sure it was a movie where porn stars (Ava's name is proud and blessed) were forced to do something else for a mad tax reason. <br /> <br /> When I first saw it, I was sure it was done around 1986 and was born in '73, so I thought I knew what I was talking about ... but not .. It was done in 1993 !! Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> Although I would call it one of those bad ones, there are good movies. Like watching a train break.
