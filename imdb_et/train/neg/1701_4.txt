David Lynch's crude and smartly taken South Park presents us with a nightmare about disturbing clich√©s about suburban middle-class families. The father is a nervous monster with teeth and a disproportionately large round mouth, spoken of by the most terrible thunderings, son and mother are permanently frightened, inconsistent beings to whom terror is a lifestyle. Several equally absurd characters are used throughout the series. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not famous for his comedies (ie air, nature and heart) and I am not particularly fond of comedies in general. There were, however, a few scenes in Dumbland that made me laugh out loud. There are some smart animated cinematic bits in which Lynch transmits a wide range of responses to his characters, using syntactic arrangements in frames, not facial expressions (which never differs in Dumbland). <br /> <br /> I believe Lynch really tried to give his audience direct, as annoying, animated comedy. Interestingly, he decided to follow the footsteps of the latest ultra-low eyebrow (ie most Will Farrell films) while adding witchcraft social criticism and classic comic strips of elements and brand humor. Although the mix does not work very well here, it is nothing if not Lynchian. <br /> <br /> Lynch fans are worth it.
