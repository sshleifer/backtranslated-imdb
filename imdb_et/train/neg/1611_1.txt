I think it's a terrible film produced and directed. Benicio Del Toro should not work on film production, he should emphasize his behavior and that is the case. Steven Soderbergh missed the revolution, the ideas and the life of Che Guevara and other important ideas. The camera is terrible, like someone with 2-day work experience, taking pictures of it, music is ... I don't know if there is music in the movie ???? I don't recommend this piece to anyone. It just wastes about 4 hours in front of the TV or any .... I can't figure out how anyone will rate this movie for more than 3 stars. DISASTER .... DISASTER .... DISASTER .... DISASTER Don't look please. Save yourself from this "movie" misery
