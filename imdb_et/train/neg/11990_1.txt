I wish I could reset this movie. Cheesy effects and action. The only reason to see this movie is to see how bad it is. Let's start with a child playing Brian. What a geek! I couldn't believe the mullet! Then he spoke to himself. I guess they couldn't just keep the movie silent, but still. Of course, they had to harden him, not something I wanted to see. However, Jared gave excellent results compared to the special effects department. Everything between the bear and the crash was something I could do for myself and better. I seriously doubt that Gary Paulsen had nothing to do with production because the film was not even called Hatchet. Finally, I don't think the writer would ever read the book, seeing that nothing was the same. I think this book was great, but this movie collided like a stinky goat!
