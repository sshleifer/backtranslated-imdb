This movie offers nothing to anyone. It does not succeed at any level. Action is a terrible, boring longing. Of course, they tried to be shocking by the length of the sexual scene, but it was just that the purpose of the film was just a parody. Complete garbage, I can't believe what this ridiculous movie was like. <br /> <br /> And I'm very sure Rosario Dawson got into this movie because he would be if it were his jarring to break the indi hit who is the NC-17 movie. The problem is not that adults stick to this movie because the movie plays like an interesting episode of OC or something that is aimed at teenagers. Pathetic.
