Well, if you like pop / punk, punk, ska, and a bit of modern psycho-billy, seeing live shows is the only thing to look at. This movie has tons and tons of band cameos with President Troma, Lloyd Kaufman as a half-big role, and lots of silly death scenes. It looks like it may be good, right? Well, deaths continue and repeatedly to many Warp Tour and band fans. Some deaths are stylish, but then they recycle time and again, to a point that is completely repetitive. Almost everyone dies when the head is broken, or the intestines are pulled out of the stomach. Gore looks like Andreas Schnaas' "Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence"; it is "water soaked in water", but now that the film is really decent and gives humor something that this film is terribly deficient. Of course, the film has been made by Doug Sakmann from Trom, has a great low budget potential and it is trying ... but just too hard. Everything is too funny for this movie and that's what puts it down. Everybody is trying to be too comical and silly, using deliberate bad behavior, excessive use of meaningless deaths and the same way ... over and over again. It is basically "Mulva: Zombie Ass-Kicker", "Chairman of the Board" or any movie you've done with your friends: it's funny for those who did it, and that's it. <br /> <br /> Great potential, great idea, great use of effects - but it's the same thing ... over and over: the band plays, the band dies, fans die. Everyone dies, blood is sprayed everywhere, the process is repeated. <br /> <br /> The question is about those movie types that are basically "bad strokes" - are they trying too hard or not at all?
