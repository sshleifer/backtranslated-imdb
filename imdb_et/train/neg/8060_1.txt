What a bad, bad movie! I tried to watch without fast transmission ... It failed. After about 30 minutes I stopped the movie, went online to see how many minutes this disaster was. (84 minutes only, Whew!) It was a confusing, boring film. I don't think anybody can hit a hit if you hit a fluorescent lamp that is much less gutted! One funny thing is that I watched the movie "Killer Cut". The box says boldly: "More blood!" "More sex!" "More terror than a theater release!" Yikes! If this movie was terrible with all these claims, I wonder how "UN-Killer Cut" was ??? If you want to see the living world and the dead world of the clock, then any night of living dead series!
