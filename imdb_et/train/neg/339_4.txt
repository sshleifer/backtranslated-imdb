Unlike "Buckaroo Banzai adventures" or "Big Trouble Little China" or "Conan Barbarian", which are terrible films with a certain coolness and self-respecting humor that makes them a cultural sense, is a Golden Child. Just bad. <br /> <br /> The assumption itself is not feasible and there are some funny moments. But here's Eddy Murphy's "flip attitude" just captures any tension or threat of feeling in the story. And the special effects are foolish to hurt this tension. The "mysterious secrets" of Tibetan Buddhism are rather broken rather than forced. <br /> <br /> Without the feeling that something is at stake or the characters are facing a real threat, why should we care? br /> <br /> Who should see this movie: <br /> <br /> Eddy Murphy's big fans who can't help themselves <br /> <br /> - I don't think anyone else br /> <br /> I give this movie out of 10 out of 4 that happened to be a random joke.
