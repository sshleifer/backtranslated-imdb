NATURAL BORN KILLERS (1994) <br /> <br /> Cinema Cut: R <br /> <br /> Director Cut: NC-17 <br /> <br /> This is an unusual Oliver Stone image, but when I I read that he was using drugs while filming, I didn't need any further explanation. "Naturally born killers" are risky, crazy, all filming that we don't get very often; strange, psychotic, artistic pictures. <br /> <br /> "Natural Born Killers" is basically the story of how the two massacres were distributed and respected by the media; There's a big scene where the interviewer asks some teenagers about Mickey and Mallory, and the teenager says, "Murder is wrong .... but if I was a mass murderer, I'd be Mickey and Mallory." Mickey describes it as "Frankenstein (monster) and dr. With Frankenstein - Dr. Frankenstein is a media who has made these monsters killers. <br /> <br /> Most of Oliver Stone's films explore their mistakes. America, a country that the director loves and admires. I think "natural born killers" are the influence of mass media, technology and nationality, Americans (and most of the world) on things like massacres and strange situations. <br /> <br /> The killers killed by Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) are astonishingly performing two wonderful actresses who enter into two interestingly brutal killers. Mickey and Mallory believe that some people deserve to be killed, perhaps from the brutal theory of social darwinism (the strongest survival) - Mickey says in his interview in jail that other species are murdering, as people destroy other species and use other species. environment; The script is interesting, but it is questionable how much this film extends, in the sense that we think about society and human behavior, not the intensity of the 2-hour blood flow we've seen. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the movie takes place in the maximum security prison; we see the harsh realities of prison life; caregiver attitude, etc .; Prison Overcrowding - Perhaps Stone will doubt in the future, at the head of society. <br /> <br /> Two other interesting characters; First of all, a reporter who heads an exhibition on "American Maniac" and is committed to raising ratings that he goes to any length to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory. The other is a cop Scagnet, a crazy, maybe sadistic officer who is in love with Mallory - he also has a strange obsession with massacres because his mother was killed while Charles Whitman made a massacre in Waco in Texas. <br /> Cinematography is great; different colors, shadows, styles create a sense of disorientation; The most obvious green color is green, recalling the disease of the killers (in a pharmacy when they are looking for a rattlesnake antidote). <br /> <br /> The camera is crazy; trembling, buzzy, it takes some determination to use it and receive it. Very unusual, psychedelic and unusual. <br /> <br /> "Naturally born killers" are not glamorous mad murderers, it doubts and how we publicize this attribute fuel ... <br /> Although the above review sounds quite positive, did not like the film . Quentin Tarantino, who initially wrote the script for the film, was not happy with the changed scenario and asked to remove his name. I see why. While a bit interesting is sometimes the natural born killers of image confusion. <br /> <br /> 4/10
