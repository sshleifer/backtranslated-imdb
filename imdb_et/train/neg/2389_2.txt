Uma Thurman plays a young woman whose gypsy spirit (and freakishly big thumbs) is traveling with traveling people, eventually finding their true place in the knights' group dedicated to the conservation of the horse screen; Rain (bow) Phoenix is ​​their lesbian leader Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissy, thumbs or not. Gus Van Sant directed and adapted Tom Robbins' book, but his satire has no main target and just scissors across the card, like Sissy (maybe it was his goal, but it's not included in the audience). The notorious box-office flop was not as much ignored as it was, and it is possible to understand why: it is a series of schemes for searching schemes, performances, director's touches and cinematography are all changing. Thurman is a pitch that stays on the road, trying to drive, but it put a plaster on Phoenix's career. Writer Buck Henry (who did not write it, but perhaps it should have) gives the most reliable results as a doctor who works on one of these thumbs. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
