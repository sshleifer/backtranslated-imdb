If you are a person who gets out of a very bad movie, I highly recommend it. If you are not, stay away. This is an amazingly cheap look, and sometimes you may wonder if it's not just a prank that pulls you. The most positive comment I can make about this is that responsible people seemed to realize that it was a super-low budget mess, so here's at least a fun feeling. <br /> <br /> But it's as amateurish as it gets. Their idea of ​​giant murderers is just boys covered with beige colored leaves that look like garbage can cover their heads. This is obviously not meant to be serious (at least to say), but even if you give up that responsibility you will find yourself shaking your head in almost all-powerful fatigue. Or often laughing as I did.
