Which absolute pile of pants. Having read Chris Brookmyre's books religiously, as I found "Quite Ugly ...", I was glad I learned that this drama was ordered. <br /> <br /> I probably had too much faith. <br /> <br /> Nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show - and even he doesn't fit. How anyone can read a book and then adjust it to a shiny piece is behind me. <br /> <br /> All the characters are changed, the situation has dropped and you see the dramatic breakup of Parlablane by Nesbitt, making it a quick chin and slipping open the cool window ... it brought tears into my eyes. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid to think about what happens to "blind countries" when it's a benchmark ... <br /> <br /> Please avoid this ...
