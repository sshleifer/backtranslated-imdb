Not that he cares, but I'm not Simon Pegg's friends. If I were, we would have a good chance if he continued to make such a thrill. The problem is that he found a successful formula, such as a worshiping, ordinary man-door-type type in Shawn of the Dead, run Fat Boy Run, etc., but it starts to wear thin. There are no characteristic features here, he is rude and unpleasant, and he thinks he's funny when he is not honest. When he is transferred from London to New York (and I assume that this link is meant to turn to observers on both sides of the Atlantic) he will prove equally to his new colleagues. But it is no surprise that, in his joyful jazz, he hires a transvestite stripper to revenge his superior at revenge. However, Kirsten Dunst will somehow warm him up, though he did nothing good. Oh, and because he's a superficial man, he falls to Megan Fox at first glance, because his character is as low as him. All of this makes a summary of the projected movie, although I don't see any viewers who would reflect how it reflected their lives. It is a shame that it is on paper that it is supposed to be worth looking at. But Pegg is playing himself, Kirsten Dunst just seems to be moving, but he doesn't produce chemistry and Megan Fox isn't stretched at all. One big plus is Miriam Margolyes, like Peggi's New York Country House - now that she'd been on the screen for longer .....
