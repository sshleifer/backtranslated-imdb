*** Possible plot spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I adore Dennis Hopper. I ask why he accepted the role of a police detective in a land that was common in 2000. \ t This movie sucks and I'll tell you why. <br /> <br /> This is a small town that will enter into the sport. One hook: The murderer is open and it's bad for business. The mayor concludes Irish Mobi to find the killer and make sure he doesn't do it in court. Det. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He wants this guy to try, but he's level and believes in the system. He wants to see that the system works. <br /> <br /> It could have been pretty good. It could have been riveting. It was terrible. First, they mark this guy with Serial Killer. Err no. There are specific criteria and none of them fit here. The bad guy has killed 5 children the first day and I think it was the other day. This whole movie lasts for 48 hours. I do not care about what twisted motifs will give him, Serial Killers will do their actions for a long time. They just haven't suddenly killed 7 children in two days. It's cheerful. <br /> <br /> Ok, the annoying omission was terrible. The only name here was Hopper, and he's the only one who even came close to drawing his share. Unfortunately, he's got me type-approved and I think he's doing a lot of much better psychological parts. It just wasn't a good vehicle for Hopper. It did not allow him to do what he does best, which is all horrible. It's not that he did bad, that is, I saw him so much better. <br /> <br /> The Irish mob man, Johnny Gault (Tom McCamus - a long day's journey to the night) who is responsible for their investigation is a little upper rigid. Inconsistency? Not quite. He tries to play a cold, hard guy and he does it so that the character is just wooden. Max. He didn't scare me. He didn't inspire emotions at all, except boredom. I can't tell you how many times I checked to see how much longer this movie ended. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that he had a sense of TV. You know what I mean. Bad product values, low budget, reuse of scenes for cost recovery. Just eh. Yanno? But I feel that comparing it is an insult to them. <br /> <br /> Derek Vanlin was both the director and the operator of this project. He shifted more than he chewed. I can't feel that Hopper sees this role as a friendly benefit. This is the only rational thing I can come up with. It was Vanlind's first job as director, the third as the operator. Hopefully it was a learning experience for him. <br /> <br /> I will not destroy the end if you decide to torture yourself, but I want to say that they all dropped the ball here. .. if the hopper. In a scene that would have been emotionally intestinal for the detective, it was just ... well ... blah. I didn't even see what would accompany this shift. Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> This 100-minute long and rated R for violence and language. No child under the age of 13 wants to look at it, so don't worry about it. It doesn't suit anyone anyway. heh. <br /> <br /> Leave it out. You thank me later.
