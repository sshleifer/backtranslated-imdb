The idea behind Wolfe's original novel - indeed the whole story - is that things happen carefully because of a sense of expediency. The goal is to survive within a certain lifestyle. The novel is full of trouble. The only relationship that is emotionally true is between Sherman and his daughter Campbell, and that only concerns. This sets aside everything that it receives by publicity, power, money or self-expression. <br /> <br /> Wolfe was criticized for having hit every head and social segment of New York. . His answer was denial. After all, he lived in New York himself and belonged to the Neighborhood Correction Committee and other admirable organizations, exactly the qualifications he would like to deny when he restarted, that he did not like New Yorker. (Wolfe has a PhD in American Studies from Yale and it is not apparent.) These hypothetical weaknesses are what made the novel memorable. No one was good. And Sherman McCoy interrupted, a professional protester for social justice. The film casts it all off and puts a story that just doesn't fit. Wolfe did her homework. The novel really comes from. Each event was not only possible, but also completely credible. Wolfe could have made a great cultural anthropologist - he knows how to enter the system and save the details. <br /> <br /> Yes, none of us could find ourselves like Sherman and his lover. South Bronx, threatened by a couple of black children, and escaping after escaping one. This scene is properly applied from printing to cellulose. <br /> <br /> But after this scene, the film does not seem to have the confidence of its audience, and sometimes it becomes foolish to refine your message, but the message is unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Sherman may accidentally hit a child and was arrested for being in a novel, but he would not return to his phenomenally expensive apartment immediately after he was released from prison, take out a shotgun, and start shooting the ceiling, as he does the transfer. What should be a funny scene, stretches the ceiling plaster all over the party's guests and they scream away, shining. It just wouldn't have happened. The film has left the novel explicitly in the dust of detailed reality. Wolfe's sensitivity, the work she put into actual occupation, is gone. Instead, it is a noisy, fantastic and silly scene that does nothing but wake the audience. Similar empty scenes are watching out for Wolfe verisimilitude. <br /> <br /> The film also fails because it draws a lot of sin and redemption into an entertaining story of moral nihilism. Here we see the opera "Don Hell in Hell". We get lectures on redemption from the poet with AID. We see a lot of guilt at Sherman. A black judge who preaches the bench and gives one of these last speeches about how we all begin to act again. A reporter who knows Sherman after he has sacrificed a sheep. And a happy ending, where Sherman begins to break the law with an idiotic laugh. The scene sits on a film like a circus elephant's head. <br /> <br /> Not only are the thin and unreliable points in the movie, but they are overestimated as if the audience would not be able to absorb any nuances. <br /> <br /> The direction that is bad. The film is not bad in this respect. Photography is also pretty good, including two quite remarkable shots - the Chrysler building strainers and the Concorde landing. This is a script that is thoroughly botched. <br /> <br /> The first part of the movie is about concept and implementation. This keeps some small details of the novel. Sherman and Judy are named Marshall. Who the hell is called dog Marshall? It loses its focus almost entirely on the other side and as a whole is hardly worth watching. <br /> <br /> Wolfe's cynical redhead right-wing may be offensive to many people, but he has coyons to make him understand. Unfortunately, the authors and producers did not have the courage to take them and thus blew up an exciting study of the New York City.
