Possible spoilers. I have to say "Cinderella II: Dreams Come True" is one of the worst movies. First, the film was made during the height of Disney's request. It was created at the same time as "Little Mermaid II", "Jungle Book II" and "Peter Pan II", all of which were their original film classics. (Disney also made "Notre Dame II hunchback" and "Atlantis II", but I'm going to get out of this topic because their original movies were never classic. " I absolutely adore the original Disney's "Cinderella." The "Cinderella" was a waste of time, however. Cinderella characterization was so different from the original girl, I grew up to look, originally was Cinderella's kind and loving, the new Cinderella was very characteristic moments with the wording of the present era: " I make this solemn way! "You say that the new Cinderella (as I call her tenderly) says" Ewww! "This is the Cinderella, I try to find the people the best, but as another successor is Anastasia, one of the stepped, which is good! Heck? Why? They did everything to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella is just a terrible family member with a bad little Anasta pig. le the original "Cinderella" when making a stage? It doesn't seem that way. When I remember correctly, Anastasia Cinderella, like Drizella and Lady Tremaine, was just as abusive. I am all for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no redemption in Anastasia. The first one was Anastasia evil. The other is good. One cannot leave such a story. I hope Disney realizes that this movie, among other films, shames Walt Disney's name. Maybe now that Michael Eisner is gone, things are starting to transform the mouse house.
