This film was probably the biggest waste of my life. Operation was pathetic. Jordan Hinson couldn't show any disturbing emotions. At the beginning of the movie he had to be discouraged. Instead, he snapped his head with his head. She sniffed ruthlessly for a tear-crying scene. I was almost angry that all the girls who wanted to be actors had to take him out. All others suffered too much action. It was flat, annoying. It was also an insult to the painters. Jordan took a month to train, and they put him on the Olympic Games. It is practically spitting on the efforts that actual Rarrists put into their work. An unfortunate apology for the movie and a bad attempt to associate hockey and skating. Don't waste your life. It doesn't even deserve one star.
