Obviously, the life of a kibbutz was seen <br /> <br /> This film is a less cultural story about the boy's life in a bitch, but the deliberate demonization of bitter life in general. In the first two minutes of the film, the milk responsible for the cows is wasting one of its calves. And all this is downhill in the character of the "kibbutznikim" character. In addition to the two main characters, a clinically depressed woman and her young son, every one of them has a rugged caricature well evil. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on how the bitch, like a cult, slowly pulls her mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows. There is no happiness, joy, laughter in this bunny. Every character / situation is a different fearsome human vice like misogyny, hypocrisy, violence, culture, repression, and so on. For example, if the main character is a surprisingly beautiful 12-year-old boy? his older brother is a typical kibbutz young man with his "Jewish" physical appearance and brutal personality. He cares more about the volunteers of aliens than the health of a dying mother. He treats these volunteers like a trash. After his little brother wanted to visit him in his dying mother, whom he hasn't seen for a long time due to his military service, he orders, quotes? "Linda, go to the shower and I'll cum for two minutes." <br /> <br /> Is there another "good" character in this movie? European alien playing with mother boy. When an animal robber tries to hit his mother's son, the boy protects him by breaking the hand of the rapist. All in all, he is thrown out of the cyborg for "violent" behavior against one of the bitches. More hypocrisy: An indescribably annoying French woman playing a school teacher declares that sex cannot happen before the age of 18 or without love and gives an overview of the actual activity that should be humorous to the audience, but is really stupid. Of course, the kibbutz will screw the head in the fields, which then turn the mother of a little boy when his mental health gets worse. <br /> <br /> The film depicts a bit like a cult. Children get out of bed in the middle of the night and take a ritual where they swear by affection in the areas the parents watch. The mother probably cannot escape the quibble, although in fact, everyone was always free and free to choose. It's a mystery how the boy's father died, but you can be sure the bitch "drove him" and his surviving parents are another heartless and sad person who is considering his mother and his son. <br /> <br /> This is the content of this movie. One-dimensional characters, dramatizing, dry performance, and a cunning message that is trying to capture the audience? this kibbutz life was humiliating, unhappy and even deadly for those who didn't fit. I'm sorry for the movie that made this movie? apparently he had a bad experience in kibbutz. But I feel like he's taken some kernels of truth about life and made them into huge atomic stereotypical bombs.
