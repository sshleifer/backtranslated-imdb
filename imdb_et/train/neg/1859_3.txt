Boy this movie I was stupid. I honestly thought it would be a scary horror movie with no humor, a boy who got a cold shoulder at that time. This movie was and I'm honest, pretty fucking good. It wasn't at all terrifying, but campiness and clever humor mad this movie very interesting. Some of the terrible and clich√© killings were so painful to watch, I almost laughed at how bad it was, but I enjoyed it somewhat. All killings concern snowboards and Christmas, which made things more interesting. The corners of the POV camera were fantastic. Later he resurrected in the same chemical composition where the snow is mixed. These were the ingredients that were chosen to make the perfect killer snowier. He, as a revenge, like a snowman, receives a police officer who convicted him. I'm saying I'm quite disappointed that this movie wasn't a horror, but actually a dark sitcom. They had a good story with a good plot but it wasn't right. All in all, I like the beginning of the movie, but now it's very annoying. But this film is better and darker than the sequel.
