Let me start by saying that I didn't look at this movie initially with great expectations. This was recommended by a mediocre friend in films and "MTV" stuck to the front cover so I didn't expect much. I was waiting for a tear-jerker that was too dramatic, but at least effective. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me start by never reading a book or watching other versions of the movie. <br /> <br /> The exhibition was my main thrilling film. It is FULL by God. The main girl is pretty mediocre, but she's Maryl Streep compared to the rest. The main "hero", Heath, is just terrible. She can sing decent clich√© songs, but that's it. His actions broke the "sad" moments, being so bad on the points that I just laughed at. The Isabel girl was also pretty godawious and the brother was just a flat character played by an actor who couldn't show emotional display. And when he tried it, he failed. For them, Patrick Harris was the only decent actor who played Edward, though it is obvious that the direction was bad because he didn't even live what I saw him. Oh, and my father wasn't half-bad in my memory, but he had so little time in the movie that I hardly remember. <br /> <br /> The story itself was not very good. More interruptions than you can imagine. Predictable story (to the end I hardly understood). Extremely one-sided characters with no real depth ... Generally, it is simply not interesting or convincing, something we have never seen before is much better and nothing worth it here. <br /> <br /> The end is supposed to be a tear. It did nothing like that. The end isn't built up at all, it looks almost like an afterthought. In fact, I had to ask my friends WHY this ending really happened, which, when they explained to me, I had to see my face "Wait when did they say that? What?". Never a good sign. Editing was probably the worst thing I saw, though I understand that fade-ins-fade-out has been done because it was originally made for television, but it's not really an excuse. <br /> <br /> In general, film is just a garbage. I'm a sensitive man, I called Simpson during two episodes. I did not cry during this mess, not even close. Really, this movie is not worth your time. If you really want to see tears elsewhere.
