I really wanted this western world, being a fan of the genre and a fan of "Buffalo Bill", "Wild Bill Hickok" and "Calamity Jane", all in this story! Add Gary Cooper as the lead actor and it sounded good. <br /> <br /> The problem was ..... it wasn't. I found myself watching my watch after 40 minutes, being dead. Jean Arthur's character was somewhat annoying and James Ellison just didn't look or act like "Buffalo Bill". Cooper wasn't his best, sounding too clean. It was several years before she hit her as the main actor. <br /> <br /> In short, his west shot shot empty. Head forward and look at another oater, as most of them were much better.
