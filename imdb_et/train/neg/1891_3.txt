A documentary about the Nazi Persians who make a tricky movement of huge mountains to get their herds of grass. Watching this quiet, black and white feature, which is partly reminiscent of the twink-twink-twink Oriental music score that cannot be used in the original exhibition is even duller. The small monochrome display has lost a prominent landscape and the creation of any plot line has been completely unsuccessful. I loved the Nanook from the bottom of the penguin and from March, but I tried this movie despite the similarity of the subject. Physical difficulties alone are not just as interesting.
