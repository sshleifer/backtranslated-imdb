This version is likely to be available on your local dollar store DVD. The print is neither big nor sound, but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 minutes, you can get the money (which doesn't speak terribly). Anna Neagle is an extreme coat of arms like Nanette. Whatever his charms might have returned, they are not obvious in this film. This film shows a large number of fine character actors (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the material remains considerably shorter in their talents. However, it is interesting to see how such achieved performers benefit most from the weakest publishing. Musical numbers (really only two) are quite terrible. It is clear that the studio did not feel forced to cash in on the rich musicality of the original "No, No, Nanette". What's worth, the DVD can be $ 1.00. It is worth saying so much that you have seen it.
