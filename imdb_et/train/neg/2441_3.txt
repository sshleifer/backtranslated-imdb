I thought "intensive care" was pretty bad and very inadvertently funny. But at least not as bad as I thought it might be. Sometimes it is somewhat tense, but never a good shocker. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD <br /> <br /> Fun is in ridiculous moments. But all the time the classic moment is: Peter (Koen Wauters) has killed and beaten the killer. It lies in the corner of the corridor. Amy (Nada van Nie) kneels next to her and asks, "Poor Peter, can I help you?". <br /> <br /> This movie is filmed in Dutch and English. To cover costs, all the license plates are in the US and the news studio background is the Manhattan silhouette. Very funny when you are Dutch and look at the original version in Dutch.
