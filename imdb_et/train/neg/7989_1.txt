I had great expectations after "My beautiful laundry", "Bend it like Beckham" and (less) "East is East". The history of British Asians, suitable for their home, has had a lot of good drinks on the big screen and a number of great TV shows and radio shows (Goodness gracious me, etc.). It coincides. Despite being a good start, it quickly fell on the hill. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it was a terrible typical BBC effort, combined with a strong regional accent, dirty overplaying characters, "they were worthy of the day" soundtrack and many "questions". <br /> <br /> I found many points during this movie. Writing is predictable. All possible clichés were pulled out and vented. In fact, I find it difficult to think of intercultural / intergenerational equipment that could have been used. The characters were thin and cliched: an eccentric non-conformist minister; a good meaning, but finally a racist old woman; predominance, overweight aunt; Parents from India; working group neighbor; "smart" deep granny; motorcycle riding. The script was weak, with every opportunity to shock the audience with a clear racist dialogue of two dimensional racist white characters. And why it had to be set in the 70's (after the 70's soundtrack excuse) is a mystery. Perhaps his incredible signs are somewhat more plausible for people born in 1979. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Even these things have been neglected, good action could have honored it for understandable ambiguity. Instead, the usual "BBC comedy" suspects are on the wheel. "Bend it like Beckham" was a much better comic act (and serious action actually) than it was practically unknown cast. <br /> <br /> All in all, the lazy cliché script that was in the twilight predicted story. Give it away. <br /> <br />
