I must honestly say that I couldn't start the second time watching this movie. Just how bad it was !!! This is just like drying out the paint but more confusing. I mean, you sit there and just wait for something to happen, something really, preferably something that makes the whole movie meaningful! At the end of the movie, I was actually wondering if there was any chance that I could forget the first hour that explained everything or whether I could inadvertently fall out of the movie and leave some of the plot glued (if there was actually one)! The main thing that really shuffled me in this movie is the main girl soon (if it was really the main girl) in some sort of alternative reality, I mean what hell was in that place? Suddenly he woke up and was at the mental institute, chained to the bed treated by the doctor, then faster than it would have taken me to cut his wrists, he turned back and he could eat some random vampires that didn't make any sense! I'm tempted by email makers and claim my time back, I mean I waste 2 hours of my life watching this garbage! I am interested to know if the filmmakers themselves really knew what it was all about! it just seemed like someone had changed all the bits that would have made sense even though I think the movie should have been 4 hours long for it to happen! I fully support the other person who wrote the second review, I was the title of this movie and it was alone. I'm just so grateful that I didn't actually buy a movie, no matter how many times I saw it in a local nail shop. You should have thought you would have given me the idea that the movie was a full set of steaming garbage, but frankly I think 1 pound was too much money to spend on this movie !!!! what a terrible waste of time and a good razor blade, i mean i want the OD'ed to be less painful than watching this movie !!
