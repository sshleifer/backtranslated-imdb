First up this movie, according to the slick, said he won the "best film" at "Worldfest" film festival in Houston, Texas. Hmmm must be a quiet year. <br /> <br /> It would never be called the worst movie, but it definitely sucks, it's just as terrible as the other Aussie B-Class Body Melt, but at least the movie didn't look like it was 8 video. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, filmmakers, watching a lot of Troma movies and really bad B-class gore movies, thought they could break. Don't get me wrong, I love movies of a very lower quality, Just the fact that some characters putting counterfeit American accents almost like it would give them more opportunities to sell it in countries or something. A really disappointing end result could have been much more exciting and some good fighting scenes. You can fully see that filmmakers are trying to copy a "bad taste", a car explosion, a rocket launcher and an infinite number of people, but there is no ultimate humor or style like "bad" taste in the finals. <br /> <br /> If you really like watching bad gore movies or you're interested in making non-budget movies, look at it, otherwise stay away.
