This is undoubtedly one of the worst films EVER, I emphasize, EVER did. Worse still, my old hero, Dolph, is in it and he's in the lead. Jesus ... The story is actually pretty good, but how it was done hurt my body. Fighting scenes for starters is about as good as choreography as a fight between two drunks sliding it out of the casing. Except for Dolph, who also suck, the actors are so bad that you can't help but don't know if they're all because they're all friends of the director who, by the way, are usually missing, if not all the time. This is a $ 12 million spent unimaginably, because the impact and the appearance of the landscape can not cost a cents greater than 1000.
