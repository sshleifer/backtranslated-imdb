Now I am a lover of the B-film genre, but it offends me in the trash. First of all, the film is played by Lizzy McGuire's brother as a tedious little child who is looking for his missing 3-legged dog. Please, please, what stupid ass mistake for a three legged dog to god damn mutated crocodile please? And he is another reason why they show that Dinocroc is huge and actually in the water on the back of the movie? I believe that if the memory serves in the water for about 2.6 minutes and was just 6 feet long, it was the heart breaker. But redeeming the qualities of this movie was that it was so bad that I almost died laughing because I believe that bad behavior made me want to die. But the fact is that this thing has been created again by another military test site to train supercocodiles for military combat or something that comes from everything that is evil E.V.I.L Corporation. Let's not forget the characters that we see we have Dance # 1 as a man's leader and half a decent chick (who doesn't know how to act) when a female leads me to say WOW! The only thing worse than the actor was naturally over, the heroes spent about 2 hours talking and planning for a long time how to kill the dinococcus just to fail and kill it in the usual way that could have taken about 15 years. seconds to come. All in all, this film was amazing in the background of its random opera music and the fact that it was probably the most amazing of all CGI monsters, with the fact that it was naturally waterproof with balls and bombs. is made for military DUH! ). By far the best scene was when Lizzy McGuire's brother drove to the floor and dinocroc eats him, causing his head to descend noise that I could add. I believe you would be better at eye-catching to see Dinocroc. And as a director, I believe we should get a lot of people to worship him and everybody take turns to waste one and a half lives until he finally dies and then I can go on with life.
