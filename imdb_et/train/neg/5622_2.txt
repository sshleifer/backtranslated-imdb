OK, after the psychedelic wallpaper, the information provided here was good. The music I could have done without (not that it was bad music, just that it didn't fit at all in this movie). <br /> <br /> The film is often directed by the director - pushing the pagan perspective of Christ's existence and the amazing comparison of the acts and events of Christ's life versus mythological figures / deities such as Mithra and Dionyses. Then he brings out the chronology of the origin of Christianity and presents the "ok" case, but not the one that blew me. <br /> <br /> When the director stuck with the facts and continued, this film would have been good. But at this point in the film, this personally breaks down into a group of delightful attacks against Mel Gibson's "passion for Christ" and the Christian private school that the director attended in his youth. During the interview with the old prime minister (which shows that the director laid the foundation for the wrong pretext), I felt that the director was acting as a childlike child. He asked good questions, but like the film itself, the interview fell to attack the rules of this particular private school, not Christianity. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are only interested in some information, check out the first 30 minutes or so and close it.
