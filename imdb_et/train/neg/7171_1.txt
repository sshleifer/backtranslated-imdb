This film seems to be totally pointless. There is no reason why something like this is written by a small child who forever was half-eternal and thought, "How can I turn it up?" And what did Jared Harris and Christopher Walken mean? Did they do that for a bet? I couldn't tell you the plot, I'm not quite sure it's fairly honest, but if it's not, you won't register. Jared and his birds go to Ireland when he falls down the stairs while you have. They go to this very annoying little girl, meet Christopher Walken, who has dug the perverted ancient woman. She brings her back to life for a reason other than the story, and she immediately shows her gratitude for freezing. Since then, it's all a bit stupid. A few hours of my life I would like back!
