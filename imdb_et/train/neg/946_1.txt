Why is this exhibition so popular? It's beyond me why people like it. I think this is one of the worst out there. <br /> <br /> Because it's so popular, I've tried it more than once and I can't get it through a whole episode. <br /> <br /> One thing is that it works terrible. Everyone is an excessive point where there is an annoying look. They speak with unnatural voice, use unnatural tones and have unnatural body language. I've seen better kindergarten play. <br /> <br /> Another thing, it's not fun. Plots are boring. They are not creative, intelligent or FUNNY. Shouldn't sitcom be funny? Why don't I laugh? <br /> <br /> Finally, what is the seventies? In the seventies it is about as authentic as "Happy Days" in the fifties. <br /> <br /> Oh, and what about Ashton Kutcher? Who put this unlatented dweeb out? And now he's making movies? Oh, save us all! <br /> <br /> If people think this is a high-quality television, it worries me.
