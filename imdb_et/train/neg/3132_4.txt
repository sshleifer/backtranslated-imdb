I didn't see such a wonderful rating on IMDb, but I went to see it because I'm a big fan of Bible material. The first thing that bothered me was a little too much Indiana Jones movie, but it also seemed like Casper Van Dien didn't see those Jones movies (but he should). I believe he tried his best, but the script just seemed. The music was also trying to be in the Jones style. Great work, but for such a movie it seemed too much work, as the video did not deserve this great music. Robert Wagner gave his best skills, did a good job, but somehow the script was all down. "Jokes" is an old school, somewhere 20 years old; they only brought a cynical smile on my face. There are some very bad camera angels, SFX looks like homemade and unreal. Kevin VanHook probably had a good idea (in my opinion, but I love such stories), but things could not finally work out. Maybe he should put it on the paper when he was almost fresh. When I (at the first minute) saw that the film was going to be one of those "low budget films", I was hoping to hear at least a good story, but sometimes the films were disappointing.
