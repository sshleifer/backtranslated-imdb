What a snake-fest. <br /> <br /> Of all the nostalgia that Hollywood has decided to upgrade and upgrade, it is one of the most pointless. It was a totally pointless exhibition first, and we really don't need a 'modern' update. <br /> <br /> Don't forget that the system is unique from the start and sexual, so much progress has been made, socially, because the show ran out of the point (if ever it was). <br /> <br /> Also, what is the sign of Boss Hogg when he is NOT overweight?
