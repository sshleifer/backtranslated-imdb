This movie. . . I do not know. Why would they take such an unpleasant character like Pippi's long-haired and thrilled unique charming Tami Erin, I never know. Why do they spend money on artistic trends and some non-all-bad special effects, then it's hard to change it correctly, I never know. Why sets and costumes are sometimes in the period and sometimes unusual, why they ordered YOU bad songs, why the script doesn't make any sense (not even the silly, children's film level). . . . what did they mean? Nothing about this movie is like it should. Every single part is dubbed (and always bad), every sound effect is a little wrong, every editing is in the wrong place, every performance is in some way bad. It can create a suitable atmosphere despite all the problems, but NEVER captures the magic of Astrid Lindgren's work.
