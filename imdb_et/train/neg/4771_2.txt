Don't waste your time with this movie. It could have been good, but the end was one of the sheep I've ever seen. I have to seriously think about how the people involved in making this movie could have seen the last scene and think, "Yes, now is the end!" and beat himself behind it. It seemed to me more than they just ran out of ideas! They built the last scenes into a cool twist, but let all its accumulation fall on its face. When the last shot dazzled black and I heard the beginning of the credit music, I was in shock - I couldn't believe what I saw and could even stop it. The best thing anyone could do with this movie is to rewrite it and give it the content. Really, I really love to get the one who came with this room to look at those faces and say - WTF ?? !!!!
