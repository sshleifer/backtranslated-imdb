What a terrible movie. Rotten tomatoes also had a good rating for this. don't be fooled by positive comments; It wasn't scary. It wasn't funny. It wasn't wise. It doesn't even keep your attention. I just wasted 2 hours of my life watching this mess-fest. The computer-created monster was interesting to see for the first few times. After about 15 minutes, it is no longer entertaining. dialogue was terrible, it must be a translation. Another negative thing that seemed to be in the eyes was the Americans of the idiots. 3 were depicted and all lacked character, intelligence and judgment. Now I will write a few lines to do this, because we have to have 10. Video store employees should have put me on this title.
