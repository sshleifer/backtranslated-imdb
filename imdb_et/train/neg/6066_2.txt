I was looking forward to seeing John Carpenter's episode in season 2 because his first cigarette burn was the best of season 1 (and I liked other seasons). Oh, how I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> In honesty with Carpenter, I think the main problem with this episode was totally terrible in writing. The characters, apart from the theme, seemed to be acting and talking as if they were written for Walker's, Texas Ranger's episode. The action was bad, and like Ron Perlman there is a lot, but I can only blame them because the writing was so terrible. I am not trying to guess what the writers were trying to do because it would be useless, but it seemed as if they were trying to confuse the horror (apparently) with some social comment on abortion and religion. In this case, it was not surprising that this seemed to be an opportunity to sort certain varieties or religious nuts as well as fanatical abortions. And I support both goals, but it was so terrible that I was embarrassed to look at the characters and talk about such foolish contradictions. It did not fully provide any valuable opinion on the subject, and the horror did not succeed in such intuitive writing. <br /> <br /> Although I don't think Carpenter can be blamed for most evil, I say he decided to run a teleplay and that's why he's responsible. There are a few small bits I found nice, so 2 stars I gave. <br /> <br /> Actual gore and monster effects were good, but CGI gore (two separate strokes on the head) were so obviously inferior in quality CGI they would never have received OK. I am generally critical of CGI, but not because I have a problem in principle. I have trouble filling it. Although technology is in some ways amazing, it is not good enough to match "real" effects, be they miniature or gore especially when they should be something organic and / or alive and should not be used before they are . CGI can be used well in small quantities or obviously when the entire film is animated. <br /> <br /> I also use this option to indicate that the title of the show, Horror Masters, is a bad title. There are not many real "horror masters" there. Maybe two or three. If the example was called "Talle of Horror" or something, it would be good. But because it is a criterion for managing one of these episodes and is therefore criticized for not being a "master of horror", they have at least one horror film for their career. And it doesn't even have to be good.
