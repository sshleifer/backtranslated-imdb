I'm proud to say that I've seen all three fast and furious movies. Of course, the plots are pretty stupid and they can be a little cheesy, but I love them with cars and all beautiful cars and secret midwives competitions. And Ill probably see the fourth. <br /> <br /> Do you want to know the difference between these three and Redline? Decent action, a somewhat thoughtful plot, even if they are potboilers, and last but not least, directors of all three who were very competent leaders, all took the films in a different direction, equally exciting. with whom he slept at bedtime, and made them add-ons, he began to lead the Hollywood unemployment line. And the script.Yikes.Its Mystery Science Theater 3000 is bad. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie had some cool cars, but you don't really see that many are working, and the action is so bad that you don't get excitement d if the cars don't burn you, why to the film? <br /> <br /> Im a bunch of teenagers in public, and I can't stop laughing with a smile. It was just an attack. <br /> <br /> Rent F&F movies. Go to Nascar Race. Go to the go-kart track and compete for yourself. Whatever you do, avoid Redline like bad cheese.
