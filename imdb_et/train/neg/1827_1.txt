Envy stars are the best. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler and the great Christopher Walken. Only the best can be expected with this pain. However, in the case of "Envy", no one could save this catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are the best friends and associates of the Sandpaper Factory. Both serve a decent life, but as Tim has a better job, he can afford more than his friend Nick. Nick is a dreamer who always offers new ideas for inventions. One day, Nick comes up with an idea for a spray spray, which makes the dog disappear (Yes, I'm serious). The idea of ​​loving Nick decides to really invent this product. He makes a bid for Tim to invest in his idea and distribute profits 50/50. Tim refuses to think that the idea will never work. He enjoys spending his money on things like a much larger house, a horse, a personal trainer and fancy deserts. Tim begins Nick's envy. Consequently, the name of the film is. <br /> <br /> The term is not bad, but it is still terrible. This film contains some of the worst dialogues and very bad presentations. Then, as I mentioned earlier, none of them could save that confusion. Not even the great Christoper Walken, who played the homeless character called "J-man", made this movie fun. The film is bad from the start and continues to worsen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if: * you like to mess (not intended) * you want to see Jack Black in white tuxis <br /> <br /> I say, avoid this movie at all costs, but Avoid especially if: * You are offended with bathroom humor * You love animals
