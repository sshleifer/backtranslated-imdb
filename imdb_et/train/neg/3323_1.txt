I've been watching a lot of cartoons or animated films because I have a girl who likes watching TV. I started watching this movie to see if I wanted my little person to watch it ... and no. At first I thought it was such a lovely movie as Bambi's film, but it was as if ducky was homosexual. The information said they were having fun with him because he wasn't athletic, but it wasn't. It just seems like the movie kids learn to be okay on gay. It was also very sad as Ducky's father and all. I don't know, I think if you are gay, you want it, but I don't think I'll look it up with my little one again.
