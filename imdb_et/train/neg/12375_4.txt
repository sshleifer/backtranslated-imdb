This is a good thing that is at least fresh: almost no movies about dance music and the club scene (if even made) did not hit the cinemas. And it also emits a lot of energy, from music to Ibiza. But the main problem is that he can't decide what he wants to be. Although he definitely wants to be a mockumentary line this is a spinal tap, the makers also realize that they don't want to play copycat. However, it does not succeed in jokes because it is not very well written and most of the symbols are underdeveloped. And it doesn't have to arc your script and direct it to do it for 90 minutes, so why not change it down to 75? Production department and cinematography still try to save the day (eg Paul's home). <br /> <br /> Strangely and unexpectedly all this has gone Pete Tong works much better than the simple drama Almost Famous. Especially Beatriz Batarda scenes offer some power. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's a mess, it's somewhat entertaining on the basic level, but you spend the night in your favorite club.
