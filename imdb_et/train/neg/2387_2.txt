I couldn't believe how flat and pointless it was. There's basically no laugh in the movie, scarcely scenes to interest you in the rest of the movie. This movie pulled some big stars, but I thought everything was wasted. I think Keanu Reeves had to watch the film a few years after he looked at the Matrix. Uma Thurman looked very simple and modest. Fortunately, I got this movie for a very low price because it is not a memorable film for some reason. I'm not writing anything about the story of the film, but as you should know, it is meant to be the most famous competitor in the whole of America because of a huge thumb. I'd give this movie 2 / 10. Before I watched this movie, I wondered why this movie got just 4.0 / 10, and now I know why. Very disappointing movie. Don't buy it even if you see it under $ 5.
