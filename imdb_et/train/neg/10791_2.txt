Terrible movie. If there is one Turkish movie, you should see it in 2006, it should be Banyo. What a waste of time. After a couple of cheap, this movie laughs, nada, zilch, nil. Dialogue is cheap and sexual clich√©s are all over it. The director must try more films before he / she is run. Red lead women show examples that an actor should not do. If you are interested in learning how to not act, this is a good example of bad deeds. The only good thing I can say about the film is to wait, wait, there's nothing I can say about it. I really didn't want to write a lot about it. Jeez!
