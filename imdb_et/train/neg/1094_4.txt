It's hard to describe it - if you were a fan of Russ Meyer movies, you are sure to see that Haji is still looking very hot, although Forry Ackerman has not been as good (what he still does) doing these films anyway? When I go with the camera, will she be in my movie?). It was a pretty prerequisite - a superhero whose gigantic mammaria is his secret weapon - but sometimes it didn't put his entire length out and jokes with your average Joe E. Brown comedy (or Abbott and Costello, if that's your thing) - basically just bad puns. However, I found this movie interesting and more than two reasons. Good work, but still basically weak production.
