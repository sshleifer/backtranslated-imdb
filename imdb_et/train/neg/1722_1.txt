This is one of the worst films I've ever seen I've been very boring with a lot of boring dialogue and having some very annoying signs and ridiculous views. The only reason I looked at this garbage is because I got this 8-plate horror set. The plot is uneven and completely stupid like the finale. No blood that ever is, except some bloody signs on the creature, and a few blood firearms. Operation is TERRIBLE !!. Richard Cardella is terrible and very ridiculous, and his character is annoying. Glen Roberts is a comic relief and wasn't funny at all. Mark Siegel is extremely annoying and wasn't fun either! Bob Hyman is decent, but nothing more. Richard Garrison is annoying and had no chemistry with Kacey Cobb. Kacey Cobb is so here and had no chemistry with Richard. Generally Avoid this garbage at all costs! BOMB 5.
