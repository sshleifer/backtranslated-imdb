I saw this feature as part of the Asian American Film Festival in New York and scared the graphic, sado-masochistic, child pornography I saw. The story is hidden under too many graphic sexual scenes - and none of them is a bit more erotic - the sick is more familiar with it. The director seemed to have the value of the shock, but by studying why these characters were such. See if you get it on your stomach - I still have setbacks.
