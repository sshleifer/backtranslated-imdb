It's hard to know where this adaptation is going wrong because I think the problem starts with the books themselves. Alexander McCall Smith has developed that you do not read about these detective stories, but about his deeply failed and totally false vision of Africa that does not exist. He has done for Botswana what Borat did for Kazakhstan - not so successfully, but so many facts. <br /> <br /> When I understood it, he ceased to be American singer / actress Jill Scott as Mma Ramotswe. If he wants to represent a non-African country, how appropriate is his black woman who is not Africa? He's not the only American cast; Mma Makuts is played by Anika Noni Rose. Both women are far away, too young for the roles they play, and too glamorous. Both murders are cruel to the local accents and both focus so completely on the cruelty that they can't do much. Scott's Mma Ramotswe is gentle, cute and soft. Rose's Mma Makutsi is a tedious motorboy female. <br /> <br /> The result is almost invisible. The main casting will be redeemed only in the presence of Lucian Msamat, who performs well as JLB Matekon. She goes smarter and more intensely than in books, but I can't blame her - she's a bright light in the ocean of breastfeeding. The contradictions between his work and his books are clearly placed on the species where the body wrote the script. <br /> <br /> For me, writing McCall Smith has always been a lot of fun, but it is bad. He refuses to edit. As a result, her books contain grammatical tests that limit scientific and name-changing characters. That's why there is something that the team writing this project actually made worse. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is now largely Englishized. The characters speak of "opening" and "sensitivity to needs". Mma Ramotswe and JLB Matekoni flirt openly. Mma Makut's moans think she doesn't have a computer, but given her constantly updated hair, makeup and jewelry, I'm surprised she doesn't have a MacBook in her handbag with her Visa card. <br /> <br /> What are we doing here? It is difficult to be disturbed by this complicated adaptation because, frankly, most of the things I like about original books are apocritical. McCall Smith paints fancy Botswana, home to cute, not threatened black people who are full of fun and delicious wisdom. It sounds good, despite linguistic travesty, but a vision of how a type of white person wants black people. This is not true. <br /> <br /> Given that it's not surprising that this exhibition sucks as much as it is. It is yet to be seen whether European and American audiences are even noticed.
