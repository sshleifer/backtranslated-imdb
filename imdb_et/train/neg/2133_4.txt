First things: I'm not conservative. And although I would never be liberal or democratic, I was against the war in Iraq from day one. I think it's safe to say John Cusack, and I'm probably seeing a policy, actually I'm sure we could get drinking buddies if we ever talk about how big Adam Curtis's BBC documents are. My idea is: do not discriminate on this review, I thought I was not part of the choir Cusack declares war, Inc. There is no doubt that WI's policy is tailored to demographics, but the problem is, the tailoring is inadequate and the film Cusack produced, produced and stars, fits worse than a cheap suit. <br /> <br /> As they say, "The road to hell is paved with good intentions." Cusack, his co-authors, director Joshua Seftel and even the participants had no doubt any intention to make the anti-war movie as biting and funny as Robert Altman's M * A * S * H, unfortunately for the viewer they ended up with one unlikely and sleepy ligament like Michael Moore in Canada bacon. <br /> <br /> The current state of US "politics, foreign policy, and war" efforts "is already absurd and consequently tragic, pathetic, and regrettably comical - just look at The Daily Show and see for yourself. The bottom line is: you can't write material as funny as what the Bush administration gives us every day, so why try to compete? <br /> <br /> The main problem with WI is that it feels like hurrying. In order to do this, Cusack basically changed Grosse Pointe Blank (one of his best films), changed the device and created a shopping list of works collected by Naomi Klein. Most of these ideas are pulled down into the throat in the first twenty minutes of the film and make them so unpleasant that no jokes or gags or deliberately evident references to Halliburton, Neo-Cons and the US occupation of Iraq are imaginative, wise or funny. Writers are so blinded by their own dogma that they simply considered these issues funny and subversive. The problem is ... it's not. Nowadays, these ideas are news yesterday and if you have not lived down or on rocks or are so blinded by ignorance, denial and empty stupidity (read: right-wing Christian), these jokes are insultingly simple. <br /> <br /> Perhaps WI would work if it were nuanced, subversive, offensive and fattened with a detailed study / understanding of occupation. As it is, jokes and eyesight are all surfaces and are so bad, so little finish, little or satirical evil, they did a little more than silence me. Homer Simpson once said, "It's funny because it's true" and the Daily Show proves it every night; War, Inc. but it proves that just because it is true does not make it funny. Bottom line: hyperbole is not necessary to illuminate US / neo-conservative policies ... it is already a big joke. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
