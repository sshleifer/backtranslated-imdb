This ultimate inferiority with the original foolish "Blind Dead" movie is still a trash waste. So many people have made these films so I can't believe what they're talking about. Since I was a child I have heard about how these films are scary and big, and I saw them all and I was very disappointed, all the drugs, since the 1970s, or do they just not know how this raw material is boring?
