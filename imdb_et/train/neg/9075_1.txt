This film, titled Slackers, has three college friends Dave, Jeff and Sam (respectively, Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel) who intend to graduate from the university without passing an honest exam but successfully completing it. It lasts until the end, as unlikely, but the most enjoyable character of Nathan (Schwartzman) shows what they are. Nathan starts blackmailing to meet her dream girl if she can't do it under normal circumstances. The only problem is when the trio starts working on it, Dave falls in love with the gorgeous and good-hearted Angela (James King). Unfortunately, this is not a brilliant genre film. Schwartzman makes it easy to watch a movie because his performance is brilliant. The King's performance is average, I think he was hired only to be his proud look. The Slackers resembles American Pie differently. Jokes are as low as American Pie. But are they not used? I think this movie is a warning to genre filmmakers that they have run out of originality. In general, a couple of smiley moments, but terrible film performance (except Schwartzman) and subject matter. * out of stock *****
