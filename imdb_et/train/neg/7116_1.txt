* WARNING * Possible spoilers below <br /> <br /> Film is more boring than anything else. There seems to be a little effort to create empty spaces and empty lawns with illuminated shots, but none of them work. <br /> <br /> MST3K did a good job of doing this, but the movie itself is funny moments: <br /> <br /> When a fake skull rolls from an ash, a woman becomes hysterical and wonderful when a man (who is trying to ride) crazy voice "says the voice of the body" There is no skull, there is no skull. "<br /> <br /> When the actual ghost cubs are trying to marinate the spouse, as if they were left between the first and second bases.
