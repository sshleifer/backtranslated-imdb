They show it in some outside network. It's OK. Although it's not as bad as the B movies they show on Saturdays on the Sci-fi network, but still a big bunch. Operation is satisfactory. The plot and the way you write is rather non-standard and the pace is far too slow. Every minute of the movie, the part of the movie where they offer things before credit - not to the top of the movie - seems to be disconnected. The big parts also play the age of the cast look they play. The whole thing is predictable, boring and not viewable. Save time. It is not even worth the time it takes to view it for free.
