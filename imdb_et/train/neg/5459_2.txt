It was a very short episode, which appeared in 1971 in one exhibition "Night Gallery". The episode celebrated Sue Lyon (Lolita Film Fame) and Joseph Campanella, who played the nursery and vampire, respectively. The Vampire hires a babysitter to look at the child (which seems to be some kind of werewolf or monster) when he goes out at night during blood. The babysitter is not very noticeable about the appearance of the vampire when he sees him for the first time, and only starts collecting two and two, if he notices that he has no reflection in the mirror, the unusual collection of the hidden library and hears strange voices when the vampire goes to talk to the child. He realizes that the man who hired him may not be in his mind initially. He closes the door, the vampire comes out, which is puzzled and the episode is over. I don't know what the purpose was to do such a shortened episode that only lasted 5 minutes. They should have expanded the previous episode in the same 5 minutes and skipped it. The whole waste.
