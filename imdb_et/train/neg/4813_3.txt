I've given up trying to find out what version I'm looking at. The copyright at the end of 1983 shows. And although this is not the irrelevance of my film, I say that watching a film that is obviously made in the age of Aquarius (including long-haired hippie chicks and unpleasant station wagons), but having the sound of the 1980s is puzzling. Extremely surprising. <br /> <br /> My main objection here is HOW TO USE THE FILM BURY CUTE-AS-A-BUTTON PAMELA FRANKLIN ALIVE. HOW TO ATTENTION! <br /> <br /> Seriously, he's all like divine and stuff, but in the two movies I've seen - it's a crapfest and otherwise a great Hell House legend - they'll kill him. > <br /> I would like to inform the film industry in advance. Pamela Franklin is apparently retired from business, but if she ever decides to make another movie and some of the director's explosive friends try to kill her, I have to ask her to stop outside. <br /> <br /> ONE BEATS ARE PAMELA FRANKLIN AND WILL BE COMING. I AM A COUNTRY. TIP IS POSSIBLE. <br /> <br /> For B-fans who are looking for an evil movie, you could do a lot less. On the plus side, this is a film that includes satanism peripherally and intelligently - this film is a hardcore satanic film. <br /> <br /> Satanic ceremonies, bafometers, hallucinations, ridiculous rat attacks - what more could you ask. <br /> <br /> This magnificent stuff has pretty much destroyed the astonishment of the 1980s, which is about as inappropriate as possible. Music reminded me of something you would hear on Equalizer. It's really bad. <br /> <br /> They also made Pamela Franklin's own charming English accent, which was also quite rude, if not cruel cruelty (against the viewer), as you can find in the general declaration. about human rights. I say we have the right to hear that Pamela Franklin speaks with her voice. Who is with me? I can forgive everything else about this movie if they didn't abuse Pamela Franklin. And so I throw down on the floor, gentlemen - ANYONE WHO MESSES PAMELA FRANKLIN MESSES OUR. <br /> <br /> AFTER Fictional Context. <br /> <br /> GOOD DAY, SIRS.
