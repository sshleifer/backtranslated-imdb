First, it takes half an hour for Hackman to be taken out of prison and to work. What a waste of time, we all know that Hackman is going to work for his masters, why we lost almost a third of these sequences. Then the Hackman will stay at the hotel and the story will go somewhere, just proving to us that Hackman has been watching closely and what he says or does is known by the masters. Again for another 20 minutes. Then more time wasted shows reunification with your spouse. All this should have taken 10-15 minutes the easiest way to set the actual action, intrigue, and plot twists. By the time the real action goes, I was so bored that I just wanted to stop the movie. Hackman is nice, as usual, and also other actors, but it's the first size dud.
