An innocent person (Steve Guttenberg) has one night with his boss (Isabelle Huppert). She puts a woman (Elizabeth McGovern) on the outside, but she can't call the police because she would strike her marriage to Gutenberg's boss (Paul Shenar). So Guttenberg, an honest citizen, when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed just half an hour later, goes on and claims that he is witnessing the first attack, but intends to pass on information from Huppert. Well - never wear a false testimony against your neighbor as they say. <br /> <br /> This simple attempt to help the police nabil killer quickly turns around. When he meets the first victim, McGovern, he starts to happen immediately, but agrees to remain silent for a moment. But then Guttenberg finds himself in court, should find it difficult (Greenquist), and we discover through cross-checking that he is APPROACH and cannot detect objects far, let alone face. (Not that it is important because it didn't seem to slip first.) The plot is practically a labyrinth. Guttenberg also pushes the head into question when Huppert is murdered. <br /> <br /> He just can't get away with arrests and holes with the now sympathetic McGovern. Guttenberg and McGovern complain of a murder trap plan. He serves as a feed. They follow a flag slip into one of his poor ghosts, and McGovern acts like a dynamism that the murderer has attracted but tries to kill him. But everything is fine, look, because not only Guttenberg is watching him closely, and not only does the police know a few minutes after he enters the dive. case. <br /> <br /> I ask you, warning viewer, is this scenario planned? Elizabeth McGovern has an amazingly interesting bone structure. It looks like he's all almond and little mouth from time to time, but he's alive. Steve Guttenberg has hair hair and that's it. Otherwise he will be as helpless as his playable character. If Isabelle Huppert can act, it is not obvious in this film. The killer has developed and cared for that he is wearing one of these deformation masks in this Twilight Zone episode of greedy heirs. <br /> <br /> Did the director, Curtis Hanson, do "LA Confidential"? It was a nice job. Here, all the little bit parts seem cumbersome and busy. Just before the inevitable peak of violence, a uniform police officer is introduced to delay the rescue of McGovern, and the scene is embarrassing to look. Dick Olsen is a late buyer. She is clean and always reliable. Paul Shenar, who is mated as a spider, has a striking face that seems to have been made on stage and he is doing a good job. a pair of hairy monkeys, shot at Carolina Beach Bar, North Carolina, not far from where I lived. The way to create an interior is clear that it should be dangerous and dirty diving. In fact, the screen looks more elegant than actually. <br /> <br /> In general, it is Hitchcock's territory, and it brings tears to the eyes to imagine what he would have done with this story.
