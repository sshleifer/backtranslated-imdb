Strangely, if less than 2 hours can seem like a lifetime sitting through such a flat, uninspirit. If the story is as personal as it was supposedly to Sally Potter, are you not expecting a little to show in his presentation? His actions were completely loose and I felt that there were no chemistry between Sally and Pablo, and tango scenes that should have been shot, given the nature of the dance, were uncomfortable and painful during the viewing. Obviously, exposing the personal story of such a film could be frustrating and as such, Sally Potter would have been wise to let the right actor take on this task instead of letting her passion fall victim to her own screaming.
