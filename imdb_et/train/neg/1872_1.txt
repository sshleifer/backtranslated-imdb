NOT WARNING. This movie is such a mess. It's a disaster. Don't waste your time with it. I warned you! <br /> <br /> Functional, story, dialogue, music ... basically everything is up, it's annoying and ridiculous. It made me want to throw (if the dialogue / actor / story did not do it, everything is nailed curved). You feel you're watching comedy. The problem is that the parts that are said to be funny are not even funny. Action, story, cinema, you feel that everything is just too hard for WAAAAY - but it will never succeed. Practically every shot is made, but what?! This film looks just like a student's film. No wonder they shot it in HD because it would waste more money on filming. <br /> <br /> If you're just having fun or bad action, writing, editing, directing, full of clich√©s, everything that is forced on your face, oh and did I mention poor action? (Well, actually it's not all the actor's fault - it's the director!), Then I think you like this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to look at this class. I would have turned it off immediately. If you still can't say, I did this movie. It made me want to throw and get back ... at least I didn't have to pay for this garbage. <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum, you know ... The man of Jurassic Park / Independence Day is in this movie, but he's sure he went down that time.
