Looking at CBS's "Surrender, Dorothy", I wondered why Diane Keaton wants to be in this (not because it is a television film - with a lack of attractive roles for some older actors, it's no wonder why the Academy's award-winning performers like Keaton turn to the TV but it doesn't offer Keaton the chance to shine). A single mother, suddenly died by her twenty daughters, puts - and gradually with her friends - a group of young people whose daughter was near her accident. Adapted from the novel, it teleplay us with a group of self-absorbing characters that would cross the street to avoid. In addition to being crazy and dull, these foolish people are incredibly convincing, as well as the clean scenario and the beachfront bungalow where the kids live (one young man wearing muscle shirts to tell us he's gay) Keaton, "Surrender, Dorothy" and actually asks, "It's" Oz's wizard ", right?" ... no, genius, it's from "Citizen Kane!"). Keaton may have wanted to make this material dead. She tries to change this clearly unlikely woman in the shadow of her personal shadow (many kooky clothes), but it doesn't fit well with the viewer because Keaton has always been warmly pleasing and flexible. Here's his crazy harpy, who doesn't teach much lessons about his journey of discovery (the film quickly forgets that it is a dead young woman and becomes a mysterious wreck of her mother's nervous system, which seems to have been too much to lose her hippie). This is the kind of filmmakers who talk about exhibitions with a warning: "It should help many mourning mothers there". I can't imagine that it would help anyone because it is essentially downward, confusing and confusing. It is corrupted.
