I only saw the movie recently, although it was released in 2001. I was hoping to see an entertaining movie, but let me tell you that Princess Blade is nothing compared to Asum. "Princess" is not very talkative as you have noticed ... She reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme, who only looked at his point, then beat his opponent. Throughout the film I waited to hear at least the confession he liked, why he fought, who he loved and trusted. I waited in vain. Crappy movie. Crappy dialog. Don't look at it if you don't want to be bored! It is so bad that I finally wondered how I couldn't disappoint for 1 and a half hours. About. I'll give 4/10.
