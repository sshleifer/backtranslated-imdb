It seems that everyone can make a movie today. It's like all you need is a camera, a group of people who are your cast and a team, script and a little money and walla you have a movie. The problem is that talent is not always part of this equation and often these are low budget movies duds. Video shelves are filled with these so-called films. They are not even guilty of joy, they are just a celluloid residue that is better forgotten. Troma Entertainment is known for making trash, but most of their movies are b movie gold. Some of the films they have put out have nothing to do with it, and some, like "Nightmare Weekend," do not deserve any release. <br /> <br /> Pros: Cast members do the best they can against the material. Some unintended fun. Moves at a good pace (should be 81 minutes). <br /> <br /> Cons: terrible writing that involves dirty dialogue and countless holes in parcels. Poorly lit, especially night scenes and end that can't be done at all. Don't make sense to lick. A bad result. Cheap and very dated effects. Lack of complete character development and you don't care about anyone. It should be a horror film, but it is not in the area and it is not the least scary. Nothing interesting or exciting will happen. Loaded with unnecessary cushioning. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: I've never expected this to be a forgotten pearl, but I never imagined it to be bad. I don't know if this is the worst movie, but it's a solid competitor. Troma should have let this film get rid of instead of giving it to the movie. Don't make the same mistake and give your curiosity the best for you. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 1/5
