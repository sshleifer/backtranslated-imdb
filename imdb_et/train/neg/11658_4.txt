Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst of the four movies because there's not much land, bad behavior, pretty annoying and some really funny jokes. But. And it is great, but there is one good actor, one good repeating joke and a good start. A good actor is Tim Curry, one good repeating joke is a horrible, weird butler who has a nasty hand who always screams, but laughs at the wrong things. And a good start is the looting of Excorsists. <br /> <br /> The Scary Movie 2 chart is the main characters from the original and many new characters are invited to stay overnight. old mansion, but do they live at night? This movie is not very good, but if your bored can also watch it!
