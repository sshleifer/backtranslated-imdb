It had to be one of the worst films. When Kate comes up and Jed is a bunch of guys and they're all going to kill ... so Hollywood. Another bad scene was when Kate walked over the cover, it turned out he was studying the texture of the sidewalks. Andie's acting in this film is so bad - I could not communicate with them and love each other. The other two women, however, were very good and overshadowed by Andie. Anyway, it was such a fun movie. I usually like this type of movie, but I just didn't get that movie. Too many unlikely situations and again Andie's action didn't help the film. He's also all the gums. Lancome has to put his makeup with a screwdriver, because he looks beautiful in commercial.
