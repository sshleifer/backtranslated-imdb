It's a confusing and inconsistent boring dialogue about boring dialogues and monologue scenes. This is not an exaggeration: you have to make huge efforts to even deal with it. <br /> <br /> I sincerely thought that Fassbinder was doing something interesting to say why Erwin / Elvira is doing suicide at the end, but instead every person tries to explain every scene: "when he was young, it happened ... "and" she just came back from Casablanca and told everyone to cut it down ... "and so on. Soon in the movie, Erwin / Elvira is in a slaughterhouse that speaks to a friend's prostitute (surely the best place for a pleasant little chat in a slaughterhouse) and tells him the story of Elvira's life, showing Fassbinder killing one cow after another. It is difficult to choose whether to pay attention to distracting images or what transvestite is talking about. Of course, we reach the very coercive and coarse "I have suffered a lot in my life and want to die". <br /> <br /> In one of the rare moments where something really happens, Erwin / Elvira meets the former lover that only two other men (like the necessary level of homosexuality) will recognize Elvira only after doing very homosexual choreography. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting shots and ideas, I have to admit (like, for example, when a nun talks about a young Erwin story), but everything on the film is wasted because of Fassbind's self-sensitivity.
