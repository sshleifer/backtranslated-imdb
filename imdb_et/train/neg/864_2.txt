Even if it is possible to choose from more than 180 movies, this "Succubo" is often called the best Jess Franco movie. Heck, even legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang, reads "Succubus" among his favorites. So, maybe it's me, but I thought it was a terribly boring and too confusing film. The opening is great and shows Janine Reynaud, who performs the SM on the stage. Unfortunately, it's all downhill. The character of Reynaud is a maneater that eventually kills his lovers in some sort of trance. Franco had a decent budget to work and spend it well on places, beautiful photography and mesmerizing music. It could have been his biggest film if it wasn't a flat and uninteresting story. It should be psychedelic, but I would say that sophomoric is a better term for the description shown here. Half of the time you have no idea what's going on or what exactly is said, even a short 80-minute working time seems to last ages. This is definitely not Franco's best movie in my opinion. I don't even recommend it to be hard hit. If you are looking for a better Jess Franco movie, try getting your hands on Las Vampire, the dreadful Dr. Orloff or the female vampire.
