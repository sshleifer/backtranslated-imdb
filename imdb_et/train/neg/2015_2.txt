I really waited for this program for two reasons; I really liked Jan Michael Vincent and I am an aviation wand and I have a serious love affair with helicopters. I don't like this program because it takes fantasy to an incredible level. The world speed record for helicopters was determined by Westland Lynx several years ago at 249 km / h. The only fastest chopper in the 1960s was the experimental Lockheed AH56A. It hit over 300 and was a helicopter, which means that there was a propeller at the end of this body. <br /> <br /> In short, no helicopter can turn much more than 275 due to the rotation principle. wing flight. And Bell 222, the "actor" who depicted Airwolf, was not very fast even by helicopter standards. And it didn't stay in production for a long time. <br /> <br /> During this time, "Blue Thunder" was released, which was much more realistic.
