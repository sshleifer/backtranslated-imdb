Thanks to the BBC for this show. I suffered under the inferiority complex, I hated leaving the house, talking to new people, and I had an overwhelming feeling that people hated me. But after watching 4 non-blonde single episodes, my fortune began to change. After episode 2, I started applying for new jobs, wearing fashionable clothes, and I felt talented. When the series was over, I went to the sales department in the sales department, beat many women and often won my local karaoke competition. If you ever have a crisis of confidence and you don't know where to go, take a trip to Poundland and only receive a DVD of 99p.
