Not because I beat myself in the eyes of a realistic blood supply, but when I wait for the blood to flow on the DVD and what I get, one bloody scene (eyeball) on the forehead of the forged tail of the asinine and turning on the desk, I mean "well that my life is 43 minutes forever lost ". I do not like it or meat and blood flower "movies" as much as I want; see if you can sit through them. Muscle and blood flowers had some difficult places to look at. There was no damn experiment. It was the best, stupid and worst case ... well ... very stupid. Maybe my expectations were too high. I put the DVD to think "oh man, it's sick." After watching their fake girl nearly a thousand times, I looked at it quickly. <br /> <br /> Two movies are interested in this movie. 1) People who are looking for F'd movies just to see how F really is, or 2) Dreadful. I was looking for this and other Guinea pig movies for the last reason, but even if I got into the first category, this movie doesn't let my boat. In fact, I can imagine that this film increases the lust of blood ... as "WANTING YOU ALL B * TCH ALREADY !!" In conclusion, the only reason for having this movie is the purpose of the collection. If you want a carnage that the traditional horror does not offer, you will get traces of death. Of course it sucks too, but at least you get the blood and the courage you expect. <br /> <br /> The only reason I commend this praise is that they feel they should. There is no artistic value that I can understand, there is no reason for it to be fame, nothing. Just a flat test to be shocking.
