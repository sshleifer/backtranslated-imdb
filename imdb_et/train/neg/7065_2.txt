OK well I found this movie with my dads old pile of movies and it seemed like a pretty good cover but the movie actually suck! OK, the first swimming story was pretty good, but it was time for it, then the boy was slow! It wasn't even scary! His dream sounds like a little childhood story. Then the news girls were completely slowed down. I'm sure someone will start inviting the news and ask him to go with you. But it ended in a cool, where he grabbed him and he was in the hospital and he saw him in t.v and said he was junk. Next, this was a pretty gay story about who has brought back dead people ... it's so stupid that I don't even talk about it anymore. The latter was the best. It was not so scary, but the idea of ​​the story was pretty cool. Yes, the girl goes over and she kills all her classmates or something. Then, when they all make their dreams come to each other, the losers get to the bus (TO HELL AHAHAHAH) and they see all the people in their bus (Ha). End.
