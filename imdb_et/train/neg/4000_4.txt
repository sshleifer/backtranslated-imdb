I liked the American Movie so I rented the first movie by Chris Smith, which I thought was a documentary. At the first minute I saw that it wasn't, but I gave it up. <br /> <br /> What is a dead movie. Living alive will hardly help you if you just study the tedious things. Tediousness that we are already famous. <br /> <br /> I am sorry, but is it appropriate for everyone that 1) lots of jobs sucks and 2) most of them are dirty, minimum wage jobs in the service sector? I knew it before seeing the movie. However, this did not give any investigation, because even though the film has a "real" (handheld camera, music, etc.), it hardly happens, as in the "real world". br /> <br /> Would the employer be as happy as Randy would check after Randy gave up after 3 days, when he said he expected him to stay for 6 months? Or the day after he gave up his job (and spun the machine he was working on) so everyone would be so simple for him? <br /> <br /> The big problem is our "hero" (?), Randy. This man is a loser. Not because he is stuck in these jobs or has a tough apartment or looks like that. He's a dope. He does not pay attention or even seek these jobs. He has zero. If I had to hire someone, he didn't want to miss the interview. <br /> <br /> I look forward to what Chris Smith does, but for the guys, finish this "is-important movies." "American Job" does not work.
