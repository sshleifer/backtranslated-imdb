Well, Cannes's artyfartyrat might have liked this movie, but not me, I'm afraid. If you like the type of movie where shots remain so long as you don't know if the actor has fallen asleep, or if the operator is gone for lunch, it may be for you. Much of this is with short stays in the area of ​​discomfort. I didn't find it shocking or distracting because some other reviewers are just a little terrible and pointless. The only reason I didn't give that letter is that it is a commendable ans and the film is pretty good. However, the plot has little to suggest. Much of the movie simply shows a stormy woman who teaches or listens to a piano that some people may like. But to think that it's not safe enough, you need to prepare some pictures of pornography and sexual violence to wake you up in a bad taste. Not recommended.
