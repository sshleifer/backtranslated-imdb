One of the worst films I've ever seen. Terrible action, ridiculous action (it is clear that cars are traveling slowly), scary script, terribly dissatisfied end and incompetent direction make the film a hash. We know Judge Reinhold is a good actor, but he should shame. There is no great tension in the car, and when the characters stumble in the moments of hope, they laugh like a banshees for some reason, even "high ways" when they see the bridge humiliated! <br /> <br /> There is also a chain of events that leads these people to share the reliability of the same car strain. Probably based on real events? In this case, the truth is stranger than fiction! It is unfortunate that it was portrayed in this way.
