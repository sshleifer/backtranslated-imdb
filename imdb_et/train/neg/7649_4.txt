Joyce Reynolds seems to be able to grow up for Janie, an American boy-mad boy of sixteen, who dives his constant dude for a visiting soldier and breezes on the roof of Life magazine (lies in the palm of his hand) all in the same week! The end result of explosives, falls, bull voices and unpleasant business activities, such as Janie's little sister who commands family members, Hattie McDaniel (as a servant), constantly bouncing after sassy kid, Janie's mother who was involved with the Red Cross and Janie's father is trying to write about editorial problems for today's teenagers (like parents, tired, sexless Edward Arnold and acquaintance, dirty Ann Harding even makes it an unlikely couple even by 1944; he can't help the children much less imagine the two of them). The nominee is (!) For Editing Owen Marks, followed by Warner Bros. in 1946 by Janie Gets Married. By then, Reynolds will have to grow his co-lands - he replaced Joan Leslie. * 1/2 from ****
