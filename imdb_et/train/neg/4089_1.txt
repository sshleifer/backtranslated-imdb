Warning: This review includes a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Wow. Almost impressively bad. Note I said, "almost". This is nothing more than a lot of random scenes that have been put together in the story test. The main characters (you can't call them "heroes") shoot innocent bystanders for their food and robbing for similar reasons. There are also a ton of homootics that were a paw for me. (SPOILER: It seems that the villainess (who is only topless and not naked when other reviews claim) can be killed early, but miraculously recovers by adding another 70 minutes of torture to the audience.) I can't shake that animal from feeling abused in this cinematic repeated several times. If you have a MST3K mood, you can watch it, but you can usually forget it. Go to rent the original Conan DVD.
