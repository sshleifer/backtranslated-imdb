While others may argue that watching Bilali's other works can better understand this film, it does not succeed in one big way. It is not independent. The plot is a mishmash that mixes the insignia with the content. Here's an idea that starts with a certain story. The handicraft is then surrounded by insignia. Let's start with two different narratives, a woman who is somehow becoming human, "god", which for some reason is judged, but getting one last hit on Earth and the mysterious character of John who seems to have evolved into a "resort" just beyond the city limits. Why? No one of these questions has been answered. But do we care, no. There is no development that would want us to feel the story of any character, the nearest Jill and even then the development is spotty. Unfortunately, this film will remain visually impressive ( what is) but at the expense of motivational development, I would like to see it when someone writes this material a little further and does not have to know that every picture must be in the picture.
