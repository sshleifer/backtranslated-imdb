I just finished a book about Dillinger. This movie was terribly inaccurate. It's like they sites names and just about everything up. His robberies and vacation trips were well planned until the other half - when the time was up, they left, whether they had all the money or not. They had notes for every way to go, etc. Purvis never saw him in the restaurant, he was told that Dillinger had paid for his meal after Dillinger's departure. Purvis has never killed SAW Dillinger before Dillinger night before, but photos of him. The way his gang members died was fictitious. Dillinger never robbed the bank as he did the movie. If I had never read a book, I might have enjoyed the movie. The operation was sometimes upstairs. The activity was also superfluous. For another thought, I doubt if I would have enjoyed this much, even if I didn't read the book.
