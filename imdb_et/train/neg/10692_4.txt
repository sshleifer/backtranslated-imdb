Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered after Hollywood glamor treatment after entering Italy. First of all, it suffers from the torment of STROMBOLI volcanic island, which was an artificial failure that would have killed a less flexible actor. And now it's EUROPA 51, another annoying exercise in a dirty mood. <br /> <br /> Also, this story does not make Alexander KNOX, another gratitude for his long-term husband, who attempts to comfort his young son after his death. At least it has better output values ​​and a more coherent script than STROMBOL. <br /> <br /> Bergman is still attractive, but is moving towards a rich society woman. He will never be able to cope with the sudden loss of his son, despite the kindness of his friend's attempts. "Sometimes I think I'm going out of me," he says to his wife. The perfect statement in a movie that is totally without humor or grace, but it gives us a sense of where the story goes. <br /> <br /> Bergman will soon be motivated to help the poor in post-war Rome, but as a social worker with poorer children, emotional health will not be improved and the plot will be worse. <br /> <br /> The overall effect of the movie is that it is not interesting enough for the project with a star like Bergman. The film loses its pace when Bergman becomes more and more disturbing and his wife suspects he's twice. The story goes down there after he cares for a street walk through his terminal illness. On the last thread of the plot, her husband needs to be placed for observation by the spiritual shelter. <br /> <br /> Ingrid suffers this tremendously (compensates for his son's loss), but it is of no use. Not one of his best chips to say it easily. <br /> <br /> Trivia's Note: If he wanted neo-realism with mental illness, he would have been better able to take the lead of SNAKE PIT when it was offered to director Anatole Litvak! He would have done more for his career than EUROPA 51. <br /> <br /> To sum up: Another Rossellin and Bergman insecurity.
