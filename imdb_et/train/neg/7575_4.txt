A retired diplomat who played nicely with Michael York goes to Russia to get revenge on a Russian gangster murdered by a diplomat police officer. There, the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian-speaking police officer to help him bring the Russian gangster to court. <br /> <br /> I remembered the 1980s old activities that always depict Russians as evil to undermine a fair US government. It's interesting to see a Russian guy this time as a hero. <br /> <br /> Not very glowing, it's really a typical "B" action. Michael York lends some mediocre to some classes. Alexander Nevsky, a Russian police officer, is a kind of "blah", but surprisingly there is someone with Michael York. Faced with it, Michael York is such a good actor to have chemistry for someone he does. The disappointing beautiful Adrian Paul is killed in the first 15 minutes of the movie. Now that Adrian Paul was in this movie for longer, it would have been above B-average. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that he's nice to watch the first 15 minutes of the movie. Richard Tyson's played villain is your typical bad guy. She is very blonde and very buggy in this movie. <br /> <br /> Hire this flick if you have nothing to watch on the TV. That's okay. It doesn't suck too bad. The action scenes are decent. Operation could be better, the plot could have moved much faster, but hey, you see what Russia sees today!
