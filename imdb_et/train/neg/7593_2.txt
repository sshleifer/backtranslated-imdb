I don't like this movie, but then I didn't think much about this book, which, although a praiseworthy "masterpiece", found that there was no character in development and separation and illogical in the plot, although it was much more readable than Fante's terrible first effort "Make Los Angeles, "which wasn't published until Fante became fashionable in the mid-80s. He has worked hard with a manuscript to correct many of the shortcomings of the book, but was not saved for my money. Ask the Dustis was never a movie when he ever tried to keep the book loyal. I find this movie Towne crazy. <br /> <br /> In the word: forgotten.
