Back in his youth, the old man wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family denied it. For many decades, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl) and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon the sister will be bored brother No. 1 and jumps in brother # 2 in bed. <br /> <br /> These three siblings can be thought to be somewhere far from the island. But no - they are high-class Europeans who go to college and occupy the social world. <br /> <br /> We never see a mutually understanding moment between any unrelated woman and two brothers. We never see any kind of flirting between a relative and a sister. All the flirting moments are only shared between brothers and sisters. <br /> <br /> The weakest part of GLADIATOR was incest. The young Emperor Commod would have over a hundred hundreds of slave girls and a city full of married girls, but no - he just wanted his sister? If the film's incest is your cup, then SUNSHINE (slowly) will excite you endlessly.
