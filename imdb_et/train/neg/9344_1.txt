As others have pointed out, this is a film for arbitrary or masochistic reversal. <br /> <br /> We all know after seeing Scotland as one of the most depressing places in the first world. However, unlike trainspotting and acidic houses without a good dose of humor or sharp realism movies like this does not work. And more importantly, without a proper script, there is no movie and it is nothing new, inspiring or thinking about the script of this movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film won a couple of Bafta shows how bad the British film industry is today. I thought the Aussie film industry was very bad right now, but unfortunately the British industry is even worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I don't even worry about it on weekends. <Br /> <br /> Take advantage of this movie and give it a wide place.
