"Dutch Schultz", AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer was a real person and his quite disgusting life is quite well documented. This film, aimed at depicting his life, should have used a fictional character, because overdramed events are too strong deviations from facts and chronology. Not only does it ignore some interesting details that other versions have added, such as the public relations fiasco in N. N. and his religious conversion. It is true that he was filled by Luciano, Lansky, to. al. but it is as much as it goes. The exploding tile scene, represented by Luciano, who fills Bo Weinberg in his home, helps his mother, is red. There is also a situation where the Dutch approach their mother to pay for the Legs Diamond. It just doesn't work. The character of Mrs Fleggenheimer also does not work. This film does not need a comic relief for the encouraging Jewish mother. The leg of the flat flat flat was humorous enough. I'm sure the man will turn to the grave. And by the way, the Dutchmen killed the people themselves, but he was not Rambo or 007. The scene where he brewed the brewery is absurd. I do not know. Maybe it had to be a comedy and I just didn't get it.
