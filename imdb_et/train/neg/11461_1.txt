Don't waste this movie in spite of +/- 2 hours of your life - just away. Especially when somebody is happy to stay away from you. Damn cheek when you ask me. I was expecting something to happen - it was never. I'm not one of those people who would stop watching the movie in part. I always have to look it up. What a big mistake. Do yourself a favor and go and paint on the wall and watch it dry - much more fun. Don't waste this movie in spite of +/- 2 hours of your life - just away.
