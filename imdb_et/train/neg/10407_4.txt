I found Tremors 4: The legend begins that would be boring and boring. All the action scenes were stupid. These "GRABOIDS" have reduced the size of today's house cat, if not smaller. This was terrible, and this movie was a Tremor-Saga just an unnecessary movie, because even though it is about how graboids are formed, this story is both pointless and useless. you are using SAME ACTOR (Michael Gross) to be someone in the past when he is someone from other Tremor movies. Gesez ... If you haven't seen this movie, don't waste your time. Tremors, 1, 2 and 3, a good time. This movie, however, make sure you are far from sitting next to your STOP button working fast to retreat away from the mess.
