In fact, I felt bad for the participants in this matter. Undoubtedly, the high school drama class could do a better job or at least work. Participants have to think that this would be their great opportunity to work in the movie, certainly not. In addition to terrible action, the stories were boring and mostly predictable. There's no point in the remote control. The best reason for this was the best assumption in the bundle. <br /> <br /> I'm all about supporting low budget movies and giving new filmmakers a fair chance, but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer. I just looked at it thanks to a good comment. They must be planted with people related to the film. You can fool people while watching it, but you can't fool them what they saw. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1 instead of 2 because at least the boxer story was trying to be warm from the heart. Of course it failed but he tried. I reserve the worst for the worst for 1 second. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor and set it aside. I wish I had.
