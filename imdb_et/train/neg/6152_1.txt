How many people say it is the "worst film I've ever seen", they tend to say that for almost every movie he didn't like. But almost 700 of the movies I ever remember are one of the two I personally walked into insult and angry. By the way, this is my first movie review and I just registered with IMDb to wreck this movie's badness. I went to see it when it was in theaters (I and my two friends were 5 people out of 5) and in 15 years I don't remember a lot of peculiarities, but my attitude towards leaving the theater is still crystal clear. <br /> <br /> --- Spoiler warning --- <br /> <br /> Oh my start. The fat loser on the altar goes to the ski week, meets the blonde bomb who is interested in her, takes her home, meets with the family, they are all cannibals and she is the main attitude, the pathetic attempt to dramatic escape, hitting all her beat and riding with her brother's girlfriend, they live happily. Vomit. First, the gags are so bad that I took the time to realize they were trying to be FUNNY and that it was COMEDY. Special effects, which are few, look like they were made 15 years earlier. The big dramatic end was so bad and bad that it was almost intolerable to look (he strikes the entire cannibal family with the lawns that stand in the style of Tom and Jerry as they step into them). I'm sure there's a lot, much more, but I have no intention of refreshing it again.
