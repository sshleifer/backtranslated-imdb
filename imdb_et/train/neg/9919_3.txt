At the opening of the "Maltese story", A.Guinness gave such an astonishing resemblance to Noel's coward that I wanted his first words "Certain women need regular, striking - like gongs" or any such world - tired bon mot. his dialogue is hardly a deadly prose, and even the captain would have had trouble putting it into practice. Indeed, Mr Guinness travels through the picture when he searches for a contact point and can't find it. And there's the deadly weakness of the whole movie. Mr. Hawkins also gives up early and reaches the "Jack Hawkins" performance without an individual ounce. It could have been connected to any of the twelve British warfare films. Their schtick has very little purpose. Luftwaffe could not bomb Malta much the same way he could not bring London to his knees. The courage of the Maltese people in the face of the constant threat was recognized by the king and the island was given to George Cross. a worthy subject that could be thought of for the film, but the "Maltese story" does not qualify even the most patronizing in terms of "worthy". willing to live.
