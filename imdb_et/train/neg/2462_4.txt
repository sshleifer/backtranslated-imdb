Well, I like the gore of this movie - it's really unpleasant. Anyone who has been with the dentist knows why. The story is not so bad, the motives of the Corbin Bersen characters make much more meaningful than most of the horror movies. that day is still a bad movie. So it will come down if you enjoy this type of thing or not. I tried to follow the sequel, but it was exactly the same as this movie. Remember, if you enjoy people who are tortured by a dentist, it's a movie for you!
