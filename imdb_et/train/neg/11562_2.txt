The wealthy widow, Anthony Steffen (like Alan Cunningham), is a Sadomocratic lover and British Lord. She brings her castle sexy red hair women, where she whips and murders them. The black-booted stripper Erika Blanc (if Susie) gets away temporarily. Mr. Steffen is haunted by the dead woman "Evelyn". Like therapy, she decides to marry again, having met a pretty blonde Marina Malfat (like Gladys). At the end of the film, they still have to dig a few graves. "Night Evelyn Cave Out of the Grave" is a great title, at least. <br /> <br /> ** La Notte Che Evelyn Usc√¨ Dalla Tomba (1971) Emilio Miraglia ~ Anthony Steffen, Marina Malfatti, Erika Blanc
