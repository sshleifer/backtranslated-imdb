I have rarely witnessed such a free donation. The film about this hopeless sex is almost nothing constructive to say. What some interesting directions the film seems to allow are initially little more than red herring. Important actors - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - are placed in roles that go far; a random gene director produces a film that looks like it's filmed with a coffee-colored lens; The writer (John Grisham), who has never earned anything, discovered new depths of motivated inconsistency. The film has a cheap, bright feel - but hardly at the commentary level - it's really part of aesthetic. I usually came to IMDb to write balanced, generally evaluative comments. This film-threatening catastrophe makes me to endlessly infamous. I don't want to, but only because I don't want to take this "garbage" anymore.
