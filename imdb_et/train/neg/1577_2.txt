The classic story of the glowing passion of the 1997 film table has achieved its well-deserved legendary status, one of the greatest catches of the famous and hopeless love screen. The proliferation, constant and progressive magnetism between Judge Reinhold and its name is surely certain that many of the hearts of the viewer will capture the memories of their first destruction. The stylish scenario hides this embryonic attitude in front of the audience, sitting so that it is an abstract, almost expressionistic cinematography that focuses on just below-the-surface desires that guide and flow between principals. You can reduce the sexual tension of the boring tire of iron. <br /> <br /> A small look at the sweat at the end of the nose catches the bright sun and leaves no doubt about its importance. Such scenes are abundant, and again and again. Like "Jane Eyre" and "Rebecca" (to which this masterpiece is so often compared), like the faces of the actors, when they experience great love for that non-non-being, slowly worship you forever. <br /> <br /> Now the classic RC sound track, whose creative and unique use is a solo synthesizer, emphasizes emotions that drip like a leaking crankcase. <br /> <br /> If I had any criticism at all of what I consider to be a small mistake (and I dared to risk the anger of millions of fans that hug this classics), I would say that "Runaway Car" is characterized by this sexual tension - is briefly broken by a scene close to the road, which now, after repeated views, seems just over (and probably even unnecessary?) the story of an eternal, bitter love interruption. <br /> <br /> Dare I move forward to perceive as a minor mistake the critically acclaimed triumph of contemporary cinema? "Citizen Kane" was "Rosebud". . . "Runaway Car" should also have its own password. Perhaps the film would have been opened by extreme judge Reinhold, who says that something like "the car is the extension of its owner!" And the rest of the story could be devoted to every syllable, nuance and nuance of this phrase. . If this plot had been made, this movie, Titanic, would have been added to the golden globes this year, I'm sure. That I didn't read the novel first.
