This unhappy movie is a remake of the 1927 film. They should have kept it that way. <br /> <br /> What a colossal bomb! Douglas Fairbanks doesn't show any charisma here. Cesar Romero plays the role of a real jerk and Bette Grable in the choir - what I do in Hungarian! <br /> <br /> A ridiculous plot with a woman in a picture of the castle in 1561 Rome, who saved the day, killing the conqueror. (Fairbanks) Now, more than 300 years later, when Grable, who is married to Count Romero, is in a similar situation when his wedding day has an invasion of Hungarian soldiers. Romero acts as a coward and flees before the army arrives. He hides himself as a gypsy and remains in the castle if his violin game likes Fairbanks. The end is worse than the whole wretched film when Grable meets Fairbanks to tell him good news - the raged Romero has canceled the marriage. a veteran player who is in it died in 1949; it must be his last movie. What a bomb that goes out after such an outstanding career. <br /> <br /> Walter Abel's characters, but he can do little to write such a poor man. Costumes look like those coming from the Stone Age. I don't understand what Fairbanks wore.
