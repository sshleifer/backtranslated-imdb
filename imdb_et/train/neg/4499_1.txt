Every movie with Karen Allen's nude scenes and I'm still so bored, walk, it's smelly! <br /> <br /> Karen is stuck in Paris and interacts with a friendly French man with whom she will soon be sex. Of course he is married ("But, cheri, why should this be a problem?") What could be an interesting clash of cultures is (believe it or not) just a dull. I went out. <br /> <br /> The film may have been much better after leaving. but it should have been much better to make up for the rotten start. <br /> <br /> My advice, if you find yourself in it, drive, don't walk, exit. Save your time and energy. Most will definitely save you money. The shame is that the production plant does not save its money.
