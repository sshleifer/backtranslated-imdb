My favorite quote from Crow was when the car was off the shore, "The movie is so bad, even the car wants to get out of it!" <br /> <br /> It had to be the most fun movie I have ever seen. It was serious to scare you, which makes it even more fun! If it weren't for the Mystery Science Theater, I wouldn't be here today! :-P
