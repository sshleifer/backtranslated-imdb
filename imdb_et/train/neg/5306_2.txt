OK, I'm blessed. I've seen two very strong productions, the original cast in New York and the other San Diego Repi (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, rock!). Compared to both, the film is almost invisible. I've been through a DVD for the last two nights and I'm not ready yet. Too many remote dialogues and too many added scenes and people. Yes, the four main performances are pretty good, esp. Ms. Streep is. But comparing the film with the film is certainly an example of "less is more". The thickening of the games to meet the needs of the film's visitor for the diversity and specificity of the film was a bad choice. Please, please, find a stage near you on the stage.
