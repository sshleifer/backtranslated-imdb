"Cement" is a bad film from a bad police (Penn), which has a bad attitude and a bad disposition with a bad boy in a bad direction until his cajones are quickly drying in concrete. While we are waiting for the cement to dry out and find out the film, we regularly run back over time with no rhyme or reason so we can see the events that lead to cement. Any boring junk, "Cement", suffers from a lack of story, clumsy performance, and the most common film mistakes; no reason to care. At best, a timid man for needy potatoes. (D +)
