After watching The Bodyguard last night, I felt compelled to overwrite it. <br /> <br /> It could have been a pretty decent movie if it hadn't been a terrible camera job. It was annoying. The corners were all wrong, nothing could be seen, especially during the fighting sequences. The neighborhoods were even horrible. <br /> <br /> The story is Sonny Chiba himself hired as a bodyguard for anyone who wants to take him to the top of the drug. She is approached by Judy Lee, who is never quite straight with Chiba. Lee's involvement in the drug circuit is deeper than Chiba's thinking, because Mob and the other gangli band are after him. <br /> <br /> The story was decent and, despite the terrible duplication, it would have been a good movie. Given the better direction and editing, I am sure it would have been the classic Kung Foo movie. As it is, it's more like the second 70's cheesy 70's movie. <br /> <br /> Note: The opening sequence is quoted by quotation from quoted "Pulp Fiction" fans and then continued in the karate school in Times Square, somehow related to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
