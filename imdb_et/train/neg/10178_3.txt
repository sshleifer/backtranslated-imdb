How did I evaluate this sequel? All this is throwing balls! Worst of all, it's not even comparable to the first part of the series! Comedy is not funny. Where did all the involuntary laughs go? Sufficient slapstick on-the-field action goes too long. Bob Uecker literally recorded a complete nine inning shutdown. What's next, 4th main story: BACK TO LITTLE LEAGUE? Maybe it could be! Leave it on the shelf and plan your trip to the All-Star Game. It was three beats too much.
