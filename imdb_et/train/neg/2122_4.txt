Although in some respects the seven pounds are solid and interesting in some narrative style, the Gabriele Muccino project is rather mediocre. The film becomes more tender and manipulative when it comes to the end: the hearts of human and emotional, the eyes physically and metaphorically. The seven pounds are rather Alejandro Gonzálezi Iñárritu Amores Perros and 21 grams of amateur imitation with lots of setbacks. The problem is that the story is very predictable through the movie. It is too bad because seven pounds could have been so "good" if Ben and Emily were put in the right hands.
