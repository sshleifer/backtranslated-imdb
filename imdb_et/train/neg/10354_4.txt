I browsed Netflix and stumbled upon this movie. As a pleasant memory of a book as a child, I decided to review it. This is a movie that should really convey. <br /> <br /> It's not just worth it. It's very boring and uninteresting. I think it would be so small for kids. He has no magic that the book contains. This movie is not terrible, but you won't find it despite ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There are moments that are just as weird. The character of witches is not very good. The family works like it's not the big thing that these strange things happen. I know it's a children's film, so if the older audience doesn't have to look at things too deeply, but the whole movie feels like it's written and produced by people who have never experienced a movie experience before. <br /> <br /> The DVD I had missed in the last moments of the movie, rather than trying to fix it, I just turned it off and sent it back to Netflix. I really don't care how it ended. Leave this movie out and read the book.
