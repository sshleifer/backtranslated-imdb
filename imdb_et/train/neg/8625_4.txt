In the unlikely event that some wishing directors read these comments, I would like to offer some advice (free!) From the viewer's perspective. If you want to make a serious exotic adventure movie, do it. If you want to make exotic adventure movies fraud, go ahead. DO NOT try to do both at the same time, it will not work. For example, if a funny "comic relief" is killed and thrown and after the monkey shakes the tree and drops the coconut on the cannibal head, it sees you had no idea what kind of movie you want to make. It's boring, prone, inexpensive, racist .... you get the picture. A few clever moments and a few glances about nudity Kathy Dush (here's too prissy) is worth the effort. There is a reason why everyone has forgotten the existence of this movie. (* 1/2)
