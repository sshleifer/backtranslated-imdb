The IMDb plot summary in no way describes the nature of this film. It should have read: "Be prepared to come back from your family's church to the tertiary prison at the age of 8, listening to the preacher drone about God's will, if everything you think is home to your Lego." <br /> <br /> It starts well with intent, building intrigue, planting some real and surreal tips, such as Renny, how did my thumb heal so fast? at the moment. Then it slowly becomes a Christian jambor, sacrificing its plot to completely wash the evangelical-induced bomb. I believe I read the word "prayer" about 53 times in a five minute period. After 31 years, I tried to turn the context of this word to my synonym for "prey". Unfortunately, my little spiritual game made it acceptable for at least 20 minutes. The plus made me laugh when the character tells me "prayer" ("preyer" for me) because it became completely zanyika. Indeed, even my Catholic wife drowned in her chair almost as long as she reached the floor. <br /> <br /> For all the brilliant Christians who ranks 8-10 stars in this movie, I recommend sticking to your theological standards that strengthen your theology, such as Circle Square, Ten Commandments, Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar, and the like. Stay away from unfairly complicated topics in films such as Jesus' Camp, God who wasn't there, what Jesus bought or soon to be released Religulous. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Robert Whitlow's book is better.
