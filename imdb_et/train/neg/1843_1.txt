Wow. Just terrible. I was an original movie fan and surprisingly sat part 2, 3 and healed. 4.5 and Freddy's dead were pretty bad. But nothing is as bad as Freddy's nightmares. Freddy is the host of this series of Rod Serlingesq. <br /> <br /> I can accept how Freddy got one punch after another, but at least in the movies Freddy called for movies, but here they were so bad, they saw like horror high school productions. Poor participants, if you really want to name yourself, after this exhibition was done, they were just what they paid for. I'm almost sure it was the stop for two types of actors. Those who started the Hollywood ladder right now are brand new who want to take any part that would make the pornography they offered last week or experienced actors on the way to a Hollywood ladder who wants to take any part that they would not have taken the porn work they offered last week. <br /> <br /> I waited halfway for Dana Platon's guest star, but she was already dead at the time of production. <br /> <br /> When parsing Nancy's line in the original Elm St: "What you never want to sleep on."
