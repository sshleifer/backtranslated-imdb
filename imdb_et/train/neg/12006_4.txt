OK, the director reinstates love in reality Director Nikhil Advan after debuting with KHNH makes his second party and waits <br /> <br /> He makes 3:30 hours + a movie that loses patience, time.etc Viewer seems to be 3 hours asleep watching it movie. <br /> <br /> OK, they had 6 stories so it was necessary, but why? 6 Story? <br /> <br /> We have a convincing story of Anil-Juh, but are bored television shows showing such stories? <br /> <br /> We have a Govinda-Shannon story that is funny and works well <br /> <br /> We have the Akshaye-Ayesha story again, but soon it will be boring and more focused on comedy and that too tedious boring comedy <br /> <br /> We have a Salman-Priyanka story, which is the worst, not just the act of doing, it makes no sense at all. <br /> <br /> We have the story of Sohail-Isha to laugh and trick you from time to time thanks to the boredom of most other stories <br /> <br /> We have a good story of John-Vidya in all aspects story <br /> <br /> But when all the stories come in bits, the viewer is boring and sleepy. especially the Salman-Priyanka story summit Nikhil Advan's handling is inappropriate, some stories are well handled, but in places weak Music (SEL) is good, but too many songs in cinematography are nice, every story is given a different look, texture and it works <br /> <br /> Actors Govinda's rocks, after bouncing back to BB, make him really laugh and love him in this movie, despite his age and weight Anil Kapoor works well in his looks and tired of John's prominent, Akshaye Khanna out of change. <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is too up and Isha has nothing to do with Anjana Sukna's dismissal <br /> <br /> Priyanka and Salman deserve the prize of this movie that you are shocked by? <br /> <br /> Salman Khan does not only work but talks as he is asleep and that fake accent oh god Priyanka crosses a standard you feel you throw at him, eventually gets better Vidya Balan is good, Driver Chawla is okay Shannon is okay
