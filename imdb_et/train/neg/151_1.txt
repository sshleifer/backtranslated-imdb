It's really terrible. <br /> <br /> The only redemption function for this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie I've ever watched, I would have the right answer. <br /> <br /> I think it's filmed 35 mm so it's already sticky like hell. I wouldn't have bothered to comment, but I noticed that some fans (probably related to the film) had argued that it was the best film after the Matrix. Let me destroy myths and lies. <br /> <br /> There's nothing good in the movie. Everything shouts sticky. The actor is ugly. Fighting choreography is the worst I've ever seen. Fighting scenes are incredibly amateurish. Imagine a girl who comfortes her hand around the circle helplessly and gives the weak beat that does not harm the kitten. Obviously, the director simply pulled people out of the street to give them roles in the film. <br /> <br /> I know that the director did not have a lot of budget for the film, but even better films have been made in a smaller budget earlier. Unforgivable.
