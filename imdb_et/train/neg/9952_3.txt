Just sent an email to a friend who is in the film school about this flick. Something that needs to be avoided when the filmmakers bluff the meaningless, overwhelmed, twisted monologues on the screen, which is ultimately fine and convincing. When the film is a test of social realism, these verbal barriers are so upright that they really draw attention to the film designed for the film and neutralize its purpose. Is it an act or script that is bad or both? <br /> <br /> The winner is also incredibly incredible for social realism - the cleverly consuming canonical English literature and the Bible in high or hungry times and capable of producing such. thoroughly sophomoric soliloquies while drunk? And how is such an unpleasant, unwashed and verbally harmful character that is able to meet most of the women you meet within minutes? (I had to praise if one of the chicks was thrown out of him on the street, despite his plywood and torture). <br /> <br /> The viewer encounters different references to ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the book of revelation. The impending death of mankind as barcodes, printed on our forehead or better hands in a terrible biblical way, is presented to a character who has been safely exhibited as a guardian of his empty space. <br /> <br /> This flick is superscriptive and top - a melodrama that is infused with pedestrian "philosophy" about the meaning of humanity, life, and so on. It's small, burnt and annoying. <br /> <br /> There are some very good English movies with content similar to this movie. "Nil by Mouth" is a great, much more interesting excursion in people's life in a similar social milieu. Dotto "In Warzone". And even though the comparison is not even justified, look at something from Peter Greenaway who deals much more skillfully, in dialogue, with meaninglessness and absurdity.
