Man, it was fun. It should be COMEDY. Or STUPID. It would have realized what this bunch was a lot easier. Seriously? I want someone involved in this movie to be obliged to come into effect immediately. For everyone who thinks about watching this "movie", let's go over some plot points. Wait, wait. There is none. There is no literal sense. I think Casper Van Dien was bored and he decided to film with some casual and wonderful, somehow he got a video tape. This film is literally the slowest film. Don't believe me? Look at it. Do it, man. I dare you. But be prepared to get your eyes out. If you can sit through the cow, you are very strong and brave.
