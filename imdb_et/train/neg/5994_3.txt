OK .. this movie could have been so good! All generations have been in contact with Thunderbirds and have come to love it, and this film was about some of the qualities that could be found on a movie of good horror. The handicraft itself and the Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen, while they still continued the design we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was just fantastic because Lady P and Bill Paxton, though not exactly what I was looking at, were a strong creature of Jeff Tracey ... but then the adult was taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe the 200-year-olds could fly 200 tons of machines . <br /> <br /> This is not so much about the fact that the film focused on the children who made me feel Jonathon Frakes was killing me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard-earned money on the film that Alan Tracey was in the movie so unpleasant and that he seemed so capable of both machines and his brother ... who were at least 19/20. Seriously, these are some pretty fucking simple machines to use when it is. <br /> <br /> The film didn't know if he wanted to be serious or far away. Instead, he tried to pay tribute to satirization and it just fell on his face. 3/10 (2 machines, 1 Lady P)
