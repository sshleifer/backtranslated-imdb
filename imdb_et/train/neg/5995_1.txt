This is a really terrible movie. What they've done is a TV show that was never targeted at small children and gave him the treatment of George Lucas (ie destroyed it by having a child to turn to a younger audience). <br /> <br /> OK, so the Thunderbirds TV show wasn't the most brain, but it was pretty formal, but it was always nice to watch (especially when the models were blown) and it wasn't too bad. <br /> <br /> It suffers from bad wrong and bad behavior (remarkable exceptions to Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope and Ron Cook as Parker who seem to be the only cast members who have a clue how to play their characters) & I don't let Frakes get direct traffic. <br /> <br /> Thunderbird's whole idea was that it was the whole Tracy family and how they worked as a team, prevented disasters, or escaped the people involved. <br /> <br /> Avoid this garbage as a plague. <br /> <br /> I only give 1 out of 10 because a zero rating is not supported.
