I had a lot of problems with this movie. <br /> <br /> It contains basic factual data about quantum mechanics that is good. Although quantum physics has been around for over 50 years, the film presents this information in a grandiose way that seems to have said, "Have you not been blown for that? Well, not really. These are not revelatory revelations. In any case, I was already familiar with quantum theory and the fact that particles should be described by wave equations, etc., is not new. <br /> <br /> The main problem I have with this movie is how these people use quantum theory as a scientific basis for mysticism and spirituality. I have no serious problem with mysticism and spirituality, but quantum mechanics has nothing to do with these things and should be kept separate. The people they interviewed for this film start with the ideas of quantum theory and then jump to say that just thinking about something that can be changed around them, so we should think positively that we would have a positive impact on the world and make our lives better. The reasoning is completely ridiculous and the conclusions do not logically follow from quantum theory. There are a lot of theoretically physicists who would completely agree with each of the so-called "experts" they interviewed about this film. They would quite rightly emphasize that the unpredictability of the subatomatic world does not support mystical perceptions of our spiritual connection. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that people see this movie and eat it completely because it leaves them with a pleasant positive feeling. The main function of the film is based on a complete misinterpretation of quantum theory, and it is as meaningful as any attempt to justify organized religion with similar pseudo-scientific arguments. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yes. At one point, one of the "experts" says that, since most of the assumptions made by people about the world have been false in all history, the assumptions that we have about the world today are probably wrong. Ah? It does not follow. And even if he did, I don't see how his argument helps. I mean, if his ideas have become general prerequisites, I think we should expect them to be wrong, based on their reasoning.
