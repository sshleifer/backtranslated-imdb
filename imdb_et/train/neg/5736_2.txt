This is one of the worst films I've seen for years! You can accidentally interrupt 5 people from the streets and they could do better than anyone in this movie. An absolute waste of time. I just gave it to 2 as I like the movies, but it's just normal garbage. Acting (and I use this term VERY loosely) is exhausting, someone please tell me that the 5 main participants made their first movie? Don't waste your time looking at it. The hostel was in some way a better movie. I can't believe anyone has spent that money, I hope manufacturers will only do it for $ 50,000 - it looks like a school project made by kids who have no idea. Did it even make a cinema?
