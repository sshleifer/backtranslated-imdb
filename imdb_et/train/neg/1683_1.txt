It's hard to call The Grudge a horror movie. At best, it made me jump a little from the moment. <br /> <br /> When you forget (unsuccessful) the scary dimension and look at other aspects of the film, it is disappointed again. Operation is OK, but not great. The story may be somewhat interesting at first, while one tries to do it. But the end is understood to have little to understand. "Scary" elements sometimes appear without adding a script for no reason ... <br /> <br /> So ... (wake up) Look at this movie if you don't have anything interesting, like cutting carrots looking at clouds.
