This is just the answer to yahoo who says this film is more realistic than the classic genre that defines MASTERPIECE jaws. Yes, brain, large white (and other shark species, pull, black tip, ocean's white tip, tiger) are known to be inhabited in areas where light catches are found. People don't do this menu often, it's given, but the film's shark was repeatedly highlighted by abnormal behavior. It's not like it never happened. The probability that a killer whale destroys almost the entire city, distinguishing human dignity, has fallen several dozen thick fermented North Atlantic fishing vessels, and knowing that certain people, all of the above-mentioned "nemesis" friends, are close enough to it, are so thin to be ridiculous. Similar to splitting jaws. It's ridiculous. It is known that large white sharks often chew on boats, protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards as they look like the gaskets below. Hai Bruce's size (if you don't know, look it up) would be more than able to sink into a boat like Orca (hey! This is the filthy hanging name we're talking about!) It weighs 6,000 pounds. I could go ahead, but I don't have to do it. Jaws are amazing (better actions, better effects, better music, better writing), Orca is nonsense (jaw bursts, fun written writing, terrible effects, the most laughable plot of Olson Twins.) This is not taken by Columbia University masters. Watch better movies.
