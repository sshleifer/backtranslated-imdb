Headed like "Killer Tomatoes" attack! " Everyone is waiting for this, either: a) a bad science fiction film or b) a comedy that makes fun of bad science fiction. It should be a combination of both, with the parody dose shaken. Unfortunately, it falls very quickly. <br /> <br /> You should never take this movie seriously, I know it, but I think it's funny, right? I only found some jokes or situations that were funny (ie phone calls side by side, Russian Olympic spy eating steroid cereals, Superman walking with Lois, etc.). "Killer's Tomato Attack" is trying to be a cult classic, but it doesn't. A cult class is a film that is so different that it is only understood by a selected group of people (or a similar description). The "Killer Tomato Attack" could be enjoyed by every 8-year-old who has a bad sense of humor, so it doesn't qualify as a cult film. <br /> <br /> There's one good actor's whole thing: Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild. She is a thin, gawky reporter, but has a loving personality, loves exaggeration and is a natural comedy. Unfortunately, he is being misused here. <br /> <br /> "Killer Tomato Attack" is not as funny as saying "Amazon Women on the Moon" or "Kentucky Fried Movie", but you have some fun moments so I would recommend it again to see. Avoid the director's paragraph, the film producer has interrupted and some supposedly "lost" film material dubbed in the pretense of the African dialect (can be found in English from the print tape).
