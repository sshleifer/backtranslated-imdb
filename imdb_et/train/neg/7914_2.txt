This movie was a burst movie, and it is really. This is the type of film that is intended for eating popcorn and flashy graphics. With that in mind, the film, not so glowing Iron Man, gives it a good job. Outside of popcorn munching and special effects, the film shoots faster than Wile E. Coyote. <br /> <br /> Many viewers, including myself, complain about how most of the symbols are seriously altered, but that makes the film just a poor adaptation, not a poor movie. This film is not satisfactory for other reasons. The creators focused more on making it more attractive than they did in their minds. Long awaited and advertised characters are reduced from 4 scenes. Wolverine, Victor Creed's main characters (once called Sabertooth) and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by Liev Schriber's performance. The rest of the characters are thrown out to make all the important eye candies. Wolverine's character is fully developed in 30 minutes, as does Sabertooth, although Victor pulls some surprises at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The final boss is a twisted and perverse customization. The original character and barely any progress can be made to show why it is as it is. The filmmakers probably thought that everything they really needed was to create a bad ass character that could do something they wanted, and was called a popular sign. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ...
