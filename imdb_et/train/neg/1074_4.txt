I would never have started and stopped this movie after 3/4. I was really botched to the end. This movie was disappointing because it could have been so much better. It was a nice atmosphere, top spirits and director, good places. But the baaaa story, the bad script. I paid attention to Kenneth Branagh's southern accent - it was better than a script. The plot was stupid - it was driven by unrealistic and unlikely ways. Nobody acts like this outside Hollywood scripts.
