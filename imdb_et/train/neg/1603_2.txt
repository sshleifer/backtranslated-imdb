Had it not been helpless for Barry Diamond and Art Evans, I would have no reason to recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> The plot centers are at a 10-year high school meeting in an expected abandoned high school (similar to the low-budget horrors of the 1950s), and a class-fought student drew a very traumatic sequence. This student wants to destroy the whole class for revenge. <br /> <br /> John Hughes falls in love with his characters because only one student is killed, as well as lunch (Goonies' Anne Ramsey). We have believed that the horny combined will die, but never see a broken thing! This is a terrible film that continued the National Lampoon downward spiral in the 80s and 90s.
