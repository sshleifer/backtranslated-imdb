There are some things in this film that go beyond the bat. Taking Dani Filti as the leading actor, this person starts making such a movie. True, I love Filthle of Filth and listened to the soundtrack of this movie long before I watched it. Dani Filth is a very recognizable character and a great leader. The film's independent filming style fits a very horrible factor. There are some GORGEOUS actors in this movie. For the small budget, the special effects were not bad either. The ways people were killed were very creative and spooky. Very little has been said about this movie, making it so little for the development of character. It is hard to fear fear for static life. Speaking a little, the F bomb was rich, opening up randomly. Yes, I understand that people swear, but it seems that the preteen boy wrote it and thought he was leaving for the whole language. The story I got out of it was pretty good, though many parts have been hanging and the lack of conversation often makes me think what's going on. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the deviation of fear is similar to porn for people who love sex and violence, but like porn that tries to pull a story, it just doesn't work too well. However, rent it if you are a sick person who wants your blood and meat appetite.
