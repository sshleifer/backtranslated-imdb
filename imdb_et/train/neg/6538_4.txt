Reading my review of the HOUSE, which showed that many may expect me to be 14 years old, who thinks SCREAM is considered a "classic" horror. It is not because I am 30 years old and have been watching horror films for most of my life. Of course, I'm a child of 80's who grew up in charm / zombie / ghost / cannibal etc etc. Types of horror movies - so I would usually prefer horror movies that are more graphic and work faster. Just like someone who appreciates different music, painting or a movie in such a case but may not like it, I can understand why some people can enjoy this movie ... I just don't ... <br /> <br /> WARNING WHO IS SENT, is an extremely boring and tedious film that speaks of a school designed for distant girls. The school's heavy bitch has to rule with the iron by hand (or in some cases whip) to reach the girls. She has a young son who slips around and falls on the girls when they shower (not less (?!?) ... in their nightgowns), and in the meantime girls disappear from school because they are victims of the murderer. Hiding around the campus ... <br /> <br /> I see why the ECONOMY USED is compared to SUSPIRIA (which I think is the masterpiece of the movie) school itself and the relationship between the girls and their guardians - but this movie is so boring and uneven, I barely woke up. I'm all about "tensions" and "arrests" in horror movies - but this movie wasn't for me. Luckily, I didn't expect that much of this was going to happen, so I can't say I was really disappointed - the HOUSE, WHEN USED, just reinforced the fact that I personally don't get the most fears of the older ones. 70s. This is not a difficult and fast rule, but those I have had seem to be more of an exception. Probably terrible for fans who enjoy more undervalued and adventurous horror movies, "black-it", but because I don't really know too many fans of such material, I can't recommend it ... 4/10
