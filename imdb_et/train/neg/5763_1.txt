However, like so many of his recent decisions, it was a very amazing mistake. <br /> <br /> The director is not sufficiently involved with today's audience trying to bring back physical exercise and fun instead of funny dialogue. disaster. I knew it, the audience knew it and CAST knew it. <br /> <br /> What a shame, why did they ever consider changing drivers? Not only that, but two Wayan brothers played two of the four primary characters without being a farce and a sad one. <br /> <br /> SP <br /> <br />
