I knew it would be, but I gave it to some smiling and maybe pointless fun. Anyone who reads some of my reviews will see that I'm pretty easy. I really didn't think I knew it negatively about it. <br /> <br /> Plot is about an ancient dragons army led by a big snake that destroys the world when some selected heroes who inherited responsibility can be? to become one? a good dragon? or something?? I do not know. It was so stupid, I didn't bother to keep that much. <br /> <br /> It has a really stupid story full of ridiculous moments and silly concepts. So many events just felt completely random and sudden. <br /> <br /> I assume there was a studio disorder or something because the biggest problem I have is that the story seems to have tried to be so big and epic, but everything happens so fast and goes so fast. I feel like I have just hit a million point and action sequences in one big ball. The film is like a face. It does not take much time to create characters or drama. Imagine the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy in 90 minutes? You may have most epic battles, but there would be absolutely no accumulation and you would not care about the results of these battles. Was that like Dragon Wars? 90 minutes I was not crapped, waiting for it to be over. <br /> <br /> Fantastic CGI, with some right instructions, but terrible action, fast paced and stupid narration made it very difficult. . I would probably have loved it when I was 6 years old.
