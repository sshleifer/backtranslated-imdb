I found this movie an interesting study of cause-and-effect, but a little more. The basic piece follows a handful of people's lives and how their actions (intentional and otherwise) affect the lives of others. The film's premise is a great promise, but I feel that it can't fulfill its promise. It takes too much time for the audience to talk about chaos theory and too little time for it. As a result, I could never feel any character and did not make an emotional connection with them. At the end of the film, I had just such an attitude. A stronger direction in character development would have made this movie big, but as it is, it's just that
