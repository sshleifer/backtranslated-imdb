I tried to like this program; I really did. I even bought a pilot film, first on VHS and later on DVD. But I couldn't get into this story because his two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) just seemed in love alone. I admit that there was some clever dialogue at the exhibition, which was an important part of the success of television programs, and I appreciated this dialogue a lot. Basically, it was almost like a comedy between men and women in the 30s and 40s. You get a lot of allegations, accusations, yelling and shouting. Many people probably love such a hit, but I hate it, so I never got on a moonlight wagon. <br /> <br /> Only Allyce Beasley as an unhappy aide "Agnes" was fun. It is too bad that he had such a small air time. Shepherd was eye-catching and I think women would say the same to Willis, but too many argued that the two would eventually come out.
