An attempt to baptize those who do not know the opera, using the fame of the greatest opera singers of all time, fails. All that is desirable in this movie is opera, and it is best to find a Pavarotti recording, doing what it does best. A doctor revolves around the plot, healing his throat, which has suddenly become cumbersome. <br /> <br /> Just because it came so long ago, it has been largely forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a dignified actor and has a part to play on his stage talent and nothing he does in this film deny this opinion. His fault is that the fear script is not rejected. Maybe because big operas can have stupid stories that he promised. <br /> <br /> Who knows, except those who are involved? Do we have to know? <br /> <br /> The plot is weak and tiny. This film is similar to piercing a cold sludge to remove some succulent tidbits (opera music) that are above the mud. We have other ways to evaluate the great Pavarotti, and that's not one of them. Just get one of his many great opera or vocal concerts and admit the captain where he is most suitable. <br /> <br /> It would be one of the 100 worst movies of IMDb when more people remembered and given him some votes; it would fit properly in a list that includes a number of efforts by singers, actors, models, and athletes to use their popularity through the film. It very often goes wrong because of incompetent actions or terrible scripts. Pavarotti would have been a decent actor if he hadn't shown such an excellent voice. But his actor is effective (opera requires it), not even Jimmy Stewart could have saved this turkey script. <br /> <br /> I give him fifty-ten because someone has become a fan of Pavarotti's song and opera because of this movie.
