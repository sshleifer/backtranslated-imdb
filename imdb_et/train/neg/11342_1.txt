I should explain why I gave this ... "artwork" with 1 star possible 10. Just because it is difficult or impossible to judge this impartiality. probably it would have been the same if I had given it 10/10 - would have followed the explanations. <br /> <br /> I don't like these pointless movies like HOSTEL or so - I think it's nasty and beautiful terrible (in all contextual contexts), but when I discovered after watching this movie, there is a genre called "historical drama" - and probably it would have been the case for 10/10 because it has a lot of it and Tarantino would have been more than happy with it (and made Kill Bill 3 to remove even more blood from the screen to show that it is possible). The "historical drama" genre, however, is that it is a sub-category of "trash bins" where John Romero is an indigenous emperor-emperor, and so it cannot be automatically evaluated as a default movie - because these are purposeful movies and you can't really say whether the comic bad the moment was meant so, or it was just bad. it is for people who want to enjoy the bad show, the bad scenario and the bad thing else. And some kind of religion - I'm one of them. there are days when I have a desire to see a very bad movie and look for some trash and here you go - the day is saved! but this is definitely my opinion and it does not fit any other. <br /> <br /> I wanted to say that if you want to watch a terrible movie, Fellini Casanova is definitely a choice, but listen to my advice and don't rate it by default.
