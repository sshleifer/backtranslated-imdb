Generally, I do not make any drawbacks and if this site could make this movie out of 10 out of 10, this movie really means hate. I thought Uwe Boll was the worst thing I've ever seen in the dark, but at least I gave it to 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion (Stephen Dorff didn't let me laugh so I was a little bit pricey). Hell, if it were compared to bloodrayne, would win the Oscar for the best movie at Bloodrayne. <br /> <br /> By now, this movie is about a BTK killer that has been doing well. The beginning seemed OK, but it was that I had to move most of it fast because death is boring. I like killer films and even if they suck, they still get some cool deaths. I am not a fictional film expert, but believe me that he would have seen himself when he saw it. Sorry for the surprise, but there's nothing good to say about it, because someone seems to have taken a video camera and filmed it ... this ... disaster. Uwe Boll's movies are no longer on my worst movie listings, which it ever took for a cake. <br /> <br /> Well, I couldn't explain the plot (if it was), but it was the best I could. Now, if you don't mind, I'm climbing into the corner and moving back and forth and reminding me of how bad this film is frightening me for life.
