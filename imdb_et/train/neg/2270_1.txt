The only thing that kept me from seeing this movie about vomiting was that these are just actors and not an exhibition that usually appears on TV. This is also the main reason why TV show fans do not like the film, but not the only reason. This film has about as much entertainment value as a root canal. It is approaching the depths of bad film making and becomes even worse. I don't waste your time describing this movie in more detail; it is enough to say that I want the poor camera people who had to suffer this first time.
