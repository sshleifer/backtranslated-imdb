Gods, I haven't been watching a movie that has been awfully long. Maybe not from The New Guy or from different Freddie Prinze Jr movies. Yeah, that's amazingly awful. Mira Sorvino's empty and woody people must be inspired by Freddie. The production of the film was inconvenient (like a game, rather, the birth does not seem good on the film). The participants didn't know what they were doing, especially Sorvin. His accent was terrible and his sexual complaint here was lacking, so it was painful to see that he "seducing" other signs and they "fall" for it. And what was with the live audience of lawns? Nonsense! I needed to turn off the DVD player, it would have been the pain of self-finishing.
