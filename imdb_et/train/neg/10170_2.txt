The Championship game is only a few days, but New Orleans things are not as they should be. From the players who have marriage problems with drug overdose, gambling problems, life loses life that should be memorable, wonderful time. Can things be repeated and the killer stopped before the big game is destroyed? <br /> <br /> Despite what you think of Superdome's first reading, it's not a football movie. In fact, football is more than a piece of equipment and aftertaste. Instead, Superdome is one of those weak soap opera-70s that live in Hollywood, is beens and those that never are. Cast dreams go through, because nobody really looks good. The best (or worst) example is Van Johnson in a very small role that is generally lost, why he is there. The plot is boring, uninteresting and incredible. Donna Mills has hit a "man"? Yeah, of course! It's about as plausible as the thing he has soaked with water with David Jansen. The film also lacks pace. I'm trying to get all four or five stories that the Superdome stream has on the movie. Superdome does not reach an outstanding drama or distance because it is a very bad example of a 70's TV movie. My single highlight was the late Charlie Jones - an athlete I didn't listen to. The cheerful way in which he crosses New Orleans to intrigue and overpay is pure cheese at his best. <br /> <br /> Like most others who have seen Superdome, I also made the Mystery Science Theater 3000. It may be one of the episodes of public access to KTMA, but it is one of the best examples of the beginning of exhibitions. So while I've only rated Superdome 2/10, I give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
