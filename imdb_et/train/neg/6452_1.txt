You know that story. Pretty kids alone in the forest when BAM! Something's going to cut them down. <br /> <br /> Well, this mess is no different. Brother disappeared many years ago.Nastly "UNKOWN CREATURE" stars that cut them, and their only help is a doctor / biker. <br /> <br /> That this movie is bad is an underestimation, it's puzzled! Action was terrible. <br /> <br /> The creature seemed very exciting. And like all the movies these days, they're trying to twist you, what they don't do! <br /> <br /> This movie has one bright spot - LOST star Maggie Grace as a female leader.
