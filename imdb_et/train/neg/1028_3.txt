I don't remember the last time I reacted so emotionally as I did with Justin Timberlake in Edison. I got so emotional that I wanted to feel scared, to destroy the screen, to easily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism. Timberlake has terribly failed; In fact, his casting is like the leadership of Andy Dick in "Patton" to play a leading role or Nathan Lane to play Jesus. But it is near the same point. <br /> <br /> Timberlake is just a bad actor and he would be just as terrible. I had problems with Ben Affleck's ability to act, but Timberlake looks like Affleck like Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench. His metrosexual lisp (read litit), his boy's eyes and emotional expressions resulting from "25 cliché expressions to actresses" poison the screen he has mercilessly produced, and no matter how you cut it. not and will not buy his role as a journalist responsible for amateur-turned crusaders. It just doesn't run. <br /> <br /> Timberlake alone is not to blame for his failure. Director David J. Burke puts him not only (basically) in his primary role, but also sets him aside Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes and (I'm surprised he was so good) LL Cool J I can imagine that one is almost physically suffering when you look at some of this casting with Timberlake. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is upwards: at the moment when any of these actors do not work with Justin, it seems to be a double relief. Fun if you want it. Freeman and Spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of time with each other, but ten minutes are blissful, unlike their scenes, our hero. Dylan McDermott is also a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br /> But with enough Timberlake bashing - words are not enough in this case to do the trick. "Edison" is a very tiring story of corruption. The extent of this plot ranges from clichés to mere redundancy. However, I admire the motivation to do that as a tribute to movies like "Serpico" or "Donnie Brasco" or even "Chinatown". Don't do me the wrong thing - "Edison" isn't even in the same playing field as these movies, but I can stretch my belief in stopping to admire the reasons for its existence, perhaps to justify my sitting. <br /> <br /> The script itself has some surprisingly bad writings. Yes, it has some good shifts, but all the conversations between Piper Perabo (who is wasting here) and Timberlake seem to have been pulled straight out of the Dawson's Creek episode. It's your typical far too glib-for-reality, let's-look-pub-how-well-me-articulate (and fail) dialogue. This kind of dialogue, in your mind, is highlighted in the wrong moments of great music - sometimes "Edison" seems to want to be moral in a music video where the emotions of the scene are not transmitted through the music, but just the wrong choice. and variant movie speeds (read slowdown). <br /> <br /> Thinking about it, Edison is curious. It is certain that hell was killed, but the performances are mixed by Timberlake, who just doesn't work. In a movie like most arts, when one thing is off, the whole thing feels off. Directors have to make difficult choices. David J. Burke was left unmarked. Some scenes play well and by themselves, but as a whole, they don't seem to be like puzzle pieces from some puzzles that are forced into one inconsistent picture. And it's not a very exciting puzzle.
