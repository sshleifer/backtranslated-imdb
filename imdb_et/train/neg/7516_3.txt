Ya I rented it, so shoot me! <br /> <br /> A decent assumption creates an otherwise inconvenient story without real profitability, but at least it is good. Director Jon Keeyes takes a simple idea of ​​a fake haunt house that is in real danger. In most cases it should be a slam dunk, but this little smelly elbow is very fast. Cinematography is above average and the actor is at best mediocre, but the story and writing are just terrible. Slower scenes drag on forever, and fears are too small and far away without the real top of the film. At first, it is a terrible mood, but loses its luster before any horror comes out, and I found myself dead forever and made another sandwich ... Cover art is tempting and I think it's worth renting if you're looking for a meaningless low budget, but if you have a good story and an eventful end, you will get something else.
