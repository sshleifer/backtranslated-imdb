Chris Rock, apparently a desperate cozy constellation that transcends his appeal to the white and the mainstream, refreshes the 1978 comedy "Sky Can Wait" with urban planning. He plays in trouble in a comedian who is involved in a car accident who has removed his soul from his body too early - consequently his angels have to find another body that puts him in and can only come with a white businessman. The rewriting of the film as blissful and sentimental as "Heaven Can Wait" only shows that Rock's eye was in the post office (it was a strictly business movement organized by the most mercenary Hollywood players). Why not catch something loftier or more memorable than the silly reincarnation comedy that culminates in the evening in Apollos? The amazing supportive casting (including usually the trusted Regina King, the wonderful Mark Addy, the Wanda Sykes, the Eugene Levy and the terrible Frankie Faison) are doing what they can, but Rock seems uncomfortable and insecure. * 1/2 from ****
