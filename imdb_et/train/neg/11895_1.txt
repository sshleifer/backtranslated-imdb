Oh my God, what the hell happened here? I'm not going to say it again, but what kind of reverse movie is that? Duplication in this is worst than copying "King Kong vs. Godzilla", Linda Miller had to be the worst actor and suits really cheesy. gorilla, which has the same strength as King Kong, but when that robot breaks down, he builds another and then tries to rob Congo. If he does this (if Linda Miller is annoying), he will make his slave to Kong, but everything will go wrong and King Kong will flee. Then Dr.Who will send the robot afterwards. <br /> <br /> Later, when I was watching the movie, I got a headache when Linda Miller and other clowns started to get up. while playing, I was hoping that the movie's madness would end until the fight. The end must be really bad because they would have been able to fight Kong again on their island against the dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Don't look at the movie under any circumstances, or if you ... be frustrated but you can.
