Spoilers can't be asked about this movie, the director won us too much and he violated this movie in so many ways. <br /> <br /> The blatant destruction of a movie such as Critters and Gremlins, this film fails on so many levels to restore the humor and horror of these better films. It comes to a waste of time, where bad actors give the idol leader a bad conversation that occasionally fills them with toys. They quarrel with toys as much as the old Tarzan films used in the use of rubber crocodiles, shaking them while shouting and trying their best to make it a little threatening. It is painful to look, and it will not help in the 80s of the spiritual that is cast. <br /> <br /> In principle, some crazy little aliens who have been caught by an aging security guard for a movie party will eventually get free. years of childbirth and start telepathically screwing up the peoples minds. Guards recruits, an idiot who casts them out despite repeated warnings, gets the power of his 80's friends together, and they go down and have little adventures together, trying again Grem ... Hobgoblins. <br /> <br /> All life is here, and a gang that consists of a doll head, his 80-year-old slut girlfriend, a hero of the hero and a prissy girlfriend, and a young hero who has no confidence and wants her girlfriend to come out anyway. <br /> <br First of all, the infamous rake fight, where the former military jock shows how he was trained as a bully in the army, joking with the wrong end of the hero that seems like a feeling. Then there are some running around, ending with a real pie-fighting style that ends up in an amazing nightclub, where comedy-grenades blow everything except the people who stand next to them. Then the end of the film ends and ends well, which ends well. <br /> <br /> It's not. It's like looking at a train break, you can't take your eyes off, it's so bad. The perfect price for the Mystery Science Theater, but the godly one should look at it alone and uncut. Fashion police still have a number of outstanding orders, and I dare not to laugh at the rake. It will value up to 10 out of ten good days.
