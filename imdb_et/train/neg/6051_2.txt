tungh! 3 things the film needs: good script, good plot and good casting. I watched this movie waiting for it to be terribly terrible and unfortunately frustrated when it was just terrible. I lost my will to live halfway. The only thing that stopped me from grabbing my eye was Rose Byrne (who was the reason I first watched it). He did a good job because Rasting and his appearance didn't change much because he was 13. He was a fantastic first effort in the movie. The dog was also very good. both did a great job with such terrible material. Sandra Bernhard was the biggest mistake in the movie. he was totally unsuccessful, and I don't think he's ever got his character. <br /> <br /> I'll give you a movie from 10 - and that's just because of Rose.
