Usually I am not motivated to write comments. But this film was so painful that I have to do it. I hit the terribly predictable plot, flat acting and laughing at moments that were supposed to be tense. Indeed, most audiences seemed quite boring and filthy even at the "most intense" moment. Molly Ringwald was the only one to decorate torture production. Even "twisting" was not at the end. I have heard that it said the film was not taken seriously; but I could find little evidence of it in the movie. <br /> <br /> Cutting should have remained on the floor of the cutting room. Make yourself a favor and spend time and money on others!
