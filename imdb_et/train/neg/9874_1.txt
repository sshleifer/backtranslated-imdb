A great book about the fox and his family doing what foxes do. it is stealing from the farms and killing the crop. until the farmer trio decides they have enough of this fox and try to solve the problem in many ways. Of course, they are "torn off" at any point in time, and when the trio is cut off, the family makes raids on three farmers. <br /> <br /> The "Film" version and I use the term movie very loosely, is more god of dreadful pastel American hymn films especially Oceans movies. They even have George clooney, as Mr Fox, to add insult and succeed in completely stopping the story. So worship them. They make a lot of money and destroy another classic book by Roald Dahl's children.
