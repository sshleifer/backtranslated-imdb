Back in my days as the "Private Lessons" employer I played in 4-plex where I worked. It was a sleeping bag that sold for several weeks on Friday and Saturday nights. I could never see it, but I saw that it was a cable last weekend, so I decided to do it. What I saw in the next 90 minutes was one of the worst films I've ever seen, and one that made me look awfully uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The main story is the teen boys' lust for her sexy maid (Sylvia Kristel). He also seems to feel attractive to the boy, but rather for embarrassing reasons. So we get the boy's views that look at his dress and invite him to look. And it goes from there. <br /> <br /> Eric Brown, like a teenage boy, must be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. His "frightened" reactions every time Sylvia dresses or touches her are terrible. I didn't laugh once at this junk. <br /> <br /> Don't start the maid and driver sub-block who is going to squeeze the child's money. Let's just say it means beating death, burying your body. I could go on and on, but it gets ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Sex Scenes are the worst I've ever seen. Although Eric Brown was older, he saw that he looked like a child. She seems to have no idea how to kiss a woman (if it worked, I should think about Brown's criticism) and it just came too close to child pornography to be erotic. I've never turned off this sex story, though Miss Kristel is pretty pretty with clothes and clothes. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER WARNING ** I have to mention the last scene. For me, it is just sick, but I remember the audience who rejoice when the movie freezing is designed and borrowed. Our hero returns to school and starts flirting with one female teacher. He asks him for dinner and he sees him as Tom Cruise just asked. She nods positively and walks as she smiles at the camera with the triumph. LEAVE ME ALONE! Yes, I'm sure the teachers just threaten everything to just serve a teenage child. <br /> <br /> I never understand this film appeal in 1982. Certainly it was more than nudity because there were many teen sex sex comedies nudity that was bombarded at the cashier. And think that the same teenagers who rejoiced that the film was 22 years ago are now working on the ladders of their companies and can help drive that country. This is a frightening idea.
