A TV movie about the ancient Egyptian curse that brought the first version of DeMille's ten commandments to the US in the 20s during filming, and which is rediscovered when DeMille's kits are discovered in the desert. <br /> <br /> One of the worst films I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> The question is, did the filmmakers make serious or joking about making this movie? If it is serious, it is a ridiculously bad film and a great movie that chooses its badness. If its comedy is less good, but funny for all the wrong reasons. You laugh long and hard on this film, probably more than many other Hollywood comedies.
