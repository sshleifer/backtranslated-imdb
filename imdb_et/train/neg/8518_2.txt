I'm surprised at how many comments on this show are about how "real" it is. Maybe I'm not in the same universe, because if Veronica Mars is anything, it's up in a great way. <br /> <br /> The actors chew the landscape with enthusiasm and the plots are the holes you can drive through the truck. This is not what I call real. <br /> <br /> It is so serious that it wants to be "relevant" to show just how Rob Thomas and his staff are. <br /> <br Generally, I found it to be the best punching and at worst, a bit annoying. Kristen Bell looks like he could be a good actor, but it is hard to say the whole top style of the show.
