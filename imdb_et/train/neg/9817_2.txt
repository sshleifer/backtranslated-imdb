Wow ... sheer shine. <br /> <br /> Turn the thriller / temporary / horror into comedy. <br /> <br /> After watching it, I never laughed so much before the movie ... a ridiculous plot with 3 characters that is just engineered - not written in depth or too deep. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialogue, confusion, useless scenes, wasted characters, bad sound and bad development in general, that's what you look at. <br /> <br /> Be sure to keep in mind the classic "food processor" scene and the totally failed police investigation scenes. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkable new lack of screen performance and writing and passing through its entire duration will make you stupid, brutal or brave.
