This exhibition is incredible in it. . . what it represents and what it focuses on and. . Words can't describe how crazy is ET. They say something. If celebrity is even indirectly implicit in the story, the ET understands it. If the dog is in the Tom Cruise courtyard, they will report it. When celebrity dies. . . they talk about it for weeks until the public envy this fame. When celebrity is in trial. . . EN announces the end of this month. There is no end to what this show shows and the time frame that determines how long they will focus on the story. Is it even considered legitimate reporting? Reports are also both annoying annoying, harsh voices, and endlessly pausing to deliver an important feeling. I cannot question this example of human existence. ET is one of the major reasons why I avoid general exhibitions before the evening. I'm sorry IMDb can only allow one star and not zero or even negative number. -10 stars deserve this display.
