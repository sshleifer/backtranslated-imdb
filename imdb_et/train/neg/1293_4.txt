I'm probably one of the few viewers who doesn't recommend this movie. I was thinking visually of stunning like all of Ang Lee's work (every icon seems worthy of the print), I was really disappointed when the movie was separated. It was really too long. The story is set in the Missouri Civil War era and is a young man (Roedel) who joins the Bushwacker's natural forces. fight with Jayhawkers, their union counterparts. He and his close friend Jack Bull Chiles, played by Skeet Ulrich, will join the group after the Chilean father is fired if his home is burned, probably Jayhawkers. The story follows the robbing adventures of Roedel and Chile and their interaction with other war victims, including a former slave who fights for Bushwhacker (Daniel Holt, played by Jeffery Wright), and a war widow played by Jewel. <br /> <br /> It seemed that every time a movie was created for an interesting point, it would turn to another sub-block and leave things undeveloped. For example, the confusion caused by the former slave Holt caused by the confiscation of the Roedel group, which is related to the correctness and the protocol, was then shown briefly, and then fell into the film later. Young wool / bully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and directs a lot of anger and violence against him, but we never know why. Some characters never seem to surface; I think this is because the film covers so much and a lot of history. <br /> <br /> Historical detail was great. I loved watching housing, furniture, clothes, etc., and I thought the leading actors did a great job of humanizing the characters, even though they stumbled a little. If you really don't know history or you are a huge Ang Lee fan, take it further.
