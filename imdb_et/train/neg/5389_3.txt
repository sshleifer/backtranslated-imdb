If you have seen other such movies, they are probably better. The Omega man comes to mind. To avoid studio credit, they avoided a large, unnecessary, and large budget that characterizes its flowers. In addition, the structure and prerequisite were excellent: four people whose past is virtually irrelevant to us are trying to overwhelm the infectious deadly disease. What is bad is everything else! I'm tired of indefinitely foolish, careless, uncomfortable, ineffective and arrogant movies. It describes pretty much a movie all. I rented it and found myself yelling on the TV repeatedly, "no, don't do it!", "Why are you so stupid," "look!" Etc. The real lack of character development is obviously about halfway. The film should have a strong personal connection with at least some characters, so you really care about what happens to them. This is not. It should also have been a longer, more involved film ending.
