$ 25,000 Pyramid Hints: Deep Blue Sea. Shakes. Slip. Eight Legged Freaks. <br /> <br /> Pyramid Category: Movies that were more fun and exciting than snakes on an airplane. <br /> <br /> Hell, with this definition I should cover a relatively harassing Ted and Elaine on an airplane! both laughing and excited as good as snakes! <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that it is not even close to all the unintentionally intentional mother of funny snake movies: Anaconda! In addition to not showing JLo-Cube-O.Wilson-Stoltz-Wuhrer casting again at the same time, you had Jon Voight who pulled out all-time cinema. His final scene is everything that SOAP tried and did not do as a "so ridiculous-fun" movie. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the snakes have the ultimate proof on the plane that the studio and the fans are the worst collaborators. There were so many discussions and chunks on every big arena last year, everything that was entertaining was opened at night, the amount of fanboy flop that came to my theater. I heard more forced smiles than in a studio that depicts "according to Jim".
