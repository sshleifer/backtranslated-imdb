Whew. What can be said about Gymkata, which is not yet? This is nothing more than pure halality from beginning to end. If you want a movie that keeps you smiling, this is the perfect movie. From Cabot's wild-style mullet / sweater combination to the top (and it's four billion assorted ninjas), all this movie is talking about. <br /> <br /> The notorious mindset led by Robert Clouse, which brought you a mirror image of Bruce Lee's Death of Death, shows his complete lack of talent. Some other faces that you probably don't know will also appear for Buck Kartalian from Tadashi Yamashita to enjoy you, even though you don't remember them or take care of them after the movie. <br /> <br /> It is said to be based on The Terrible Game, which, if I could find a trace of its existence, would be interested in reading it to see where this thing went wrong. Instead, the book is probably the imagination of Gymkata. Probably something Clouse compiled to sell your flat idea. <br /> <br /> Pick this one and Yakmallah it yourself. It's just one of the best bad movies I've ever seen, and it says quite a bit.
