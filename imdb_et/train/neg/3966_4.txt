Allowing me not to be my companion but well assembled, the smart flick is worth the time. In short, they say: <br /> <br /> Dialogue is often weak and at times incredible due to this character. <br /> <br /> - Persuasive action. <br /> <br /> - The story was never a fire. <br /> <br /> Writers dropped a selection of bits of a dozen mainstream movies thrown into the kettle, boiled almost inadequately, and tried to break us down as a result of poor feeding, causing confusion. /> <br /> Long and short, though not absolutely terrible, was definitely worth something to absorb my NetFlix rent.
