The post-war shock-shocked soldier clich√©s are given boring treatment. Repentance, the magnificent glory that works within high talent cannot redeem the "soldier's return" from its rigid burden of inability to bring the viewer into emotional engagement. The best moments, as noted by another reviewer, come when Glenda Jackson is on the screen; but even Jackson's good cinematic film cannot pull the chestnuts of this film out of the cold, never-heated chamber. Ann-Margret, who has a reputation for sex dogs and is too often accused of lack of ability to act, finds her true and rather profound abilities that have been wasted here - despite the fact that she talks about an almost perfect Middlesex accent. Hackneyed score, redolent lot of poor TV miniseries' slathered-saccharine emotionism, is an irritating contradiction to emotional distance script, blocking and excessive formality; except for his score and corset script and direction, the soldier returns all the correct bits, but it does not work together.
