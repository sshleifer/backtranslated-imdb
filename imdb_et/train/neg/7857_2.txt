Does anyone else get tired of this old clich√© where a nearly dead person appears in a horror film, gives us some information and then explodes with no apparent reason? I know I'm. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that this use in this movie is worthless. If you have seen the first movie (the first edition I should say), the information provided is completely worthless because you already knew it. I think you can get that this is not worthless for the main characters ... but why stop the idiot with the head? Wouldn't she want to live? Of course he would have died anyway. <br /> <br /> This is another movie titled "The Hills Have Eyes II". The first is the original sequel to the 70's film. This is where he gets a little bit more complicated for a person like me. Look, I'm probably a part of my age, who even knew that HHE2 at first was much less original HHE1. And now that we have the aftermath and the fact that this sequel is called exactly the same as the original HHE1 sequel But anyway .. <br /> <br /> Wes Craven's original mountain eyes were decent. Eventually, however, the idea was better than the presentation, but it probably had a small budget. To be honest, Wes Craven is not such a spooky manager good. He has only made some good horror movies (Nightmare's Elm St., New Nightmare), some honest (Scream) and a number of terrible (Cursed, Shocker, Vampire in Brooklyn). Oh yes, and he did Swamp Thing, but the original HHE2 belongs to the last category. I've only seen a few minutes, but it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Now he has written a new HHE2 ... and it's so disappointing! Last year's HHE remake was even better than the original film. It was tense. I think it was related to the fact that the main characters were the family, not the teenagers between beer and pot and sex. It made us feel dirty. In the first hour we were in hell and in the last moments the good guys got the bad guys and felt good. <br /> <br /> This new movie is not under tension. There's no relationship. Simply violent things mostly happen to stupid people. There is hardly a dangerous presence here. Just ugly horses that hide under the rocks. <br /> <br /> I'm tired of movies where people die because they make foolish mistakes. It was only the second day when I looked at the "Deep Blue Sea" where Samuel L. Jackson kept walking on the water while he was talking and then ate the shark, but because the idiot stayed close to the water. in a situation to do something! Here's exactly the same thing. People leave by themselves to leak, even though they know that people are dying ... seriously, did the potty pause wait? And then, if you think people have learned, someone else will go! Seriously, it is no longer scary if the characters bring their A-game and still lose? I think so ... <br /> <br /> It's even there. It should have done the first remake like "The Fog" remake (which was less dangerous than the "Becker" episode). More bad guys. More time in the cave. More tension. More about everything. <br /> <br /> But it really lowers. Less bad guys. There is no tension. Of course, there is more time in the caves, but there's not much going on there. Finally, it seems that there are only two or three bad guys. The last film showed that it seems to be a whole tribe. Where is this tribe? Who monitors them through binoculars? Seriously, these are the movies that this film should have brought to us, but it ends up with exactly the same promise that the last movie gave us the same exactly "watching" scene. Come on! I give it to the devil. The look of the movie is good ... but that's it. <br /> <br /> I don't even think gore fans like it ... though I'm probably wrong! There is gore (although most of it is in the dark), but without tension and the characters you care about. Finally you are not afraid. You're not shocked (if you're not an 8 year old girl). You don't even know you've seen something new.
