This movie is really terrible. After seeing the ad, I thought it might have its own charm ... but it didn't. Girls can't act and they can't sing. The soundtrack of this movie is full of songs and not quite sight, terrible story, incredible plot, one of Disney's worst films FAR! An ally is not a bad actor on Phil of the Future, so I don't know what happened to "cows". And his sister, AJ, seems to be just driving his sister's "fame", and he doesn't show any talent that was ever. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, the girls finally learn some clich√© morale, but it's late to save the wreck of this train. <br /> <br /> Awful
