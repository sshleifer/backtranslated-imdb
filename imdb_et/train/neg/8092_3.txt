Tom Wolfe's bright, gloriously satirical novel about New York's snobbery gets a glossy look, but it's not well-deserved. Not only does the film suffer from the eternal Tom Hanks as an unfortunate Yuppie, the Kewpie doll Melanie Griffith as the manipulating southern belle and Bruce Willise (?!) As the New York Literature sweetheart. The most serious failure was under the direction of the director. Robert Altman could have breathed life into these unlikely characters and make them interesting, but Brian De Palma has never seen the nuances of people's experiences because of his visual complexity. The resulting film looks good, but it seems that blah is in favor of his dehumanization. Honestly, if satire doesn't make the viewer hate, what's the point?
