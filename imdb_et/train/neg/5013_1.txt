I'm not arguing about anyone killing this movie, as well as Jones' January performance, but please check him out if you haven't already done it, AMC's "Mad Men" TV series, which will start later this month. I think he took the role of "Taboo" strictly for money and realized what sacred confusion he was, with minimal action to prevent hunger. know if this is the case, but I know (now) that he can act. <br /> <br /> When I first looked at "Taboo", I was convinced that his sure delivery was a terrible choice that later led to some important revelation about his character or plot: it is hard to believe that the director did not recommend him at least once that changing the expression of 17 consecutive scenes can cause a lock. <br /> <br /> Ironically, in his winning man's "Mad Men", this is a character that is at least in his early appearance highly repressed, reserved, insecure himself, and more colorless than his "Taboo" role. But as the TV series progressed, he began to bloom somebody who doubted his normal role as the mother of the 60's white bread. Can't wait to see where they take their character in season 2. <br /> <br /> In summary, avoid "taboo" like leprosy, but be sure to check out "Mad Men".
