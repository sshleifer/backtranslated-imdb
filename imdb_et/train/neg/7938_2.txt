A family looking for some old roadside attractions to add a father to a coffee table book has met an old, dirty old erroneous exhibition led by an eccentric one-eyed man. When their family leave when they leave, they are forced to stay in an almost abandoned fishing camp that was decades before the prison. <br /> <br /> 'Spooky Sub Factor, from Tod Browning's beloved' Freaks' (1932) to Alex Winter's Freaked Fun (1993). These are both classic (or soon "Freaked"). "Side Sho," but never. And if it ever reaches the classic status. . . Well, this is an obvious hint to the sad situation of our genre. From this ridiculously bad opening to a 17-year-old daughter who is obviously older than her natural mother, there wasn't much in this film. Writing was a subpar, but not totally terrible. . . just boring. The direction was bad and the rare pleasant effects were quite terrible and incredible. Action was poor and casting was even worse. Anyone who believes that the age of these two camping ages should not be long for a long time with teens. There was not enough gore & violence to compensate for some other lack of quality. . . and when there was little violence, it wasn't well done at all. And I can't forget to mention the ending fighting scenes that were, frankly, some of the worst I've ever seen in the movie. In general, it is an easily forgotten and poorly prepared horror film that deserves to be left alone at the bottom of the dollar trash. <br /> <br /> Final decision: 2.5 / 10.
