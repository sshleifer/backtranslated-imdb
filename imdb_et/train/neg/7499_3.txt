The superb comic character John Leguizemo is a New York Latino who can enter many male and female characters to show off the strangers in an ethnic group that has been subjected to foreign culture. However, he is not Italian. He doesn't look, think or handle Italian ... Especially Sicily or Calabrese, groups of immigrants living in Bensonhurst or Bayridge Brooklyn. Every scene in which he interacts with his "Gumbas" rings is wrong as if he had traveled from "West Side Story" college production, while other boys made a small rent on "Mean Streets". This is just one problem with this uneven, middle-minded flick. Spike blew this big time. Btw, CBGBOMFUG stands for "Country, Bluegrass, Blues and Other Music for Gourmet Raising [or Maybe Gourmands] Ask Hilly Crystal, who founded the club. <br /> <br />
