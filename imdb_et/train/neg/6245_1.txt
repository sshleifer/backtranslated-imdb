The only thing that proves "awkward truth" is that Al Gore is still an idiot. These "unchallenged" experts are undisputed because the answer to their unfair hypotheses is generally real science. This is mostly wrong science. The biggest source of greenhouse gases - CO2 - are people, we breathe it out and if you don't want to sacrifice your brother to save the world, there's nothing to do. We've heard how the world ends as a human being for more than 50 years. Fools announce the anniversary of journalism, and when the time passes, nothing has happened. "Uncomfortable truth" is just one vehicle with which the uncomfortable faction of American society can carry its poop. <br /> <br /> And when Al leaves tobacco because his sister has died of cancer, it is a burden too. Al could not manage his farm better when he led the country. He lost money on the operation because he was not interested in growing a farm when he could pay more $ for a tour. The only global warming that is not disputed is the hot air produced by this gas bag!
