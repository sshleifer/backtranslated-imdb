I sat on the glued screen, riveted, awake, but I kept an eye on the eye. I was waiting for the next terrible special effect or the next ridiculously clich√© plot to show full force so I could learn how not to make a movie. <br /> <br /> They seem to have made this movie, the team looked at every single other action / science / shoot-em-up / head vs evil movie that was ever made, and saw cool things and said, "Hey , we can do that. " For example, the only car parked within one mile, which seems to be a one-way road with a shoulder not intended for parking, is one car with an attractive brunette born in a bile. The car blows into pieces before it even lands. The special effects were probably the biggest beef in my movie. But what was actually in my bad books was the unreliability of so many elements and the lack of unreasonable! For example, an antagonist, a flying demon, is capable of generating a strange odd way when a single army truck transports a significant VIP. Known security boys who have guns come to know that they are already dead. Then the VIP says a defensive man: "You will never miss this truck, do you understand me?" She gets out to find the beast who killed her three friends, she's been hit in a comic way. Then, without any apparent reason, logic, convention and common sense, the stupid ass gets VIP! Much of what happened during the film was useless. Transparent operation distanced me from the movie, as well as bad camera work and things that just change you: "Wow, it's incredibly cheesy." Shiri Appleby recorded a movie from 1 because he gave the film one element that would always make viewers experience, sex appeal.
