Theoretically, the "director's comment" should have worked. Talented Rob Bryden plays Peter DeLane, a former television director who talks about his experiences behind the camera. Among the programs he allegedly worked for are "Bonanza", "Flambards", "Duke Street Duchess" and "The Bounder". His comments are not the least informative because of his habit of attacking from the point. <br /> <br /> But in practice it couldn't be done. This is one joke show and the joke is not very funny. Scripts are completely inadequate and Bryden can't convince an old man. Every time it is interesting to say what is like every five seconds, it gives a ridiculous laugh. Instead of having DeLane amused, you want to shoot him. If old old men make you so much fun, it is for you. <br /> <br /> It didn't help to mock the examples, except for Mr & Mrs and crossroads, quite good. In order to make jokes, they had to be very terrible, like "Charlie's Angels", "OTT", "Telly Addicts", "Neighbors" and "New Faces". <br /> <br /> The exhibition has a long time in the tank, so fortunately we have spared the horror of future releases. Wouldn't it be tastelessly ironic if "director's comment" ever was a day when it was a fraud?
