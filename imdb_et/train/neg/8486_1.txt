I can't believe anyone thought there was something original or interesting about this movie. I am as much a fantastic fan as the next man, and I can even enjoy old movies in ridiculous spaces when they write someone besides a monkey. (See, for example, my luminous overview of Altered States [1980].) <br /> <br /> The monkey could have better explained why I should take the idea of ​​this film a second time seriously. The problem is not that the manufacturer had a small budget - that is, they didn't care. <br /> <br /> Now, to publicly lower those valuable magazines with a glowing overview in the box: <br /> <br /> Chicago Tribune <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (I like to read the last two. The review of credibility has gone through the floor, but I know if I will make a movie with a hand-held camera, cheese and fools, show them to those journalists and remind them of what they said about creating Ada.)
