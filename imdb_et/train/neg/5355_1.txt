Now I don't hate cheap movies. I just don't understand why you should waste money on a movie if you could take pictures of your father's camcorder. When I rent a movie, I want it to be MOVIE, not a lot of people who would think it would be a good idea to waste some MiniDV - Tapes. <br /> <br /> Maybe I hate it so much because the boy in the video store said it was great and it wasn't. Maybe I hate it because it is cheap, it has the eternal plot of EVER, the most unrealistic characters in EVER and really a really genuinely ATTENTION in movies EVER history. Even Tom Savin can't save it. <br /> <br /> This is a complete waste of time.
