Why should anyone in the world make this trash movie? The first two Zombie Bloodbath films were foolish enough, but it takes the cake to the worst trilogy (perhaps all the time). Todd Sheets is still a director but no longer a screenwriter who is neither negative nor positive, as he is as untalented as the one who wrote it. Writing is too strongly dependent on the f-word used 200 to 300 times in nausea. The action is about the last two Bloodbath films, so of course it's the worst I've ever seen. Special effects are better than the last 2, but they still look godawful. The plot has become too complicated for it to be good, and it was about breaking some wrong mistakes and creating zombies. There are also cryogenic frozen mutant zombies and school children who know how to travel, leading to one of the most idiotic end I've ever seen. After the film, it goes to a challenge that is strange because this whole movie is a retrieval. Just look at it to make it fun, because if you mean it seriously, you can kill yourself. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 95 minutes.
