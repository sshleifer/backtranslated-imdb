What is an unusual film. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no promotions for "Hollywood Special Effects" or entertainment. No background music, no special effects or improved sound. <br /> <br /> Facial expressions are usually covered with thick beard, and Spanish is a strange monotonous flower that sounds the same either in the middle of the battle or around the campfire. <br /> <br /> I saw these movies (parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience, not really something to go and entertain. Its quite long and places are boring. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that due to the lack of development of any plot, I do not believe it is very educative. <br /> <br /> It's also hard to make a sense of the film's dialogue - it's a good idea to read a little bit of history so you can understand what's going on because for some reason, the director didn't see the audience telling why the Che band is moving as they did - as a result, the forests seem to be moving around the forest for some particular reason and fired. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to have more stars in this movie somehow creating more empathy with me and the depth of character developing, but somehow all the characters were finally strangers to me. The stars are realism and show the difficulties of immigration.
