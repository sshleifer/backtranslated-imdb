I bought this Blockbuster 99p. The man behind the receiver said the reason was so cheap because the disc was scratched with t * t but didn't mention that the reason it was so cheap was that the movie was a bad effort that was sucked harder than Paris Hilton hotel room in home video. Talking about home videos, when it's a fair game to release them as movies - I say movies used to recruit actors and technicians and scriptwriters etc - no more - just collect your friends and flat-o ideas for a weekend is very good £ 8.00 budget and let someone fall on the Casio keyboard (soundtrack) - then hit it on the shelves for some bad juice (I) to take home desperation alone. But here's the courier - I handed it over a lot and threw it on one side, ready for hammers ... until the next night, looking at the different Blockbuster of Hellbreed (£ 1.99 to bring home and keep Darren's Day) in Darren's Day. Now this movie has made it a "Grim Weekend" look, so I'll get back to Grim Weekend to catch up with some wonderful IMDb albums that the viewers claimed. Of course, when I had the misery, Grim Weekend's pain and the horror of the toast, I can enjoy, smell and even have fun. And there are many. Check the discs. Then check the flick. Hell, it might even be worth it. AWWWWW CRAP!
