Having just been "Lipstick" for the first time in a few decades, I supported it with "Descent", although I have heard more negative comments than good friends from other films whose taste is as diverse as mine. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how the unique niche of Rape Revenge has evolved over the last 32 years, from "I Spit On Your Grave" full length to "lipstick" to a delicate sensationality in the "Accused". But the "Descent", though some important points have been made, never gives us a truly new revelation of meaning. No, the "Descent" is so bad about the picture and sound quality that it reduces the important messages it could count on - a message that is not a breakthrough when carefully researched. <br /> <br /> I knew the plot was going in. What I Wanted to See * was * Dawson's "descent" or degeneration. Being a big Rosario fan, I wanted to see that the layers were removed and his psyche twisted slowly ... you know that DeNiro brings such a picture to "Taxi driver". Unfortunately, the script and director / writer options do not offer any credible transition. <br /> <br /> The biggest failure point is another act. It turned out what the filmmaker's intentions were about the club jumping, drug use, and big black slave Adrian (every white boy's nightmare, natch) segment from the DVD, but this tour of Dawson's character has never been credible rendered. We don't know exactly what the hell he is doing half the time he has done or why he does it. Sound / video bad quality again does not help, but the sequence is too long and pointless. It destroys any momentum and investment in wires that were otherwise created during the exceptionally well done first act. By the time we reach the final, our interest has already declined. <br /> <br /> One of the successes of Dawson in Q&A is that in the end, "vengeance" is the scene that is being pumped into retaliation, to understand how drawn and ugly reality is. While this certainly applies, it does not make the scene more interesting. <br /> <br /> If you have a DVD, check out the deleted "classroom" scene. This is a great 8-minute plus energy saving and provocation (albeit all verbal) and really shows Dawson's slow cracking when he happily vivifies the poor Francie Swift's prissy-dormdending dormitory counselors. If more expositions were added to this and a third of the average would be cut, we may have an interesting psychological study on the impact of meaningless acts of violence. <br /> <br /> Because the movie is in the final section, but what we get is what we saw before, in more graphic designs. So what?
