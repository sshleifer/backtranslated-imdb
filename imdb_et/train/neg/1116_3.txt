This film seems to have been part of Coppola's family training. It doesn't seem to know whether to be "A" or "B" west. I mean, the hero is Hopalong Cassidy for God. William Boyd must be spinning in his grave. <br /> <br /> All "B" Western Clich√©s are here. A two-gun-groomed horse hero in a white hat with an incredible breed ("C'mon Thunder"), an all-black-bearded villain, a distressed heroine, a troubled career, a coward sheriff, bad guys, etc. <br /> <br /> Except for a few exceptions, actors are strictly from the Yakima Canut School of Command. Chris Lybbert (who?) As a hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) Like a villain, they look like they were home to the 30s of Poverty Row. There is little help from veteran performers Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins, but they are not given enough to save it. <br /> <br /> What was the point of this point? Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine Framing Sequences? Should we believe the character of Sheen was a ghost? What was the purpose of black gloves? It just didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Being the greatest lover of all genres in the genre, I tried to find some redemption features in this movie. The cinema was pretty good and the settings seemed very authentic. Apart from the hero and the main scorer, the other characters were authentic. <br /> <br /> Once the producers began to raise the character of Hopalong Cassidy, they would have thought to portray him as he had originally written - a Grizzled filthy mouth ranch arm with a chip on his shoulder, the part that Lee Marvin would have brought out. <br /> <br /> What else can I say but ... Thunder, great companion.
