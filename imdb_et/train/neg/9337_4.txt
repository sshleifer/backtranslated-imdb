The Coffy clowns do not want the caffeine kick you are expecting from a movie that shares your name with the warmest drinks, and never rises out of being just a terrible revenge. Indeed, if the film was a cup of coffee, it would be rather weak and watery, with some unwanted feeds and a missing aftertaste. From time to time, it hits the spot, but otherwise it's not a hot act-drama that it hopes. <br /> <br /> Coffy is a sister who takes the law and gives hard justice to pushing drugs, lady-pimpin, mob-sucker, who pulled her younger sister into a frail, sick state. Coffy's socio-political comments on the difficult situations of American black young people in the United States, so some thought-provoking things like Coffy's Crusade against Political Corruption and the White Industry, and it acts as a parasite for targeted African-American minorities. Unfortunately, the poor quality and lack of a movie undermines timely messages. Coffy's ideas are important, it's just that they're not well targeted. <br /> <br /> One of Coffy's plus points is the presence of the Blaxploitation icon Pam Grier. Grier likes to play with his role and makes it an attractive heroin when he grabs his knees, often in remarkable acts of violence (how to deal with a house full of hoods? Drive the car straight through the door!). It's just a shame that the story strikes at times, wasting time that squeezes as much as possible sexual exploitation. The low budget has not helped, but also the lack of Coffy for the Blaxploitation flick. Similarly, when quality issues are undermined, entertainment and excitement are also present at moments of dullness and misrepresentation. <br /> <br /> The whole result is work-based and wood. We get a hip hero, but not a hip movie. It is a shame that Coffy has his moments and that should be rightly considered the key to Blaxploitation's madness; it just doesn't rise above the average, lukewarm number.
