Looking very tired, Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary who fights with his former employers for some gizmo who are going to sell to the Iranians. "Silk Stalkings" producers' low rental video boom offers some decent activities and the much unlikely staged "drama" ... the lack of a logical and truly terrible dialogue is crucial, although the latest turns and loyalty could have been a better movie for a better film. Burtil still has a presence, although it also means that you notice more than he can offend half with "one liner".
