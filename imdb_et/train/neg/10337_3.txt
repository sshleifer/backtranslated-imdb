The person who is at the end of this film is so frightening and dated that the whole aesthetic class of his movie laughed like crazy. Now most of the rest of the movie was okay. It had some inadvertently funny scenes, but they had some real good camera shots and editing. Yes, Alderich is a great director who made, among other things, Santa's Phoenix and whatever happened. The problem is not direction, action or anything technical. The film is destroyed by a third law. Why? All murders, revolutions, and characters have all gone over NUCLEAR MATERIAL? What the hell did the writer smoke when he came up against it? How it just doesn't come anywhere can be the biggest in Deus Ex Machina's history. For all the complaints about Burton's monkey planet, the life of David Gale or Notorious is that it is the hardest end ever. What to let.
