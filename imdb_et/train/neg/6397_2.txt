This is a problem that I have with movies on television if there is nothing else to look at. I have some way to suck in really bad movies. <br /> <br /> But it was quite observable. Understanding to be the only one left behind after the comet on Earth, the identification of zombies is around, makes me laugh. And that's why I gave it instead of movie 1. The story was stupid ... but in a way that makes you laugh (too stupid> funny). <br /> <br /> I think I only looked at it because the boy from Star Trek was a leader. I was surprised to see him younger ... and he was the only funny sign anyway.
