This video guide was a masterpiece of 1995. Beautifully done! Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston have great screen chemistry when they talk about the Start button. I expect Microsoft to release a special edition DVD with deleted scenes, a comment from Bill Gates, a documentary about how Windows 95 is comparable to Windows XP and more! <br /> <br /> Overall: 10/10 (Has won at least the Golden Globe)
