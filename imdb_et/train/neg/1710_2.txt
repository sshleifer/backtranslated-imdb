For a while, a group of friends with a minimal budget, but enthusiastic and talented bags, are a small-budget masterpiece that takes the world by storm. Frame and cover. did it with Evil Dead, Jackson and Pals succeeded Bad Taste; and Myrick and Sanchez made the mint with the Blair witch project. <br /> <br /> Director Todd Sheets and his boys are forced to hide forever if Zombie Bloodbath is something. The lesson of not making a cheap horror, this unhappy effort (about the plague of eating meat) is a reminder that while many people have access to a video camera these days, most of them should not take it on their chip to try their hand at making a full-length movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that the pages didn't look good on the well-framed picture (some of the corners and movements of his camera are really pretty) good, but that a) he has a weak script b) he's bad cast and c) he does not realize he has a bad script and cast. This means that the last movie is an extreme amateur and is probably not followed by anyone other than a zombie filmmaker (like me) or cast and team members (like those who have approved the film). <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath is clearly targeted to non-discriminatory gore-hounds, and Sheets (who are currently incredible 34 titles in his belt as director) will definitely go his way please, with buckets of offspring and Blood is thrown at every opportunity. But while these moments are unquestionably happy, they are not particularly convincing and soon rather annoying. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a very bad film with almost no redemption features. Except for two: <br /> <br /> First of all, it has one of the greatest film historians like Jerry Angell, played by Larry (as well as several zombies). The greatness of her barnet (with a pulling mustache) is just to watch this movie. Drive before you jump from your hiding place to launch a weak attack that requires almost no effort to escape. Known to be hiding behind the door for hours when someone opens up the "pathetic insidious zombies" hiding from time to time behind low walls or sitting in churches erected as members of the church. that would be 1/10 for me, but I am generously raising my rating of 2/10 when Jerry Angell is marking the flocks.
