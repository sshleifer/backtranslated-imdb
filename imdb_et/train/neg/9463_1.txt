The remarkable and downward right of the humiliating adaptation of classical children's story not only does its charm to its ancestor but lacks the talent of what so ever. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his dreadful action, which is clear what Jim Carrey did, but should give up acting together. He is so annoying that you would want to mess him up if you were able to jump in the movie. Sets are ugly and cinematography is very bad. I've seen a lot of bad movies this year, but it doesn't just take the cake, but it is definitely the worst thing ever.
