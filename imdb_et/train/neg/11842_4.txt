As an actor, Kirsten Dunst is terribly overestimated. You can always say that he is just "acting". I like Izzard. The plot is terribly boring. The viewer has no real connections with the characters, never knowing who really sympathizes or even cares. Slow, boring movie, some laugh, but few and not very funny. The plot does not have the slightest grip or stop. You can see every plot turning miles away. What should this movie be like? Comedy? Drama? Who cares? You won't be at the end of this movie.
