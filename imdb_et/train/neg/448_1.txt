What I hate about this exhibition is how bad the drivers are. These women have no self-esteem or dignity. The whole plot is the ones who throw themselves boys. Amanda Bynes' talent is completely wasted. She was a great "All This" and her own show. Why do they write to him and Jenny Garth as coats of arms, airs, desperate, men pursuing, "old-maid" wannabes over me. <br /> <br /> Their plots and dialogue remind me of "The Simpons," Homer says if his comic character Poochie is not on the screen, "Everyone should ask where Poochie is?". All call centers focus on some guys and then some guys. Sometimes they change it and the boy sprays. Then they get together or break at the end. Two women are either low, stupid or sexually abusive. The only word I think is "sucking".
