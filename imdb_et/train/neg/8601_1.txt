Ok, where do we start with this little pearl? The mutant slugs will take over the small New England (?) City. Only one man can stop them ... and this man ... is Mike Brady! Now, if it wasn't ridiculous, leave the voice. <br /> <br /> Films in hunger are what is known as stock film. No matter who plunders or where they are, the same shocks with slippers from all over are shown. Remember, this unique shooting takes at least half of the movie. <br /> <br /> The action in the movie was to hit, pull out, steal your wallet, hit your girlfriend, kill your dog, BAD. I'm sure there is worse, but you have to push it hard. The only pearl was ... you guessed it .... MIKE BRADY! She had to take a few nights at the YMCA because she was the best in the bunch. <br /> <br /> What about horror? This movie is not taken seriously. No horror! They're knives for crying out loud. The whole rising effect could have been prevented by a salt shaker or two. Look at this movie only in a MST3K-type environment, otherwise I see great damage in the brain.
