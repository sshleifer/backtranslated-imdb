Awful! Absolutely terrible! There is no plot, no point, no end. It seems the director turned the camera on and then the whole team went for lunch. Everyday. I'm trying to USE this video, but nobody takes it. I'll give him 1 instead of 2 because I like Benigni. Roger, I have to say thumbs on it. <br /> <br />
