Look, there's nothing outstanding offensive about this movie, it's just boring. This is a typical rom-com that you can see to the end before you see as much as a trailer. The main difference is that the classic rom-coms handles their stories wisely and inadequately. This film has no pretense, but it has no sense of movement, you feel like you could get up and walk at any moment. There's also a debut film about fifteen years ago. I'd like to look at a classic movie, like when Harry Met Sally replaced this low-level imitation. Oh, another big problem ... no chemistry. If you're used to seeing Michael see all the cute ones like Vaughn in Alias, you're seriously disappointed with how they see him here.
