Bored Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (like Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on the legacy. They use money while traveling. Their life becomes more exciting when they start a relationship with exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Ms. Barry). But they remain as eternal as before. Undoubtedly boring director Alfred Hitchcock is trying to revive the title well (as quoted in the film, Shakespeare's "Tempest") "Rich and Strange" by subscribing to some camera work. King Vidor's "The Crowd" is a highlight. The low point may be a couple of dining rooms on a Chinese prepared cat. <br /> <br /> Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph
