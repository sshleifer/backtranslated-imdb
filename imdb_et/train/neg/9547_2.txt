A less than average-looking video game has become a conspiracy that the next terrorist will be discovered in the US backyard. Welcome to live direct movies directly into cheap entertainment. Actors and actors with a full-fledged plot of land with a full name. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this strange game will continue and our "hero" will put some real money and do it well. It's like gambling, except the part of gambling is lost and it sucks. Instead, this is an online game with little real value, and you get the authorities for your tail when you do that good. <br /> <br /> What makes it even stranger is that two strange computer programs are fighting against it somehow and everything is a finished end. I'm leaving the viewer to see how it all works. <br /> <br /> Generally not even worth $ 1 rent. Borrow please. "D-"
