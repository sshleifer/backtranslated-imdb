Chronic coward. Director Boorman shows the robbery of abundant houses at Cahill, but the male driver is infamous for his childhood, that's fine. Forensic scientist who is investigating Cahill is being thrown into his car, but he is facing rats and does not seem like a beautiful man, so everything is fine. The owner of Russborrough House, Beits, made his money by taking advantage of diamond excavation, so it is an invaluable robbing and hiding of art in a bunker in the Wicklow Mountains. Garda kills her ferrets and is involved in her murder. Moral equivalence is ill, Boorman is looking for a hit movie, but he has no courage to resist the generals of violence who terrorized the neighborhood and fired another wave in Dublin. He also communicated with the generals' son. Nasty. Shame on her for her coward.
