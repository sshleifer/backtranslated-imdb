At the end of this thriller, Ally Sheedy uses the last day to create an image of more than one haunted evil creator of the image. He convinces that if the nasty Bette Davis-type role should reach his path, he can make a great difference. Unfortunately, I can't find many other reasons to view it. If you're thinking about what Sheedy looks like in a pair of old-fashioned glasses (but why should anyone?), Here's your answer. For the rest, Sally Kirkland's sex-hungry crazy woman is very tiring, and even if you like the thing I do more than I do, you have to admit that the tension falls badly during these scenes. The savage drunk of the Savage drunk is equally terrible, but at least it's a small role. Of the leading actors, Nikolai Walker inspires no sympathy for Paul Keller's situation and his actions. Dara Tomanovich is better and sheedy scenes rise to level a little. Sheedy's meticulous, undervalued performance (although he seems often to be an automatic pilot) is in itself admirable, but out of the rest of the context. Sets are drab, camera doesn't work.
