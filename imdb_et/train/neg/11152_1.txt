Why barely see this movie if you have great movies to see. It is a complete waste of time and money. The film is so bad that I felt bad about it. All of this is BAD. The actors were bad. The script was really bad. The story is stupid. And the worst CGI EVER. The only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the movie in the club. One interesting thing is that there is a trait that we want it to die for because it is so stupid that we get enough of it. (I don't remember the name but was "Selected" BOYFRIEND.) <Br /> <br /> NOTE. If you want to see a good movie, this movie is not the right choice. 0 of 10 stars
