When I heard the plot of this movie, I just had to see it, I mean destroying whole cities by killer tomatoes! Unfortunately, the title is about as funny as it gets. <br /> <br /> Head Detective Dick Mason, a Special Team of Military and Scientists (including Greg Colburn who never takes out his SCUBA outfit and missed his parachute shot) "Killer's Tomato Attack" is a B movie parody, especially the horror of the 1950s in Japan. The movie begins with a standard-sized tomato discovered by women who wash their kitchen before we find ourselves in the midst of crime spots, because the tomato is said to have murdered this woman and let me tell you that she won't get any saner when the movie is progressing! To be fair, a couple of funny moments, such as the Japanese scientist Dr Nokitofa, speaks his voice on an American accent, or when the hidden expert Sam Smith penetrates the tomato hey, can anyone go through ketchup? . Similarly, in 1978 this film was probably much more funny, so all this bad was a good concept. Unfortunately, the "Tomato Attack" released by the "Killer Attack", such as "Airplane" and "Naked Gun" series, has since been much better comedy. <br /> <br /> Operation is cruel; editing has zero consistency, it seems really slow and incomplete. For the work of a parody film, you need many things that happen at once, one gag after that. Singing in the movie seems pointless and the ads in the furniture store that blink over the screen are right, even for this movie. Ultimately, you see why this film is a cult; I don't see that many people are indifferent to it. Unfortunately, it would be terrible how I get it together.
