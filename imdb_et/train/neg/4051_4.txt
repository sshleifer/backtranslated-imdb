Lindsay Anderson was a very European filmmaker, while David Lean, Ridley Scott and Alan Parker like films that cover the scope of the Allel. Anderson's film is more about social commentary and subtitle, so the message often ends up in a movie whose primary function should be audience entertainment. <br /> <br /> What you think of IF goes down to what you mean by British filmmakers. I very much think that cinema should be a universal media (the best British films are those who, in my opinion, are trying to emulate Hollywood) if you want to send a message to try pony expression and find that the film is dated, contemptuous and too set in the 1960s. 1968 was a year of love for summer and a rebellion of students in France. You can imagine the French left who worships this film, especially the climax. French new wave filmmakers also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes, but the international mainstream doesn't like it, and many don't want it intensely
