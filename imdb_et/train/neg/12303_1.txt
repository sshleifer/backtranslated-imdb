This movie is so bad that it is good - in an unintentionally funny way. I couldn't watch it, I laughed so much! It's like a romantic thriller parody, except it's not a parody. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul plays the hunky and mysterious staircase of Emily Wendell, an oppressed preacher woman who is hard for Luke (Corey Sevier), whom we finally learned in prison; the only thing Sevier is to blame is bad action! Remember that it is no worse than other participants. You feel the participants have * no * ideas what they really are in a terrible movie; they play it directly. Everything in the movie is bad: actor, script, love scenes, tempo, turn to plot, music selection. Climatic scenes are just so ridiculous - first of all, shootouts in the church, then Luke's last words to Emil - I was laughing. Apparently, Luke made a lot of weightlifting and cleft in prison and we see a lot of his torso. This is probably the tip of the movie.
