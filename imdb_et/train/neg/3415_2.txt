The standard view is just a terrible movie. At the same time, he scores an almost perfect score on the scale of unwanted comedy. I can think of some real comedy that makes me laugh as hard as watching this movie. Andy Griffith's ghost dressed in Indian garb dance sends me to hysteria. I do not waste this gas or energy consumption on the video shop to rent it, but if you happen to put 3 on the couch in the morning and it is on the TV, check it out.
