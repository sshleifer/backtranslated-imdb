Style, but not substance. Not as funny as it should be. Not as deep as he wants to be. <br /> <br /> This is another film genre about the difficulty of making movies. The young filmmaker is hired to finish the 60s sci-fi movie Codename: Dragonfly. Think about Barbarella or Diabolique. <br /> <br /> But Jeremy Davies is a terrifying filmmaker. He's not a hacker, he's an artist. The movie he wants to do is a diary of his life. Hardly original. <br /> <br /> All characters outside Jeremy Davies's filmmaker are as thin as rice paper. Interesting characters like daddy, doppelganger or Jason Schwarzmann are presented as the director of the cages, and then the door is shown without adding anything. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of candy, but as compared to other filmmakers, such as Stardust Memories or 8 1/2, which he compares. These movies are funny, provocative, and well-developed characters. These films have lessons that are valid outside of <br /> <br /> The film wants to be comic and campy, but it's just a derivative and no funny scene. Filmmakers describe it as sending, but what is a satirical purpose? The actors say it is a tribute, but I think I'd rather be Codename's full-length version: Dragonfly. <br /> <br /> Coppola has obviously been delighted by the sci-fi movie by visual humor in the movie. But he doesn't share why we should entertain. <br /> <br /> Outside the sci-fi movie, it's just a mess. There are continuity errors, the filmmaker chooses a sci-fi weapon after selecting it. What is this? <br /> <br /> Just because he has a scene, the filmmakers are facing critics who complain about the lack of story, the lack of a point, a scene where he admits that empty wisdom does not mean that he has been engaged I think if your Roman cop can get out of making a film about a self-evident idealistic filmmaker who doesn't know what he wants to say and doesn't say anything. In this sense, it can be considered autobiographical. <br /> <br /> I would look at it on a wall full of TV in Circuit City if I had a choice. Watch the 15-minute Codename: dragon movies that are on the DVD as attachments, and then send it back.
