Giving credit, if any, deserves a reputation only for tehnicolor, costumes and kits. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the lowest point in BING CROSBY's long career in Paramount. The script is about as clumsy as you could imagine, and neither random Bing nor William Bendix nor Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do anything to fix it. <br /> <br /> Bendix sees a page boy in a wig. And the poor Rhonda Fleming has the role of a costume heroine that requires him to look adorably at Bing and elsewhere, except for a few unexplored ballads that are likely to be duplicated for the event. <br /> <br /> Just terrible! Mark Twain's spirit is not evident in any scenario. Only deadly Crosby fans will be able to judge this film's confusion when it is forced. Even the extras look like they don't know what they should do. <br /> <br /> To sum it up: Empty like water. Not recommended, even for children.
