Felt of me was watching it ... but it seems like this is the reason why the family in this movie works madness. It doesn't make much sense, as others mentioned, it was one of Karloff's latest films, and it's just his presence on the screen, giving him all the credibility. It is sad that all the great legends of the horror films of the epochs were finally reduced to such low-grade debris. Boris didn't get a little better than the poor old Bela Lugos, but not much. <br /> <br /> Boris does his best and gives him credit to try to save this mess. Stylish background music does not help and does not capture any clear moments. In addition to Boris, the rest of Mexico has been dubbed with some strange, truncated, English monotone that resembles the type used in the late 70's porn movies. <br /> <br /> I think it is Edgar Allen Poe's 'Usher's House' that it has been taken, but you would have a hard time getting a lot of Poe in the finished product. <br /> However, there are many better movies with Boris Karloff, look for them, and give it a wide pile if you don't want a curving brain!
