Don't waste your time with this dreck. As depicted, the characters have no redemption values, and tracking them is quite torture. "Gothic" was at least entertainment, that's a mess. If you want to look at pretentious and corrupted poets who cross each other, it may be in front of you. Lord Byron is depicted as a complete jerk and why others decide to spend more than five minutes with him is truly amazing. Mary Shelly seems to be the only sign of any backbone, but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without the dull respect. What a waste of time. See Gothic instead. I also remember another higher film based on the same subject, but the title was not. I was hoping it was, but there is no such luck. Not recommended.
