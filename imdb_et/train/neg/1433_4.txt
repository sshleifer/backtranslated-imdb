The images are large and well reflect the Canadian landscapes. The story, on the other hand, was quite boring; In my eyes, this was the story of love in the woods, as Titanic was a love story in a boat. I didn't feel Gray Owl was a great environmentalist. I usually like Lord Attenborough, but it was ... bad.
