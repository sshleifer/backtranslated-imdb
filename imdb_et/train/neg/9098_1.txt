There is a reason why certain movies go straight to the video and of course the obvious reason is that if it is too naughty for a theater player, then release it directly into the video. Of course, it wouldn't be good for those movies that are good and yet they're right on the video. This is no exception, although the film has good actors or at least potential participants: Amy Adams (I am an Oscar candidate and talented actor), Robin Dunne, who deserves a better or at least a better agent, and Sarah Thompson, who deserves roles that are leaving teenage melodrama . The film is also misrepresented: this film takes place before cruel intentions, so this movie is actually prequel and quite silly. It was a waste and really a movie of the same level as soft core porn and pay-per-view masturbation films. Fortunately, participants can hopefully delete them from their sequel. So if you want to see something naughty, but don't have the courage to buy porn, then rent this movie as a starter.
