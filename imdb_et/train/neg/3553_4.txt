"Incubus" is good (interesting murder mystery), bad (divorced script, sloppy resolution, badly made attack scenes) and weird (strong bleeding, strange sleepy and stiff performance by John Cassavetes). - Was that sign really "wacko"?). Not nearly as offensive as it is known but not very successful. (* 1/2)
