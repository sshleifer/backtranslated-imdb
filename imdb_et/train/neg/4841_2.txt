Really ??? <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised to see a glowing overview here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's one big pathetic, grainy, clich√©. I would laugh out loud and much, but I was on the date with the former military. I couldn't hide my second answer, BOREDOM. Yes, I think my date, a flat-line "good old boy" liked it. It's not a compliment. I know the actor wants to work. But Ralph, come on. <br /> <br /> It was a painful tease from Ralph. I only vote for 2 because Ralph was so strange. But I have to say, Ralph, how could you? And why ?? <br /> <br /> I'm going to watch The End of The Affair to heal and recover ... C1
