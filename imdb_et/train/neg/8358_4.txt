This is not one of Arbuckle's or Keaton's best films, that's for sure. A fat woman is tired of all her heavy drinking so she takes her to a sanatorium where a psychiatrist (Keaton) claims she has guaranteed treatment! Well, once there, Arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and took surgery. Then she escapes and rides around where she meets a cute girl who wants to escape. Eventually, they escape, despite being pursued by them, and it turns out that the girl is crazy and Arbuckle is soon restored. But she wakes up and everything after the operation has been a dream - a sexy crazy girl was not and Dr. Keaton is not as great as she seemed to dream. <br /> <br /> The lack of humor is the biggest problem with the movie. Of course, having fun with mentally ill people is pretty low, but during that day he could laugh. I would laugh if there was something funny to answer! A lot of energy and that's all. <br /> <br /> FYI - In a single tracking sequence, a fatty male contest over 200 pounds (wow, what are its probabilities?). And shortly thereafter, he relies on a post where number 5 was just freshly painted. As a result, they are now behind Fattyi's shirt and look like a regular participant. HOW SHOULD THE FATTY'S T-SHIRT BE REPRESENTED BUT AFTER BECAUSE THE FOUNDATION MUST BE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MIRROR COULD HAVE BEEN READING 5.
