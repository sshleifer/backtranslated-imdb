This movie was terrible. I swear they didn't even write a script that they just wound through the fingers across the movie. Ice-T was annoying as hell. * SPOILERS Phht more similar reasons not to look at it * They sit and eat breakfast for 20 minutes. he might have long gone. The ground was difficult, so it would have been impossible to follow him to prevent dogs. And if ICE-T is on this hill and uses this Spaz-15 attack on SHOTGUN, like its snailervin (and then truncated by an eight-shell tree that takes the tree size down to 1000 shells). and hand-held weapons are considered to be inaccurate in the 100's. And they even saw reflection. What reflected the light? I didn't see the scope of this thing. Even when he went to the intestine and held it, he was left dead. The end of PlusThe, where he carries a barrel of stones or cigarette. It won't breathe or kill her. The moon would still have to kill Ice T but bother the barrels.
