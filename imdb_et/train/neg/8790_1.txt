I saw this cable recently and enjoyed it. I have read the comments here and it seems that everyone likes more in the second half than in the first half. Personally, I enjoyed the first story (too bad that it wasn't extended.) Another story I thought was clich√©. And this "California Dreaming" when I hear one more time ... Chungking Express is fine, but that's not what the mainstream viewers see, like "Tiger Fetching".
