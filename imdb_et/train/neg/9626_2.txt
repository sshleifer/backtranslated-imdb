Don't let that bones. There are many things in this movie. It's a cliché all the way, not very funny, predictable and illogical. Let's start from the beginning: characters. There's a boring, unhappy guy - giving Stiller his boring, unhappy waistband - supposedly wild, but in fact quite ordinary, love interest - whom Aniston plays well but really didn't need to do it - fat, friendly friend and then the choice of clichés: annoying brave australian guy, confident spanish guy etc. Story: The start is a bit unusual, but then it goes into a standard movie style where every plot becomes as predictable as your average tapping joke. The biggest problem was that the "development" of Stiller's character seemed quite nothing - like your middle school game, the writers knew where he started and where he finished, but didn't put enough stock to say the average bit right. Finally, the alleged jokes were something other than the usual brand-humor version. there was regulation of chunder scene, sweaty fat men etc. In conclusion, the simple fact of this film is that learning the meaning of the word "shart" was the only good thing. Hamburg really brought a dog dinner here and the sugar coating of Stiller and Anistan could attract the viewers, but the taste left at the end was the same dirty. <br /> <br /> Final Comment: This movie may have been terrible, but Aniston still chose a friend-seasons movie when Kudrow's unpleasant Marci X.
