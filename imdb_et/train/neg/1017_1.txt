Oh dear god. It was terrible. It's bad, it was there. This movie doesn't make any sense. It runs across the map and it is not clear what it says at all. The music seemed to be trying to be like Batman. The fact that Edison is not a real city takes away. Since I live in Vancouver, watching this movie and recognizing all these places, it made it intolerable. Why didn't they make it a real city? The only writing that was decent was "Tilman", where John Heard did a fantastic job. He was the only actor to play his role in reality and not over the top and the camel. It was actually a shame to see John Heard playing such a very bad guy with a lot of screen time, and the movie is pulling out. Damage. Hopefully, someone sees this important and at least gives credit to John Heard, where the credit is to be paid, and hire him again as the leading halban that should be there. List A
