I was really terrified of this crazy movie. With an unusual dark atmosphere. And such a scary musical result. Really promising! Indeed, in ten minutes you start to really sweat and feel uncomfortable because you start to fear the worst. This movie has a real nightmare atmosphere and, worse, it all comes out. For an hour and a half, I have been trying to fight full boredom and falling asleep, but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake. Nuit Noire is a truly terrible picture - for your eyes, ears, intelligence, and especially the wallet, because the idea of ​​spending money on a cheap amateur homevideo movie ticket is the biggest fear of everyone.
