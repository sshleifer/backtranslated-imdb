I saw this movie in SXSW with the director. Quite a few people walked out and the audience could barely accumulate even polite applause. Of the 60 or 70 films I've seen at the festival, Frownland is one of the worst. <br /> <br /> 106 minutes is at least 95 minutes too long. You see how the main character failed and pulled out attempts to communicate in real time. The same grimaces, mouth movements, kinetic and frantically repetitive words and syllables over and over - WE ARE A POINT. <br /> <br /> One place compares this work early with Mike Leigh. Which drugs should be used to make this statement? Considering that Frownland is the master of Beefheart's song, perhaps you should be able to enjoy the movie masking a great Forte Mask replica. Incredibly, it won the jury award at the festival. You can bet he won't win the audience.
