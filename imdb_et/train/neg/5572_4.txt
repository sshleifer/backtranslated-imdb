Another colorful excuse for men in rubber costumes to wrestle with each other. This time, future-time travelers arrive in 1992 and recruit some people to go back with them in 1944 and prevent Godzilla from being created, thus saving the future destruction of Japan. But after completing this task, the time that the passengers have shown is the twin toys whose creature is rampant, and without Godzilla to stop it? Eek! Everything sounds very stupid and probably is, but the plot is surprisingly decent and the last battle also seems pretty good. Unfortunately, the rest of the visual effects are just garbage as well as nice garbage and the film is as uneven as its predecessors. Pay attention to the shiver of Spielberg.
