Let me first point out that I love the stories of Western and civil war. I also consider John Ford a great leader. I also have the same high feelings about John Wayne & William Holden's ability to act. <br /> <br /> I don't remember if I saw this movie when it first appeared in 1959. Last night I saw it for the first time since then. <br /> <br /> Like my 4 rating, I can say I didn't like the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I'm trying to talk about some of its shortcomings. <br /> <John Lee Mahin, who wrote a manuscript of Harold Sinclair's novel, was a very talented writer and wrote many fine scripts. This script is poorly written and poorly researched. They mention the terrible conditions of Andersonville Prison. Andersonville wasn't going on during the movie. They also use rifles that were not used at that time. <br /> <br /> John Ford has directed films for over 40 years and won 4 Oscars. He must be sick when doing it. Her usual style was missing. It may be that it was in the south and east of the film and not in the Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> He was usually a public limited company that he used in almost all of his films. This time, only the small cowboy stars Hoot Gibson & Ken Curtiss have roles and of course Anna Lee has a small role. There were no other familiar faces except 3 stars. (see below) Mr. Fords limited company made most of his films classic, which they were; Unfortunately, here you are. <br /> <br /> Now, we reach the main characters John Wayne and William Holden. The duke must also be sick, he seemed inappropriate here. This role usually fits perfectly with his style, he was right here. Wiliam Holden did everything he could, but not as good as he usually was. <br /> <br /> In such a movie, it was necessary to be an actor. Here, in her first important role (second film), there are very beautiful Constance towers, but not really an actor, she still has the roles of Television. Let me be kind and say that he has had a long career based more on his looks than on talents. Also caas like Ms. Towers maid is Tennis Star Althea Gibson. I am glad she adhered to tennis. <br /> <br /> The remaining production loans were far from the usual high standards of other John Ford films. some military-type songs that allegedly took place by the marching cavalry are not good at all. Action scenes were good but came at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Ratings * 1/2 * (of 4) 47 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)
