I don't usually write a comment online, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen. Not only has it been filmed as a soap series ("Young and Restless" actually filming professionals compared to it), but it also has terrible cuts. He has no action. It's full of unnecessary garbage. <br /> <br /> Here's an example: The boy wants to kill the main game when he was fired. So (after the burden of the rams) they are here: the guy puts his knife in his throat and says something like "You're dead now." Then the protagonist says, "If you kill me, you are dead. I have told the police that they are threatening me." So (killer) man goes like (just cry): "Oh no ... police officers watch me !? !! Oh ... my God". <br /> <br /> Remember: this is just one example. I really can't believe this film actually exists. So: If you want the WORST movie ever to be seen ..., I suggest it :)
