This is one of the toughest films of the 90s. I do not recommend this if you have something better to do. <br /> <br /> This image offers African-Americans wild, uncultivated, violent, insecure, frozen smokers. The Fudge (ice cube) and its homes are constantly disrespectful of other dormitories, not only white people, but also Asian, and they are never disciplined for their activities. Regardless of the tolerance they hold and cry from the evil white oppressors who lead and stand their lives. In fact, it is Fudge's effect that causes Remmy to be tied to the skin's heads, to fall out of college and eventually kill Malik's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Skinheads are hidden under hidden groups who share remove campus and generally stay away from all others. They do not explode their music to irritate people or the police. They commit serious crimes, such as battery and rape, but they are not as repressive or threatening as Fudge and Dreads (Busta Rhymes). <br /> <br /> There's a lot of material in this movie that has almost offended me or made me strangle. Some of it is listed below. <br /> <br /> Flamge and Dreads are labeled students of Columbus University, but we never see them in the classroom and it is quite unclear how they pay their tuition fees. One has left to speculate that the weeds they smoke have something to do with their finances. Although they are students who look like a private school, they cannot speak one of the correct English languages. Their characters are developed only through their compulsive whining and xenophobia. <br /> <br /> It seems that drunk Kristen (Kristy Swanson) knew exactly why drunk Billy was at home. He even asked him to get rubber so they could start. The fact that he penetrated without a condom became a rape, but it would be a great sex only if he had one comfortable. Later, Neuvn (Jennifer Connely) assured Kristen that she had no responsibility in this matter, and despite deliberately jumping into bed, she was not ready for sexual intercourse and was abused by a sexual predator. Then, a week or later, he met, and tall, extremely sensitive, good, who knew how to avoid rape and a condom. The director emphasized the contraceptive thoroughly. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete and perfect garbage that turns black people out like glasses and women are foolish and weak. Cole Hauser's action and Laurence Fishburne's accent are the only reasons I think about it. The writer / director is probably a man of limited intelligence. Go ahead and limit your own viewing if you want this mess, but remember that neurons do not grow back. Just follow the tips and UNLEARN.
