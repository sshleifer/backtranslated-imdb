I can't really think of the features of this totally bad rendering in Asimov as art. Forget about the product placement disaster, the convincing performance of Will Smith and the large plots of land. It was not only ridiculous but also painful to look at. Even the action was boring. The mix of MTV-inspired product values ​​and a totally bad dialogue was probably aimed at very young children. <br /> <br /> What a shame that sci-fi is bad can be done after we have had Bladerunner, Minority Report or, to a lesser extent, Dark City (same director). It really belongs to the bottom 100 list. Really terrible.
