Now this movie doesn't scare anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons - two big reasons and less - well, that's three reasons, isn't it. <br /> <br /> The first reason it's interesting is special effects. I found them quite interesting and somewhat remarkable. Seeing Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning growing hair was horrible, especially when they attended meenage Ã  trois. "Rolling Stones Song Sugar" and that he was in the notorious nude scene of the Rock musical "Hair" in London. <br /> <br /> In addition to the special effects, this movie had two more comments and was repeatedly filed during the closing credit. I lost the census, but I swear that Sybil Danning created these points in closed credits at least ten times and maybe much more. These were the most striking features of the film.
