Men, do I love police movies that are full of action, shooting, search, etc. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was behind this short and unsatisfactory movie. We've seen it all before, hostages, bank, surrounding ... But there are 2 other bad guys who shoot several victims and innocent people who just stay in the fire - without being hit by some Kevlar. br /> <br /> Not just some shots, no, hundreds of shots. Turning back to the bank, where the dark hostages did not lock the safe and the doors when the bad guys left. How stupid the director thought we were. <br /> <br /> Okay, tapes that the fake documentary was good, but after seeing the movie, I just got the idea: why didn't the police get a proper shooting course? And why there were so many police officers and was SWAT for a real long break. Really bad.
