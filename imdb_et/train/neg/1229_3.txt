Sorry, but besides being a good job of intimidating, Kim Basinger was one of the worst thrillers I've ever seen. The logic is thrown out because 4 young men are terrorizing this woman outside a crowded shopping center, then the security guard fires. But no one seems to notice. Then, instead of screaming for help or racing at the mall, he drives out and ends up in the middle of the boys pursuing. I can't even describe how foolish it is to see this woman fleeing from four slowed criminals carrying a red toolbox yelling at God to help her, and then having sex with one after others have been brutally killed. Please trust me, it's bad and a bit tasteless.
