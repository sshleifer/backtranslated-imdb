(First of all, excuse my bad English) Of course, only Jessica Simpson's starring film can contain such serious hands. I'm Norwegian and I felt offended and shocked by the fact that the filmmakers didn't take the time to make this American / Norwegian movie. Even Wikipedia is more accurate about the facts of this country. <br /> <br /> So I post my corrections out of my disappointment: - The country is Norway, not Norway. - "Da" is Russian, not Norwegian. - The Norwegian priests do not use these black lockers along the neck of this white paper, because the Protestant Church is dominant because it is true that we have a native traditional costume (which we use only twice a year), but its clothes in this film are rather German equipment . -I couldn't understand the Norwegian language in this movie. Jessica didn't think. Neighter made "Norwegian priests" <br /> <br /> The only thing I feel is the Norwegian flag (and the Viking hats, but it's so stereotypical what people think of Norway - the Vikings !: O gosh) <br /> < br /> Well .. I think the people who made this movie don't read this comment. but at least I cleaned up some things and got rid of some frustrations ..! <br /> <br /> I am proud of my country and I love the US people being less stereotyped and more accurate than they are talking about. <br /> <br /> It was all ..
