The first "Alone" was one of the 90's more fun movies. The other was just as funny with the same cast and fun! Now Home Alone 3 comes. I was curious about how they could continue the same story, given that Kevin would have been 17 years by 1997. So what does the director decide to do? She takes the child as annoyingly and makes her sick. The child is like 6 years old and the mother leaves her alone in the house? What kind of burger team are these idiots? I really don't want to get too detailed if you want to see this movie unfortunately. But please, I would recommend staying away from it. It's not worth your precious time. Go for a piece of paper, do housework, balance the pencil on the nose or make a nap! Then it's better to watch "Home Alone 3"! <br /> <br /> 1/10
