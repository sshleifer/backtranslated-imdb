I was in this movie in China. I choose Sheeba Alahan because I was modeling in Italy at the same time and they could not pronounce their real name correctly, so I choose Sheeba and then added Alahan because it was similar to Alohalani. <br /> <br /> I've never been active before (and it shows), but the movie was so fun. They gave me "lessons" every morning (apparently not useful). They dubbed my voice (thank goodness). David and Peter were attacks full of good humor and jokes. This film should never have been taken seriously, it was a tax debt according to insider information. <br /> <br /> I give him 1 because I have a sense of humor, but 10 for the fun I had "doing" in it.
