When I first heard about "Solar Crisis", I got this load, I was wondering why I've never heard of such a movie before. Then I saw it. <br /> <br /> Now I know. <br /> <br /> For an outdoor space, a sun, a large desert and a large metropolis, this is a terribly narrow and claustrophobic feature. ; it seems that everything is hunk so the camera doesn't have to pull back too far. <br /> <br /> The effect, though good, is quite subconscious; we're talking about destroying the planet's planet if the team of scientists and soldiers can't burn deadly solar energy. But, after screaming, sweating, and red shine, there's no real emergency. <br /> <br /> Don't get me cast on. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle and others do in this movie without even disturbing the knowledge of the material is to guess. Wondering who does not yet pay for apartments in other apartments in Hollywood .... <br /> <br /> And when it ends ... Well, let's just say it's tense and intriguing, but with too little delay in such a tension. If he had to keep that pace, maybe I would have heard the "Solar Crisis" before. <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mostly lost opportunities and poor careers. I wonder how Alan Smithee keeps his work junk as such?
