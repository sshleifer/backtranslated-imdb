While at school, I made a film with a couple traveling around trees, thinking about half-editing, that it was not just a failed aesthetic strategy, but a clich√© of Canadian cinema: scared lyric married free, metaphor-laden storms with social commentary. But no matter what the flaws in my movie, I feel better ... that ... thing .... First, my running lasted 20 minutes, not 85, and its content was bigger: every pointless business here is over four , five and six crazy minutes. The male leader is simply an incredible, frightening, loud slip that has been given to outbursts of drama classes, improving the T-pub between U-covered philosophical perceptions and giving him plenty of space to hate us. Indeed, if he did not have such a ** hole then the third act would be even less meaningful because a couple of snarky dudes would show far and inappropriately undesirable echo "use" values; but it does not make it easier to see if the drilled tail has "please" until the magazine has run out. I take back what I said about AUTUMN BORN, which had at least the courage of its misleading lechery: this movie is and remains the worst film in Canada. At least I really hope.
