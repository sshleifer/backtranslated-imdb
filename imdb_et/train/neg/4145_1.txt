Okay, I've been watching this movie twice now, I've been researching it a lot online, I asked several people there. I've even gone to the original length of the Sheridan Lafanu Classic 'Carmilla', which this film is based on. I think the best way to review this movie is to play to play it. Since the film's plot doesn't seem to make any sense at all, here's the plot of the book. <br /> <br /> Laura lives with her dad with Mr. De Lafontaine in Syberia Castle. They will continue their lives blissfully and peacefully. One day, they will receive a letter from a "general" man who has done his mission to get his daughters to death. He puts forward allegations of supernatural powers at work and explains that he will soon visit them. Meanwhile, a random encounter with a strange woman arises that Lafontaines has been caring for her daughter Carmilla for several months. Soon Laura will start to wonder about strange dreams and will start a strange illness. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And exactly what has he done with Laura's condition and generality? <br /> <br /> I've found this game and want so many people to play it, and let me know what their results are. I even have a memorable name and I would have a crackling, but I can't disturb it. It's called "this movie doesn't understand any sense" in the game. <br /> <br /> All you have to do is try to create a full plot of the movie while you watch the movie, explaining what's going on. I mean, all the questions answered, everything makes sense, absolutely complete. <br /> <br /> Do you have to answer questions like ... <br /> <br /> Why are vampires moving around in the daylight? <br /> <br /> * Why are they all lesbians? <br /> <br /> * Why is a girl named Bob? and why is he hitting himself? <br /> <br /> * When is a movie a dream and when is it really? <br /> <br /> * Why does it seem that killing zombies is an accepted part of a life that does not make anyone's eyelid? <br /> <br /> * Why does Travis Fontaine run down the zombie on the spot and drive his car without slowing down while driving, but when he is faced with a clear hostage behind his car, do you apologize for being a zombie? <br /> <br /> * And why does he let the girl he later discovers openly to know that this is the main vampire will drive him in his car * <br /> <br /> * And then let him to drive away with your daughter in a stolen car? <br /> <br /> What the hell is the asylum scene? <br /> <br /> * What the hell is green? <br /> <br /> * Why does a head vampire suddenly dress like a sister? <br /> <br /> * Why are there never vampire fighting zombies? <br /> <br /> * What is the importance of a necklace? what is it done? why does it kill vampires? and how does Jenna know that? <br /> <br /> In fact, it's as fun as trying out so many questions about this movie. <br /> <br /> I have my own plot and I have to admit it's not quite there, but it's a pretty good effort. <br /> <br /> All in all, "vampires vs zombies" have no moment at the moment where there are actually vampires fighting zombies. Everyone in the film seems to know exactly what is happening, but they seem very reluctant to get to the audience. And it's somehow based on the classic 19th century horror novel. How? Why? What the hell is going on?
