If the film is independent and not appreciated, like Hamilton, I had normally waited, cut my heart out of violence. I know that good movies don't always include blood or violence, but I read the comments, visited the website, and even made some of my friends pay $ 9.50 to see this god-terrible movie with me. If there is a festival called Horrorfest, I look forward to the horror, not to Dawsons Creek, who has an incest underneath. My expectations were very low for this movie, but little expectations about the movie were shot in hell when I saw that the hour went before we saw someone from the first blood drop out of the finger. There were too many holes in the plot and too much imagination. I'm sorry you didn't see Happy Feet. I think there may be more violence and gore in this movie than Hamilton!
