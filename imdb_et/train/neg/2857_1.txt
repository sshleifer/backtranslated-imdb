I've seen many Sci-Fi Channel Original movies since I started watching them again in 2002 (my first one was Sabretooth - which I think is one of the most interesting Sci-Fi Channel features). Their quality is different. Some are medium, but decent (Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry Werewolf, Swamp Devil), some are ridiculously bad and then there are some that are really terrible. Raptor Planet is the last one. <br /> <br /> Raptor Planet, the sequel to the original Sci-Fi Channel 2004 Raptor Island, is a barely traceable movie with a truly scary and lazy script. The effects that bring dinosaurs to life (a combination of puppet theater and animation, as well as CGI and Raptor Planet) are some of the worst budget films. Gore effects are even convincing. The plot includes a commercial group who for some reason (forget why) travel to the alien dinosaur planet. That's right, people, dinosaurs are foreigners. Dinosaurs in space. What's next, sharks in the room?!? The rest of the plot is easy. Man is poured and eats. By now we have been waiting for it in many released dinosaur films and novels, but this is the first killer dinosaur movie I've ever seen where I miss out on dinosaur attacks. <br /> <br /> There are, however, a few crying. There is one scene that stands out where Carnotaur (who starts with the film from live film) lives with a man who later becomes a giant raptor. Also a little trivia, this is a scene where Steven Baur shoots a scene of his death from the first movie. <br /> <br /> Although Raptor Island did not have a good movie, its masterpiece was compared to its sequel. <br /> <br /> Believe me when I say it is probably the worst movie Syfy has ever incited. It's close to sight.
