Most of the book adaptations are bad, but this movie set aside the main features and changed the description and some characters. They gave up the story and combined scenes and changed the queue. They added ridiculous things that never happened in the book and never. <br /> <br /> If I hadn't read the book beforehand, it would have been an incredibly boring film, it didn't leave you looking at the characters like or not like them. This makes the characters funny. <br /> <br /> Extreme. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Already two hours of my life.
