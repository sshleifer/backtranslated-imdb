I came to this movie with great expectations. I was aware of Greenaway's work and "Tempest" and was interested in adaptation. First I wanted to turn off after ten minutes, but I felt it was unfair. There was a storm, but where do you think you're going to be a little boy peeing over the boat? It's symbolic of what? I continued for another ten minutes when my finger pulled over the 'off' button. It's not Shakespeare, it's not a cinema. It's time and place for that, but I don't waste my time and there's no place in my studies at Shakespeare. After twenty-five minutes I gave up and it was the end. Then I read all the comments on this website and the film's pretentiousness was only by his defendants. "It's a painting ..... put it in the gallery," "it's a ballet ..... hold it on stage". Shakespeare can be done wisely and the games were presented to mass groups, they were available and this version helps to wedge between Shakespeare and the general population - and I don't think Bard would be happy with it.
