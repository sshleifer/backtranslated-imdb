The film tries to be a documentary documentary documentary, but with many obviously written parts - but it is unable to provide the public with any signs to create an illustrative image. The film also wants to find true love in Los Angeles, but there is nothing more than an interesting look at the amateur filmmaker who is trying to make his first "big movie".
