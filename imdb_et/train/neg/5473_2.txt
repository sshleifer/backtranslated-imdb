I've never seen one of these SciF originals, it was the first. I think it's fair to judge the performance, direction / production, design and even CGI effects of other SciFi films. To compare it to normal Hollywood production, it is unfair. However, I say that the general Aztec Rex did not like Werner Herzog's masterpiece Aguirre, God's wrath. <br /> <br /> I start by saying that yes, I know this film is more related to a cultural collision than a dinosaur. Despite being a TV-sci-fi movie, the background to this story is the context I explore. The embedded symbolic elements are obvious enough. <br /> <br /> Consequently, as a student of history, theology, mythology, and film, I found a terrible dialogue and the subjects of the plot are somewhat offensive. I'm not asking for any mea culpat on behalf of the manufacturers - as I already said it is. But I have been concerned about the fact that a large number of younger demographic films probably depend on television to give them a story about history and cultural diversity. <br /> <br /> The main problem is most obvious in its nature. Ayacoatl (there is no comment on Dichen Lachman's presentation, but just how his character was written, although I say he has some work before he gets Emmy notes). The actions of its Europeans are justified by its nature. His task in the film for love in Rio confirms that the European way is the right way, simply because they are Europeans. There is really no other reason. It really is just a presumption that the viewer is meant to associate with Europeans over the Aztek, because their dress, language, ideology, etc. are more familiar to them than the Aztecs, so the Aztecs represent the opposite sex and retrospectively. And it's not just that the viewer is left with this assumption because of the ethnocentric perception of the viewer, but it seems like the story is trying to convince the viewer - as if the Aztecs couldn't plan - if not better - to attract the dinosaur to his death on the bed . <br /> <br /> There is a Spanish subgroup in fairness, depicted as looting temples, and intending to misuse the native language of MesoAmericans. There is also a scene where we have a Christian holy man who observes the achievements of the Aztec: "They have agriculture, medicine, calendar, etc.". - But in the end, there is still a Aztec warrior depicted as the main antagonist of the film, even over "thunder lizards" (later on). He was a treacherous, double-minded and trying to send a romantic European Spaniard trying to consume a hallucinogenic mind that changed the mushroom - this is an important spiritual component of certain local Meso and North American aspects and religions (again, more so later) so that he can to keep the woman she knows belongs to her and the Spaniards. <br /> <br /> Now, by analyzing the true nature of the story (leaving obvious Christian and pagan topics off the table) from a symbolic point of view - the viewer can easily take these so-called thunder lizards from the MesoAmerican ideology / theology depicted in this film as one intention: bleeding , ruthlessness, cruelty, evil, maybe even evil? In the opposition, we have this group of Christian travelers led by young Hernando Cortes, depicted as naive, but generally noble, lambs who have hit the Aztec dark world. The film is also called Aztec Rex, which leads one to believe that dinosaurs have to eat people. However, what Aztec Rex translates is the king of the Aztecs, the head of the Aztec state, or in this case, in the "state". (So ​​why did the movie's title change). And who do we really see that this is the last king of the Aztecs? It's the rest of Spain, Rios. Aztec Rex is referring to the new European ideology that fought through diseases, bloodshed, war and famine, native american. Rios symbolizes an ideal European - the filmmakers want to be remembered (as opposed to Cortes, who represents a "hands-on-noble European"). But when you study the Holocaust in America, let's face it: do the symbolic parts of the story of this film want it back? <br /> <br /> I have to say that the Aztec Rex is, at worst, a bit racist or kind of unknown, at best. <br /> <br /> And yes, I know it's just a movie, everybody meant I'd be fun, I understand, but in the end we've got the idea that Rios was the father of the last remaining Aztecs? I don't know what Native MesoAmericans should be thinking about at the end ... like me, I thought it was a little too sensitive. <br /> <br /> The best support for this movie is Ian Ziering's wig - though striking - that at least changed the look of Ziering enough so I didn't think I was looking at the 90210-derived yuppie that drove a bunch of twilight hearts. Ziering proves that he is more than a capable actor in this film, I actually bought his performance or at least forgot that it was still Ian Ziering. I don't know who his representative is, but he should do more work. <br /> <br /> Finally, it was a pleasure to see Jim McGee again. I've been a fan of the Scrooged stealing from a short time since 1988. <br /> <br /> Alexander Quaresma - DeusExMachina529@aol.com
