This movie was written by Charlie Higson, who has previously made a "legendary" Fast Show and his own show based on one Fast Show character (Tony, car salesman). He has also written James Bond's books for children. <br /> <br /> In fact, I've only seen Gordon movies based on Lovecraft's stories, and each of them is wonderful. Here, Gordon tries to do something else. Style is completely "modern", which means shaking camera, fast and strange cutting, cool chillout music in the background. I think it works pretty well, but it's still useless and cheap. It often makes me think of an operator who shakes his dv camera in front of actors / actors and tries to make stylish movements in the pictures (hoping that something like that can be tolerated). Casting is good and the whole atmosphere is the result of good management. I think the main character, the "zero" young man, is quite interesting in his "zeroness". Fat boy is also good. And a man who looks like Alec Baldwin, but doesn't have him. But soon after the start it turns out that the film is something not so interesting: in this case I mean the scene of endless sadism and disease. There is not much humanity in this film / story: it is completely pessimistic and every person in this film is disgusting and hopeless or soon dead. Needless to say, there is no humor. It's 1'40 long vomiting without any relief. Anyway, Gordon remains one of the most interesting filmmakers who are active today, and I think this film is an attempt and its failure. Everyone must sometimes get lost, just learn and find their way again. It may be Gordon's most interesting and empty job.
