This movie was like a bad indie A list of talents. The plot was silly, to the end. It reminded me a lot about what was put on the home video market in the 1980s. I would have given this one, but there were short moments when you saw the actors really struggling to value it. I think the worst thing was keeping an underwater scene out of the dock. Underwater lighting seemed to come from, and if someone we had to take care of was near the tip of the air, that air tank would appear. I would avoid it if there is nothing else on the shelf. Good day.
