... and yet, we were told there was another hour and 20 minutes to go. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why wasn't there an editor who would tell the writer / director to hit, snip? Apparently, the writer / director has made trousers before; if short, it would have been fine. But the lack of dialogue will start after 20 minutes. A lot of music doesn't look like. Background noise (speaks, traffic, and especially common helicopter) is aging very quickly. But the worst failure is the story. A little short time is short. <br /> <br /> After an hour we saw the same scene variations over and over again. I almost screamed on the screen: "We get this, we get it !!!!!" It is amazing that after leaving this theater we can go home, watch the Daily Show and parts of Colbert's report, prepare for the bed and know that the audience was in STILLIL theater. <br /> <br /> It is not enough to give your vision. You have to give the audience enough to share your vision.
