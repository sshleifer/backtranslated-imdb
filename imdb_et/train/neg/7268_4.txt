Bored, tall, pretentious, repetitive, involved? this gear seemed like a bad date. Worse still, the tedious art-school direction - the use of heavy hands, which is so over-painted as it almost put me in the ascension - throws constant attention. Add the smallest plots and practically no dialogue, and the film will begin to feel like a four-hour epic about 30 minutes. It gets worse: voice commands and quotes and songs that comment too badly on characters are poorly written instead of dialogue. Really loud opera music. Blame it all on the director. <br /> <br /> Participants are all pretty good. The leading actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is especially suited for the film launch. He and other participants have some delicate erotic moments. Even they start to get lost in 5 minutes, and one wonders if the director manages Bel Am's porn work. Gorgeous college campus as the location of architecture in Mexico. How are universities in the US so wonderful (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD with this movie. Do you want to use the Quick Scan button ?? much.
