Freddy Krueger's sixth gear, where he has finally been able to kill almost all the Springwood youths; now he wants to broaden his horizons and (** SPOILER **) needs it to do that. <br /> <br /> Failure as a horror film because it is simply not scary at all. Works better than a dark, spooky black comedy to tell you the truth. Freddy Krueger is now taken away from his ability to freeze that viewer. (Too many wisecracks, that's for sure.) Actors are not interesting (except Robert Englund, as always, and apparently sliding Yaphet Kotto) and are just too many visual effects. Finale is OK but doesn't give as many sparks as I think it can count. <br /> <br /> Adding a new twist to a familiar dream killer gives Englund the opportunity to do more non-makeup scenes than ever before. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting: this is a couple of Roseanne and Tom Arnold comrades who have no entertaining value, an appropriate appearance by the veteran shock roller Alice Cooper, and Johnny Depp's funny bunch, which also recognizes the pop icon. he had received. <br /> <br /> Breckin Meyer's film debut playing Spencer. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this is presenting the main scenes from previous records during the closing credit. <br /> <br /> 4/10
