First, a technical review. The script is so slow that it is really a 25-minute story blown up to 1 hour 40 min. The dialogue is both flat and truly one-dimensional. "Functional" is pathetic, it seems that they have indeed raised schoolchildren out of class to read a few lines of the idiot plate. As for the "point" of the whole story, namely "war is bad" (oh, there's a shock!), It really is nonexistent. Without "let's shock" and get a big "scene" of advertising, no one is talking about this movie. It is so bad that I really think it would be better to use it if that money had gone. Believe me I've seen some bad "emperor new clothes", but one thing I want to tell them is at least those that were well photographed and well done when the camera sucked in two scenes! Read all the other reviews - avoid at all costs and don't talk about it.
