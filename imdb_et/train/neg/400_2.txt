I rarely make these comments, but I felt compelled to encourage other pain I watched while watching this movie. It is so stupid and unlikely both in the general story and in the details that you just can't stop unbelief. The problem begins early when you see a government researcher around the Porsches tool and eating with his team looking like a castle overlooking the Capitol building in Washington. Ha! It only gets worse. After all, when a bad boy starts killing good boys, the latter group is acting so foolishly that you want to die to cleanse the gene pool. The special effects are pretty good - every manufacturer can buy it - and the leading actors have been great in other movies, but the scenario and direction here are moral. Many people have wondered whether Paul Verhoeven's previous, foolish movies (Showgirls, Starship Troopers) were deliberately intelligent, but this film should think. He's just bad.
