I can't believe that with 34 previous comments, no one mentioned this film as a dirty blast of Born Yesterday. The man is hired to bring a seemingly stupid blonde that meets the requirements of a gangster. Hired gun and blonde fall in love and live happily. Gangster is left. But yesterday was an intelligent treatment, but it's just so fluffy. The transfer of Technicolor to DVD is regrettable. Natalie Kalmus runs around her grave. See the paper. Recognize her? But it is historically interesting to see the roots of Rock 'n Role. Also interesting is Ewell's introduction to CinemaScope, which is a new format.
