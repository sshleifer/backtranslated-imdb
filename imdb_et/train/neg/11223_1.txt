I was watching the film and I was disappointed to say that the film couldn't communicate with me as an audience. The tongue would shame the streets. <br /> <br /> Land; a father who does not force anyone to marry his son seems far removed. <br /> <br /> The idea that grandmother asked her child to confuse her enemy would only distract attention from a weak mind. <br /> <br /> ... and I was waiting for the whole movie to laugh and laugh at my stupidity for 3 hours to convince myself that the film isn't even worth the first. <br /> <br /> Hope this saves you time!
