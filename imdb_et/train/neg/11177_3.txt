What seemed to be the longest one hour 35, I had to endure for a long time, Al Pacino gives a solid result. Not his usual way of writing that was great. But his character was just really pathetic. Someone who comes in when he stumbles upon forgetting meetings when we realize that Hollywood's social life has cleared him of his life energy. But in this movie we needed someone who likes it. And for some reason, the character of each picture said, "I don't know why I like you, Eli" on the Al Pacino chromosome and I couldn't even like her. <br /> <br /> All other players played their usual styles. Tea Leon, Richard Schiff, and Bill Nunn did nothing to make people on their television or earlier films. And Kim Basinger wasn't long enough in the movie to offer any result. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie was not a boost. Most scenes never help the story, but rather collect the factoids from the characters that later appeared in the climatic end. It had the potential, except for their unwillingness to rely on the story. <br /> <br /> What is the idea of ​​a movie? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz would you think "If Hollywood is for you, you can't come out." Yeah, of course! And that's why so many people have been fired in Hollywood.
