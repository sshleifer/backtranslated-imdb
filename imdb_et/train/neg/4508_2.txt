Andrewjlau, I could no longer accept. My girlfriend is watching it now and I find this movie terrible. Quote my Chinese girlfriend, laughing, "They do it all for a man!" I find that these women have no intensity, no sense of tragedy and identity, and that these men are hardly worth it. During the dance picture, when Zhang Zi Yi wins, men see the fool more than admire. <br /> <br /> The Japanese people have much more intensity than the Chinese people and geisha is Japanese culture. I am sure that the Chinese had something similar, but the faces did not match. <br /> <br /> In any case, dialogue is so unforgettable, American. If the European had done it with the Eastern Europeans, they would have done a much better job. <br /> <br /> I have to add: it seems that most people who liked this movie are American. Sorry to say, but no wonder. Everything was written for you, not instinctive, not passionate. I think the Chinese actors are beautiful, but I couldn't say they were good actors in this movie. Yes, cinematography is great, but really, I don't see how these characters are complex, deep people. <br /> <br /> I'm going to Japan to see the real thing. I'm sure it would be amazing to see.
