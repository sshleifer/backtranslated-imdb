I've been using IMDb for some years, but I've never written any comments before. But this film was so disappointed with me (even though it was a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that I was no longer silent. <br /> <br /> Noise is the New Yorker story (Tim Robbins) who is so disturbed by noise pollution that he takes alter-ego as a vigilant, a "Rectifier" and swears by the car he finds in a car alarm. <br /> <br /> I take the name of the movie as a somewhat wrong user. Although there are one or two cases where other sources of noise are or are mentioned, our only real focus is on car alarms. Car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. There is really no other attention. If the film tries to tie other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car noise, it seems to have been simply thrown to give Robbins a character for action. Yes, we all disturb the noise. No one likes the sound of car alarms. Of course, we all have such an internal desire to take the baseball bat, and this movie uses this movie and quite a bit. I say "pretty much" because there is also a prominent sexual relationship (including a totally unnecessary threesome) that is obviously thrown out for those filmmakers who need such things to enjoy the movie. Frankly, it's eye-catching. <br /> <br /> Robbin's character, very soon a movie, will become completely irrelevant. Fewer, it seems that he decides not to put the noise any more, and more than to concentrate on the noise he has begun to lose his peace of mind. In the first half of the movie, there is essentially a story of how he turns to an angry, car-bashing guy in the hero of this little boy The Rectifier. But ... transformation doesn't happen. He just calls himself around. <br /> <br /> I could go on for a while. An annoying general social comment comes every now and then, to add the pretentiousness of the film and a self-satisfied smile that never leaves Robbins face, doesn't help. In general, I think it is very obvious what this film is trying to do because it is pretty much under the throat, but I don't think it can do much. Only one man thinks rejoices.
