I went to the screening of this movie and was shocked when it was that cheese. It was a combination of every horror / thriller clich√©, trying to comment on many things, including pedophilia, Satan's worship, secret police, things, religion ... and that was a mess. it was a pretty washbasin; boy and the guy of Jesus were fine, but after them .... Anyway. I admire this endeavor (albeit slightly failed) in an attempt to show Christians a different way ... even though they did the way he introduced the gospel, there was a bit of a spare and a baby. But then again it may be because he talked to a little child ... no. in fact I have decided that all this is bad. music ... oh my dear ... horrible ... toooo too dramatic. Okay. I felt bad for people who made this movie premiere; It seemed like a bad student project. I'll finish this rocking and say to the bottom line, go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life. Please.
