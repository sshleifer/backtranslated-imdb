My wife and I agree that this is one of the worst films. Certainly the top ten of those I looked through. At least "Plan 9" was enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed "Christine", "The Dead Zone", "Firestarter", "Carrie" and some of her other movies. I didn't care much about "Cujo" (just because I've seen that sound was so bad and I couldn't often say what people say), or "Pet Sematary (Pet Cemetery)". <Br>> <br /> But this confusion was a very possible mistake. The "creatures" themselves appeared to have been designed by 9-year-olds. (There is no attack on 9-year-olds.) <br /> <br /> Even with "one liner" we made us nervous and not far away.
