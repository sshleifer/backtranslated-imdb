This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I looked at it mainly because of the curiosity of the illness, because I loved the novel and I would not. I turned it off in a little less than an hour, although I wanted to turn it off after five minutes. I wish I had. It ignores a lot of the novel and changes all kinds of factors. If the movie could not be redeemed in the last 50 or more minutes (which would be impossible), I would not recommend it in any way. Its insult is one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. I don't think many people say "The Bell Jar" is necessarily unclear, but this particular transfer could have been done. I would like to see it in the hands of the director and scriptwriter almost one day, who can do it fairly.
