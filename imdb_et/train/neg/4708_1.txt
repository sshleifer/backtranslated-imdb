Heldeke! For the first time I heard about this bad show when one of my friends screamed like an idiot "JOHNY TEST" when we were playing video games. I thought he was confused with "Johny Quest" (by the way, one of the best cartoons I've seen in my life) and "Quest" changing "Test". It's strange that I'm wrong, but actually I was wrong, he didn't change anything, he heard this show. <br /> <br /> One day, watching the TV, I heard it was going to release the Cartoon Network. what was the plot of this exhibition, so I predicted to see it, and here is my answer: "I want to see me back" (because I watched this mess and "My gym partner's monkey". <br /> <br This is one of the worst shows I've ever seen, first, the beginning, with the most foolish song in the world, then the plot Oh, where are my ways? I haven't said the plot of this exhibition Is there a boy who holds AMAZINGLY INTELLIGENT for nurses who have a lab and who's experimenting with my brother, OHHH, now I see why his name is Johny TEST, he's a test of his nurses. <br /> You know, I leave Dexter La b (before it became a new Dexter, It was a bad copy of an old good exhibition, except that this show is amazingly bad. Don't look at it, make it more productive this semester than watch this crap.
