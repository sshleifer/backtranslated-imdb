I have read a second comment about this movie and I usually don't try to be tough in my criticism, because I'm trying to be a nice person. But this movie is one of the worst movies I've seen (and it's a lot of bad US networks plus Cinemax nights). This movie worshiped me in such a way that no other film has ever been. I really think these people are crazy. Just save time and don't look at it. Please - I wish I had. The action is terrible, the plot (which plot) is STUPID and humiliating and crazy. I really don't think it would be a movie. But that's my opinion, and I'm trying to save you from wasting my time.
