Jesus Christ, I can't believe I've wasted my time watching this movie. I was just looking at the drunk of the Jordan Lady. But watching this movie put me down. It's terribly awful! I could have reviewed the Survivor Series 93. <br /> <br /> This leading man was so wonderful and general. I would love how Mistuharu Misawa Tiger drives his ass through his glass. I was every time he said "lake" and "salon". I'd hit her ass. <br /> <br /> Jordan Ladd, on the other hand, was absolutely wonderful. Real angel. But he could not even record this movie joke. Unfortunately he could not even act as he had taken his nut when he took the medicine of this truth. It seemed fun. <br /> <br /> I also loved it a bit where yogurt accidentally flowed in Jordan. It reminded me of the time ... nevermind. <br /> <br /> Anayways are watching this movie terribly.
