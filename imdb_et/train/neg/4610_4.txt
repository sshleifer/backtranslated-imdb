I watched this movie because I noticed it was cast by Kari Wuhrer. I have long been his theory that he is a talented actor but never seems to prove it because he is always in such a low-budget B movie. She's still pretty, and she's still trying to take on the regrettable material. The film is often ugly and disturbing, but it doesn't do it well. George Wendt played against the type and it was so jarring that he recognized his role. Another comment on Mrs Wuhrer. His breasts are noticeable after the last vision. Perhaps a reduction operation or (more likely) removal of implants. It's not bad. He still looks good. I'd like to see her in a better movie.
