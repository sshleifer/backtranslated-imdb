As others have pointed out, this film is criminally inaccurate in depicting the artist's life and I was very angry and offended for one ... making my rape a tragic love affair, meaning that his rapist was responsible for "awakening his talent" because of his total disregard for work, making this idea a sexual object, forward and further. I also find it annoying that people who do not know Gentilesch see this movie and walk away from that impression about him.
