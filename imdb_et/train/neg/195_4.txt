Slowly and with inaccuracy. Reviewing its mistakes, it is still an interesting overview of Alamo's famous and heroic restriction on Texas's struggle for independence. James Arness as Jim Bowie. Brian Keith as Davy Crockett. Alec Baldwin as Colonel Travis. Raul Julia as General Santa Anna. For this TV project, David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler. Very good original music by Peter Bernstein.
