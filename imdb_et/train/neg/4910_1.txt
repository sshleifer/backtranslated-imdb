The word "1." in the title, the viewers of this film are more evil than its victims. At least they do not have to adhere and see that this endless movie reaches its death. <br /> <br /> 1. should refer to: the first script in the script; 1. Used in the final film for each performance; 1. editing in post-production production; etcetera, etcetera. <br /> <br /> The movie is not thrown too badly, but the fact that everything about the movie is worse than the third price, from a silly script to a wooden show. And if you wear a movie under that nail, with the 2-hour sign you want to get out of your trouble. With a 160 minute length it is clear that it should have been edited in less than 2 hours. Even in the equally terrible lakes of Placid, Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda, at least a very weak script, had enough nuances to laugh at the movie. 1. Until death, one effort comes only for the time that has disappeared to wait to see what happens after the opening of the preparation of the female lead suicide. <br /> <br /> Editing is so bad that it will never be used by one of the main characters I think (never quite said) is DA. Obviously, the scene where he was introduced to the viewer was left on the editor's floor. And no one thought that a character from somewhere was an unusual film boy. <br /> <br /> In short, don't waste your time with it. My wife and I wish we didn't. But at least we have created our own anomalies by commenting on the different places in the film, as it was in the Mystery Science Theater. "Meanwhile, in Cleveland ..." !!!!
