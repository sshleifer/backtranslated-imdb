What can you do if you have bad behavior, bad leadership, scenes that are amazingly long, terrible lighting, painful editing and terrible effects? You get Jessica: Ghost Story It looks like your hitting betacam, which is good, but the lighting needs to compliment this media. That is not the case in this case. There are some CUs where the human face is completely in shadow. Especially one scene is a psychiatrist scene. This is a joke when you ask me. Some scenes were so long that they could have been cut in half ... but I think they wouldn't have the length of the movie. The main character is incredibly flat. He is a LEAD male, so he should have elements of his character's "hero", but he doesn't. She whispers and fears the whole movie. I could go, but I don't want to waste my time. Although the lighting was terrible, I have to say that they have a nice camera movement. Too bad lighting did not congratulate it. The DVD cover is nice and it will end. Just terrible.
