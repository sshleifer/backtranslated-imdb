Four years after the director's debut with art-house snoozer "Welcome to L.A", Alan Rudolph shows us what he really wanted from Hollywood to be one of the boys. "Roadie" is frat-boy fracas with baroque shocks, horny-harpies, Art Carney in both uphill wheelchair and meat Loaf wheel. Meat Loaf (played by Travis W. Redfish!) Is actually a pretty charming presence on the screen and maybe in a smaller role (in the better movie) he can really congratulate, but the Zalman King script is full of stereotypical humor and the helpless Meat Loaf is widely and morally held. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr. and Blondie show everything - and everything seems embarrassing. They should definitely "Roadie" be one bad trip. NO STARS from ****
