A disappointing, predictable film in which a woman (Mc Teer) travels with her state from a state to a state because she is unable to maintain relationships and find happiness. In this genre, "Anywhere, But Here", where starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman gave a much better insight into mother / daughter relationships. Better functioning.
