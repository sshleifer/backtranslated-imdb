I don't actually post comments, but I wanted to warn people about this movie. This is a film of unfinished students that has no redemption qualities. On a technical level, it's completely amateur - a constant inadvertent jump editing in scenes, copying wildly, etc. The plot is completely clichÃ©, the structure is ridiculous and the actor is embarrassing. I do not want to be too harsh: I have made my part of the study films and they were all terrible, but this film has no reason in a world where innocent fans have to see it. /> <br /> A safe assumption that, like cast positive comments, filmmakers, friends and family have.
