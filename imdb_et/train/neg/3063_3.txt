Meaning is usually a glorious image of the hero. For example, Bonnie and Clyde praised the dynamic bank robbers and felt their consciences despite their compassion. Why? They were two people who were depressed when people were desperate to survive. <br /> <br /> This film has no substance. The sign of Viggo Mortensen will soon appear as a folk hero. Why? He travels along the Idaho highway to the hospital where his abducted wife has taken. Nobody bothers to understand why he's trying to escape from everyone. Worse still, when it comes to understanding that he is not a red-necked terrorist, no one in the government wants to help him if they try to save their rear ends. <br /> <br /> Jason Priestley stands for radio emcee based on our hero's support. <br /> <br /> The end is absolutely incredible.
