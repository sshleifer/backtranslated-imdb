When Ben (Red Foxx) discovers his wife Beatrice (Pearl Bailey) with his brother, he rushes to his son Norman (Michael Warren) to let his shameful story discover that Norman has a secret lover: Married Garson (Dennis Dugan) .) Needless to say, Ben does not take it well and numerous complications - including Ben's attempt to get Norman homosexual, affirming him with a whore (Tammy Dobson.) Unfortunately, this description of the movie sounds more entertaining than the film itself. <br /> <br /> Originally written by Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick, NORMAN ... Are you? was an absolute disaster in New York. To play the game, I saw it in the 1970s staged as a community theater production - and although no one would blame it for anything other than a low farce, it played so widely and just as dropped that it was quite fun. It is unfortunate that this movie was not the same. <br /> <br /> This is a terrifying film. Red Foxx, one of the most fun comedians of the 20th century, is just as funny here as yesterday's washing, Michael Warren (who later appeared on HILL STREET BLUES with much better results) competes with Foxx to see who can give the worst performance and Pearl Bailey is not far off; In fact, it has to be said that only Dennis Duggan, Tammy Dobson and Wayland flowers have a shield - and unfortunately this is only compared to the rest of the pain. <br /> <br /> Not only is a movie badly done, it looks bad. According to film teaching, this was the first big-screen effort that needs to be filmed in video tape, which was then transmitted to the celluloid for project purposes - and believe me, it shows. The look of the film is bad for a silhouette painted from the windows of the 1970s sitcom, straight from the windows of Norman and Garson. HOW YOU? not one of them. I can summarize my reaction to this film in two words: miss it. Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't touch it on ten feet. Just return slowly and then run like hell. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
