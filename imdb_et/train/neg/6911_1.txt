What a large amount of manure. Shot-on-video (really dirty video camera, NOT digital) garbage. This is undoubtedly the most stupid thing. The fact that this mess is actually released is completely asanas. Anyone who sees it becomes a stupider to track it. Seriously. I felt that after that garbage I watched several knee cells in the killer. This $ positive assessment was given by the "filmmaker" (and I used the term loosely) myself and / or his family and friends, because no normal person with the squirrel's intelligence would honestly want this life. Trust me, leave hell out of this video. You thank me for that. Avoid it like herpes.
