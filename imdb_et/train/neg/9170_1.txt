The question, if anyone sees this movie, may not necessarily be, "How did that movie make it bad?" or even: "Why did I see this terribly?" but, "What have I learned from this experience?" Here's what I learned: <br /> <br /> - Just because the "rules" of horror movies are cataloged and counted many times over ten years does not mean that nobody goes on and makes a movie that uses all of them without sense of humor or irony. <br /> <br /> - If your movie needs to be described as a video game ** loosely **, you will have a script problem. <br /> <br /> - The black character may not always die first, but the Asian character always knows kung-fu. <br /> <br /> - Although you may be proud to think about how to do it. Effect on "Budget, Which Does Not necessarily Mean You Should Use It Again and Time When It Is Nausea." - Ron Howard's brother does not guarantee selective roles. <br /> <br /> - When the scene don't edit together, just use video game material, nobody notices. <br /> <br /> - If your relative rap-metal band offers your movie theme for free writing, courtesy of a drop. <br /> <br /> - Zombie Movies They are not zombies killing people. They are about zombies who kill people, preferably in the most horrible way. That's what they are SCARY. <br /> <br /> - White people who can pay $ 1,600 to rave, deserve to die. <br /> <br /> - If you find an old book, it will tell you everything you need to know. Anything else you explain on your two lines after someone asks, "What was that?" "Where are we?" <br /> <br /> Bare breasts are not a panacea for horror films. <br /> <br /> - Helicopter boom and Sega license agreement make your movie magically "student film" in the "studio". Try it! <br /> <br /> - Just because you can name all three live dead movies that won't make you George George. Or even Paul W. S. Anderson. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse movies, but only because I've seen "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation".
