It was just terrible when the plot was just OK, but the rest was bad. I mean, come on the doll and then they even tried to make the movie digital and it made it even worse! I would normally like a low budget movie, but it was just a waste of time and almost made me want to come back. I have about ten small budget films with similar 6-8 movies, and I have to say it's the worst movie of all of them. The wording is also off and they use fake plastic masks that don't even look real, they could use what seemed a little bit closer to the real, to save you time and money and don't look at the horrible film.
