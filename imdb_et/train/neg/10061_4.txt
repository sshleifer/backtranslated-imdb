"Franken's Curse" remains exactly the story of Mary Shelley for a single headline word that wouldn't be so bad if the changes were good at all. The tragedy of the creature destroying the Franken family has been completely cut off and replaced ... nothing. The story of the heart and the moral center is gone. It doesn't help that Frankenstein is a companion, an evil murderer; he deserves everything he can. The plot is basically a checklist of Frankenstein clich√©s. Even if it is taken under its own conditions, it is a garbage: a spooky, flaky film that contains a glowing view of a bottle bowl hairstyle. Since it's the first Hammer horror movie directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, it's a place of horror. But that's a mess.
