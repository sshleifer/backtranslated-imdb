Expectations were somewhat high for me when I went to watch this movie, after I thought Steve Carell was unable to make big movies like Anchorman, 40-year-old virgin and Little Miss Sunshine. Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Let's start with what's right in this movie: Steve Carell is allowed to be at some points. The film has a handful of moments that made me laugh, and it is almost entirely due to her being given her things to do. He is undoubtedly a talented person, and it is a shame that he signed what was, in my opinion, a whole train wreck. <br /> <br /> Out of this, I'm talking about what went horribly wrong. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Dan Burns, a three-girl who is weighed nationally on the Syndicate Counseling Column. She prepares her girls for a family reunion where her extended relatives gather for a while. <br /> <br /> The family is high on the list of things that makes it a terrible movie. No family behaves like this. It is almost the same if they were transported from Pleasantville or left to Beaver. These are the caricatures of what we think the family is when we are 7. It reaches the point where they become uncomfortable and simply depressing. Touch football, crossword games, bowling and talent shows are NOT coming people. It's almost sick. <br /> <br /> Another big mistake is that Carell should fall. Looking at Steve Carell in his first scene, he is similar to looking at a stroke victim who is trying to recover. What I imagine should be unique and original in this woman if it has been slowed down. <br /> <br /> It makes me think this movie is on another planet. I left the theater to think about what I just saw. After thinking, I don't think it would be much.
