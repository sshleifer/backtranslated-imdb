It's really one of the worst movies. I consider myself to be a huge zombie fan and usually tolerate bad stuff, flat "special effects", and whatever you may have in second level movies, AS LONG, because the film has a good atmosphere / story / stop or whatever you can offer. It has no positive aspect in principle and is the third or fourth rate, perhaps worse. Some of my friends and I made a small movie during the week's vacation and definitely did a better job (though not a zombie). <br /> <br /> This flick is not even funny, nothing else. Really bad and superfluous special effects, zombies that look like ordinary people (except for the white face that is pulled over their face), NOT LESS FALSE BLOOD (I like a lot of realism, the combination of realism and Zombie films is arguable, but the gore presented is just stupid). The camera stays pretty long when it is feeding with scenes, it's boring and you can't help but don't know why zombies use the WEAPONS (!) To kill their prey. I do not go into the details of duplication (others have done so). While I'm from Germany and I'm at least a little curious about the original version, I don't waste my time with that time. <br /> <br /> Stay away from it whenever possible.
