Sorry, guys, I've already written about this movie, but today was the first day I looked at another review. There are quite a few people who agree with me, but it is frightening that some people really look like such a movie. I don't like to write nasty comments or criticize other people's opinions, but I think it's fair to be warned by someone who might be discussing watching this movie. It's not a good movie. I like movies and I watch almost everything, but this movie put it on a very short list of movies I watched and was happy to leave halfway. If you are really tempted, look at the trailer ... this is the mistake I made because the whole movie is essentially a trailer ... after that there are no surprises, but a somewhat shockingly bad dialogue to waste time. I love Michael Vartan's alias and I hate to criticize him, but I think it's my duty to stop other people who waste hours of their lives on such a film !!
