Carlos Mencia constantly, violently, shouting "B ** ch!" women are like "n ** ger!" black people except it is worse. Remember that the B word, unlike the N word, is the only pejorative term that is still related to violence. "B ** ch!" is the last thing women hear before being raped, beaten or murdered. This man abuses violence by using the language of violence. He seems to be a gay boy who tries to cover his wife with bash, so he sounds like a straight. And how all the Nazi white boys who give fascist greetings to their audience, while their fools, small bimbo white women worship their seal, are clearly frightened to protest against this woman's hatred of hatred. Make hee hee. But Mencia does not believe or support the speech! Come on, Carlos ?? Do you want women to be free to speak b ** ch-slap as loudly and violently as you can in your mouth, or do you think "freedom of speech" is only for men who laugh at women?
