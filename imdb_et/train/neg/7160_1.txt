Well - if Jason Miller's (even exorbitant IV's still eroded) camouflage look is the highest point of the picture you have? <br /> <br /> This is a bit of a country, a bit of rock n 'play: mix two jars with money that drag your child all over the place with bitten-dried mummy (have you thought it's another - dried bog?) in the basement, Christopher Walken is a poor color sample and a little girl who could have been an interesting character if they had worked out. <br /> <br /> I understand - sort of - that they go back to their relatives. After that .... <br /> <br /> Problem: There are many interesting feedback on what I have to assume that his mother will be killed in a car bombing (I think). It's never something involved. <br /> <br /> Problem: What do we need for Grandma? Now grandmother may be interesting. He's talking about Gaelic or Celtic or something. Maybe you can do something. The best they can do is to have a tobacco habit. That is all. <br /> <br /> The problem: they made the husband a real cozy character. Does he write (does he sell his wife to the devil? Maybe he can wait for a trust trusted to him) or does he reject the type (ultimately he has a good hairstyle and nice clothes)? He drinks, he hesitates. He's not a bad man. Not good. But I don't like it. Why didn't they do anything to him? <br /> <br /> No problem: an old boy will appear. The man strikes him down. She returns to her husband. (It gets pretty stupid, but at least this character is motivation.) <br /> <br /> Now - he's an alcoholic, he's an alcoholic; he could only get married for his money. The grandmother is locked in the bedroom. The blind uncle takes our heroine into the basement to show him the mummy of witches (do you follow it?) Who can live. In fact, you know that he lives, the music swells. A little girl lives in the house, takes her grandmother to the door (opens the door to do it) and gives grandma a cigarette. Periodically, grandmother gets out. But nothing happens. The man and the woman lose the boy in the house, then lose their bedroom. Uncle in the basement cut into the throat. Leading woman has nose bleeding. Man drinking. They both drink. All of them have a terrible truth, mentioned in the first voice - omigos - abortion, when the leader's wife was twelve years old. <br /> <br /> Despite all of these hanging yarns, no one was able to get on the screen. There is no bridge between situations, no disruption to the horrible horror, no longer slow scenes that go somewhere, nbody, really, take care - and they had places to go with this aspect - an innocent child who drives drunkards, grandmother who may be locked because he is a monster but no, his worst fault is smoking. She has big hair, good makeup. <br /> <br /> There is no plot in short. Somewhat random (predictable) violence in the dark library where the rain falls, and the soundtrack that brings us in. You need more than a few drunks and a movie to make Christopher Walken. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​were good. Oh. Nice landscape, good wardrobe. At least the operator knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> I bought it. Poor me.
