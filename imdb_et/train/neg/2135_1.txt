Just talk to the trash. I'm a big fan of Cusacks, that's the only reason I watched this movie, but the only reason I saw their presence was Grosse Point Blanc's accurate and deeper, less quality. In addition, the role of films as a political satire is not disgracefully too obvious to even be the most moral for any purpose. And to exclude it from being a satirical satire, it would not even be synchronized. Imitation is obviously the highest form of attractiveness, but seeing that it is not close to Grosse Point Blanc and the same league, when you meet (see if your honor) Spartans in terms of political satire, let them leave alone and let it vanish into the vagueness that this absolutely worth it.
