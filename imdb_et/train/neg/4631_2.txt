Although Misty Ayers (Burlesque Stripper) is definitely attractive to the blonde leader, this flick is just an excuse for letting her strips down a few times (in 1954, when that film was made, not nudity, not 1965). > <br /> The man who takes him to work in a forerunner is similar to Abbott & Costello Bud Abbott. Most of the other woman is unpleasant and the drunken woman is in a creepy way to have fun halfway. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10. Ms. Ayersil has a convex body, but you can't judge the acting of talents because the ENTIRE film is imitated. Some of these "exploitation films", which are usually done later than this, are in some way interesting, but it is really a clean festival. Targeted Sid Melton (MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY). There are some samurai-like facial expressions and interesting apartments, but here is nothing.
