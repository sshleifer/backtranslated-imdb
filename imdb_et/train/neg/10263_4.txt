Yes, South Star has a pretty forgotten title that is suited to this heavy crown Matt Monro. It gives a lot of tone to this swollen and rather dull function, which is amazingly uneven with George Segal and Ursula Andress as an adventurous couple in search of a big diamond. Add Harry Andrews (with a strange accent, no less) nonsense ostriches, tons of wildlife stock footage, and Raoul Coutard's poorly drawn and dull photography, and you'll reach a thoroughly failed train in Senegal's jungle.
