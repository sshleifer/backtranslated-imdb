Don't be mistaken, it's not horror or film. I strongly recommend viewing this 82-minute failure; the only reason he earned a star was the presence of Chris Pine. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. You are patiently in the hope that deformation, a surprising hint, a plot will be created - but not. there is no time to develop - thanks to economical editors and honestly embarrassing writers - before returning to an idyllic and playful (to bring teenage stone assembly) state. The only thing that could have made it worse would be to add a pernicious symbolic ethnic "companion". <br /> <br /> Their encounters with obstacles (be they human or physical) are short, confusing, and completely pointless. <Br>> <br /> Chris Pine fights to keep himself above the surface while being exhausted with mild pain. Lou Taylor Pucci was unable to dry when he spent the summer with Keanu Reave, who fought the Navada desert. <br /> <br /> See 'road', see '28 days later ', watch TV days ... but that's it; I ask you. Bear the boredom, unlike the fact that the film can be believed, this film does not improve.
