If someone illuminates me, I really have no idea what the film is. It looks like a picture, but it's far from it. This movie tells a meaningless story about a New York journalist and his problems. And that is basically everything. If this agent plays Pacino, one has to think that it must be something important. But the meaningless and boredom of this film is not difficult. For one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second film of the year (the second is "Simone"), which deserves the title of "the most boring and senseless film of the year". So what's going on, Al?
