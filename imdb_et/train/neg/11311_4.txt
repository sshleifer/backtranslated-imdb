I remember Ben from my 60's Sci-Fi fandom days, I did a lot of interviews and bios about hidden actors, especially Ben, actress Fay from Spain and Jody Fair who played Angela in 1961 The Young Savages. Ben was one of the people who lived in Chicago with a lower-key Sci-Fi con, about 1970, when I had a great conversation with him and his "career" and life. All of these were published in a forgotten fan a few days ago. I would like to have copies of these interviews, but time passes and none of these people remember me so many years later. Ben was really a nice companion who lived out (the drawbacks of these days didn't cost his guests even if they were not big stars, of course, and even then it was just a few hundred dollars)! Good to know that Ben is still alive and kicking!
