This movie is one reason IMDB should allow 0/10 votes. Operation is terrible, even what some have praised here, the Carpathian character! The script looks like it was written in haste. In one scene, a black narrator left behind when Buck asked what "dan7" meant in computer graphics, said "Daniel 7, * CHAPTER * 24." He probably meant VERSE 24, but the filmmakers left it. Perhaps the worst part is that the eschatological position of the film is insecure about the Bible. Although many Christians have accepted the end-of-film interpretation of the film, this interpretation is, in my opinion, * wrong. To understand these shortcomings, read Jim McKeever's "Christians go through misery" and George E. Ladd's "Blessed Hope, Second Advent and Abduction Bible Study".
