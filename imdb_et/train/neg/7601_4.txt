This is a film that shows that mood and music and texture are not enough to make a good movie. Of course, the viewer is treated with a number of fine Los Angeles scenes in the thirties - I especially liked the trekking approach to the tunnel and the uphill tram, but in some ways it is a fine cinematic self-defeating, because it creates the feeling that "something happens" - and nothing does . The script also keeps on some plot or action or trauma - and not from time to time. Not even filming a movie (I assume), a significant misuse of characters. Leading actors who are too beautiful for their roles, did not transmit any repression or torture, and the script did not leave us alone. <br /> <br /> Now, Donald Sutherland? This is another story. His character was so well-designed, so well played that I wanted to watch the camera.
