"Practice" is shifted to quite successful and well-written "Gray's Anatomy". The cast is fabulous. The premise may even work. But writing is just terrible. <br /> <br /> The advance vote, which was hidden in the Gray anatomy episode, should have been my first warning. The plot was just blah. I thought maybe it was a fluke. So I set up a DVR for the pilot and all other episodes on the tape. <br /> <br /> When I looked at the pilot, I was just wondering how an exhibition with such beautiful actors could put together a boring pilot. The pilot should suck people and keep them coming back. There should be excitement, lightning, excellent writing, an intriguing story with a suitcase that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season. Amazingly, there was nothing like that at this show. <br /> <br /> Thinking it was a fluke, I just looked at another episode that hopes the best. And while it is somewhat better, it can't get close to what needs to be interesting, it can't stay off the TV. <br /> <br /> I just cleaned this example from the list of views. Not worth the IMO, and I would be very surprised if this show would change it in the middle of the season. Go to one of these people.
