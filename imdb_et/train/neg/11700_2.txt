I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but after watching it, I was very disappointed. The best bit was when Stephen King was in it. Rober John Berk cannot act to save his life and each other. Some productions even made me laugh out loud! The film was not as I imagined it, after reading a fantastic book, I imagined it to be darker and more intimidating. If I were Stephen, I would be very crazy! <br /> <br /> I don't know why they ended up changing, I thought the end of the book was very good. If you just discovered that the pie killed your daughter, wouldn't you eat it for someone else ?! <br /> <br /> The book was so much better!
