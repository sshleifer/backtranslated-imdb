The JD has never been impressed anyway and the ultimate justice (which I had not seen before my MST3k incitement) is no exception. It's not that the character is less pleasing than Mitchell: it's just that Geronimo ("Call me Heronimo") doesn't like it. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is suspected that all Mitchell and final justice were Joe Don's retaliation agent schemes trying to get a "star" by inducing a heart attack. The problem is that it's hard to tell the difference between his comedy characters and his "serious" characters as he is. <br /> <br /> About the plot. .umm, what's the plot? Repeat the same pieces as many times as you think you look at Groundhog Day 2. Probably the fact that they use the same scene from Geronimo out of prison is expected to be a comic relief Ummm, yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the Maltese landscape is pretty gorgeous, so it made me 2. Lick gave Malta tourism a few decades ago.
