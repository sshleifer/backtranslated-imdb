Rodney Dangerfield is not the main character of this movie. He's hardly in it. Most of the screen time is dominated by funny jokes. One current gag is that the character name is Jerk Off. There are also many erectile jokes where the stroke has an erection. This movie is as funny as the British accent of Kirstie Ally is convincing. <br /> <br /> This movie started as a weak action movie: five minutes ago and then bam! Unfunny jokes. But in addition to the terrible letter, the film is badly directed and the actor is terrible. It also makes old bad comedy clich√©s with many well-known B-movie actors. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid, and Phil La Mar. These are just a few of the people who spend more time on the screen than Rodney, although he is the main character. Don't be surprised if you find this movie at a drug store for five bucks. Even this is too much.
