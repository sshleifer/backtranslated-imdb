Spoiler: A bunch of passive aggressive people with family reunion. The script has them and things that people never do, at least someone with disgrace. The hero falls on the woman she sees as her soul mistress at the bookstore, which was the day of the meeting, not knowing that she would appear again to her brother's girlfriend. She tries to delay her brother's claim, but, knowing our hero, has obviously attracted him, tempts him mercilessly, wearing sexy clothes and behaving like a stripper, rubbing the whole brother of his brother to show him how to stretch. At one point, she really disrobes and gets into the shower with her. He's trying to cover his eyes. His heart breaks. She thinks it's funny until she suddenly decides she doesn't want a brother and leaves the reunion. <br /> <br /> The movie really pulls. The target audience rope and tortured their long distance. Writing is incredible and incredible. We almost went out, but we were sure that something would happen that would bring things up, but nooooo. All beautiful reviews have to be written with paid colors so that poor poor suckers like me would look like this. Compared to Little Miss Sunshine? Jeez. Shame on them, the writers, the actors, the producers and the theaters, to allow something like that to do.
