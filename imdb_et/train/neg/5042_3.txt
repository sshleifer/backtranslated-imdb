The main complaint of this film is that I can't tell who is who. No racism is intended, but these Asians look the same! I can say a little about this story, but heck thats about as much as it goes. Human identities are not a mystery if they were the mysteries that I take care of for them. Instead, I didn't remove them from the ASAP screen. <br /> <br /> This movie has been captured with extensive photos and silent emotions. Heck is bored, not only familiar with these people, but just sitting there. <br /> <br /> Production is a typical Chinese John Woo, a terrible video with spotty scenes. It's just a little better than Andy Lau's "full-time killer" (which was a great movie.) You would think with a decent budget that they could look at it at least like the 90s in Hollywood. I didn't know the Chinese had these art buildings.
