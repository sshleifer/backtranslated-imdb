A nonsensical boring film, charismatic Mercurio is completely wasted. The first Thursday, perhaps one local cinema, will release a minute and the entire Sydney population, except mine and four others. BACK OF BEYOND is a project that was apparently set up by a producer looking for a fee. Local actors, such as John Polson and Terry Serio, deserve better (well, Polson has run into a flat thriller, like SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK), and Terry Serio never sees guernsey beside the Syrians. But Paul Mercurio should have become Australia's largest export screen. Such roles are great disappointments and such films are just a waste of talent and time.
