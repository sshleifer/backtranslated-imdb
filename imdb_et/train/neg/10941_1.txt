WOW what I'm saying. I like shity movies and I go my way to see the scary action, but Snake Eater would rather have reached my urinal when my grandmother gave me a dance dance. Lorenzo Lamas, more than Lorenzo Lameas, has the same ability to act as Bill Clinton has self-control. It has all the goods that really make the bad movie even worse. Crazed Hillbilles YEP! unnecessary tit shot (with real weird grace) YEP! crappy soundtrack YEP! I wish I could give the movie -10 stars, but 1 is as small as it goes. I really think someone was kidding me when I saw it, because it can't be real ...... worse with 2MORE SNAKE EATER MOVIES! ...... I think its demand.
