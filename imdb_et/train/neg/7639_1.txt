I saw this movie at NY Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and thought it was pretty bad. The first and most disturbing was how much of it was shot; that means a lot of slow moving and overly artificial close-ups that had no sense - a story wisely or aesthetically - after showing the operator's skills (which I also believe as a director). This movie seemed like a pretentious film student looks like. The leading actor (Sam Levine) was certainly very cute, but at best was a mediocre actor; and the rest of the cast was so, so bad. The story itself was mostly irritating. I have to admit that most audiences seemed to enjoy the movie; laughs and sighs constantly, but I didn't like it much.
