This movie is spoiled in Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode. I think MST3K was the best one for hanging this movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible act, bad makeup, bad effects, chick (1960s) underwear. I give it to 2. <br /> <br /> It's hard to understand a companion because of makeup. Assistant says things like "not you" that sounds like NACHOO !! (guess sneezing). It's just a bad oration. Long eyebrows are fun in one character. <br /> <br /> I still don't know what "Predicted Man" means in terms of plot. However, I stayed from the beginning. <br /> <br /> What is the minimum of 10 lines for posting?
