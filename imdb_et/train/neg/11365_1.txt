This is a very sad film. Really. Nothing happens in this movie. The script is bad! I think they just copy the first 15 pages to 90 pages. Manufacturers have to think that we are creating a Hollywood movie here in Belgium. They didn't succeed. In the third week it only works in Antwerp and Brussels at 22.45 or something. In the past, Belgium has had very good films like Daens. Shades is a waste of your time. Maybe you could see the theater sneaky when you saw a real movie. If you've seen the shades of 10 minutes, you've seen it. It was announced to death on local radio and television. I hope it will disappear in the shadows soon.
