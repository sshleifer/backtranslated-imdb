First, Steve Irwin, peace. Many fans loved you. Now ... this movie wasn't a movie at all. It was the "Crocodile Hunter" TV show with poor performance, bad scripts, and poor targeting between Steve's capture or teaching. He was an entertaining animal seeker / specialist. Millions leave it. But the whole idea of ​​the movie was a big mistake. The plot was so broken, it was almost non-existent. Casting was terrible. It was not worth the action even at primary school level. The direction must also be damaged. If you can't do half of your participants' performance, no matter how bad the script is, you must not be so good at first. I could have written a better script. I wish I had never seen this movie. Of course I watched it for $ 3 ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son), while with friends who demanded it instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son, who is not so discriminating, liked the film well, but he never asked to see it again. If you want pleasant memories from Steve Irwin, buy on his DVD. Avoid this movie like a plague. If I were Steve, I know I wouldn't want to remember this movie. Respect him: Avoid this movie!
