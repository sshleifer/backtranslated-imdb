Was it predictable when Tori complained that his first boyfriend treated him as a robot, and then his new boyfriend (murderer) turned out to be an artificial intelligence designer? I think so. Scenes that make you delight: assemblies are abundant, kimono stripes (what do you call it when you put your clothes on instead of taking them off?) And a climate fight ski! Be sure to tune in at the beginning and end, but during the second act, the sandwich can be won when all the plot is done. Is it better than CO-ED CALL GIRL? Nah. Does Tori even do it on paradise or out of the snow? No.
