I've never commented on IMDb, but I feel I have to watch Batman's animation. Its absolute garbage! Warner Brothers had a perfect animation at Batman in the early 90's, so what are they trying to mix with the winning formula? I feel like writing a letter of complaint to WB. The original animation was dark and cried exactly as Batman was supposed to be. WB was supposed to interfere with future Batman. Now they are producing this fire. Joker is not like DC-comic Joker. DC should dig. I invite everyone who agrees with me to email or write to WB and use the power of people to get the original formula back
