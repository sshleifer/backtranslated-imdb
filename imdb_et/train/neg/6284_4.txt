I liked the original assumption of the movie that made me hunt, but the problem I found quickly is that it knows quite a lot about what's going on in the first 20-30 minutes (double come behind the mirror and take it all). <br /> <br /> There is no real twist (which is good), but the final revelation does not make much sense (how can it affect the whole film with insecurity and fear if it is evil beside the mirror?). <br /> <br /> True, mirror-image scenes were cool when they first appeared, and the blonde murder is also crappy, but ultimately it seems to be a story or a more interesting script-searching film, atmospheric application, and 80-90 in a matter of minutes the amazing sound structure does not really cut it, in fact it becomes quite boring.
