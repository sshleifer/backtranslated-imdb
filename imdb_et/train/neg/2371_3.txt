I'm not a big fan of Freddy Krueger, but that doesn't mean I don't like Robert Englund and his second nightmare in Elm Street movies. I think Robert is a very good actor. Nobody plays better Freddy Krueger than he does, but doesn't ruin Robert, the film was sucked. Operation is terrible, the plot is really weak, and Freddy Krueger is the only cast that is even worth watching. Sometimes the queue can be better than the first, for example on Friday the 13th franchise (I thought the remake was the best in the series.) one of those movies. The original was good, the other one was better, the third was okay, but the third was okay, but I haven't seen the others. Whatever you do, don't make the same mistake I did when looking at it.
