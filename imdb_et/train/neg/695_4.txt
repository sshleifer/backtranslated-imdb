I heard so much about this movie how it was a big slasher and one of those early 80s films that die for the hard fans of most of the slasher movies just had to see. Well, I rented it and I have to say that while it keeps my attention as far as the aisle goes to most slaher films like "April's Day", "Friday 13" and "Prom Night", this movie would have been right there above substances did not have the real enthusiasm and potential, as did the character. The signs I found were unhappy in this movie because it was a strange guy with hairy hair that kept the dormitory and naturally brought him to a real climate change when he was facing a killer. The other would be a dirty bug who is a jean jacket, he could have played more roles in this movie that could have made the movie more interesting, instead the movie was played by this man as just one loser who made unknown calls during his sleep. with his girlfriend and then falls on his part and cuts him down until the end of what was waste, I was finally disappointed. As far as the actual identity of the killer goes, when the identity was released from who he was, I just laughed, but it was all obvious and he really made a real jerk, as well as his annoying character. real intentions appeared. This movie should be at least once to watch all slasher fans, but don't spend your hard earned money on some rarely difficult collectors to collect.
