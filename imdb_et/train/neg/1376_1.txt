Of all the films (and I'm a filmmaker when it's worth something to you), this is the WORK movie I've ever seen. I know there are probably some worse things I haven't seen yet, but I've seen it and it's the worst. My friend and I rent this one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about youth and braking. He's not credited! His role was incredibly small! How did he put it on the cover? IMDb doesn't even read it in its filmography. This movie was so bad, we wrote a little to the video store as we returned it, and we slipped inside that bag. He read something like "Please save your remaining customers to watch this complete and totally bad movie!"
