One of my friends bought this movie for 1 pound and even then it was highly appreciated. Despite such big names as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Burt Young, this film was as funny as taking a plate and hammering it right at the ear. It uses tired, bottom cylinder technology - consistently breaking the fourth wall when Sandler talks to the public, and seemingly meaningless "hot girls" assemblies. Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it a successful comic to become successful with women. If a ship's resident comedian - the shameless "Dickie", which is due to his impenetrable success with the opposite sex, is expected to be lost at sea, Sandler's character Shecker will have a big break. Dickie's not dead, she's locked in the bathroom, probably a seaman. <br /> <br /> Maybe he vomited his slowest film.
