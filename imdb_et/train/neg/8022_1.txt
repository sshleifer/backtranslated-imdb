I see someone has already thought of a similar analogy that was similar to the first thing that came to mind after watching the movie. They said the ingredients were there, but there was no plot. In addition to sexual scenes that are confined to child pornography (which I would have felt could have been changed or recommended in nature rather than graphically, I would compare it to a recipe that is broken in half, a list of ingredients that have no instructions on putting them into production) there is no character formation and story development ... unfortunately this monotonous generation has in many cases bullied a plot and we think "ahh-ok ... finally we can find out more about why this scene is happening ... or ... WHO this the sign is ... or maybe we can finally know and appreciate this character more ... or understand and participate more in the relationship between this character ... etc "But there is no such happiness! On the contrary, many times I was tempted the more than once turned off but it stuck when the carrot was hanging, just to find that no matter what the mini-plot anger mini-plot (and that which was badly presented) was just a rose, so why did I stay there until the end of the mystery, except for the IFC usually have a better choice and they gave him 2-1 / 2 stars (another secret). This does not mean that characters are not pleasing to ALL degrees, or that you are unable to identify them at all or their human dignity at all ... that is just that it could have been a little more effortful. I note that it has been made around Santa Cruz and thought it was someone's film school project. I wish I could have given this better overview, but frankly, it was a disappointing and disappointing month and a half.
