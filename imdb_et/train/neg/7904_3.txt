The ridiculous look at the small boogers that spawn and reproduce themselves. So far, this is a movie for fear elements. All the rest of MUNCHIES play like a really slow comedy that is so stupid that it will be more funny in about 15 minutes. I can imagine that little kids will be happy about these little boogers, but for adults, these supposedly "intelligent" references will turn the screen into things like, for example. bold statements by filmmakers "Look! We're here for GREMLINS success!" and Clint Eastwood's cardboard cut, which tells us ... exactly his western films? This last one was completely lost to me ... Oh yes, and the removal of chemical waste in the caves seems bad. Don't know where they got the idea. <br /> <br /> Don't say that MUNCHIES is the most unsuccessful movie to sit through. It's just really stupid. And if you manage to break the smile while you watch it, you will probably feel so stupid that you've done it after the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Good bad? Yes, but only if you are looking for "stupid", "slowed" and "ridiculous". 3/10 and well, 6/10.
