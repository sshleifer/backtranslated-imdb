This direct-video-duffer is another pound of Rick Moranis career coffin. As a Disney tradition, quality is sacrificed for quick entry; it is lazy restored and in Moran accidentally shrinks itself and some relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie. The blade of this cheese has a lot of visual effects and a non-drum-like dialogue that did nothing but put me in the "Incredible Shrinking Man's Day" when such a thing was done properly. It's surprising that it is headed by top operator Dean Cundey, who should either stay out of work or choose the right material the next time.
