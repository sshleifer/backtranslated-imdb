I was waiting for French music in B-film. After all, Dhéry, Blanche, DeFunès were the superstars of this time's low budget French films. And it's colorful! But I have hallucinations in this incredibly one hour 30 pure mediocrity. Musical numbers are terrible and comedy is totally boring and stupid. And the songs? What songs? It's just a sequential bad number, one after the other. The only very rare thing about this is women's nudity. It was not familiar at that time. In fact, some numbers are just to show us topless women. It adds mediocrity! And try to find a young musician Michel Serrault in his first film, who will be a great actor in French cinema in the future. Success!
