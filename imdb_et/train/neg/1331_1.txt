The collusion course is even worse than the typical "bad white male capitalist" movie of the week. This film is less pleasant than toothache. Jay Leno can act. She is good at her undervalued debut film The Silverbears, where she presents her character with demands. This film is so bad that Leno's character, the sacred tree, is less annoying than Morita's character, a sacred fool.
