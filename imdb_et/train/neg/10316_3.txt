Frankly, when I first heard about this performance, it may be a bad idea to show that Muslims are using racial jokes themselves, but that is exactly the opposite. I realized that an exhibition that helps people understand that if a Muslim uses a word like life does not mean that it is a terrorist thing. It also shows how people give a bad name to Muslims because they play their stereotype, watching the example regularly, people realize that everything, though it may be a bad Muslim, doesn't mean we're all bad when we just try to live 1 at the same time as how hard it was for Amair to get on the plane and how he used words such as "Blow up" or Yaser, saying that we are attacking the competition and people took it wrong. Being a Muslim, I know that such things usually do not happen, but they do, and many people think that there are bad things about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq. people see how we treat this exhibition badly and it can think of them as it is. I'm glad that this kind of atmosphere is coming up. Many show that Piotr Muslim people as terrorists, many people find them funny for their opioid is OK to do it now and then, because prety is all about joking who we say you can't do that joke. unfair, but it is often done and in fact a bad name is given to Muslin people.
