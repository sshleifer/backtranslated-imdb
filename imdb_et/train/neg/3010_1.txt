holy sh * t it was god terrible. I sat in the theater for an hour and ten minutes, and I thought I was going to have a lot of eyes on my mansion in Oedipus Rex. lovely God. this film does not deserve more credit than anything the high school film buffer does. please save your money, this movie can't offer you anything. if you do not want to visit the cinemas and sleep. you know h3ll, bring your girlfriend and make things interesting. you're the only one out there. F @ ck this slide show. <br /> <br /> You will be warned. <br /> <br /> I recommend not seeing it. <br /> <br /> Hello, <br /> <br /> How are you? <br <br /> <br /> Do I enjoy this day? <br /> <br /> I am. <br /> <br /> This comment was a hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this movie of the day. it is sad.
