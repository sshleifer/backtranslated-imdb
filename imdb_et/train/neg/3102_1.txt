No matter how you watch this movie, it's just terrible. <br /> <br /> If you look at it as a horror, this is an unpleasant movie with monsters hand-made dolls. <br /> <br /> If you look at it as a comedy, you will notice that most humor is flat and just flat. <br /> <br /> If it's a romance, you don't know why a man in such B is ** ch! <br /> <br /> If you look at it as an action that you really can't pull, <br /> <br /> As you can see, this movie can't deliver anything remotely. As mentioned, the monsters are obvious dolls, and this movie was another test for Gremlins-type film. However, it has the worst looking monsters in this genre. Critters seemed pretty good, as did Ghoulies, the devils saw even those who were from Munchies. The characters in this movie are completely unlikely. The hero is a lousy security guard, his girlfriend always has complaints, they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military officer and another friend who is a spaz. At one point in the movie, the hero and the soldier fight with the kidnappers ... this movie is completely stupid. I like the scene when they are in a terrible club (which is probably not a club, but probably a canteen) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21. Give me a break, I'm 25 and I look younger than any of them.
