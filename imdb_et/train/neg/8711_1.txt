OK ..... This is the third in the carnivore series. Allows starred dinosaur dolls! At the beginning of the movie, you can't see Dino's reason when the body counts can only see Dino's eyesight, smart enough to hide the bad dolls! and maybe after 16 minutes in front of the film, special teams with a team member Rance, the team will be in stock and then begin to find body parts and dead body after Dino's rampage. the team failed and you hear the vocalist shouting, pretty scary! and then the black girl walks on, and now one blossom is found! It opens up a raptor's hand and cut his face, but when you stop when the raptor's hand can see that its just a man who has a hand on a doll!? WTF! The story is simple. 1. Some terrorists are attacking some trucks because they wash some guns there. 2. Where dead dead seams are ten tons of raptor and one gigantic t-Rex! How did t-Rex fit into it? 3. Rance and some nerds kill dinosaurs! Unfortunately, a foolish blonde girl announced her to grab one alive = (4th Saint Jessie, where the robbers have their own races! 5. Dino is now in a boat in the Pacific region. 7. END The movie is good if you want to laugh.
