Billy Crystal wrote together with cogeneration and stars in this extremely safe and comfortable comedy-drama about the irresponsibility and aging of fathers and sons, adults. Billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha) that causes her to look for her alienated father (Alan King), a movie-extra, who boasts herself in big letters. The script is pointless to Neil Simon with a single liner, which is Henry Winkler's (flat, inexpressive stuck in the sitcom mode) and ready conflict. Crystal and King are trying their best, but the King is too eager and often up. JoBeth Williams has yet another ungrateful role for him, but succeeds in bringing his girlfriend to his innate class. I think this is a comedy, but what the tears are flashing ... shamefully. ** from ****
