This movie was so bad, outdated and stupid that I had a tough time to look at it to the end. I saw this Rodney guy in Natural Born Killers and I thought he was funny as hell, but this movie was nonsense. The "jokes" were not funny, the actors were not funny, something that wasn't even funny at all. Don't waste your time for that! Only such positive things were beautiful women :) and Molly Shannon, who I am sure I tried, but the script was just terrible. That's why I rated it as "1" instead of "2", but that's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
