Wow. I don't even remember that movie very much, except that it's beaten. <br /> <br /> Land is basically; The girl's parents ignore her, so this sick PokeMon pretends to be her father. Am I the only one who is bothering it? Then this strange mother of PokeMon Ashi pretends to pretend she is a girl. I don't care if he's trying to make a girl happy, it's just big. <br /> <br /> There was no real plot. The girl was just a tiny brat who wanted things on her way. He played with Unowns, the "daughter" of Entei, and probably with his "father" he can grow up and grow old with a whim. <br /> <br /> It's pretty much what I remember, but I think you'll get this hint and not see it. (Or, if you see it, don't wait much.) 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Seriously. If you want a PokeMon movie, rent a "PokeMon; first movie".
