It's a kind of strange movie, because Santa is living in the clouds in space and fighting with Satan and his minions ... but it's still fun. <br /> <br /> He has some real laughs. whether all of them were deliberate, is certainly debatable. This movie is not good, but I can say I really enjoyed watching it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie "Santa Claus Conquers Mars", "Santa Claus" with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow, or "Santa Claus" with Tim Allen.
