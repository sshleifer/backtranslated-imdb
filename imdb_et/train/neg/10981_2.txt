Or listening to this thing. Even the soundtrack is a cage. Frankly, this is not the worst homosexual film I've ever seen (concerning Billy), but it's below the barrel bottom. <br /> <br /> This thing pulls and drags and pulls. It is not that the plot is a man - in the hands of a good writer that he could have worked on. . . it would have been much more fun. There's not one plot point you don't see on the road for ten miles. The dialogue is flat. The jokes are old. To add insult to damage, it is full of one-dimensional stereotypical gays. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship between the two wires was possible, much less real. Chemistry was not, dynamically, in fact, there was no evidence of why managers love each other. . . We have just been told that they are in love. It is hard to imagine if they have nothing in common and are not sexually compatible. They like the same book? Huh? <br /> <br /> Operation is not quite bad, but slow. I mean, almost Jarmusch-slow, but without Jarmuschi quality. In fact, it would be a good barometer for you. If you like Jarmuschi movies, beware of this.
