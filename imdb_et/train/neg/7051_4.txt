A film about problems with growing and real, Blue Juice is an entertainment for those who like surfing and Cornwall. Sean Pertwee is the real star of this movie, while the most famous Catherine Zeta Jones plays her girlfriend and Ewan Mcgregor plays her drug addict. <br /> <br /> For those who don't like surfing or the least of Cornwall, you'll find that it will take a long time before the movie even interests you. The start is slow and spends too much time on the lengthy techniques of just a few interesting landscapes. Too many main characters lead most of them to one-dimensional. The plot is an interesting idea, but because of the low characters, you have no idea why they act in the situations where they are placed. <br /> <br /> Only Ewan, Sean and Catherine characters make this movie a valuable video tape, so it only appeared on the US video tape after Ewan and Catherine reached the mainstream reputation.
