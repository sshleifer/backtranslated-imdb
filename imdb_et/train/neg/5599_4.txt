Seeing the floor of love One thought comes almost immediately to mind. Certainly it turns out that FBL is a pilot for a series that can start in Canada this fall, poor poor Canada. <br /> <br /> Cara (Shirley Ng) and Janet (Natalie Sky) live in Vancouver. Janet has already come to her mother, but Cara's parents are still in her homosexuality. The pressure is outward though parents come from Malaysia to their younger brother's wedding. In the same week, British Columbia legalizes gay marriage. When Janet wants to get married, Cara has to decide if she tells her conservative Chinese parents that she is gay. Is he? Would he be? Could he? The situation of Cara is in contrast to the situation of Jesse (Trent Millar). Jesse has just declared his world of homosexuality fourteen years old. Soon his biological father, Daniel (Andrew McIlroy), will arrive. His stepfather, Norman (Michael Robinson), fears that his chances of finally accepting Jesse completely are sorry that Daniel is gay and he is not. Does Calling 1-800-Makeover Help? <br /> <br /> Dialogue and delivery come directly from the smaller 1950s program with superficial physical emotion. A full-featured melodrama is enough to beat you from time to time and comedy attempts to a great extent. McIlroy, Millar & Sky is the only speaker who approaches the competence in this miscalculation, but given the material they need to work, it is not surprising that there is no impression. It is possible that campiness was determined. It often seems that the performers are not so bad that they have to try to mimic the few days. If this is indeed the case, this review should probably be rewritten. Rewriting would focus on beloved ceilings, which are the poor and ineffective sending of old sitcoms. There was a time when just holding a homosexual protagonist was enough to mark it on the screen. This time is gone. This day we also need quality.
