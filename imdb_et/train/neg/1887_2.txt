Today I got an argument about why so many people complain about contemporary films in which I saw a curious statement: "The evolution of the newer films is not nearly as good or interesting as it used to be." Depending on this film, it can be associated with a number of things, sometimes with general special effects and plot-based Hollywood garbage like world wars, but in the case of an overwhelming, uninteresting experiment, social commentary and desperate struggle that puts "art" back into the cinema are films like Dog Days, which are guilty . <br /> <br /> Normally, I have a great deal of tolerance to movies, no matter how cute or pointless I am. find them (ranging from good, long, like Andrei Rublev and Dogville, to those I find painful to sit through Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West). I closed this movie in 45 minutes, which is 30 minutes more than I really should. I didn't like any character and found nothing more important than a thin veil of vague pessimism. In trying to say something about the crimes of society, this film too easily becomes self-conscious, tritical, and exploitative in a very sincere sense. I've seen a lot of annoying movies about the same subject, but there are so many better movies about depressing, pathetic people (Happiness, Gummo, Children, Salo, storytelling, irreversible) that actually contain very emotional symbols and character. There were no more than eighth classmates in society on dog days, deciding to ignore any real intelligence about how people really are, and instead choosing a boring, terrible, and hopelessly unigenous attempt to "art" work. It is not an unknown or intelligent observation in the tails of society, it is just boring and worthy of value.
