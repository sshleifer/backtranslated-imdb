Mr. Perlman gives outstanding results (as usual). Unfortunately, he has to fight with a signed script and some nonsense pieces. <br /> <br /> Larsen is in "Die Hard" mode with Singles and Swelling Muscles, I'm sure he can do better, but he seems to be happy Armas is very decorative (although it's completely dressed!) and shows some signs that the latter is acting. <br /> <br /> SFX is mainly poor CGIs and steals from other movies. <br /> <br /> Shootouts are merciful - A-Team worth <br /> <br /> Perlman not worth it - OPEN
