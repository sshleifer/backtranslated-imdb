Eh, not very good slasher. Both work, effects, decent but familiar and uninventive soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Near the start of the movie, there are three consecutive deaths that make a pretty good scene where it seems that something is going on. In addition, there are many signs that migrate around, do not understand what is happening, or follow red herring; more killing than people. There are other deaths and the killer is a murderer of equal opportunities, not any tool. The killer also wants to make other people kill innocent people. Identity is not over, and the motive is pretty thin, and we really don't care. <br /> <br /> The movie is expected to take place at Christmas, but it is not an important factor. One scene lights up in Christmas light, that's about it. <br /> <br /> The film is rather dark, muddy, mostly on a time-lapse video tape. Some of the scenes that were opened lost some dialogue. The end should have been stronger than it was. We think we understand what happened, though there is something else.
