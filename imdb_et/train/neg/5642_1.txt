This title seems to be filming rather than a film that should have been visible to the public. For Dafoe and his wife, he must have been working in the film for the first time, notwithstanding the fact that people are actually watching it. I felt that it was wasted for 90 minutes when I was worried about the plot development or even the beginning. <br /> <br /> Try to match this movie genre and you will not be able to, because it has no beginning, middle or ending. I've seen "artistic" movies, and it's not even close to artistic, abstract, or original, it seems to me totally pointless. <br /> <br /> I think it speaks for itself if the only ones who rated this movie 10 were under 18 years old. There is no doubt that the constant pointless erotic scene is the throwing of the movie with us. This is when you can call it erotic. Certainly it wasn't a taste.
