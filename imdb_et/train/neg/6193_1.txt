I can't believe I've been watching such a weak movie for an hour and a half. If there is only one movie you have to forget, that's one. <br /> <br /> Robert is a teenager whose father died recently so he starts to pick up some local antisocial teenagers and use drugs. All of them make him unconsciously violent, and finally this subconscious explodes ... <br /> <br /> The first thing is that I don't think any great ecstatic thought or trace can be found in this film. any single character. In case the manager sees what I saw as a great ecstasy in a few minutes, I have to say that it is not even close. <br /> <br /> The use of cinematography is not mature either. Most of the time, I didn't see the facial expressions from the actors and I didn't feel the body language enough to have enough effect. Perhaps the team was just so tired that they fixed the camera there to all the settings. Everybody is happy after the audience. <br /> <br /> The plot is particularly weak. There are many related scenes and we talk about what might be related, but they are really so random that you can't pull them all together, maybe if you're not the ones who wrote them. <br /> <br /> One and a half hours you can find less than 5 minutes of real action and all the rest of the time is just people who go, talk and move. So I really can't comment on acting here. <br /> <br /> Nice music selection in the last few minutes. Maybe it's the only good thing. <br /> <br /> I've never given a movie 1, but this movie deserves it (at least you laugh when you watch scary movies). This is a film about when an unsuccessful attempt to imagine worrying teenagers meets a very disturbed audience. I hope you do not belong to either group.
