I do not have anything terrific, but this crap derived from Stephen King is too freshly cleaned, too bright and modern. A plot of a new teenage boy in a small town called "Sleepwalker" - a kind of crosspiece between a vampire and werewolves - and who feeds the female virgins blood is asking for more mysterious and unclear. . This thriller is given an imprecisely colorful look and feel, barely in the atmosphere. Children are predictably beautiful and energetic, but the great plus is the boy's mother, Alice Kridge; Kridge, "Ghost Story," has never broken out filler-female forms, and it's a big loss that she's not used any more. Her performance is horrible and intense, and hints that "Sleepwalkers" can be a much better film with a different focus and narrower direction. It is too top and commercially manageable, with an uneven tone that thrives on the wild thriller comedy drama. Stephen King appears in the suitcase, just like the real directors John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * 1/2 from ****
