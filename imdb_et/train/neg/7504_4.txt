I'm afraid I don't agree with the majority. I found Spike Lee last bored a bit bored! Although he tried something else, not just to document the rise and fall of the serum killer, he doesn't think it worked too well. <br /> <br /> There's a bit too much there - the relationship between Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna (Mira Sorvino), Ritchie's (Adrien Brody) lifestyle and then the local Mafia species. The story is good, but at the end everything you have - 2 or 3 tracks. With such a provocative killer, wouldn't Mr Lee have any more on this side of the movie? > <br /> <br /> However, there are some good points. All the scenes of David Berkowitz, the killer of "Sami's son" seem very nice (color saturation, etc.) and the actor is pretty good. <br /> <br /> In general, I felt that different stories would have worked well independently or without killing. It wasn't strong enough in the end. <br /> <br />
