How can someone say that this movie is comedy? If I hadn't gone, I would have slept my finacee and asked for my money back. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it was like he was on the wrong set. I like most chicks, but I hated it. This is the only time I saw so much and was not turned on. These equipment were too big. No one is talking anymore and I don't think they even did that. The dancing part was terrible. My ex told me later ... "Wasn't that a part? Didn't you think it was sensual?" I only said yes to save my feelings. Now I know why we ever married. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen.
