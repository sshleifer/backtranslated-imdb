What you never waste your time on this pointless point. Movie. Transformation that did not need to be rewritten. All the comments coming out of the theater had the same remarks. The worst movie I've ever seen. Save your time and money! <br /> <br /> Nicgolas Cage traveled through the mountains, swim in low water, and ran into the mountains when the bees attacked, but his suit was still perfectly pressed and the shirt was sharp white. very last scene. <br /> <br /> Though the actress was amazing Ellen Bernstein and Cage, it was as incredible as the movie itself. It's amazing how good actors can make such bad movies. Don't get a copy of the script first. If you are still interested in seeing the movie at least, wait until it appears on the DVD.
