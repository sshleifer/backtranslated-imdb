The exhibition is average. It doesn't make me particularly laugh. However, I think Courtney really brings it down. He doesn't seem natural. He has these three ways to talk, all robots. He speaks quietly (without intonation), he speaks normally (without intonation) or does the thing where he begins to speak normally and gradually screams. But his screaming is like "pretending I scream because I shouldn't be too loud on the device". <br /> <br /> She is constantly aware that she is the funny actor who is doing this funny thing. It's annoying. You can't really get your personality because it doesn't really create emotions and doesn't irritate you. He has this husband who does all these foolish things and doesn't react to him. Very dry and normal.
