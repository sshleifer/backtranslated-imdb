In the ultimate justice, there is a great Joe Don Baker running around Texas shooting people shooting people. Then he is in Malta, where he takes more people. She locks several times to let people go. Then he gets into a vicious man dressed like a monk. There's a chase on the ship and Joe Don is in prison again. Finally, Joe Don, with the help of Elaine "Seinfeld" kills a bad boy, breaks in a boat or two and anyone can shoot. All this and a memorable theme, like Mitchell!
