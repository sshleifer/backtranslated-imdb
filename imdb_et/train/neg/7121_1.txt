If you have some skull, empty mansion, schizophrenic husband, schematic frame and nutzo gardener, throw the minister and his wife - what do you have? <br /> <br /> AIP response to insomnia. br /> <br /> "The Screaming Skull" gets points for awe by offering free dressing to anyone who scares the movie. A pretty safe bet if you've redeemed stupor people who think they've produced "Suspense for Dummies". <br /> <br /> However, Peggy Webber was still a cutie. He was here and there for a few good moments of action (especially when he tried to communicate with a gardener) and no one else was doing it at night like him. But this frightened face, which he scares himself. There is, however, little tension here, and everything is telegraph like a punch dropped by mime. This movie can't be intimidated, it's impossible. It has its moments, but not enough. <br /> <br /> HOW Mike Nelson and his two robot palms have several moments of pure joy, especially in the copy they got ("The movie jumped and it was really scary!"). <br /> <br /> One Star The Screaming Skull, Eight and One for MST3K. <br /> <br /> Talk about "Screaming".
