Prom Night 2 is a OK horror movie, but the prom night is better and this movie about how the 1957 prom queen Mary Lou kills her boyfriend and comes back 30 years later to revenge. The best actor of this movie is Micheal Ironside and the movie stars are other OK actors and actress like Justin Louis (I), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette (I). And there are some good gore scenes like when Mary Lou kills the girl, who is trying to hide their cabinets in their closet and how one of the pupils is on the computer and Mary Lou pushes her to death. All this is OK / good horror movie and my rating is 4 out of 10.
