Melissa Sagemiller, Wes Bentley, Eliza Dushku, and Casey Affleck play at Middleton College for young students in Middleton. Four teenagers form two triangles of love. One night in a sad full moon they drive and talk about a slippery and complicated mountain road. Don't look properly to take care of another car and kill one or more of them. A ghostly nightmare begins ... Pretty bad and politically correct horror without gore and nudity. This is probably affected by the "Carnival of the Souls". Cinematic art is decent Unfortunately, out of 10 out of 10, there is just a zero stop.
