I really disappointed this movie when I saw it at about 6 or 7, because I was a big fan of Robin Williams and something he couldn't do was bad. Until then. This complete garbage destroyed Robin for a long time for me. I recently regained my funny but serious part of my father's day, but then he started creating another mistake, Bicenntinial Man thinks it was called, but it is. Robin should now get much better jobs and now he has returned to making this "classic" mucus.
