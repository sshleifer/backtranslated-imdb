Some have praised _Atlant: _The_Lost_Empire_ as Disney's adventure for adults. I don't believe it - at least not in adult thinking. <br /> <br /> This script suggests starting a live action movie that hit someone other than what you can no longer sell to adults. The "cracked workers" of many older adventure films have been well done before, (I think Dirty Dozen_), but _Atlantis_ is one of the worst films in this motif. The characters are weak. Even the background that every member omits seems at best hidden and uncomfortable. MD / Medicine Man, a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons, if we haven't seen them before, we've seen the game before and again. The story of how one of the companions, Vinny, played Don Novello (Fr. Guido Sarducci) went completely unconvincing at the flower shops. <br /> <br /> Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a young Atlantis obsessed academician, Michael J. Fox, says he has his depth. Finding Milo from Atlantis continues with his grandfather who picked him up. There's a lot of younger Milo in the scene, sitting on his knees, because his grandfather puts his helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> And while the characters were at best slim, the best part was _Atlantis_ on the voice talent. Maybe Milo's depth is not thicker than Fox's charm. Commander Rourke loses something that James Garner publishes. Though Rourke is a pretty stocky type, Garner shows his ability to breathe life with just his delivery. Garner's vocal performance is the highest point. I'm sorry to say that Leonard Nimoy's dying king is nothing more than mandatory. In addition, Don Novello, as a demolition worker Vinny Santorini, had one or two well done, funny lines - but I've always loved Father Guido Sarducci. <br /> <br /> Computer animation was also well done. Wallpaper animation, that is. The animation of the characters was not as bad for Disney as the minimalism that drew Don Blut out of the door. Character animation does nothing if the flat characters do not even straighten. Apart from landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is little to be impressed. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say hackneyed or trite. I'm not so sure. Any cultivated parcel can do something new for proper treatment. Shakespeare often began with a well-known story and plot and was only famous for the new color cover. So this is the thing. And _Atlantis_ obviously lacks this. <br /> <br /> I can't start all logical spaces without the spoiler section. The plot was bad. Plot bridges come in like a thread and the end doesn't make sense. It is accompanied by a script and animation with annoying sloppiness. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> 1. At the beginning, when Milo discovers that the slave or Celtic symbols are incorrectly transliterated and "the Irish coast" should read "Icelandic Coast", we start problems. Script writers should know the British victory for Eire or Eureann in "Ireland" and ignore the older Latin term Hibernia. But more than necessary, they need to know the Viking conspiracy to call Iceland's greener island and Greenland. <br /> <br /> By writing a misspelled letter, they have written for themselves to request the English version of the script and the post-roman date. Because it has been a long time since Atlantis had to sink into its underwater cave. And without visible clues and less technology than Milo was, the label made it much less reliable. <br /> <br /> 2. The Shepard magazine could not be written before the sinking of Atlantis, nor does it know anything about a cave or crystal that is in the "king's eyes". It must be written after the sinking, but without the technology that Milo's expedition had, how the devil was taken by Leviathan. So how do you know more about it? And why would it be written in Atlantis? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. However, the company and the astral movement do not require it to be written in Atlantis. So it must be some kind of automatic writing. Since someone who is not in Atlantis cannot read, it must be the spirit of crystal-clear messages. It would have made more sense. But it could have been explained in the film that Milo could have discovered that this power had called him all his life - it appeared in dreams, etc. It had to be studied in the film. <br /> <br /> 3. The Atlantic should not simply be able to understand modern languages. Nobody expects the original Indo-Europeans to be able to talk to Europe anymore when the Romans understand that "c" or their day got French "ch" (pronounced as "sh", not less!) <br /> <br /> 4. The current Atlanteans were alive before the cataclysm - when they probably * could read *, but now they can't read what they used or used before. <br /> <br /> 5. Massita's illiteracy is a sign of a significant shortage of the film. Nothing seems to have happened to this culture. The air seems to have stopped until Milo can save it. Although life does not seem to be a lasting struggle for survival, no one wants to write poetry or write novels, and maybe it is a combination of Atlantis school systems that go downhill and lack of good fiction that caused Atlantis to enter illiteracy. <br /> <br /> 5. Kidata can be apologized for not knowing how to read or operate the machine when it was so young when the foolish cataclysm is set up. Kashakim's stupidity almost wiped out the existence of his people. A bunch of cataclysm was killed, progress progressed (not much killed here, but he was watching huge culture and progress) until someone killed the crystals when they were not boiled in the lava, because the giant robots were not protecting them. <br /> <br /> The blue electricity bolt should have shattered the similarity of Kashakim when Kida tried to combine his father's image with the big Atlantis kings! <br /> <br /> 6. Although Milo was the only one who could read Atlantis, Rourke and others knew quite well that they saw a dirty book and found a crystal that he knew as a crystal, not some stylized astrological or "phases". ". solar diagram. <br /> <br /> 7. When Milo's grandfather talked to Rourke, it does not explain how Rourke Milo was suffering from reading. Rourke handed the dog a juxtaposed page, although Milo did not obviously find the sign of a broken page in the book - it was only that the viewer slipped, "nothing was quite right". If the word "crystal" hadn't brought Milo's head out of trouble to try to steal it, Milo would have suspected something. It's just a thick look. <br /> <br /> 8. The team's "double-cross" did not become a sign. We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie had been with Rourke from the beginning. But "heart change" is gradually falling. It was a change and needed to be better motivated. Difficult to do with signs that were not given to get started. <br /> <br /> 9. A little bit of lava flows over the dome, instead of filling the rest of the area we look at. It's a liquid; it does not flow over the protective cap until it fills all the lower areas. <br /> <br /> 10. Finished TICKETS! - And there is no point other than satisfying political correctness. By restoring this capability, Atlantis is no longer a weak force that needs coding. The giant robot's guardians and the blue flashes that come from the blue flash indicate that they have less fear than we can. Technology is higher than ours and certainly in the early 20th century. After all, Milo has to teach the Atlantic to read what? The whole idea is to leave your little silent, corrupted culture alone, not to send it to hyper mode. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Maybe the lost world plot and the beginning of the century should give me a hint that it's more of a tribute to cellulose. The defects found by the film are in agreement with this idea. But I'm at a loss, why should I pay to see thin characters and plot holes just because many of the fine books also had them. Nevertheless, the pulp stories are part of the "crap that they are no longer able to sell to adults". We have become a bit more complicated and our pulp also needs to grow. The lost ship's Raiders didn't lose any pulp feel and avoided so much badness. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 - The movie is enjoyable, but if I think the plot will be getting lower.
