I just rented and watched this movie just to see what was all the noise. So here's my reactions. It is easy to see that it is a low budget movie with poor players. The main plot of this movie is that the woman gets revenge on her rapists. This concept, if done correctly, can easily prove to be a truly provocative film. However, the film does not make any impression or disturbs me. It missed me. This movie can easily be shortened to less than 45 minutes. All of the many scenes are mainly to fill the time like these scenic scenes and some of the scenes described below. <br /> <br /> ************ Contains spoiler ***** ******* I find that rape scenes are quite annoying. I don't know if I've watched a cut or uncut version if that version actually exists. I found a lot of land on a lot of badly written plot. Here's a list in my mind. <br /> <br /> Why not rape Jennifer at night when she stepped out of her house to find out what these noise is. That would be a great time. <br /> <br /> Why they just didn't rape him, instead of pushing some rapists in joy and extending Jennifer's challenge for so long. This would probably be more shocking and disturbing. <br /> <br /> I found it really stupid that the rapists left the forest and head back to their house. Maybe prove that these rapists are really miraculous. <br /> <br /> These rapists should at least know that if you want to do the right job, they should not send a coward who is obliged to do the job. /> <br /> Why didn't Jennifer call the police when the rape ended? What should be the first thing that comes to mind in most people, especially someone who is a writer. <br /> <br /> Why did these rapists smell when they saw Jennifer alive? <br /> <br /> I find it really amazing that a slender lady like Camille can pull a human tree and hang it. ************************ Ending the spoiler ************ <br /> <br /> But hey, this the film is not without its substance, Camille Keaton is proud and I hear one of the most funny lines I recently heard when Matthew protested that she was going back to the house and killing Jennifer. Why me, I don't even c ^ m !!! '
