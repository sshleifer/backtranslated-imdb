The idea of ​​how long a lost flick is sometimes available on the web. So I bought a copy for me. Well, of course it is terrible and the story is childish, but it has its moments. I think the people who searched for it also know its background. It was made by an extremely low budget made by the owner of the cinema house. But for me it certainly didn't mean the money requisites but the money. The set is one that is well done. Zombies are traceable and gore is intact. The only problem with films is the quality of pelicule. It's terrible, luckily there's no sound, but sometimes it's too dark. So you have to look clearly to see the gore. In a funny way, they tried to sell it really not like that. The voice command says at the beginning of the movie to look at the character and the man who appears with a green glow that tells you that there is gore on the road. Of course it didn't work, made me think of Cannibal Girls, it was a tedious clock when red things started to flow. They had the original idea, Cannibal Girls was made a year earlier. Don't go to the talk, go to the zombies and notice the continuity error. When a girl and a guy love for the first time, she takes her bra, then they love and suddenly have her underwear again ... try to do it, or do I get a little offline ... ... eat it with your ugly body
