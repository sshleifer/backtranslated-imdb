666: The child starts at the time of the airplane blow, the only survivor of the flight 666 was a young boy named Donald (Boo Boo Stewart), who has been received by news reporter Erika (Sarah Lieving) & his cameraman Scott Lawson (Adam Vincent) after having covered the Channel 6 news incident . At first, Donald seems like a normal child, but death seems to be following him after Nun & Vicar Scott's warnings begin to believe Donald is the cause of evil and all deaths ... <br /> <br /> Direct DVD The horrors of horror were led by Jake Perez under the pseudonym Jake Jackson and one must say 666: The child is really quite poor. When I see the shelter being responsible for the film, I worry because I'm very worried because their results are terrible. They seem to be specializing in making and / or distributing a low budget horror film, which is usually a recent successful big budget horror film and 666: A child you don't need a rocket science degree. this is a complete statement of cash recently in The Omen (2006), published in the same year. Benjamin Henry & Austin Laurel's script is terrible and just does not match Hollywood's equivalent ambition, I mean exactly what Donald Antichrist is waiting for a small town middle class family? Is it hardly an excellent starting point to bring the destruction of the world? Every Sign 666: The child is in some form the main character of The Omen, the adoptive parents, the priest who tries to warn them and the unhappy babysitter. There is a real incident there, barely any gore and the plot is bad. I mean, Donald kills a dentist because they tried to fix their teeth just as randomly and unnecessarily, what were all the nasty pictures that Donald led everything where the babysitter came and there is nothing that links everything together and that is just a confusing mess, which becomes very boring very soon. References to number 6 are also annoying and very unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Director Perez does well for me, it's competent if nothing else. Blood or gores are virtually non-existent, there are few sprays in the blood, cut hands and someone gets a round saw on the face, but it sounds much better than the screen. Surely it is not scary, the atmosphere is not due to the rather boring modern side of the suburban house and there is no tension, because we never know what Donald is trying to do, and there is no danger there. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is boring, it's pretty well done, but because the actual movie is so bad, it's a little different. Action is not so great, but at the same time I have seen it worse. <br /> <br /> 666: A kid is a poor man with an apple rip-off, I'll either look at the original or do it every day of the week. Not good and certainly not recommended. Followed by Sequence 666: The Beast (2007), which went straight to DVD.
