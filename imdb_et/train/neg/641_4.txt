To my mind, Largo's winch was a Belgian comic (never read) that talked about playboy adventures, a sort of James Bond without spy life! So, when I had to choose a movie for a five-year-old child, I pulled it up because the boy was already a big fan of James Bond! <br /> <br /> But right after the opening credit, did I seriously doubt if American films offer an amazing start, then there's no action and terrible sex? Then the story is very difficult with a financial move? I thought I lost my child. <br /> <br /> But strangely enough he was caught by Largo and more than James Bond! <br /> <br /> Was this great interpretation by Tomer Sisley? Hard relationship with Largo with his father? The multi-box story where friends are bad guys are bad guys friends? Honk-Kong, Yugoslav Exotic Places? <br /> <br /> Dunno, but he cares about Largo ("Will He Rise?) and enjoy our moment.
