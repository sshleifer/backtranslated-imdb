I thought Harvey Keitel, a young, fresh Sex Pistols from John Lydon, then a bonus, Ennio Morricone's music. I was waiting for an old school, a passionate, Italian policeman thriller, made in America. You live, I have a mishmash story that has never made sense, and a movie that left me to say: WTF !!! Too many unanswered questions and not enough action. The result: the potential cult class got under the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work well together, so perhaps Quentin Tarantino can rejoin these boys with a better script. Oh, and Morricone score: OK, but not memorable. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, it's not a waste of time, it's not a "black" if you're not a hardcore Keitel fan.
