There's a big difference between the original, intense, edge-to-edge, scary, gore-festive release and filmmaker Eli Roth and his team who have made Cabin Fever and just acted. The film is followed by five college graduates in a forest cabin that will be fatal if it goes into a mysterious, fast-acting, meat-eating disease one after the other. It won't be long before friends turn to each other and can hardly stick to each other's eyes. As this movie sounds, the main premise of this film, which could have worked, is less lean on the filmmaker. Unfortunately, what we finally arrive at is badly drawn characters, the only purpose of which seems to be beautiful at first to make the inevitable decay of contrast, the hackneyed script that is so heavily burdened that it leaves the viewer to tune in and the incomprehensible subtotals that motivate director Roth the appearance of the screen in a little more than one case. It's sloppy filming in many ways! Avoid this time devourer.
