there is no tension in this series! When one episode ends, it is so dirty that the effects are so bad and the script is so terrible that the last thing you think is how Batman and Robin save the day. No, actually the last thing you think is watching the next episode! This exhibition is so boring that I don't see how it was ever made, let alone DVD! Obviously, these consequences are not equal to the current Batman films, but even the script is terrible. I'm not quite sure any evil professor and quick gun or anything like that is inconsistent. See the 60's or 90's version or even Batman's start, just over this version!
