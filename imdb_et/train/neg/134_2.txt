This film, which was far away, was super smart. This is a theme rhyme with every horror movie ever made. Valentine is trying to be ZERO original. What is valentine anyway? This is the number of people who give each other the same flat messages that were given to the same people a year earlier. There is nothing original in Valentine. <br /> <br /> I saw it only once, and when you look at it, there are some movies that it has cut off. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4.All other horror movies that someone kills. <br /> <br /> I know there is more, but my idea slowly changed from silk, so I couldn't take them so quickly. <br /> <br /> Valentine had no chance to be a good movie. How should every horror film have a "surprise" killer, people you don't care about, because their emotions in turn take on every other scene. One minute, a nice girl becomes evil B-ch, she is an insecure woman and so on and son. <br /> <br /> Usually every horror movie (in my book) can be recorded by gore. Valentine is not on it again. It would have been like trying to do this PG-13 but could not, so they left the editing. <br /> <br /> Don't see it too inspired, burst when you hate yourself and want to die. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins -
