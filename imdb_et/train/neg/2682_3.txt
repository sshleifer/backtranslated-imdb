I had been waiting for a long time to see this movie after I saw "return to paradise", which I found tough. I was so disappointed. The most realistic thing was the unpredictable end that I thought was partially stolen from "Back to Paradise". Maybe I waited too much. On the positive side, Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles. Although I didn't like Danes' character and first I found it very annoying. <br /> <br /> I didn't see anything real about the movie. It could have been done so much better, for example, in prison conditions and horror. It was a too lively movie to be realistic. There could also be more action and tension. The best thing about this movie is the "tragic" ending. I couldn't predict it. But by that time I really didn't care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
