This remake of the 1962 film "The Book" points to the very good parts to praise it and some fine actors - although Scorsese chooses to end up with the most complicated plot of twist and embarrassingly superfluous Shakespeare death that I was watching on my watch. <br /> <br /> DeNiro is a great actor who is committed to her work, but needs a direction to focus on her talents, and it is very short for the last five minutes Gregory Peck's coat is usable but nothing more While Robert Michum is always fun to watch, even with as few lines as it is. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte turns right as Lorenzo oil but is not in the same form as "Weeds". Joe Don Baker has some great features, while Juliette Lewis proves once again that talent skips the generation. <br /> <br /> Some good points? Initial Credits (!), The First View of Cody returned to prison when Cody was attacked by baseball bats, a decent panic of Sam Bowden, Cody out of calm but convincing prescence. Worst? "Cleansing Woman - But Not Really !!!" part. Grabing a bare hand on the lower side of the car at a hundred miles at high speed. (Does the US have any speed limits?) "He's dead - but not really!" And the rambling is over. <br /> <br /> I can look at the original again, but I am not yet tempted to see what a remake is like in the four years after it is seen.
