Yes, even if the show fan, like a survivor and a trainee, is a bad show. I didn't know the first couple of exhibitions, but then I realized how pathetic it was for everyone to show first. Alex and Aaron's antics gave men a bad name on how they cheated their choices or chose their choice as soon as possible without showing an example. <br /> <br /> Ryan, you may have a Trista. She had the most annoying voice I've heard on television, and she was certainly not the smartest girl (very media-friendly, but I doubt there's much more). <br /> <br /> I really looked at some of the exhibitions because of the accidental restart after a daily TV. I think the reality TV point is to treat it as a "fun trash". Look at it as something you can laugh at, and don't have to think too hard (I don't look at CSIs like reality TV-tired and clichés, but you have to look too much to think about). <Br /> <br /> Some ideas for some of the reasons that go to exhibitions. First of all, "a woman tells everyone" A woman like Amy (who was a lot of her) said she had tried every scene called a bar and club scene to meet a boy and it didn't happen to her. Hi Amy, how do you join the club? Making Hobbies? Charity work? By making your work where you meet more men, all I know is that the arrival of a bar is not the perfect place to meet a future partner. Amy and many other girls seemed obsessed with the idea of ​​meeting a "perfect man". Tips for Women: It doesn't exist. However, there are many great men who make great spouses, some who may be right for you! they may not earn six numbers a year or be JFK juniors, but they are very good guys. The woman's lowness at this show is quite incredible. I'm still young, believing that the woman gradually grew from her low because they became older and more realistic about their future partner. This exhibition is otherwise proven. <br /> <br /> In general, this exhibition shows a lot to confirm the stereotype of how women look at men in society. This is really a terrible show and I think all such shows should stop. The best shows of the state miles are the Dark Date and the Fifth Wheel because they are fun. There are no more men between "couples" than just at night. bachelor teacher, unfortunately he takes too seriously.
