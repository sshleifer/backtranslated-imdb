"Cat Egg" includes some scenes with intelligent dialogue and some fine performances, some of which are surprised by me. Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected as Chaplin (partly due to some gifted designer hair and makeup); Joanna Lumley is bright as the writer Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst has won Marion Davies (although why movies never use their real stutter, it's hard to explain). But these elements do not lead to a successful whole. The script seems to have worked hard on certain scenes - the Davies and Chaplin meetings are especially well designed - but not on the big picture. Several smaller characters need not be there and behave consistently. The main picture is full of illogical (eg why does Thomas Ince think Hearst is good to say something he doesn't really want to hear?) And party scenes are repetitive and tiring. I think the trip to Hearst's hunt was more fun than the movie shows. Davies is characterized by a standard effervescent Flapper type that is not really accurate and the scriptwriter's idea of ​​Chaplin and love is incredible. Oddly enough, Bogdanovich, who seemed so connected with the thirties "Paper Month", has no similar affinity for the twenties. He insisted that a great costume designer use only black and cream that gives the party guests a very artificial look and plays only the most stereotypical songs (eg "Yes, we don't have bananas"). When Hearst Demands That All "Charleston, Charleston!" it seems like the actors are ten minutes of dance just before the scene. The life of silent movie stars can make interesting movies, I'm sure, but not this time.
