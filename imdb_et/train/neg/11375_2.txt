Are you talking to me? (1987) is a pretty bad movie starring some guys I've never seen before or a neighbor's guy trying to become an actor. He has heavy taxi drivers trying to use this sick to make it big. When he learns the hard facts of life, he does what everyone else does, changes his image! He's going over the good night over the night. His friend can't believe the change (but he appreciates Faith Ford and gets a cool payout concert). Does this young punk keep his credit on the street, making it big? <br /> <br /> This is a real flat movie that is trying to add too many things at once. Interestingly, an interesting idea breaks down. Who knows, maybe somebody takes the ball and runs, because the filmmakers will hit the ball this time. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this movie. If you don't want Forest Gump to see the hot Faith Ford and the young Bubba. <br /> <br /> xx
