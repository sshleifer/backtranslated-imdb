I appreciated this movie 1 because the plot is incredible so incredible. Judge for yourself. You should be warned that the following will not only leave the plot but will also violate your desire to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> A computer virus designed by disappointed nerd sends the code through TV screens and computer monitors. When the code - in the form of light - enters the eye, it can access the body's electrical system. It is forcing the body cells to excrete calcium. Within a few seconds of the infection, the patient reaches his neck, develops the tunnel vision, his skin turns white into white, after which he falls and his hands and skull break into the cloud of chalk. <br /> <br /> This virus is very intelligent. When he discovers that a blind computer expert tries to disassemble the code with a braille output device - hand-operated -, the device is set to a very high voltage that causes severe burns on the skin of the expert's head. The virus also feels aggressive against remote controls and the ATM keyboard. Fortunately, it could be stopped by throwing an outdated desktop shelf and electric shock crying with a broken computer and his feet on some spilled water. <br /> <br /> Oh dear ...
