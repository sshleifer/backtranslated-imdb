I hated this movie. It was absolutely terrible, poor, bad, PITIFUL actor, REAL REAL REAL stupid criminals who weren't even LEAST BIT funny (unlike the first two very good movies). all the boobie traps are weak, pathetic excuses for ideas that have been poorly copied from the first two, which simply meant that the writers of this movie were just lazy because their wages didn't go over 20 bucks a week. This movie is totally bad, it is not worth even renting. Actually, it doesn't even look like v.v. Go using your eyes in a more useful way when you see the first two! I'll give this one star (10). Just trust me when I say if you liked the first two, and you are not a complete stupid person, you don't like this movie, don't look at this movie !!!
