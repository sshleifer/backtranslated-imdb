Already his first claim that desires are always artificial is completely wrong. <br /> <br /> When Jehovah's Witness rejected, does his own film about the film? or something for this thing - it's time for everyone to get their own. While far, far more intelligent than saying, Paris Hilton (I know not too hard) Zizek foot spews as much baloney as her, just a different one. He combines the worst of his professional world: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both fields are known for b * lls *** osopher, where there is plenty of free space to create unpredictable theories, to start or stop, and to combine concepts almost randomly, in a process that uses English incorrectly, creating a semantic only a mother can love. Example: There are three main Marx brothers, of which the "big" idea is to connect these three people with consciousness, id, ego and super-ego. I am surprised that he did not play the "Snowhite" clip and made an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of Gahannah (Muslim hell). It's like Schumacher's "The Number 23" premise: play with numbers long enough, and you can come up with any cockamamie theory, even if you connect the ancient Greeks to the death of the princess Di. <br /> <br /> TPGTC has an entertaining element: looking at the fearsome sweaty sweat like a hog of existing songs that are considered to be intellectual analysis, can be quite fun. Why watch a "cuckoo nest" or some other madhouse drama if you have Zizek for more than 2 hours? It's like watching a fun train break. Indeed, he is almost funny on one or two occasions. <br /> <br /> I've always been mystified with people who are desperately trying to make filmmaking in the elevated intellectual social science. Idiotic films like "Birds" make a lot of sense, so it's a lot of credit, probably his fat creator in his grave. The real truth is that most movies have an intellectual value of zero, and some of those who have some intelligence do not require a shrinking philosopher to draw one card to understand them? if one is not a complete idiot. Zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal films. Hallucinogenic drugs must be quite popular and cheap in these days in Slovenia ... <br /> <br /> When Zizek showed a bath in the Psycho shower room, I thought he would say something about galactic black holes; how they empty their lives like stars in the blood of Janet Leighi. Or maybe he could have said how the hole represents Leigh's vagina when blood flows instead (like menstruation), which represents some "smart (zizeki) irony". Speaking of this, the real irony is that if Hitchcock really had so much thought of each scene (and script), his films would not have been illogical, far-fetched mess they often had. The purpose of these bath hole analogues was to show how easy it is to improvise "hidden, deep meanings". And when you add Zizek's fantastic terminology from philosophy and psychology, putting these terms on those analogues like wedding dresses, you get a noisy jumble that can impress you impressively, that is, easily impressive and gullible. br /> Zizek speaks here of a number of (inadvertently) funny things that are one of the most absurd ideas when he associates Anthony Perkins' "job satisfaction, well done work" with cleaning a bleeding bathroom. Don't laugh ... Neither the Hitchcock nor the "Psycho" writer could ever have felt that vaguely entertained that Perkins could enjoy a well-done job - cleaning blood-stained toilets - when they prepared / guided the scene. Talk about moving words to your (dead) mouth, but about misinterpreting what the director had to say. <br /> <br /> I like Zizek's initial thoughts about Tarkovski's terrible "Solaris", but then he has to destroy a rare good impression by dragging his "anti-feminism" and other nonsense into his theory. <br /> <br /> Zizek's attitude to logic is the dog's plastic bone. "I want to play it all day!" Logic has its own rules and should not be raped - at least not publicly - by its like. He seems to consider logic, proof, common sense and reason as enemies or simply thrown toys; concepts that must be avoided, twisted to reach the end goal or simply destroyed. Zizek is a hippie drawn into the LSD and all his favorite films are his own "2001". <br /> <br /> The fact that Zizek focuses on two of the most superfluous directors - and those whose films are often LACK intelligence, if anything - like Hitchcock and Lynch - only reduces his already low credibility. I was surprised that De Palma was not more prominent; this is another flat director who writes unsuccessful scripts. Zizek has a field day with Lynch's incomprehensible "lost road". There are just as many interpretations of this film as people have watched. <br /> <br /> Zizek's comment that the viewer easily accepts von Trier's ridiculous "groundbreaking" physical structure in "Dogville" is ridiculous to me. But Zizek does not only do things when he goes, he also places great emphasis on "obvious" bleeding. Like all "social scientists" (oxymoron), he puts his highly tricked "observations" into a dictionary (if it is full of spitting) and sometimes complex language layers. After all, sociology works exactly the same way: it makes us believe that we hear something new, in fact it is what we all know, but we speak spoken - which fools more unnoticed listener. <br /> <br /> I was half waiting for the men of white suits suddenly to come out and strap on her loonie suit ... <br /> <br /> Slavoj Zizek: Soon the child in the park who's near you . <br /> <br /> http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
