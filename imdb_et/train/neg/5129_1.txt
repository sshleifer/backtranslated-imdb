The message of this movie is "personality is more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo should be a "ugly duckling", but it is funny that she is not at all ugly (in fact, she is much more attractive than a friend who looks like a model). <br /> <br /> Now, would this movie work if the "ugly duckling" was really attractive? When will Hollywood stop with this hypocrisy? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this film is simply ridiculous, despite the message it wants to transmit. <br /> <br />
