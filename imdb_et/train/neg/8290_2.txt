Alan Rudolph is so leading, without any special touch. For example, in the secret life of dentist dentists, there was one shot that could have expressed the whole relationship between a man and a woman. Rudolph destroyed it. The camera is located in the corridor, looking through the doors of two dental offices, Dana and Dave alone in their rooms. You get an idea of ​​their destruction and isolation, but not much more. Lighting, colors, body language, facial expressions can all be greatly improved. If I were to drive, I would have spent the whole day, if necessary, correct. This is the beauty and power of the film: it can express so many, healthy lives within a few seconds <br /> <br /> Shooting with the little ones who stepped into the pope bottle could have been improved. The child should have shown more excitement with the sheep, had to beat his legs and mix, had to bend his head to look at all the attention. <br /> <br /> Campbell didn't bring. He plays a communist man, but, instead of passing on his inner instability by voice, gesture, body movement, the film relies on voice production and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter-ego, played by Denis Leary.
