Potter's terrible action and flat plot with never tension. And like feminist controversy, it's ridiculous. I saw this rubbish when it was first released, and although I found it to be incredible, I'm glad I saw it. This is because I have an immediate answer to the question “what is the worst film you've ever seen?”. Plus, I find it convenient to know that every movie I see in the rest of my life is better than the Tango lesson. But I have to admit that I was impressed by how Potter wrote a script that would collect the maximum number of art council grants around the world (as is clear from the closing credit). <br /> <br /> I only recently saw Orlando and I see Potter learning the wrong lessons in making this movie. All it took was a bunch of costume costumes, a pair of heavy lady cameras leading the lady, and a loose plot to attract the cinema to the public. Why shouldn't she think she could go with a self-conscious void that is Tango's lesson?
