When the star of the fallen major came to a small town with drug dealers and a federal representative body. Restoration with a former star map to clean the city. <br /> <br /> Low key, often boredom, "action" comedy mostly just doesn't work. The problem is part of Chris Klien's election as a former silver player. he is not bad, but he is not really believable as someone who was considered to be tough. As I said he wasn't bad, he just wasn't talking about what his back story was. The real problem here is a script combination that really isn't funny and seems artificial at times, and the direction that a pedestrian in the dark port. There is no life in creating things. This would be as if the director had a list of frames and that list. It makes a movie that is unrelated. And the film tends to live from time to time, such as the final exhibition that ends the movie. This sequence works, but because the earlier parts of the movie shook the bulk of the power. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend a movie. It's worth it if you're a fan of actors or a big fan of an independent cinema in all its forms, but otherwise it's just a disappointment.
