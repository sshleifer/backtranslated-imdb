Rookie suffers so much. The film is accompanied by random musical songs, a long pointless scenario and a sufficient grid that makes Jerry Lewis blush. Noonan and Leavitt just don't know when to give up. The whole hour will last before the story finally reaches the main land and the characters are shipwrecked. Then the boys start playing the Japanese sailor's day with a racist caricature. This is a shame when the more fun parts of the film are Noonan and Leavitt, who play stupid stereotyped Japanese guys. But after switching between the two characters, it becomes quite tiring. Then it stops sharply. Even naked Julie Newmar with a towel does not save it. <br /> <br /> The movie really does have a little charm and it's over half an hour too long. The story simply despises the attempt to create funny situations and not. Stay with Martin & Lewis. At least Deano had a charm and Jerry had this animated face.
