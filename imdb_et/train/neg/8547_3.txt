It was a pretty horrible movie; I found that music is effective for it. The photos that Mario took from the village were also irritating. But I had three problems with this movie. One thing is that the lighting was very dark, so for a while it was hard to say what was going on, but it may be my copy. The other is that the start is not very well explained and I'm still not sure what's going on there. The third problem is that I didn't understand the end, but probably some people do it. Of course, the usual problems that people do with stupid things and the male leader are very 70s. All in all, observable, but not even close.
