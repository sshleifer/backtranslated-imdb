We've all asked ourselves, "Why don't they re-make the right movies that were just OK, instead of rebuilding those that were already big, then they can only do it better?" well with Prom Night, they're average, but the trashy fun 80s has been rebuilt by Jamie Lee Curtis and even made it a WORSE. The color of this color film that catches young teenagers (not violence, etc.) apparently to attract, a knife on this butterfly is blunt. The director spends so much time focusing on seeing an attractive killer somewhat creepy. that something else goes out of the window. Cast, including Britney Snow (who was great at hair spraying), try your hardest, but the material doesn't give them anything to do, but it stinks and looks scared. hears the attack but can't see it). It also looks like the only place where the knife in this movie was in the editing set, because the film looks like it's polished (im guessing something far from scary ended the cutting room on the floor to scare the kids) pouring the American money who sends this movie to 1 box 1 ! Slasher's movies are very fun, but Prom Nights made me download the original. I've seen episodes of scarier OC and Dawsons Creek
