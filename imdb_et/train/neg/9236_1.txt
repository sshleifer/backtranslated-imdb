I'm among the millions who consider themselves to be fans of Cary Grant, but I can't think of one reason to recommend this movie. I don't understand the casting of Betsy Drake and it seems that no one else did if we wanted to judge the number of small films he played later. <br /> <br /> Most fans agree that Katharine Hepburn was great when she helped Cary Grant raise and grab her child. idea, but it fails. I've read comments on how "creepy" Drake was, but I thought it was too easy to describe. Franchot Tone walked through it as if he were hungry. Disaster is one thing. This movie is a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> It doesn't deserve 10 lines of comments and I don't know why this is a requirement. Very bad it was preserved when so many useful movies have rotted into the vaults. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to torture anyone, give it a wide place.
