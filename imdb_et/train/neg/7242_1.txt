Pallbearer is a disappointment and sometimes a very boring love story that just doesn't work in part with casting Gwyneth Paltrow (Julie). Gwyneth Paltrow walks across the film's confusion and it's hard to say what David Schwimmer even sees. <br /> <br /> But Pallbearer is sometimes funny, especially the church scene and group scenes with his friends are laughing, but that's basically it. See Pallbearer for these scenes only and move on. Trust me that you won't lose a lot.
