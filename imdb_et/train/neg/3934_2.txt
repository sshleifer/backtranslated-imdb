I look forward to seeing this movie and seeing these great actors. But I was sad about the script and the whole story was disappointed by the plot. David Duchovny, (Dr. Eugene Sands), "Connie & Carla", 04, was a doctor who uses drugs and loses his license to treat. Dr Sands visited the nightclub and was able to use his medical experience to assist the wounded client, and was assisted by Angelina Jolie, (Claire), "Lives", 04, who immediately drives Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton (Raymond Blossom), "Kinsey", 04, plays Big Shot Gangster and a man with all sorts of money and connections. Timothy Hutton seems to be acting in most scenes and is completely out of his mind trying to kill his gang members. Gary Dourdan, (Yates), "CSI-Vegas TV Series," plays a major supporting role and represents a true COOL DUDE, the so-called body hill for Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby ​​red lips, which draws great attention to all men. This movie is not the biggest, but it's entertaining.
