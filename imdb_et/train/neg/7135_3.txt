I'm sorry to say that I don't think that Enzo really can keep up with the Saleen S7 Twin Turbo in any way. S7 would be just too big to consider power. S7 power: Mass ratio is 3.93 lbs / h, while Enzo is 4.61 lbs / hj. S7s are also lower for much better. Sorry for Ferrari fans, but Saleen gets that much better. <br /> <br /> Like other parts of the movie, I just have to say that it's so badly pathetic. The story is too weak. The behavior of this lemon is worse than daily soaps. <br /> <br /> I can say that as far as the treatise of negative psychology is concerned, it is a pearl. This film is nothing unless there is an obvious definition of narcissism and sociopathy. Its all the rich plugs that get their stones out, showing just the traces of innocent traffic accidents from all the innocent road users who also cause injury or death. rating because it did not force me to leave the theater. I also think that the amazingly beautiful brunette, whose leading female is the blue eyes of the killer, saves it from being completely sad ... even though her singing doesn't make her on the "Variety" cover. <br /> ps: The man who plays Jason is a sliding line version of SOOOOO James Vanderbeek.
