This film is an incarnation, a straight 11/10 scale. The dignity of the accents and the density of the cardan spandex pants are simply incredible. Yanks, though true Scotland can be as colorful as you would ever go there, don't expect to be given many opportunities to "dance" the contradictions with the locals. Also, do not try to capture local opinion with fine-tuning art. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of infectious singing and dancing scenes, but the plot is too cheesy and linear, and dialogue is often too weak. I also doubt whether anyone would want to be timed in the 18th century Scottish village, not gay in New York. Perhaps this priest would not have left this great sacrifice from Brigadoon, maybe he was just trying to get hell out of that trash. <br /> <br /> See this to see what LSD would look like in Christopher Streed's daily paradise in Scotland. In addition, I would only like it for Hollywood muscle graduates.
