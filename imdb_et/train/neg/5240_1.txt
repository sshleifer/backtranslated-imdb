As soon as it hits the screen, it destroys all intelligent life forms! But on behalf of my own producers, I have to say that it is not part of any well-known movie category, it deserves a brand new name! It's a "neurological drama"! It is sad and pushes every neuron inside the brain. This is the closest thing a person will ever hit without actually suffering. It drives you out of speech, all your members are numb, your mouth falls open and remains so, and the strangest symptom is that you want to go to the blind and deaf. <br /> <br /> This kind of "movie". <br /> <br /> The only word that I think is just the completion of my experiments is OUTRAGE !!!!!!
