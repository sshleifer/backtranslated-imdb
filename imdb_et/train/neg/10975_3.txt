This movie blows - we get it right now. Inside this pair of goods, there are a couple of gems in the scene, but no one can redeem a limp plot. Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt "12 monkeys" and acts similarly. I usually hate Colin because he's a fairy tale in general, but he's OK in this movie. In this movie, there were two plot lines: one boy who throws rocks through the winds of moving vehicles and the other with a woman with a mustache. Let's be honest that this film has no point in what he wanted to say or where he wanted to go. Character links intertwine at some level but are in no way worth adding to the script. The whole thing is weak and pointless, and then there is an occasional OK scene. But overall - don't worry if you love Irish accents so much that you can look at mediocrity and it will be saved by everyone who sounds like Lucky Charms elf-an American fetish, who has somewhat succeeded in filming.
