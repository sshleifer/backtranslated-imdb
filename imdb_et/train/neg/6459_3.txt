Such great actors are such a disappointment. Marlon Brando plays and the terrible character, the movie is not at all funny, the subconscious message can be seen: "It's a stigma!", "IT SUUCS SO BADLY!" so on. It's just nasty and embarrassing. In addition to the stupid drawing, the sense of humor is something else. How the rooms are decorated with colors. It makes me sick, everything is so colorful that it can cause epilepsy. Usually I don't care about decorating the film, but this "Free Money" made me angry. Avoid at all costs! "Free Money" - probably for Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but the viewer won't get anything! One looks at it at a price of peace of mind.
