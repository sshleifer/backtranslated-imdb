Hollywood does it again. A lot of money, no creativity. I'm sure the writers wrote something other than oxygen when writing it. Based on the preview, I thought it would be a funny movie. But if you are not in the last silly pop culture, most of the stupid humor is left in this movie. Why waste your time. You can sit on a log that does nothing and is more fun than this movie. <br /> <br />
