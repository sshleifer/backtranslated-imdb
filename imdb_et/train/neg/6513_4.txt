I'd rather have 20 root canals than this movie again. The fearsome Prince Myles Berkowitz has wasted almost two hours of my life on this cynical pseudo-bay. The only amusing thing about this confusion is Mr. Samaha's outrageous camera battery on tits and ass. Berkowitz takes a great concept and grinds its dust. It's uncomfortable and badly done, an obvious effort to make it nervous or funny. No it is not. I rarely feel that the movie was a waste of film (or tape), but it can differentiate it. If the date is showing this movie, run it.
