When an artist-Russian scientist says that two-thirds of the roads are film, "I came to science." All in all, this is why I watched this movie - everything that includes a half man, a half-haired shark, certainly deserves serious empirical research by an impartial ambitious scientist. Or, as the bison says, my girlfriend's brother was far away and the rest is history. If you say that the special effects were bad, this would be the area of ​​special effects. It's 2005, it's not that hard to shoot a car scene without a cheesy bluescreen background. Yes, it was charming and modern than Hitchcock's "Birds", but in 2005 it just seems like a low budget. Keep me on a Sci-Fi cheap test and get me a service to actually make an attempt to stop the unreliability in the process. <br /> <br /> However, being serious about the overall concept of this movie, let me tell you again, as sad as it may seem, it's probably worth your time. If nothing else, it's a bad Sci-Fi force - well worth a new education for a new movie and definitely a worthwhile training course for those who have seen a few movies of their day. <br /> <br /> A crazy upside-down crazy scientist with a hammerhead transceiver who thinks it's a good idea to let the channels go to the nearby water, questioning not only the human intelligence, but also the ability of "B" filmmakers to come up with unreliable plot lines . <br /> <br /> This film also fills one of my long-standing claims of bad films - bad guys always wear sunglasses. <br /> <br /> If it weren't for 2005, be dead because this movie was a pointless poor metaphor for the Cold War. I think you may also have a Khan Klingon bird bridge on a bridge that places infusions in Chekhov's ear. <br /> <br /> One of the most moving features of the film is when the chick without a bra requires Charlton Heston's appearance, "wait for Tom", when he tries to escape the helicopter from the ground. The thing is that Tom wastes bad sunglasses with his endless banana clamp attached to his Kalashnikov or AK-47 under inferior conditions. <br /> <br /> Like a mad scientist, the film says, "My goal is to develop a human species" - it is enough to say that this film only contributed to the transfer of humanity. The crazy scientist's talk of Freud's references to the fact that he is making a female protagonist with hammerhead shark is a simple reminder that even in the worst science fiction we can all find something to laugh at.
