This is just the "Christmas Story", originally called "The Story of the Year". In the summer, Ralphie tells about her family's adventures when they moved to a small hick town in the middle of nowhere. Unfortunately, the fun is not caused. <br /> <br /> The original worked thanks to its disrespectful nature and honesty - everyone can be involved. It's just stupid and not very funny at all. Charles Grodin's last film - no wonder! This is one of his poorest roles. I felt sorry for him. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburgen has been given little work, everything in the formula, and you have to think about why they even plagued her. <br /> <br /> And I mean, come on? Unfortunately this is the best part of the movie ...
