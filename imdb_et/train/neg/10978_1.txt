Usually when a movie is given one voice, it is because someone just doesn't like it and is annoyed because it doesn't have a lower rating and so decides to drag it as much as possible instead of giving it a low rating. That's not the case here. <br /> <br /> Bonesetter is a great example of a 0/10 movie. It does nothing right and has no chance, because it does not really try to do anything. There are bad D & D novel types of plots that are incompatible and completely missing. It is clear that someone who took part in this project did not make any serious effort on it, because the hard work of even the most uninvited people would be more. Truly terrible movie.
