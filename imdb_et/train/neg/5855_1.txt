The film was released in early 2000 with MELA in both disasters So sad to start the millennium with such nonsense <br /> <br /> The film looks like 70s but looks like an involuntary comedy 2000 <br /> <br /> Anywayz Some classic gems from the movie: Paresh Rawal I don't laugh at his role or cry Reason: He's going to look for his mother's village in the worst part when he understands Anil's secret, keeps his secret in his stomach that gets big and makes him wait, I remember in my childhood, I remember my childhood, that teacher told me the same joke Urrf !!!! if a child i laughed at this time but here? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a joke that can't be explained We have Anil in two roles (one older and younger) and Rekha plays an older woman and a Young Young at Rave We have also rejected Harish while Shakti playing with Aruna Irani son, both fighting against who is the worst wig <br /> <br /> Direction Expired Music is bad <br /> <br /> Anil tries hard to look younger and too old in a younger role but a good quest for Rekha is enough, also Raveena is okay Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is terrible Aruna Irani is like normal Rajnikant is normal.
