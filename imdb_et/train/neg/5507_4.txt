It was another big screen that went through the sixties in US TV shows. It's fun enough, but it was very wrong. Intelligent Mars lands on Earth and sees in his opinion not too bright people. <br /> <br /> Normal stupidity occurs with a man, Bridges, eventually joining him and helping him go home. Along the way he gets Hannah. <br /> <br /> This is a nice break for some of the pleasant Hollywood stars I hadn't seen for a while. <br /> <br /> Nice to have some free time if you don't have a better look.
