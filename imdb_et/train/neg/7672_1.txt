Apparently, a lot of talented behind the scenes were worked by team members so don't even look at the credit at the end, you only keep it against them. No one was interested in seeing this movie, only 3 were in the theater; two passed in 10 minutes and they were happy. The "Monsters" were the Unemployed Worm Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and Alien's Design of Rejected Space Beings. The film's creators probably didn't want to hide the third movie monsters, so they hired speed players who probably couldn't remember their rows, or in some cases learn to pronounce words before filming. Some scenes are incredibly intuitive when they transmit exactly what should happen when something is. If you're lucky enough to know where this movie is shown and you're not moving out, you're laughing at what should be a scary or stopping moment for the movie. The unreliability of several scenes just stunners you and Stephen Dorff's regular "Queen Mary's passion for fervor" gives a feeling to everyone who sees it. If you need to see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it is in a good box in the video store. If there is justice in the film industry, one of the main players is to rent it for you.
