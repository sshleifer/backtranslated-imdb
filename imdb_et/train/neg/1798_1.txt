How can the film be Ozzy Osbourne and still suck? I just can't get it. Trick or Treat managed to do it. It sucks and loves it. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat is one of the films I warn people about. It is a spooky cruelty that causes vomiting, just begging for it to be seen so you can feel much worse. Trick or Treat has no redemption factors. <br /> <br /> With a heavy metal movie, it doesn't seem to be what heavy metal is or what it represents. This film succeeds in seeing heavy metals flat and it was in 1986, probably one of the hard hours of heavy metals. This is quite a lot, but negative. <br /> <br /> Trick or treat = so bad that you get angry at tracking it. This simple equation will hopefully keep you away from a distant, irrelevant movie.
