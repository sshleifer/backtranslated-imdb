Strangely enough, Rene Russo's eyes and mouth - not Buddy Gorilla - which is the centerpiece of "Buddy", are produced by Jim Henson Pictures through Francis Ford Coppola Zoetrope. Somehow, he counted countless close-ups of Russo's face in the post-production stages, and he literally fills so many times that poor monkeys are built. An unintentionally funny real story adapted from the memories of Gertrude's "Trudy" Davies Lind about a rich medical spouse who turns his mansion into a pet and wildlife menu. The film goes beyond good intentions ... it is positively sincerely sincere. The film never speaks of what it needs with the magic of the "family movie", and for too long, people and animals seem to be clearly programmed (here is nothing real). For about ten minutes, two chimpanzees move around in the Russian kitchen and start throwing the carcass back and forth (down by an inch from Alan Cumming's head); The eyebrows are not raised yet, because it is fun for one day. However, when an adult gorilla Buddy gets crazy during the rain, the police are called - and everyone looks at the Buddy window when he interrupts the living room furniture. Furniture should be the least worried if this disgraceful failure of good factors is a cause for concern. But at least we know that Russo was in good hands: when Director Caroline Thompson needs a good excerpt, he gives another extreme close-up. I don't know what was the lipstick budget in this picture? ** from ****
