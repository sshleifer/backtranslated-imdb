It's not Korman's knock, because he was very funny at Carol Burnett's show. He was also good at playing secondary characters in Mel Brooks' films ("High Anxiety"). However, he is not a person who is unable to carry the film's dueling roles. It's basically a "Gremlins" knockoff, following such films as "Critters" and "Ghoulies". It is also not a very good knock, in parallel with "Ghoulies", but it has a much brighter tone, because it is not as close as it was when it got dark. In fact, it is too light and foamy, and unfortunately many jokes are flat. Although I gave it to 3 scores, it is only because there is a film that is even worse for Gremlin. When you looked at the Mystery Science Theater 3000, you know what I'm talking about ... the infamous "Hobgoblins". It has a boy who has found a few critics in some underground locations (I saw this movie once, so I don't remember everything clearly) and it is friendly enough. But this creature is quickly becoming friendly and of course they are still born and this is a movie. More attacks than joke hits, and it's really bad to see Korman playing the role of an evil brother. The best thing is to skip it, but then you might just want to check it out for a hit.
