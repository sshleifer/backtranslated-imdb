Don't do me wrong, I love action and revenge, I've seen a lot of them because I was a child, including Dolph Lundgren's newest "The Mechanic", which is pretty good. And Tony Scott knows how to use the camera, and even the brilliant shooting and editing of movies. <br /> <br /> But for "Man on Fire" (and even more than "Domino"), Scott shows that instead of using his filmmaking skills intelligently, he uses it poorly to show and compensate for lack of content, what his material does not offer him. "Fire man" is almost 2 hours and half if it should have been at least an hour less. <br /> <br /> The way Scott's film and this movie was edited will make you wonder whether he really wants you (audience) to sit through his movie because his constant camera is moving and flashing really to the eye and putting you in the theater leave or turn it off after 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, when MPAA and studio apartments have a questionable attitude to ratings, violence, and PG-13 movies, I also suspect that a $ 70 million movie has been made from a B-film script, whose character cuts his fingers, puts the bomb in the man's ass and blows the boy's hand with a shotgun, all in order to apologize for the death of a little girl who hasn't even died! Then go to the computer, why the studio gives a better script because of language or violence.
