There's no spoiler here ... Because there is no damaged plot. Madchen Amick lives as proof that the face can live because there is no need for talent. The only bright spot is some really good one-time liners that Alice Krige did very well, but then she is again Alice Krige. His soft, dreamy voice gives a unique hint of how dangerous these bizarre creatures are. He is incredibly horrible in this otherwise incredible plot. How they agree to this project is a secret. Scriptwriters must treat this script by submitting this script. It has great continuity problems, superficial stereotypical characters, writing horror formulas, and just doesn't make any sense what-so-forever. Creatures, though possessing decent skills, such as "twilight" are a question of where they come from and what they are, ever so much studied. <br /> <br /> Don't waste that time.
