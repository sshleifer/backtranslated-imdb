This movie was so bad that I couldn't do it without doing anything else. There were no plots and no point. I was thoroughly bored and about a movie that provided comedy, I couldn't remember one joke or a funny line that was worth the description. Politicians with no charismatic technical jargon would not be less entertaining. <br /> <br /> So how was this done? Is there no quality control in the movie? Looking at the girls in bikinis, this terrible experience was the only disturbing one. She was not the least funny in this film, so it proves that writing is so important in effective comedy.
