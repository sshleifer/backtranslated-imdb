I don't remember another murder / mystery movie so halbana. This film about a medical examiner investigating a friend's mysterious death in a car accident has a full receipt for a bad film: a bad actor, a dull story, a lack of temporary humor, and a lack of humor. I remembered this movie on PAX, a TV station that was remarkable for movies with low budget and TV on TV, like this one. Of course, TV movies do not have a larger screen film factor or intermediate layer. But this movie certainly hit all the sour flavors. The authors of this film have missed the opportunity to make an excellent TV movie "Receiver murder"; the title does not offer any tension. <br /> <br /> So if you want a good recipe, don't watch this movie. This movie alone can kill your TV appetite. <br /> <br /> Rating F
