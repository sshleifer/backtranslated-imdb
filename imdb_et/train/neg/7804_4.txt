TEMP (1993) didn't do much theater work, but here's a direct-video-rip-off that you didn't want! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is a new woman at Millennium Investments, a large business brokerage firm who is starting to assist a large-scale secretary, Deidre (Sheila Kelley). Deidre proves to be an ambitious father's girlfriend, who is in no way able to move the ladder of the company, including screwing the top mediator, which he can't stand and kill anyone who gets to his bad side. She digs the skeletons of Ellen's cabinet, tries to make trouble with her husband (Barry Bostwick), kills her daughter while she is responsible, kills her daughter and tries to make money from the company. <br /> <br /> Harris and Kelley present competent performances, support cast is in order, and it is relatively well assembled, but it does not fully compensate for the script that goes along well-worn paths and offers little surprises.
