Shonda Rhimes's brilliant team seems to have commissioned it somewhere in the offshore, perhaps mediocre, region? "PP" reminds me of any annoying, promising at first, but during one season predicted, David Kelly slips (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal and now Boston Legal). The crazy things they get are so extreme that they barely cause compassion or sadness. And that's what really makes good medical drama - the dramatic situations you're afraid of, "It may be me". They're not funny either. <br /> <br /> The actors are pretty good, but the lines are dead and can't live. I'm a therapist and let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays the most incredibly incompetent, unethical, untrained therapist. Who writes their own things, created ethics and transmission / disruption courses in Stanford. Someone should give them an ethical code for reading (an episode with the involvement of a nasal bleeding woman and therapists in it). No therapist is so bad. <br /> <br /> Women who wanted to move forward were dead, we've all finished 'Sex and City'. Addison's youthful aggression against her pleasing man - very anti-age, looks so unnatural to a 40-year-old woman, and this otherwise talented actor does not believe it or give it very well. The only successful / tasty development is Addison, who fights his decision to go to LA and "Voodoo Dr" and his coping with survival. <br /> <br /> This concept can work with a brand new writing team.
