There is not much good to say below, Soderbergh's real aspiration for neo-rabbit. Soderbergh faithfully renews the decent young Criss-Cross of Robert Siodmak without altering the plot at all, but the adaptation will clear the noir atmosphere of every ounce of modern film, giving him a similar story with less attractive places, lifestyles and anachronisms. Soderbergh, who later makes great criminal films such as the Out of Sight and the Ocean series with great style and atmosphere, takes a dangerously obvious path to modernization, renovating the story with the toughest, dullest and flattest styles of the early 1990s. Nightclubs have a terrible, rebelliously dressed garage ensemble, the uncomfortable version of Peter Gallagher's Burt Lancaster leaves his femme fatale girlfriend, who purchases cinematically lifeless modern equipment such as stereos, TVs, and other up-to-date equipment that would absorb the reaction that could have been more entertaining and less boring, if a couple of sustained grace, like a good result, more for their animals, would be more than just William Fichtner, who gave performances that are t wood, a sharper pace. Unfortunately, none of these things are below. The fine director Soderbergh will not use his dry separation this time for his film. This disposition works great when he drives more of a movie movie with a movie like George Clooney's images or social or characteristic drama like traffic or sex, lies and videotape. With a film such as Underneath, this viewer strengthens the boredom experienced.
