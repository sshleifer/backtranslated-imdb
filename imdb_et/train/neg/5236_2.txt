my friends and i saw this movie about a week ago and i feel it is imperative to tell the whole world (or at least those who read it) that this movie is not just about the five worst movies I've ever seen, but actually it's an honor be number one. I've seen quite a lot of movies, but no one is stupid. you could say that I have suffered from watching ... my only excuse is that we waited a couple of hours and couldn't go anywhere else without freezing our buttocks. I don't recommend it to anyone. At first I thought we were watching some really bad porn movies, but we thought after 10 minutes that it wasn't. It's not comedy, it's not drama, it's not action, it's not horror, it's just terrible!
