Apparently, the film that predicts future trends in British popular music is wrong on so many fronts that it is ridiculous. Tommy Quickly? Honey? The DOES movie includes a song by Spencer Davis, two by the animals, and a live movie by Beatles, making their live version of Twist and Shout (all 1:20). All in all, the British music is an awkward screen in 1964. Oh and Herman's Hermits.
