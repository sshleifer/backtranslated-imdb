I'm not an artistically inclined person. I am a science-based woman and I felt that this film was perhaps one of those campy artsy type films. I looked at this part of my groom and my future daughters. We tried to find something in this movie to keep our interest. My fianc√© and her daughter voted for it and we went on to the ocean, but this is another story. Don't wake me up the next morning and woke up to another picture. I started watching this movie seriously. I just can't get it, I thought I'd get it. I thought the most funny part was rinsing the ashes and the urn that found a place with a fireplace that was used as dead flowers. Interesting and still there were dead things inside. It was a strange and weird film. Maybe that's what they were after, but I'm not going to cheat the second time!
