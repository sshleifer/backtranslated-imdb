The plot sounds like it was a promise. Frankly, I didn't watch the whole movie. After about an hour, I had to make a decision. Is this movie worth it until it ends? The answer was clearly NO! It was not the fact that the human body could not transplant from different species without rejecting it. Nor is it a presumption that the secret government is pursuing him for human / wolf transplantation. The reason for this was that the film was poorly written, but there was no emotion, and I do not understand several queues of dreams with wolves and buffaloes. When he ran a dog pack in the zoo and left them in front of the gate of the zoo, he said, "If you can't drive with big dogs, you won't leave the porch," it ran through my eternal mind. Save yourself time and skip this movie. I can guarantee, if you dare to look at it, you will sit there loosely on the jaws, as I wondered why someone would waste money, time, energy and efforts to make this offensive misconduct in American cinema.
