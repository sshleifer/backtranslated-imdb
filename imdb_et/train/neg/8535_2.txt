As I said, this book was pretty good and it could have been a good movie when Melissa Gilbert wasn't so terrible and unbelievable in the lead roll. What accent was it to assume that it was still? It sounded like his terrible Russian accent in the second movie I've seen him. It took 3 events to watch all three movies. Brad Johnson was the second leader. <br /> <br /> I really liked the beach scenes. They added some essential brightness to take off from Melissa Gilberts, a depressing imagination. I think they could have used the views of San Francisco more. It seemed that the night scenes were actually SF, but I could be wrong. I don't remember this book being frustrating. Please keep Melissa Gilbert out of future movies that need accent!
