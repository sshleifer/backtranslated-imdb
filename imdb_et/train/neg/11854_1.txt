For my life, I do not understand this little good estimate. It was pointless. Matthew Modine was frightening as the leading ladies. Gina Gershon, others said this, but I repeat why this stupid accent? Completely unnecessary. And his action was just bad. I don't know if he scored an accent, or what. There were no chemistry between the two. <br /> <br /> Modine was in love, suddenly she pulled half a salad of her mouth and in her mouth and worked in whore? Where does it come from? I think we had to get to know him because we saw that his marriage to work was going to crumble, but frankly I couldn't care less about any of these people.
