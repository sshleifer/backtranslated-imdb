The only real highlight of the film is the death of a strangling boy and the reaction of surviving characters. Spaces and Alligator, which is a little bit of Godzillat (1998) thrown. . The female driver is not, because she probably has a better agent. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is surrounded by a really stupid extreme sport called Surfing, where surfers cut themselves and surf the shark in infected waters. In this film there is also a huge salt-water crocodile in the area. People eat. The movie ends. <br /> <br /> I do not mind the movie of bad fear, but I hate the boring fearful film that it is definitely.
