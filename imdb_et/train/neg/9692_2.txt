Bonjour Tristesse covers the same foundation as the "Wedding Member". Reasonably, the prevailing daughter tries to prevent the relationship between the beloved family member and the interloper. Although critics love the "Wedding Member", I find that Julie Harris is a jumbo-drag and adenoid, landscape-chomping, all of which has been. It is an annoying, rich idiot like last year in Marienbad, but this time it's a travel book. <br /> <br /> This Preminger movie series is evolving, but there are no characters. His first 30 minutes are content to blur the relationship between father and daughter of Seberg and Niven, making it uncomfortable for sexual reading. Once the conflict is in place, Seberg can't get the part that he needs. Kerr pulls the rank and makes the film an endless love. Seberg's empty story is like something about Strange Interlude - that's not good. I really want someone other than Niven to be in his role. He spends so much time to normalize British behavior in all his films, he never gets any characters around. <br /> <br /> In the most memorable order, the evening dance becomes free in the harbor. . Bertolucci steals the whole scene for his empty training "Conformist". Kerr is on board to grab his hands and imagine another big pain (like Black Narcissus, Iguana, King and I Night, Heaven knows Mr. Allyson, Way and Sympathy, etc.). Really, Kerr was a terrible actor. I wish every one of his films could end up with a fatal car accident or even better, starting with one. <br /> <br /> A person who is uncomfortable must avoid it.
