I don't know what else to say about this terrible movie that hasn't been said yet. Frankly, I'm just angry. I should have known better when I saw the title of this movie that it would be a terrible hunt, but I loved the war games so I promised my whim. I live this decision, regretting the rest of my life. From the beginning, when the government people explained that their supercomputer was able to determine who the terrorist was, it was how well they played the video game. The list of very bad, very bad lines, dialogs and actions is so long that I can interrupt IMDb when I tried to post it. Talk to those people who said they have seen the worst movies than this. I'm really curious to see something that could bring a bunch of horseshoe horseshoes.
