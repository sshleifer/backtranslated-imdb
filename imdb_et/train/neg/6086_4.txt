For some reason, in the late 70's and early 80's in New York, the local CBS station played this movie late in the evening on a Friday or Saturday night for several years, usually at 2 or some time. This is the best film for this time slot, because it's really hard to follow and quite strange (see other comments on specific story information). Anyway, after I got it several times these days just before cable TV (and even after it hit, but before they offered a lot of the night program), I caught that little strange thing. After not seeing it for years, I decided to see if I could find it on the DVD. Well, it is only available (in any search I have carried out) in a pretty bad terrain print for the "Brentwood Video" label, which is part of a 4-pack movie (4 films on two two-sided discs) called "Alien Worlds" someone is interested in. Usually it is available for around $ 10 but even less than you buy. The other three on this movie are easily available in many other public movie collections, so there's no need to comment on them here. Eyes "Available Elsewhere.

A second-language English-language dubbed film has been cut back in time, and it seems that it is sometimes a good idea to save money if you don't bother with a scene if they are not considered important for the story. Would the longer version make it less confusing? Who really knows - if you haven't seen it in your mother tongue ... By the way, my attempts to watch it do not work during the day and I just finish it. Looking at it in the middle of the night, which just fits this movie .. or maybe it's just my past experiences, who know?
