Born Again is the first episode of the season. It deals with the subject of reincarnation and simply does not drive. I have never become great at the time of reincarnation and this could be part of my apathy for this episode. This refers to the case of Toom, which is a somewhat good continuation of the previous episode. But the positive ends there. What is unfortunate, because it happens at the beginning of the episode. I think it's ridiculous that the dead guy picked him up in a completely independent girl's body. And she waits until the girl takes eight to start a terrible revenge. There is even a serious spiritual Mulder & Scully dialogue to keep the episode afloat. If you're reincarnation, maybe this episode is your alley. If you are not, you can at least know what bradycardia is.
