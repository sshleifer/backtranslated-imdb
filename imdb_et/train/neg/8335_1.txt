The package means Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn are pulling out big bank robbery, but that's not what I got out of it! I didn't get anything! The first half has a new character in every other scene (without an introduction). The first half-hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest is just one long, tedious, under-performing chase. There is always an irritating sound in the background, whether it's a loud clock, a blaring siren, a whistling train or even a terrible score for Quincy Jones. There are also many ridiculously bad parts. Like, bad guys ride with Beatty on thin ice with CAR! Or the police arrive at the scene about fifteen times. I really hated this movie!
