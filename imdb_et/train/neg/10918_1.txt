Manmohan Desai made some fun but illogical movies, such as AAA, PARVARISH and NASEEB, but he did some craps like COOLIE and MARD and then GJS. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst films he ever chose. Mard ko dard nahin hota, but the movie is so bad that you eat <br /> <br /> British cartoons and the film is so weird British hotel scene is fucking stupid <br /> <br /> The movie has a lot of stupidity like Amrita attacks Amitabhit, and then the whole scene and climax towards the film becomes even worse There are more jewels like horse shape life, Amitabh masks haha ​​and other <br /> <br /> Manmohan Desai is bad Music is okay <br /> <br /> Amitabh does its own style, something other than COOLIE, LAAWARIS type roles Amrita Singh is okay Satyen Kapuu is ok Prem Chopra is as usual, Nirupa Roy is again normal herself Dara Singh is also normal
