I rented this movie based on what the trailer showed, and of course Sir Anthony Hopkins. <br /> <br /> When Jackson Pollack joined David Lynch and Timothy Leary to make a movie, this would be the end result. I don't think I've seen a movie that made the LSD trip an episode on Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> This is a set of bundled pieces where characters flash in reality and out. or a different reality and film does not culminate in the last 5 minutes, where suddenly it makes sense. I wrote my movie review from a blog that basically provides everything, and I'm not doing it here. It's a well-functioning cinema and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, and let me tell you if this movie is one of the redemption functions, it's music. It fits perfectly. Part of the dialogue is incredibly good and incredibly bad at the same time. <br /> <br /> I liked this part of the movie, I really did, and when you finish it, you really understand what's really going on. It is unfortunate that you have to go 2 hours mad to reach an important point that minimizes the effect of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I give it to 3 out of 10, because the real problem with this movie is not an actor, it's all.
