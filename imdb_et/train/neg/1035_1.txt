Dreadful, terrible cast and cheap props. It would have been much better to have an action-style style movie. What waste. From the movie name. <br /> <br /> "Enemy" Naming "Action Movie" would have made it better. (contributing to the parody effect). The police look like a 60-year-old player, a blonde girl who is always bored with the same face. At the end of the movie, he and his team work together to take the bad guys off and every time they exchange words, it seems like the cheap lines given to the sexy scene in porn movies. Terrible. Don't waste your time.
