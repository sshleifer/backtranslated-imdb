If it smells like garbage and it looks like garbage, it must be a garbage. This is by far one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. Tony Scott's bad leadership style is a shame on the uninteresting and somewhat inaccurate story of Domino Harvey's life as a bounty hunter. The story is completely interrupted and confused. Certain aspects of the plot were ridiculous and totally unbelievable. It seems that all the action scenes loosely created bad plot points and terrible action. However, Keira Knightley is not completely naked in this. This is the only and only upside down of this movie. If you want to see her naked, just make the movie fast and back, up to about an hour and a half, and you get the whole nipple. I strongly recommend that no one see this movie EVER! </ 3
