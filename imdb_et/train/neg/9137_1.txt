What I can say is a piece of brilliant cinema that could have won the Oscar. The copy should be safely stored as a safe vault for the offspring. It should be demanded to see all high school students around the world. Sam Mraovich is a genius, perhaps the most genius writer / director / producer / cook / babysitter / walmart who has always given mercy to the cinema in the world. <br /> <br /> Where do I get started with this? Ben and Arthur every millisecond was so breathtaking! And as Mohovich as Arthur, he is so attractive that I am surprised that he did not go to the universe. I couldn't keep myself in the naked scene. I borrowed this movie for my brother and he called me on the phone, saying how Arthur's naked scene made him homosexual. I am of course completely supportive of this film and it is a beautifully designed lesson in tolerance. Why just yesterday I burned down the church and wrote to "Sam and Arthur" on their glowing ashes. <br /> <br /> Film is the best film. When that Fed-Ex plane went to the sky in the middle of the palm trees in Vermont, I wept! Why didn't I even know they had palm trees in Vermont, or that people could have flown to Fed-Ex before the movie. It opened my eyes to new opportunities. This film inspired me to register Sam Morrisich's screen for writing, acting, directing, composing, casting, manufacturing, manufacturing design and real estate at school. I just want to say, "Thank you, Mr Movovich. Thank you for this creation in the world. We can never pay you enough."
