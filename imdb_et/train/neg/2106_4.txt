Bela Lugosi is nice, as usual, but the film is nothing more than Dracula. He is probably the only one who played the perfect part in this film, but even a legend like Lugosi does not save the idea of ​​this movie, and unlike most of the old uncomfortable horror movies, this movie does not make the mood very well. Even in the worst Bela films, it is still mediocre.
