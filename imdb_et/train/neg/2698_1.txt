This movie shows how racist John Singleton is. He portrays whites and other competitions that are not black as evil in our educational system. How soon he forgets that this is the same educational system that made him what he has done and failed. The character of Ice Cube is an exciting black man who was responsible for most of the violence in this film. Singleton barely touched the white and black characters that were trying to reach each other. When Omar Epps says, "I have to be with my people," the racist remark told the volume. And John, for a moment, does not believe that Thomas Jefferson's picture of the tower staircase was not my attention. Nice touch!
