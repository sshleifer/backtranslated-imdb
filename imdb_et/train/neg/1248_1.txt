This movie was bad because it was not interesting. It was a kind of remake, but then again, not really. I was very disappointed with the resources at Tim Burton's disposal. He had a large share and CGI available and a lot of money ($ 100 million), but can you honestly say that what we had was as good as the original film that was made for less than $ 6 million? Heck nr. So the film will not succeed in this regard. <br /> <br /> At least in the original film, the form of freedom was shocking, but nothing in this movie was even relaxing because of the end scene, because you could see it. And by the way, if you give some thought and I did, you can understand how this ending can end. I just wish I had time after I thought about it. <br /> <br /> This movie would have been great and fun if it missed the first movie and received the "monkeys." Here's how I would have written it: astronaut (it should have been more than Marky Mark, because he is not good enough to take care of the film himself, so I would be three men) to land on what they think would be another planet, meeting people (not silencing), cities dominated by monkeys, hunting, communicating with friends with friends, discovering that they are on earth, finding some ruined ruins, finally going under the mad mutant who live underground, breaking the war between mutants and monkeys and then .... well, let your imagination go wild, how do you want to finish it. <br /> <br /> But my idea is that this movie could have been so much. Unfortunately, Tim Burton really knows a good prisoner. Think about what he did with the Batman series. what people a He's trendy, so he's got to be good thinking. Sorry, but no. If someone else had made this movie, it would have been much better and would have been much more satisfying.
