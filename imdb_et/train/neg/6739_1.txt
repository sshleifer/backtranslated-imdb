One wonders why someone would try to see the newly filmed parcels again, as this movie is. "Wedding Day" is one of the best examples of why not even try to hide a new story, something that should have been talked about. If such a project goes on with the approval of the big chips in the studio, go all out with the big stars and glossy product values, so people come to the stars. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not the case with this mistaken comedy attempt. The problem seems to be the way in which screen writers have transcribed the story to London, if in principle it seems like a typical American situation where even the device can't fix it. Then there is a problem with the letters. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar! <br /> <br /> Since Kat and Nick have no conflict since the beginning, the viewer will not be dragged into the movie as the creators thought they were. It is clear that Kat falls against Nick and vice versa in this predictable story. Amy Adams, who was "Junebug" best asset, comes over a little girl who is willing to lie and not come to a clean man who loves her and marries her. <br /> <br /> For all those interested at the end of the film, it takes almost seven minutes!
