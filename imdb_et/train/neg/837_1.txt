I saw and liked the first two lots. Especially because the other is not just trying to make the other as good as the first. And this is the story that stands alone. You don't need to know the first movie. I liked it also in "Free Willy" movies. <br /> <br /> But ... the third one is totally useless! I tried it with my friend because we both liked the first two. We decided to stop after a good half hour. The movie is okay, there are funny parts. But what? Timon and Pumba were funny creatures in the first two films. With Lion King 1/2 being for me: hard to try to get even more fun with the first movie than it was before, and tells the story of your point of view. But what? I really would like to know. You know, the idea of ​​these two sessions, looking at the first, is really nice. But what follows is mostly unnecessary. I think many people liked Timon and Pumba, and so I really did. But for me, many parts were very built, trying to be funny. No chance, most were not funny at all, at least for me. Btw. what movie was anyway? Was it a) Timon and Pump or b) Trying to get more fun from the first movie? I want to choose option b and I'm very disappointed about it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see stories like: "Story behind Xy", Tom should see "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" Stoppard with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. It's really funny and try to get more out of Hamlet than it is.
