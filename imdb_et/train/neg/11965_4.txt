As a historical nut, who is particularly interested in this particular historical event, I was very disappointed with the film. Costumes and productions were quite authentic, but the portrayal of this "British small island" Hollywood was really boring. <br /> <br /> The amount of travel material and footage for soldiers must be unprecedented in film history. Every time I heard the triumphant background music, I began to know that I had to prepare myself for another meaningless filler. Of course, the producers had invested a lot in "staging" and had decided to make their money worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Despite their outstanding election, their dialogue was once again boring and their characters were never developed. When Peter O'toole or Burt Lancaster finished the scene, I have to be disappointed. Their lines were so weak and pointless that I hardly believed that they were the same two great actors who represented the man of Arab Lawrence and Alcatraz respectively. <br /> <br /> There are even worse epics, but it's not much better.
