Lorenzo Lamas marks Jack 'Solider as Kelly, a former Vietnamese vet and renegade policeman who goes through the search and destroys the mission to save his sister from the background. The dirty movie is so cheap and so bad that Ron Palillo is on the third bill and 3 more minutes on the screen, and even these are not good. In general, it is a terrible movie, but Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell scenes hanging from a tree that is packed and gagged are worth (inadvertent) laughs. Followed by an improved sequel.
