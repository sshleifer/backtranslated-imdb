Just Cause is one of those films that first makes you think why it was so slipped when it came out - nothing special, but competent enough and Ed Harris with great support. Then you hit the last third and it all starts to become more stupid until you have a killer with a torch attached to his forehead, threatening the alligator of Sean Connery's wife (typically fashionable and convincing Kate Capshawi) and boy (very young Scarlet Johannsen) in the shadow of the scanner. <br /> <br /> A movie that is probably best seen on the plane and even once only.
