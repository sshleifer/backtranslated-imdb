When I heard the Hazzard Dukes rebuild with the current participants and a solid script, I was like, "I have a chance, it's not better than the first, but we see what happens." Well, I saw what happened. I saw a great 70's / 80's exhibition that was classic by Hollywood. It's so sad to see Hollywood scriptwriters getting something original these days. They seem to be taking a big show with a large audience, and try the "REMAKE" classic show. HEADS UP IN HOLLYWOOD ... IT WORKS !!!! Anyway, more about the show. I think they could have given a better actor than Sean William Scott (American Pie). I'm sure John Schneider will be disappointed with how his character was depicted and used. Get real, Johnny Knoxville, like Luke Duke. How small can you go? Disgraceful jackass actor who plays loving Luke. That's sick of me. I also give Jessica Simpson a beautiful wife, but she sucks. Catherine Bach, who played the original Daisy, was a smart, sexy, strong, opinionful and good IL South girl. She was every little girl model that grew! (I dedicated the doll and Jeep - thank you very much!) Anyway, Jessica Simpson played a smart ass, a 2-bit slut like Daisy Duke. Daisy was never blonde. Why they had to pour it. Jessica Alba would have played a great Daisy Duke. He can speak with a great southern accent and he is proud and would have done an excellent job. Anyway, I would like to say that this movie blew something hot. I feel like I got $ 8.50 to pay for the tickets and they should pay back my money. If you like the Duke of Hazzard (the original series), you can't see this movie. It just disturbs you. CMT (Country Music Television) is playing the Duke's attacks all the time later. So set your TIVO and go with the real thing, not the imitation of Hollywood's big screen.
