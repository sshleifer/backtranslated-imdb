It has had to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with any other comment that said the special effects were fine. I found them pretty bad: it was just not realistic and they were so fake that it just mixed the real story. Archaeologists are looking for a "set". They don't bother to say what is or is so special. It also makes it unclear why they are looking for it in California, while the introduction of the film takes place in ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> When you film a wilderness movie, make an effort to go into the desert. The beginning - an ancient ceremony - looks like it was shot in the studio instead of the desert. <br /> <br /> The level of action was constant throughout the movie, not ups and downs, not the top. It made the movie short, and it is definitely the movie's pro.
