It's terrible how some people get out of such things ... This is one of those overpriced things ... And I hate things that are overestimated, not good ... Why don't we get more TV shows and movies that really are story and great music and what is well written and is actually something? It takes a lot of people to make this movie, series and band and everybody wastes their time ... It seems the bands are younger and younger ... I watched the little ones were and I thought they were 5 or 6. It was sad that the kids are doing this youth ... They are still too young ... Presentation takes a lot of work and they have many other things they need for their life ... The idea that a very young band is terrible ... They must end such bands ... And I don't like this idea at all or the kids themselves ... They're very annoying, very young and their name is "Naked Brothers Band". The people who participate in it and the people who support it have all lost their thoughts ... If this frequency band is shown on the TV, change the channel, and the petition to ban it ... <br /> <br /> And I know this is a very boring comment, but you get a point ... <br /> <br /> This band sucks. Take Drop It ...
