Heavenly Days commit serious comedy faux pas: It is desperate to teach us civic education and it will not stop until we finish the exam. Fibber McGee and Molly travel to Washington, where they see the Senate in action (or if you do not want it) to spit on your senator (Eugene Palette in one of the worst roles of your career), get to grab the tedious stereotypical children of refugees and meet a man who talks about Henry Wallace's book. Henry Wallace !! A year later he was considered a Communist worship, but in 1944 he was A-OK. Add some really awful musical moments, a whole host of flagships and a dull sub-block of newspaper journalists, and you have a movie that must be ready for the generation of Philip Wylie ready for the generation. Heavenly Days are suddenly unevenly reminding us that the devil has all the best stories.
