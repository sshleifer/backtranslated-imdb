When childhood memory says it was a scary film; it is a touch and go whether you should look at it again. Anyway, I remembered the terrifying scene of a homeless person and the cool villain played by Jeff Kober. <br /> <br /> "The First Power" is not a very good movie, sad to say. It is full of those police officers and a very bad script with holes that the truck could run through (with countless convenient "turns" that help the story). Lou Diamond Phillips is a hypersensitive bad ass cop who sends a baddie serum killer to Kober to find out he was Satan himself and now has the resurrection power with the power of having every weak-minded man who comes over. Through a mixture of very poorly understood psychologist who helps in the case. <br /> <br /> Ahhh, it's a trash. But enjoyable as such, especially if you have pleasant memories. It scared me as a child and this scene with homeless people is still pretty good. Any logic here; Forget it, in almost every scenario a good action is thrown and you finally get into the action of Steven Segal's flick and 70's demonic flick. And who on earth thought Lou Diamond Phillips was in the lead? Needless to say, he's not convincing at all, but he's trying his best and I've never had a problem with this man, so many of the appraisers here seem to be. As for Tracy Griffith as psychic, the less it is. But Kober is pretty good as a killer; always liked this actor. <br /> <br /> "First power" can be just what the doctor ordered after a hard day's work and "brain shutdown" is required. Beer is likely to increase the viewing experience and I will definitely have this load next time I give this film a spin. In summary; not a good flick, but a somewhat innocent joy for nostalgic fans who were easily scared by children. "Look at you, friend boy"!
