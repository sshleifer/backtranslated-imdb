It wasn't all that: it was the tempo, the pop and the actors who were not afraid to chew the landscape. It also had a decent script. It was scratching my head for me. If Farrah is not really "serious" about his career, why does he have a manager (and why is he wasting his time)? When Kate and Barney are "artists", why do they sign up to show all the mothers of the uterus (like the "Brady Bunch" movie, where Robert Reed wants to make Shakespeare just to find himself with BB)? They were not industry names, but they were not hungry. And when they got the story right (the poster appeared before Farrah got the show), Silverman rejected "Funniest Home Videos" and "American Idol" and Spelling's promises for her child Tori. did not happen. <br /> <br /> I was disturbed by how the spelling role is distorted. He is shown as an actor-creator if he was not. And how he was "ridiculous" to the "idea" of CA! How was spelling and Goldberg allowed to enforce Farrah's oral agreement when others were signed? And why didn't Farrah or Bernstein tell him he wouldn't leave because he discovered his inner diva, but because the bigger ones wanted him? Because it tries to create conflicts and tensions by setting Farrahi as a "bad girl" (like Suzanne Somers), it won't work because the base was never put on - it was the place where the "Three Companies" image was delivered.
