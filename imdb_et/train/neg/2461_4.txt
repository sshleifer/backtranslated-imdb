There are probably more people in front of the dentist than we say, small monsters or scary dolls. What makes it an excellent subject for horror film, really. <br /> <br /> Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a dentist for many years, but when he beats his wife, he hits, and he brings his anger and frustration to his job. Well, give the crazy dentist a cage and a mouth, and you probably think what will happen next ... <br /> <br /> As I said, a brilliant idea, but not as good as needed. Especially the end has ended with a huge shoot. The last note: see Mark Ruffalo (You can count on me, the eternal sun ...) in it. <br /> <br /> 5/10
