I buy or at least watch every Seagall movie. He came out with a handful of good films, then descending from bad stories, bad camera work and walking people, he almost lost me. A few movies he remembered how to make a decent movie. Now she's forgotten again. This movie is dark (at any level you want to name). There are many slashes and lashes here, without being noticeable unless it is meant to alert the military. <br /> <br /> Seagall may have many scenes because it was often too dark to say and most of the other's voice was used. Unfortunately, the only interesting feature was the bad guy who killed his guard to escape and then brought the whole place to destroy. Okay, because when are we deploying a prisoner with a prisoner? Anyway, this bad guy was at least colorful and very focused. If you like this king of the king, there are many gore. It seemed to me that bad guys pulled the same ring every time. I'm just glad they didn't suck blood from their miserable victims. I mean to you back to your summary. Basically, this is a horror film that is hidden in action
