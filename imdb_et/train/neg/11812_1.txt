... but I'm not one of them. Caro Diario was observable at least two-thirds of the time, but the boring and self-centered third part of the film gave us a taste of what came out of this extraordinarily confused confusion. Moretti says he feels the need to make this film, but doesn't want it, while the viewer feels he should stick with it, but he doesn't really want to. The film about Italian politics and elections can be exciting, but it is not the film. At one point, Moretti and his friends are standing outside the headquarters of the Communist Party, discussing the interviews they are preparing to deal with party leaders, but it is a feature of this film that we don't see any of them. Moretti's political attacks are events that lead to the birth of a son, followed by his home films with his child and later with his son Pietro (the film pulls us through for several years and more than one election period). We look forward to seeing some final sequence or convincing arguments, but they will never come. I doubt I would be patient to be able to sit through the Nanni Moretti movie ever. He manages to do an hour and twenty minutes seems like eternity.
