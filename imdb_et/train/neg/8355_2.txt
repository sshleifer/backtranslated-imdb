Wanda Nevada is a hairy fantasy film that uses some 1979 ideas that represent the illegal romance of 13-year-old girls. The script, tempo and direction are equally terrible. The sequences do not believe. The characters speak with a simplified wording, which is usually found in films aimed at children under the age of 10, but also contains several sexual references that include Shields character and graphic deaths. <br /> <br /> Film wants to be a comedy at some level, but never funny, adventure, but plot and action are meaningless and childish, but introduces pedophilia and rape as a real opportunity. He also wants to be a picture of a friend, an image of the age, a ghost film, a spiritual film of India, a travel book and a western. The overall impact is huge with stupidity and disgust. Wanda Nevada is a complete waste of time if you do not want to see a great fantastic picture of the Grand Canyon. That it works well.
