Although Robert "Knox" Benfer has his own fans, I'm not one of them. His films are asynchronous and amateur, and not very funny if you are not 14 years old with a poor sense of humor. <br /> <br /> He is definitely not famous because his immature fans want you to believe in harassing people in Wikipedia or filling the voices here in IMDb. He is certainly not profiled on any major media that speaks of his "fame" and his creation. <br /> <br /> Benfer has little skill in limited animation, but he has to get out of his youngsters sycophants and learn to write some real funny stuff before he is seriously considered a real entertainer. From that moment on he is just a camera with a child and it shows.
