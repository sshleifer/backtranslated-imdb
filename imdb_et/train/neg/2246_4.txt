I've never seen Judy Garland's original 1954 version. It has also been a few years, but I found this story not exciting or romantic. The film speaks of two lovers whose musical career is in the opposite direction. John Norman Howard is a weary, frustrated rock star in decline, starting with romance with fresh, gifted new song feelings, Esther Hoffman. His dramatic success is only to underline his decline. <br /> <br /> Leading actors Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand have enough roles in their roles, but their chemistry and the plot have not left much to me. The film is remarkable to me in only one aspect, the beautiful transfer of Streisand to the Oscar winning song "Evergreen". He has a really powerful and wonderful voice.
