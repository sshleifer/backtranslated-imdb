You saw it before last year's prize, but didn't know why they issued it after the end of the vote, but whatever, at least for the exposure, but the film was a complicated mess. Of course, some parts were funny with black humor, but no character really felt very real to me. There was no one I could contact, and I think it has failed for me. Of course, the plot is somewhat interesting and subversive towards Scientology, WOW! What a great idea ... let's see if it's gone. The whole challenge seems to be fake, from enlightenment, from casting, to the terrible visual effect (which should be deliberate, I can say, and so everyone else, no one laughs with you). Anyway, I hope it will make this DVD for sale at least, I wouldn't want a project that many people obviously made a lot of unnoticed. But this is some way. Bored bored.
