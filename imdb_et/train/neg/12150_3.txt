Feeding masses is just one of the many recent mediocre zombie films that come after hard-earned dollars. Suggestion? Keep your hard earned dollars and just say good old TheatreX took one for this team. Guess what plots are? Zombies take over. This time, this film is about originality (?) For the sake of Rhode Island and, frankly, I'm not sure if I've ever seen a zombie flick in Rhode Island. The government-controlled TV channel is supposed to keep "normal" programs so that all other citizens don't think there are problems in the world, that is, those who never look and go outside. However, I say that some of the ads that this station has posted were probably the most entertaining part of this movie. There is actually a bit of a story, but I'm not worried about it because after a while you don't care or you are asleep. In any case, it has a lot of terrible actions to throw away all the "seen before" things that were out of the camera. Trust me, you'll find a lot of time to do with your time when you look at it. 3 out of 10
