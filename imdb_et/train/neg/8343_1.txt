Salvage is the worst horror movie I've ever seen. There's nothing terrible about that. It does not deserve to be such a good genre. First of all, I don't see how many people think such a piece is such a great movie. When I write something boring and completely ridiculous, because I would laugh and be too embarrassed to put others on this stupidity. Second: The actor is terrible and the leading actor is frighteningly ugly. Third: the story sucks, it has been used in the past and sorry that this cheap movie is not an excuse. Read the case on the back of summer, it shows the whole story. I don't recommend you watch this movie if you don't have 80 minutes to waste anything that will regret you watching it. I feel very bad about these Crooks and their name for irony. All hail Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
