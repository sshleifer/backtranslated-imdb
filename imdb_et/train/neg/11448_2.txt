This movie is not as bad as "Perfect Stranger", but it was not just funny. It couldn't hold on to one type of comedy - it jumped from SNL, Adam Sandler-esquire, romantic, little guy, big hit, "Loser" (movie) comedies. Although there were quite funny moments (falling down the hill), no one was extremely funny or spectacular. Schindler's list was more fun (and felt shorter). you never knew whether Andy Samberg should have been in high school, college dropout or just a loser who lives with his mother - Sissy Spacek - in his worst role. And bad Ian McShane, a serious actor if I only had one name, is given to the camera for reading. The story drags and is perfectly practical to the end (including spoilers here when Adam Samberg's mother wants to see it). Don't spend money to see this movie, and maybe Lorne Michaels gets a hint and starts producing quality (Yes, Wayne's world and Tommy Boy are quality films).
