Although the animated film is boring at least 6 years old. <br /> <br /> Adults who grew up in the area of ​​wild horses and natives seemed to have combined with the PC too many fantasy films created by people who have never lived in the area where they filmed. Talk to those who have lived on the back of a horse, most of them treat their animals like family members, regardless of the background. Regardless of the background, we have been dealing with good and bad natural horse shredders. I had to explain that it was the views of filmmakers on children who were surprised to see how the PC showed a different world than what they actually knew compared to the real problems. <br /> <br /> The usual Disney or Dreamworks fare on the cute talking animal burning screen was nice for the older viewer. But if you live in an area similar to the one shown, you may end up answering questions.
