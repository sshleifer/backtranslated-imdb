!!!! POSSIBLE SMALL SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> Since I looked at the first hand of GUILTY AS SIN, I couldn't believe it was done in 1993 because he played as a JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszterhas clone since the mid-80s. It starts with a murder and it remains in the audience of the museum "Is he guilty or innocent and does he go to sleep with his lawyer?" manipulating and migrating his client-type film, which ends in a ridiculous way, and GUILTY AS SIN has an even more ridiculous end in this respect. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad thriller, but the most unforgivable thing is that it was directed by Sidney Lum the same man who brought us all the time to the classic court house drama 12 ANGRY MEN
