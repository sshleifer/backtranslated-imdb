Indeed, Parsifal is not an opera that can be liked by everyone, even though it is my favorite Knappertsbusch, 1951. The whole approach of Syberberg is so static. When music starts to swell ... Syberberg keeps the cast at the same pace. The keys to Amfortase and Klingsor are endless. What happened to movie editing? The result is a physically tiring look. The viewer is never transported spiritually. Your impulse is to rush home and play again to confirm that Wagner was right, Syberberg got it wrong. And that made the decoration of Wagner's anti-Semitism with "smart" reminders - did this film never have a viewer of Wagner's unknown movie?
