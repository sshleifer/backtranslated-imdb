Good idea, badly implemented. Although it can make up to 99% of the SciF channel movies, it's true here. I love movies that show a good back story, and I like animated films and I like all the main actors so it could have been great. Despite some good action, this film has failed because of poor writing and directing of Bill Platt. This movie is not. It has been put together so randomly that you know that the words "second draft" are not Bill Platt's vocabulary. There is one scene that is totally unnecessary and can be removed without anyone noticing it. This scene begins and ends with driving in the car, so you could cut one car scene and never forget about the pointless scene. <br /> <br /> This movie was also a strange habit of explaining some details while explaining to others a point where you can guess the whole "plot" in advance. It was also a habit to interrupt the fight early, probably because they could not afford it. There are also some ridiculously bad scenes where the "plot" appears on the computer and the final battle, which includes a comfortably placed "poisonous glue" (seriously, what is it?). <br /> <br /> Shiri's Appleby fan, watch this movie because he's OK. He manages to break his Roswell a few times and make a good chicken (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he has done after playing Q in ST: TNG, so it's not new. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 4/10.
