You know, Jason, you know Freddy and you know Leatherface. Now, be prepared: the killer of the security link! That's right, Killer Workout, a buggy movie, when I ever saw it, sends an unseen murderer to his (or?) Victims with an oversized, novel security pin. It is a strange choice to be sure what is worth explaining. Of course, the film never even tries to explain where the killer got this thing. <br /> <br /> As the title says, the aerobics gym is confined by a mad killer and everything is suspect. In fact, the movie gives so few clues about the killer's identity, almost all of the movie's being a murderer until they're killed. And since almost everything, but the killer is dead, it's really just a disposal process. Strangely enough, even though the whole name is dead, the aerobic classes continue to be serious. In fact, nothing can stop dancing. Although three men will be murdered in the next room, the training will continue. Death is not even a factor; one sign dies, but later on it is visibly visible. Director David Prior knew what he was doing when he called Killer Workout and not a logical exercise. <br /> <br /> Cop chases, explosive solariums, and hundreds of women exposed meat shots are thrown for good action. Like a woman caught in a tanning bed, I finally felt a great discomfort with Killer Workout. Finally END flashed on the screen. So what happened? You got it, shots of women who work. Not even the end of the movie can stop them. <br /> <br />
