I'm generous, giving this movie 2 stars. the line "have you ever seen oz wizard" was the best part for me! terrible writing and acting like appearing in this movie it's no wonder that many have taken the worthless tv reality shows. do yourself a favor and come out of the house and hit the royal baseball game.
