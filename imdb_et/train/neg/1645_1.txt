I watched this movie last night and I had to warn someone else who was considering this movie. In a word - don't do it. I feel that this is something the scriptwriter student would have written in the Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy phase, i.e. every other word was a curse word. I have no problem with a lot of passion, like "Good will for hunting", provided it helps to get more symbols. In this case, it was just hollow catchers who were trying to entertain the audience * or laughter. The three leading figures are all their unique stereotype, wall street jerk, coffee house jerk and "I'm a non-gay-just-in-touch-with-my-feminine side" of-a-jerk. You just don't give them a damn! They are all low, countless losers you want to lose. For those who dare, this movie has a few funny moments, start and end. The WC / Vibrator is funny in the way of the sick Uh, yeah. Indeed, I would only recommend this movie to my enemies.
