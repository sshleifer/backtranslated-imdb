In the first scene, "Child Problem", the baby is peeing in the face of a nun. For this movie, it's witty. An unpleasant, meaningful "comedy," it is on so many levels that it spurs faith. John Ritter is a kind of father who takes a child to hell and worships him for keeping his dignity in one of the remarks, irritating performances and gentle humor surrounding him. And what the hell does Jack Warden do in this mess? The film has been very badly led by Dennis Dugan-directed production and terribly intuition when it is done with fidelity, it's a rather strange experience. But don't forget it. Michael Oliver, the most repulsive and unlikely child artist who ever hit the screen, is the sublight of the whole thing. Believe me, you want to smoke her in the mouth.
