This film is just too long, too repetitive, male nudity and sexuality (as it is said with a collection of adult titles) is too free and unnecessary. Much of the first-third of the film could have been cut for ten minutes and was as effective as trying out the audience's patience (and endurance). <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on Saturday afternoon, with a film festival; a crowd type that tends to be more adventurous, more interested in experimental or atypical films, such as without much dialogue, shorts, foreign films. The crowd sold close to the 275-seat theater began to tune in the first half of the film, and the vast majority stayed "profitable" (never reached), I never attended a number of film festivals, experimental, homosexuals, and so on for about 14 years people away from the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been easily cut by more than half and was as effective as it was. It could also have gone in different directions, even shorter, and would have been much more effective. <br /> <br /> Since it is now, it is not something that could be easily suggested or what I could. desire to look again.
