First of all, I apologize to the filmmakers for using the terms "filmmaker", "film" or "film", but "criminal" and "crime against humanity" seem a bit harsh. br /> Writing: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Director: Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Functional: Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Cinematography: Too hidden words. <br /> <br /> The technical skills used to collect this cruelty: NONE. <br /> <br /> This set of wastes is hardly called a cinema. Most family house movies are closer to serving this distinction than Revenge Quest. No, this is just 10 autopilot captured from the video. <br /> <br /> We leave this survey between the plot because there are too many holes to cover at once. Let's just say that it smells worse than the rest of this movie. Calling an operational one-dimensional call gives them credit. Little is, at first, a terrifying and terrible video and editing is much worse. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this fear, though after the plot, should have an effect ... or rather a disturbing lack of it. There are no gaps in the pistols, no flash pots, and some of the sound effects that were either in the "gun" of the stock or they were created by mouth (yes, you read that right). The filmmaker really had a duty to record "shh" sound to the doors of the lifts; I think he felt that it made them more futuristic. It should end in 2031. However, it does not explain the sounds it made in the fight, <br /> <br /> If it wasn't bad enough for the sound quality to be terrible (it just used a microphone installed) on the camcorder and it shows, use almost worse than no sounds at all. The sound effects are different from the rest of the soundtrack as the sheep in the sheep drunk, and they are just as clumsy. Picture of this: A bad man enters an office building looking for his harvest. The woman is afraid. He raises his gun (uzi) and shakes it. We hear a sound that is obviously not so good. The woman runs away from the camera and suddenly a blood packet explodes on her (only 1) (she seemed to be hit by a paintball), and she fell off the face. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that my description makes too much truth about the injustice of the real sequence. <br /> <br /> In the second order, which makes almost a movie, but not quite, makes the movie funny enough to play in the stairwell. The bad guy pursues a good man and he whom he protects down the stairs, shaking his plastic all the time. You may want to be a duck; there are badly timed sound effects that fly all over the place. . If there is justice, there is some kind of karma with his name. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this set of industrial waste - and I would strongly recommend it. for scenes that are almost literally raised from Bladerunner, and an AM radio that doubles as a radio transmitter. Try not to focus too much on the plot; it will only hurt you. <br /> <br /> 0 stars 10. And it's generous.
