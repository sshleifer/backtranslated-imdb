Yes, this movie is a real thief. It stole some shiny Oscar from the Avatar just because the politicians wanted another war hero to accept the film (support?) In the fight against US wars. I don't really want to go into politics, but come on, it's clearer than the summer sky. Hurt's cabinet doesn't really have any outstanding, real plot at all. I feel in the 50s of Hungary when the party told people what they like and what they didn't. At the same time, the same propaganda films were produced, except that they were black and white. Even if we find that this title is a reasonable part of the "US War is a cool" genre, you will definitely have much better movies.
