this is the only movie I've ever been out of. bad act - bad plot - bad casting - bad leadership - bad cinematography - when they had set a bad picture they couldn't do better. I hope they are proud of their turkey. I'm surprised that someone associated with this movie has ever been hired in Hollywood. don't waste your time!
