I didn't even know that this movie only existed shortly after I saw Blade: Trinity, I shared Trinity on the table when I saw a user mention how the Wes Craven series is much better than what Blade is so I did my quick research: checked Drakula's IMDb & RottenTomatos score: Ascension and somewhere in the search, I found out it's a sequel to Dracula 2000. I also noticed that Wes Craven on Dracula's tables was really strong for this movie, which is a big contradiction with the scores I saw. <br /> <br /> Let's take a quick personal summary now. I remember seeing Dracula 2000 and I do not like it at all, and then I see Dracula's score: Ascension lowered my expectations even more, but then again I am the person who really needs to watch the film (any movie) so I can make my own opinion . <br /> <br /> A couple of things I knew when I started watching this movie was that it's a small budget, so that's why I'm going to have to ignore a lot of v / fx and just draw that offsets story and actors, I was also somewhat impressed by some of the film's election (Jason London, Roy Schieder & Jason Scott Lee). > <br /> Oh geez? This movie was CHEESY! But the cheese can be at least entertaining, I found it to be a pretty loud ridiculous, bad audio synchronization from re-recording the FEW scenes, the stupidity of the characters in this movie. Of course, they all knew about vampires and some basic things, Luke was even a book about it, but did it prevent them from being "infected"? No, it is the worst thing to slip, where the girl has to get out of the shower and check the noise she hears as a towel. <br /> <br /> I also have to flash at some point because I'm not sure how "Dracula" wore clothes on her body, especially since she's big wild and angry and I see if I was in that situation, I wouldn't want be the one who dresses him. <br /> <br /> So the movie ends like the average movie of every trilogy? it is not, instead it is the "Cliff Hangar" where i now look forward to the 3rd installment of "Legacy". Oh entertainment value for Cheesy movies.
