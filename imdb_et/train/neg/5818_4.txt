--- What happened to these unlikely people. Alan Arkin was as usual, sleepless and just walking through the role. Children are all confused. Mariesa Tomei will probably want this role ever. And what is Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno in this very bad movie? If you like to watch out for losers because of your disorder and don't try to do better, it's your movie. Everyone else, walk, read a book or see something else. <br /> <br /> Jane
