I think you have to give some points of courage to write a musical story about the lesson of history, but how is some good music? <br /> <br /> How was Howard DeSilva's comic book in the interests of otherwise tired children? <br /> <br /> Is William Daniels' contemporary (temporal) exemplary style designed for the demographic turn of the 1960s and 1970s? <br /> <br /> Do we need all the "jokes" about NY & NJ? (I hear the Broadway audience in the blue hair on the chip.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, I find the whole piece dated, boring and too striking for the screen
