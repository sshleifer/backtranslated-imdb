When I first saw this movie, I thought it was one of the best films ever made. Of course this is due to Bo Derek and his various film forms in this film. But now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this movie is terrible. Remember, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful and he and his wife-director John Derek make sure you see him a lot. But if you think of this aspect of the film, it will become one of the big dull rides. And Tarzan, he's all muscular as you think he should be, but when he first sees Jane (of course, Bo), he doesn't know what to think. This, despite Bo wearing a wet weekly shirt, is visible to her breast. Tarzan would be the only primitive person on the planet to have this problem. If you are looking for a beautiful nude body by sliding a movie, it can fill the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and valuable movie, go elsewhere ... almost anywhere else !!!
