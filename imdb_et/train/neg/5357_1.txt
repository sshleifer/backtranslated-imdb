I don't know where to start. This movie seems like a lot of one of those cheap Saturday morning kids showing they did back in the early eighties. Similar to Captain Power or Power Rangers. It's full of bad digital coverage and really cheesy sounding "secret office" and villains. <br /> <br /> Operation is so bad that it's not even funny. The direction is terrible and so far there is little consistency. It looks like someone just threw a lot of scenes and forgot that there should have been a plot there. <br /> <br /> Maybe one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie starts early when several crooks sit in an explosive tool in the agent's car. For some reason, even though the device is clearly said to be "remotely exploded", bad guys decide to track their motorcycles. This chase continues. all the time bad guys make ridiculous and totally pointless bikes. Bikes stand, doing the wheels, etc. At one point, an accident happens and one of the attackers is thrown out of his bike, we see that the bicycle (clearly cgi) is thrown into the agents' car, but the passenger is lost. Then a few seconds later the rider and the bicycle return ... probably without a crash. At this point, even if there is an explosive device installed in the car, the attackers decide to shoot the agent's past while driving, then blow their car. What was clearly done with cgi. Sound is confusing? That is, and so is the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> It can be pointed out that when I say cgi, we are not saying that Lord of the rings is here cgi. We're talking about cheap cheesy Power Rangers, which are typical cgi, I really think it would have been better for Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> Why Savin and Todd never know about this movie, I can only assume that they made money for the benefit of someone or because they were extruded to it ... probably the last one.
