A really scary movie. It seems like it was done in the early 90s with a straightforward person who wanted to show that gays are good, normal and normal. LTR recommends that monogamy and marriage are the way to salvation for the sad, lonely, sex-like gays to be offensive. Wow! Who knew? Supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes (feminine buffalo, bitter, lonely queen, laughing tree, etc.) and the main characters are milquetoast, middle class, central clones that are of little interest. <br /> <br /> With regard to the main pair of romantic and ideological struggles, there is not much to say: we have seen it before and done much better.
