My first contact with Templarios and not good. I was excited to have found this title among the Anchor Bay Video offers that have brought us other cult classic, such as "Spider Baby". Print quality is great, but the fact that the film is deadly cannot be hidden alone. There's an exciting opening order where villagers refine the terrible revenge on the Templars (and put the whole thing in motion), but everything else in the movie is slow, pointless, and ultimately unfulfilled. Adding Damage Damage: The movie was dubbed, not with subtitles, as allowed in the video chat.
