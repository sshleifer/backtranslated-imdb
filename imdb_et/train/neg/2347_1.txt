First, let me say that I am a big fan of Ashley Judd; that's why i was curious to see this, his debut role. There is no argument that his talent is obvious and his performance is excellent. I think I can see how professional critics liked the story of aesthetic content. But I think the films are meant for entertainment and this is where this film fails. <br /> <br /> Halfway, I thought, "How much longer do we have to look for a boyfriend forever, stiffly standing around an abandoned souvenir shop, reorganizing the goods?" It seemed that it would continue forever! <br /> <br /> Then I thought it was one of those films where the director was trying to get the audience into a relaxed state before being hit by a dynamic event. There is no such happiness. Continuing the movie is a boring, boring and endless story until the end. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying this because I'm a junkie. I like all kinds of movies, especially romantic comedies. But I hope it's entertaining. <br /> <br /> Add the fact that cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor's bad home videos. Depressing! <br /> <br /> I just can't get anyone to like this movie. The value of Zero entertainment. My longest life is 114 minutes. <br /> <br />
