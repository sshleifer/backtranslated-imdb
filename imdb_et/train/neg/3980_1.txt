No, I'm not kidding. If they ever come up with the idea of ​​a movie, they should be thrown out of the studio. I'm serious. Their films are exactly the same in all, and they only consist of traveling abroad, which has a problem they just solve, hoping to be popular and make new friends. Think about it. If you've ever seen a movie that marks them with another plot, contact me and tell me your name. These "movies" are bad excuses to be on television and go to other countries. There is a reason that films never go to theaters. I'm sure if they were really young and some O.K. movies, some studio boss bought all their rights for 15 years or so, so now that they, 17, can make movies in other countries when using studio money. Let me advise you, CONTINUE TO MARY KATE AND ASHLEY! This is yours!
