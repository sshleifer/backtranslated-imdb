There is no real plot for this, but a series of short sketches showing some very old jokes. I smiled once or twice, a lot of my stuff. But even after only 73 minutes, this film takes a long time to be welcomed and becomes obsolete and annoying (here and where you wake up, a little nudity). Still as bad as this movie (and it's pretty dirty), it's a comedic pearl compared to pretty much Aaron Seltzer & Jason Friedberg (Time-Movie, Epic-Movie, Meet the Spartans). sad way. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: 11 Pairs, 3 Bushes, 3 Donkeys <br /> <br /> My Class: D <br /> <br /> Code Red DVD Attachments: Original trailer for this movie; and trailers "beyond the door", "dead pit", "farmer", "obsession", "power game", "sole survivor" and "Wacky Taxi"
