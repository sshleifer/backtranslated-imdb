I was so disappointed in this movie. I don't know much about the real story, so I was eager to see that it was playing a movie and educating myself a bit of history. With such a powerful real story and great actors, it seemed to be a solid combination. Well, somewhere the script failed. It was so scattered - is this movie from his childhood? his love life? with his own disability? his ability to speak? his passion for disabled people? I'm sure there is a chance to add all these things to a good story, but this movie wasn't like that. I was left with cold observers who were unable because of their disabilities, but because of their personalities. Other small handles: 1. Heavy duty track. It's the seventies - we can get it right now! 2. If he is such a phenomenal public speaker, why were we not treated here and there more than an extract - and even then mostly in assembling?
