This is a really stupid film in this typical genre of the 80s: action comedy. Conceptually, it resembles Rush Hour, but it lacks the full range of activities, laughter, and chemistry between the main characters in the film. Let's know that I enjoy Jay Len as a stand-up and talking person, but he just can't act. He is terrible when he tries to act harshly - he can barely hold that mark off his face, laughing at his lining, which, by the way, is not very funny. His vision (even at this time) is not a pleasant phenomenon. In addition, I feel that Pat Morita - at least according to today's standard - does not give Japan a very politically correct impression. Don't even let me start the story. I'll give him 2 out of ten.
