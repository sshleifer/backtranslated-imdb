This movie is a joke and Quinton should be ashamed of trying to reject it as a modest Blaise movie. If you have a sleep disorder, then all the rental equipment for that movie. The sticks they call an actor who is expected to be Modesty Blaise must be the most boring person on the planet. Maybe he could be used as a hat that stands in the back of a real movie. Ten to five minutes nothing to thank you who ever invented the fast back and forth button. When you see this movie, you can call it RUN. I can't help but think which third world country could waste this mess. this movie is boring because the actors are the boring waste of waste they breathe. If you want to see Mostey Blaise Film, look at what they did in the 60s, perhaps what the director should do.
