(See English as Swedish is not allowed) <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with very low expectations and I unfortunately tell you that the film is barely in their lives. <br /> <br /> As far as I loved seeing Janne "Loffe" Karlsson again on the big screen, the writers should have realized at the beginning of the script writing process that the seven people entering the water are neither original nor funny. The story is very thin and jokes are used and predicted, those that are not are just boring. I smiled three times during the movie. <br /> <br /> The placement of Swedish Findus products is (inadvertently) funny, not just a big sign; "Findus did make it happen!" <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta Kanal 2 doesn't have to see on a movie or DVD, just wait for it on the TV, it won't take too long.
