Ever watched a movie that lost the plot? Well, it wasn't even at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Our heroine, who sits around the house, painlessly annoying scenes that do not really have any threat or even a prophecy that even occurred during apparently persistent thunderstorms (which has never been heard in house-double glazing)? The house, which is probably just a few miles from the city, is still a few hours' walk away (?) Or a third girl who doesn't use the plot for any purpose, except to offer a surprisingly fast murder like tedium becomes unbearable? Or even a start pointing to killing 20+ across the region, although it is obvious that the killer is never far from the house? Or a strange ritual with salt and pepper, which largely coincides with the trend of most films. <br /> <br /> Add a leading actor who can't act, but at least be ready to do some totally irrelevant nude shower scenes, and this video is really nasty, but not as you expect. <br /> <br /> Considering the following simply to ban it in the UK in the 80s (mainly due to the final surprise of an extended murder), it offers nothing but curiosity and one classic murder (don't worry about your telegraph at least ten minutes before). <br /> <br /> After a walk in the woods, our victim will get steeply up, which they will probably fight. One and a half away, they see a black-covered and high-rained figure at the top. What are they doing? Push down and drive like others? No, of course not - they fight the top and stand comfortably and correctly in front of the weapon of murder. <br /> <br /> It's really just a movie, as they say.
