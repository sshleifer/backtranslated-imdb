Well, I wasn't able to enjoy this movie even for cultured values. This is the "Commando" director's B-Movie Flip, which is still too flat and silly to be considered a B-movie with enough entertainment value. <br /> <br /> This is the momentum of the '90s, but above all, the film should remind you of a film of 80's when these B-movies were always the highest. These films always went up and never turned their story or actor. It was all about cleaning things, big heroes and circles flying. This movie has all the ingredients of it, but I really didn't want to watch this movie when I like watching similar types of movies. It is hard to say why really, because the story and the acting and such are just as bad as all other films of the same genre of the same age. <br /> <br /> This is probably because the movie is often far too silly. All such films have their foolish moments, but this movie is just full. Fighting, Dolph Lundgren, running around the shirt, characters, story. Not everything is very good because it is often too flat for words. From time to time does the story not even try in a little sense and in the main line of the general film? Its story is all over the place and it seems to have been written just to create a film that contains struggle sequences, arms struggles and such. And these sequences aren't even very good to look at. The moments are too short and quite disappointing to really look at the man who brought us "Commando". <br /> <br /> This is first of all Dolph Lundgren, where he can play a big hero, who beats a seemingly light butt, knows how to handle weapons and other weapons, and of course Tia Carrere's girl. All this also brings us one of the worst editing sequences in the history of the action film and certainly one of the worst sex sequences I've seen in every movie. Both are too flat for words and just very badly put together. <br /> <br /> No character really works. Good guys are policemen, but they never seem to behave. They simply kill without having to be held accountable to anyone, and they are not very interested in making arrests or informing anyone of their findings. Even if they discover that the great Japanese crime syndicate is trying to take over L.A. And the brewery works for the drug factory and the smuggling of large drugs. Think for a moment about Brandon Lee's overall goal in the film? The film could have been done easily without him and the girl. <br /> <br /> Too foolish, flat and easier and just not fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
