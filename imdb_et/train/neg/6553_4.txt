Years after the fall of the last major corporations, the world has fallen into a new dark age where cyborgs are harvested for their parts. Money, a female cyber, goes to the wasteland for a doctor to get news that she is pregnant. When recycler (hunters hunting for particles) runs, Cash tries to find his way to Cytown, the mysterious shelter for the hats. <br /> <br /> "Cyborg 3: The Recycler" is the third (last) far entry to the CYBORG trilogy. The first film was originally designed to be a continuation of UNIVERSE MASTERS, but was quickly transformed into an apocalyptic standard martial arts festival, which became something of a cult classic because of the cheese game. CYBORG 2: GLASS SHADOW was a successor that actually improved to its predecessor but was not widely observed (and the few who saw it as cheap due to feed). <br /> <br /> This movie attempts to rush on the first two films (the first was an exciting action movie, the second was a clever cyber story), but unfortunately it remains under both. The budget was clearly lower than CYBORG 2, where the film was placed in desert areas (like so many films from the 90's apocalyptic acts), saving costs around old industrial buildings. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie focuses on a plot device that is a pregnant cyber, it is as interesting as it is absurd (this movie is not the first one to try this idea; ). But the film is trapped in the same trap that so many victims of low budget sci-fi action films are that the scene (synthetic organisms) is nothing more than the androids. Visual effects are more than just denture belts and makeup effects. <br /> <br /> Actress is quite common for such a movie, with the leading actor (Khrystyne Haje) being one of the worst performers. Instead of being happy in the news, she's pregnant, she's acting everywhere. His co-stars are much better, Malcolm McDowell, who is an ordinary gangster who enlivens scenes and Richard Lynch has fun as the main villain. Particularly remarkable is Andrew Byniarski, who plays Lynch's right-hand man, who later appears on THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake and its prequel.
