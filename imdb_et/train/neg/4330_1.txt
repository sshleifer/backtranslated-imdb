Last night I decided to look at the prequel or I'll tell the so-called prequel to Carlito - "Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)", which went straight to the DVD ... no wonder ... it's completely ... and i mean completely S% & KS !!! looking at it at the waist and I think it would be a clean waist when writing it .... I don't understand how De Palma agreed to the production of this film "sh # t-fest" .... one of the things I hate my hat ... Jay Hernandez, who plays young Brigante, reminded me how De Niro got into Brando's shoes to portray a youngster at Don Corleone's Godfather II ... but the difference De Niro was amazing and even got the Oscar !!! Jay Hernandez has great courage for a young Pacino ... too bad for her, I don't think she's playing in the movie anymore and after watching this, including # $% ty movie, I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to get a bad taste of my mouth.
