Given that I felt I got a new Jet Li movie to see, but fight and pointless hand combat, I took this title. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie contains more weapons battles (Chow Yun Fat area but not so good) than Jet Li and the company's acrobatic battle. So the mixer fight was interesting and even funny, given that it was something unexpected for Jet Li, the more Jackie Chan said. <Br>> <br /> Unfortunately, I would recommend a Fist of Legend, a Thai Chi Master, or even Enforcer for this dissapointment. <br /> <br /> Rating for 4 martial arts Rating for 3 overall movie scores
