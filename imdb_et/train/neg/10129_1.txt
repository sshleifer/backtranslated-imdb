I can hardly find the words that make this movie totally terribly expressive. I was promised to act with Segal and stealth aircraft that usually make an entertaining movie. I can honestly say that I would like to see a cocktail stick rather than see this movie again. The action was so terrible that it was almost funny. The story was uncomfortably weak, where the pieces were so large that you could fly F117 through them. The script was so poor when I found out that 10-year-old wrote that I shouldn't be the most surprised. Direction and production are so amateur, I don't even hire those people to shoot their worst enemy wedding videos. Utter Utter runs. People responsible for making this film have become cheap art and should be ashamed of themselves. Steven Segal should never show his face in public again, I can't imagine what made him in this star, the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.
