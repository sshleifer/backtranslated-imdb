... well, put it on a DVD, waste an hour and a half of your life that you never get back and find out. <br /> <br /> Acting? What works? <br /> <br /> Production values? ... Production? ... Values? <br /> <br /> Story? Don't get me started. <br /> <br /> After several years of posting in IMDb, I didn't think I'd see the movie so bad that I really wanted a lower rating than one. I have always found at least one or two reasons to see merit - in the intent or effort of a writer, director, story or producer alone? <br /> <br /> In this case, they're all the same guy (!) who really needs to deal with, at least as it does with the worthless video balloon that he doesn't have the talent. I mean, this would be a reasonable excuse if it was a younger "production" for the first cinema class, but the "artist" referred to this track was twenty-six behind this failure. <br /> <br /> How did it ever get? Who has the right mind written about it? In addition, do not let the box cover the fool: not even something that is remotely similar to good sex scenes or its "good" exposure. <br /> <br /> The last two points: one second, when this "movie" had redeemed the value: the "talent" mentioned above gets rounded out by its lover. I'm cheered today! And I learned one thing from this "movie". There are times when something is so bad that it is really very funny. But not in any comical way; it's just sad humorous. Very sad humorous.
