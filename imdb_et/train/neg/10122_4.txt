Another early film about Alfred Hitchcock, which seems to have failed to fulfill his contractual obligations. Like Juno and Paycock, you can say that Hitchcock had little interest in this film. It has almost no style or craft. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young couple who come for money and go on a journey that proves their marriage test. Emil is given a new life with a good heart, a rich man who loves her, but decides to take the highway and stay with her husband. It may seem more plausible if Fred were not made completely sensitive, pompous to a peach who jumps as soon as possible to leave his wife with another woman. The couple comes together, but the movie lacks real reconciliation. The third thing goes in a completely different direction: the couple is left behind on an abandoned ship and rescued by an Asian fishing vessel. Joan Barry gives a very confusing idea as a faithful wife of an unfaithful husband. That's all you can say about it.
