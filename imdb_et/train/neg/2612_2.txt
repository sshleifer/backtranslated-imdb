The only reason I've seen 101 Dalmatians was his names as the original song and the Oscar costume. I have to admit that I was less impressed with this movie. In this order, Cruella DeVil (by the way Glen Close from this role very well) is released due to the good behavior of the hospital. She likes all the animals and locks all the fur. From that moment on, we are just waiting for the beginning of the crisis. Soon he will and will try to make the best fashion for the world, of course, for himself and his fine Dalmatian fur. In addition to Glen Close, I found that everything was pretty stupid, but the child's eyes were funny. It is fairly fair because its target market is, I expect, children under 12 years old. Quite good entertainment for kids and families but didn't do much for me. * out of stock *****
