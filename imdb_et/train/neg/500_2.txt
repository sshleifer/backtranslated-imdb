Bloodsucker leads the dance - which is a ridiculous title, it is so misleading. It is not surprising, however, that filmmakers are trying to mislead us, because it is one terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The story mainly involves understanding the murder in a distant castle. <br /> <br /> There's very little in this movie. And when something awakens the viewer from his stupor, it is always an involuntary comedy that is hopeless by the group offered by a hopeless group of artists. These guys are so bad that they show that the actors they play look like a group of corrective levels. It is really hard to determine how bad it is if you have this abysmal duplication. However, vocal artists cannot be blamed for the script. It's travesty. Unwantedly funny at best, pathetic. Generally speaking, the story is uneven. Women's characters are particularly idiotic; men are either horrible or annoying. <br /> <br /> The whole company smells of the audience's pure exploitation. It is far from what it promises, and even if the murders (eventually) begin to occur, they all appear on the screen. All we get is some half-blind interrupted shots. <br /> <br /> Some people have said this film is giallo. I cannot accept this opinion less. Anyone who enjoys Italian thrillers should give this film a wide range of excitement because it is far from exciting. This is basically a porn movie with a horrible angle. But this is not very erotic. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend it to anyone.
