The three stories that were not interconnected enough, "Inside Man" was a very nervous and inadequate attempt to be artistic and realistic. Though the film has moments, it started to look like a fast thriller that quickly lands for slow crawling, jumping fast between high and low, and barely barely rebuilding in 20 minutes. I give credit to Denzel Washington, he played his part very well with his full understanding of his human side, not just with the typical "super detective" answers. Clive Owen also did quite well with his duality, such as the "evil genius" and "criminal master" (both not retrospectively). Generally, each person created a large part of it. But when parts finally came together and everything was counted, there was no sudden "ah-ha!" or all. It all ended with very little energy, which started with a lot of lots, lots of questions, and as I said before, Spike Lee is not close to normal. I have to fully agree with the so-called professional critics ... this is not the movie they play.
