I think I watched this movie, but don't quote me because I can stay asleep while watching it because it wasn't exactly "grabbing my excitement and imagination." At least I know I looked at it enough to find out that I didn't see it soon. Or ever. <br /> <br /> Jeez, talking about lame ... Really flat. Completely flat. It would not even turn six years old. In principle, it had no dramatic effect. Zilch. Nada. Just hit the dreck. Comedy? It was supposed to be a comedy? Ya coulda fooled me-ee-ee ...! Now that foreigners would have been unsatisfied with carnivores like the Critters, we might have been human beings a little deeper than being cutesy ... as screaming and screaming and running for their lives that they didn't eat, so the story could be more exciting than drying the color. <br /> <br /> Don't bother looking at it. It's not worth the effort. You'll find something more interesting. Like drying the paint. Or sleep.
