Its original book was created in the 1950s, but it doesn't make TV series because most people follow the style of the 1930s. Ironically, the tube train near the pipe was a 1950s train that was painted on a 1930s train, so Underground also plays in this game. The hanging of Jarrow's March plot was weak, but in the 50's version there were students who started thinking about the world around me, so I think they are thinking about the poverty of the routes. All that Japp had to take care of for himself was too weak, but they had to spend some time. It would have made a proper half-hour show or could have filmed the movie and make it better. It is obvious that this episode is a victim of style.
