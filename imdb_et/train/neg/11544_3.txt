I was really looking forward to seeing it because I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a talented actor. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. Then it quickly jumps to the mainland, which they attack by a stranger group, and Dyer is beaten very badly when Anderson is raped. They then decide to revenge. Sounds good, right? Well, that's not. The story is boring and tracked, and certain things are really weird. I do not give any details, but things happen that I have no desire to see. I like to give doubt to all movies, and I really wanted it. It just didn't work. I give him three out of 10, mostly for the actors.
