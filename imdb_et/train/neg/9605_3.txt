This Italian 70's film is not even in class with dog soldiers, The Howling or even this terrible American werewolf in Paris, but ... it's fun to watch. I'm talking about watching a leading actress, a stunning blonde who is running on her birthday. We're talking about graphic, complete nudity ... it's obvious that he is a real blonde ... a bit of a bitch! The story is hoot, SFX is childish and the actor (mostly) stinks. The only redemption value of this film is all (and there is LOT) nudity and sexual scenes. Tame by HBO standards, but still fun to see when you Saturday night without a date. OK ... HERE IS A SPOILER ... NOT a werewolf (except the heroine (?) At the ancestral opening. The girl just imagines she is a werewolf ... in other words a clinical Lycanthrope.
