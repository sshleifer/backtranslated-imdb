The idea is that in the first ten minutes something interesting would happen to the audience. Late Night Shopping manages to avoid interest for much longer. When we reach the point, it is so monumentally moral that I thought I had to misunderstand it. But Sean is not talking. State Landlord who rented the same apartment to two people at the same time who worked in different shifts and did not realize they shared it. His friend asks, "What about the weekends?" Sean doesn't have enough explanation. Then Sean tells her about a similar problem that she is not sure that her girlfriend is still living at home when she works at night and she works during the day so they don't see each other. It has lasted three weeks. But his friend doesn't ask, "Yeah, but as I said before, what are the weekends? Then you need to see him. That doesn't make sense. What are you doing, Sean?" . <br /> <br /> We are seeing a check at Sea to see if soap and towels have been used. (In fact, he will spend the soap with him.) But how his girlfriend air conditioner and shampoo, sanpro and moisturizer, toothpaste and toothbrush. Let's go to the kitchen. What about food and drink? Are you missing? Is it purchased? Is there a shared bed in the bedroom or not? Is her clothing used and exchanged for clean? Is the laundry basket more complete? Is there a seat up or down in the toilet? I mean, good grief! <br /> <br /> And if it is all, Paul will organize the works early to see if his girlfriend is still living at home. Why doesn't he just call him? <br /> <br /> But it gets worse. In the last law, although no one spoke to Vincent where the rest of the group goes, they manage to find them. Lenny's interest in love and Sean's girlfriend seem to be the best friends and they'll find the group. There is not even the slightest effort to explain any of these extraordinarily unlikely coincidences. br /> <br /> I heard one interviewee and he promised "no weapons, no drugs, no corsets." I thought "big". But after half an hour of thedium I screamed on the screen: "I want weapons! I want drugs! I want corsets!" <br /> <br /> Sorting these problems would not have taken much, but the official website prides itself on not being a script editor. That's all you need to know.
