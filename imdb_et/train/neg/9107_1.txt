I was crazy that someone made this movie. I was still angry when I lost valuable minutes in my life to watch it. I could have been waxing and been more entertained. At least Cherri makes me laugh before it hurts. I was a little confused at first, but then I tried and realized what was going on. By that time the movie was halfway through and yes, I'm a procrastinator, but I always want to see things to the end. So I missed it and looked at it all. Not only are participants not as attractive as cruel, they are simply not convincing. I have seen my nephew gain more attention than the suspicion on the screen of this film. If you like a bad show with bad movies.
