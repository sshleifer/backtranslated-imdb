I saw this movie thinking that it would be one of those old B movies that are fun to watch. I was so wrong! This film was boring and it was obviously aimed at men who like looking at women in corpses. The story was so ridiculous and unlikely that he lost his interest completely. It seems to be the same genre as Ed Wood's films - at the bottom of the barrel.
