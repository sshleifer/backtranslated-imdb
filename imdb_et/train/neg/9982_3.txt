The story begins slowly and no fun is happening. The whole action is over, but you don't have to laugh because the movie is funny, but because the story is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The funniest part is when Harvey 'I'm not Paranoia' Keitel loses it and the judge starts the massacre. Oscars for this man!
