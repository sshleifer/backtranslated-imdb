The man brings his new wife to his home where his ex-wife died as a result of the accident. His new husband has just been released from the institution and is also very rich! Suddenly, he hears voices and sees the skull all over the place. Will he go crazy again or will the first woman be back from the dead? <br /> <br /> You probably thought it was over, so I'm not writing it out. I saw it several times on Saturday afternoon as a television set. Then I liked it, but I was young. Now I see that it's bad. It has been a terrible act, badly written, very dull (even in an hour) and has a large number of FIVE people (one is director)! However, it has something good. <br /> <br /> Music is a bit creepy, and the surroundings with a big empty house and pond are nicely in the atmosphere. There are also some frightening moments (I jumped slightly when he saw the first skull) and a somewhat effective end. All in all, this is certainly not a good movie ... but not a complete disaster. It has a small cult. I will also give it 2. <br /> <br /> Also try to avoid issuing this Elite DVD Drive (related to the "Giant Leeches attack"). It has a TERRIBLE shape with jumps and scratches throughout. It didn't even look bad on TV!
