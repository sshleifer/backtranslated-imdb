This movie is not like the 1954 version of Judy Garland and James Mason, and it's a shame, because I think the 1954 version is much better. I do not deny the talents of Barbra Streisand at all. She is a good actor and a brilliant singer. I do not know Kris Kristofferson's second work and therefore I cannot decide on it. But this film leaves much to be desired. It is slowly occupied, it has free nudity and an unpleasant language, and it can be very difficult to sit down. <br /> <br /> But I'm not a big fan of rock music. Judy Garland's version is better. See the 1976 film with Barbra and Kris and the judge himself.
