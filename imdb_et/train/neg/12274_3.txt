I usually do not say that the movie is not worth watching, but it is definitely an attenuating circumstance. The only real upside of this movie is Cornelia Sharpe, looking quite attractive, and the fact that this movie is really short. <br /> <br /> The plot in the movie is incredibly boring and goes almost anywhere in the movie. No characters are even far from interesting and there is no reason to care for anyone. I'm not sure why Sean Connery agreed to make this movie, but he should definitely have passed it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I saw this movie is when you are a fan of -hard Sean Connery and just want to see everything he's done. Save it last, though. <br /> <br /> Well, if, for a miracle, you see it despite my review (or some other review of this site), I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thank you for reading.
