I am always amazed at how different people are and how almost every film is extreme. People who think this is the best movie and people who think it is the worst. Stigmata wouldn't be the worst film I've ever seen, but it's there. First, the sound. Manufacturers spent more time on audio than editing. It was so sound when the soundtrack played and nobody talked, and when Patrica spoke with his monotonous voice, he could hardly hear. <br /> <br /> I usually like Patrica and Gaberial, but they were both in this movie. Patrical was basically 3 emotions. Quiet, big pain or really angry he has a stigma. The first one was predominant, the second was screaming, the third was raising the voice. It was loud, which differentiated between three and not emotion. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed a lot of deep meaning and the subtleties that everyone was talking about, or maybe I was disturbed by terrible filming and MTV-like style. When you watch a 3-minute video, you need a quick story and a quick story to shoot with a 2-hour movie. I don't see how she sees women falling over the baby and the kids. And no Pittsburgh will get it often !! <br /> <br /> I think maybe there would have been a real story that could be said, but the whole budget was spent on buying music and equipment slowly to sink, and letting the gorgous apartment that Mrs Arquett lived because they ended with a blow.
