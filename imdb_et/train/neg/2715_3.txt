The 1960s were a time of change and awakening for most people. Social upheavals and unrest were common when people talked about their views. Racial tensions, politics, the Vietnam War, sexual poverty and drug use were daily and daily news. This film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining film and to a large extent succeeded. <br /> <br /> This movie follows two families: one white, one black. In the first half of the film, the story is followed by each family on an equal footing with social and family struggle. Unfortunately, the other side of the film is almost devoted to the white family. Indeed, there are more signs in this family, and the story is mixed, but the same attention is not paid to the racial aspects of this century. <br /> <br /> Overall, it works well and historically, shots are blended with color and black and white original material to give the film a documentary feel. Film is a fictional work, but clips of well-known historical figures are used to set up the press. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one-sided.
