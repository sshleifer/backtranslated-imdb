This film is a rewriting of the 1978 Warren Beatty movie "Heaven Can Wait", but it is written in Mr Rock's style. The assumption remains the same: Lance Barton (Rock) has been taken before his lifetime has ended and deals with God's representative, Mr. King, to come back to earth as someone else. Like the Beatty movie; he chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a rich white man, all because he knows Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who happens to be in the Wellington House during the murder. The role of Mrs Wellington and her lover is suffering in this remake, and the idea of ​​making an outdated white multi-millionaire into a static black comic who just tries to make Sonot just doesn't work. At the same time, Rock was used to show Wellington, and then, when the real "white" Wellington was unlucky. Improvements could be made to the original Beatty plot - which in itself did not skilfully depict the idea of ​​a life-death - but they were certainly not found in "Down To Earth".
