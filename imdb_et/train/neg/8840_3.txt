Here is a great example of what not to do if you have a great idea. This is not a problem? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but there is no real content in the script and its execution. It should grab you from the start and then draw a little emotionally, interest you and invest in characters. This movie doesn't have what it takes to fly and continue, and that's the reason. First of all, you don't care about the characters because they aren't presented so people can associate with it, I mean it's not Superman or Mission Impossible here. They do not believe in how they act and communicate. Example: Jeffrey Combs chewing gum is gum, wrinkles, and looking intense all the time, there is no way to go here. I mean, what is it? He looks like he's in the toilet or something. I loved her again in the animator and the way she played an intense / neurotic, priceless medical genius was right for the money. But not to try to overcome it too hard to compensate for the intense and finite, but still neurotic way, it's not natural, I'm surprised that he didn't turn his jaw while filming. The film is essentially a life support, it is hardly a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that never came.
