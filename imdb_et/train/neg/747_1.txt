Finally, I thought someone was going to have H.G. Wells do classical justice, not another version that is in the wrong place or era, but one is firmly based on the book. Well, it certainly follows the book quite close and it is the only plus for this confusion. <br /> <br /> It's 180 min (yes 3 hours) long, the book is only about 150 pages long. <br /> <br /> If Timothy Hines had a nerve to come here and say, "If you can do something better ..." I would say "yes, I could" and I've never used a video camera and had no sort or drama school in my life. <br /> <br /> I paid good money to get the United States from the US to this mess, not the same mistake as me.
