It is curious that the two stars of Meet The People were a couple of movie stars who went into a new television environment and became even more progressive, both of whom went to the end of making things and enjoyed the small screen of the Olympics. However, Lucille Ball was not a big star to accompany television. For Dick Powell, he desperately wanted to make films like Meet The People and his career would have come to his next film. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason why Dick Powell made the film was a young player from MGM poured into a specialty number and he saw him at that time. His personal time with June at Allyson was much better than on the screen. Powell sees the crash bored and can't make any emotions at all. <br /> <br /> He was probably tired of making musicals with foolish plots he ran from Warner Brothers. The original show Meet The People was not a book show, it was a revue and it took place in 1940-41 in Broadway's 160 performances. When MGM bought it, they demolished everything except the title and the title song. The rest of the score was put together by different and diverse songwriters, no song is memorable. Strange to think of some source material is Burton Lane, E.Y. Harburg, Harold Arlen and Rodgers & Hart. These boys must be empty for the material. <br /> <br /> The piece is quieter than even the most musical propaganda games of the time. Powell is a writer named “Meet The People” and is a shipyard that wins the lottery date with the film star Lucille Ball. He's interested, he's interested, they're both interested, but the creative differences keep them naturally up to the finals. This is a movie in a brief summary. <br /> <br /> MGM gave Powell and Ball a good musical performance, which is the main reason for watching people. The big ensembles of Vaughn Monroe and Spike Jones are here and my film is highlighted by Bert Lahr, dressed in commodore suit, as Lou Costello was in the In The Navy's series of dreams. The song Heave Ho is written by Arlen and Harburg, who wrote to Lahr, The Wizard Of Oz. And as almost all people in the world have seen this movie, you have the idea that Heave Ho is like. <br /> <br /> The next film by Dick Powell was Murder My Sweet, where he finally made a musical supply. And Lucy should wait for the television before the world realized what she could really do.
