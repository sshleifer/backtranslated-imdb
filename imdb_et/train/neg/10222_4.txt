Apart from the excellent cinematography that is wonderful in the struggle of James Wong Howe, this film is a real stinker. <br /> <br /> This is the second film I've been leading by Alexander Korda in recent days. The first was Charles Laughton's "Rembrandt". It was so bad that I closed it. What I'm afraid is not much better. Flora Robson is as ugly as ever as Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps his performance as a virgin queen was good for the 1937 standards, but when compared to those of Helen Mirren, it is not a game. Robots tell Robson their lines. His battle message for English soldiers is so enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Even scary Laurence Olivier will not save this boredom. <br /> <br /> The future woman, Vivien Leigh, will have a supporting role here and she will not give anything here. I think Scarlett was 2 years later! <br /> <br /> It's a shame that history with the Spanish Armada is so boring in this movie.
