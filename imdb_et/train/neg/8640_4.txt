I watched this movie 3/4 and wondered why it got terrible comments here. It was quite easy to watch (at 3:00). It was a good casting - the role of Kevin Dillon's social battery attacker was very credible - he was both cordial and cool. The other main characters were not so bad. <br /> <br /> This is your typical stalker / temporary movie. The couple can't imagine they go to a fertility clinic for help. The sociopathic "genetic material" donor fixes to the recipients, and their typical stalker form invades their lives. <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the movie was pretty good. increasingly obsessed with raising your child and creating a perfect family with your mother. Of course, things don't work for him as he planned. Not a bad plot. <br /> <br /> But the last 15 minutes were just awful. I'm pretty tolerant of the movies (especially at 3:00 am) .. but I was just surprised how bad the end was. I'm not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I can't sit back (unless I finish). The only quality of editing was the role of Kevin Dillon - one of the best in the series. <br /> <br /> Try watching other channels before watching. But if there is nothing better then try .. =)
