0 * 's Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson. Director Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Based on video game manager Uwe Boll, who is trying to reactivate the game to the nail elbow. Instead, he makes one of the worst movies of MADE! Even if he gets small celebrities, such as Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, his film does not have the necessary foundations for the film to be good, such as a story, and the basic relativity in the dark and in the light. The film is bumped and Uwe Boll has no creative control. And not to mention the bad CGIs used to make monsters. Though they saw cool and the feeds were fine, it was small. Frankly, this is one of the worst films. My last rating 0/10.
