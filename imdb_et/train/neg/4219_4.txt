This is an amateur film filmed with a video film, not an "electrifying drama", as the DVD bed sheets wrongly praise. I've seen many better things for students. Most of the story opens with a taxi around Jakita. This movie could have been done with a single camcorder, but there are some sections where two cameras were used and the content came together later. Editing is extremely harsh. Final editing was probably done with two cameras, bouncing back and forth, not with the right editor. Maybe they also made a taxi editing? English subtitles were written by someone who does not speak English, eg "Where are you going now?" If you say that the quality of production is equal to Blair, Witch is generous. If you're not scared yet, this movie was an ambitious and creative endeavor with lots of cool and funky pictures of Jakarta.
