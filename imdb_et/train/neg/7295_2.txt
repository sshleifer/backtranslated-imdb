First of all, this is why I am going to give this movie instead of 1, because at least Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic performance to Lieutenant Columbo. He alone gets 10 stars to try to save it for an otherwise totally worthless attempt to make a movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, one commented on the poster that Andrew Stevens in this film gave "his career." For me, this stevens of Stevens had completely destroyed this film, and so I was all ready to scare off any kind of insult to the person who made the above comment. Then I wondered what else Stevens has done? So I checked and you know that this person was absolutely right. 17 years after this Columbo film has appeared, it seems that every 33 projects Stevens has been running since then have been completely stupid, so it is doubtful that anyone has even seen the rest of his career. <br /> <br /> If you like Columbo, check out the other 69 headlines before that. Do yourself a favor and save the last of the worst.
