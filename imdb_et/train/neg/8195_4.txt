Every Christmas Eve, I put my kids on another show, "It's a wonderful life." I also liked Bad Santa. So dig me. I admit it. I like cheesy, schmaltzy movies. I also like great, intelligent people, but as with so many things, the variety is good. What would be the Christmas season without an annual cinematic ka-ching Christmas fight in all its shades, from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus doesn't forget to forget Bedford insects, but I don't think Christmas should be an icon. "Fred" is a totally OK holiday movie with enough humor for adults and enough charm for kids. My wife and I laughed a lot, even though most humor was obvious and Vince was just Vince. Paul Giamatti was a Santa Claus who helped a lot. There is no big flick and will likely become a must-see for someone's annual Christmas traditions. But my wife and daughter and I liked what it was, holiday schmaltz with a little spice. There's nothing wrong with that.
