A shaky hand-held camera was used, which was expected to give the film a documentary look, but the effect was so exaggerated that I just started to look at the motion sickness. Someone with cerebral paralysis seems to have kept the camera (there is no damage to people suffering from CP infection, but I don't think you should do a lot of work as an operator!) The work of the camera was so bad and so disturbing that we kept it smile and gave up after 10 minutes of torture. I looked back some time later (it was on television) and it wasn't better. I recommend giving it one flaw, unless you need to get rid of the bad sushi you have eaten!
