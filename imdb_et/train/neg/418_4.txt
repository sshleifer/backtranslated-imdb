One might wish that an idea as good as an "invisible person" would work better and be treated more carefully in the era of fantastic special effects, but that is not the case. The story, the characters, and finally the last 20-minute film is about as fresh as the mad scientist of the early 50s. There are some great moments, mainly due to the amazing special effect and the invisible person standing on the streets. But unfortunately, we will soon be back in the narrow prison of an underground laboratory, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable, but also schematic. <br /> <br /> Old movies or TV shows over the last 10 years, and some of them have their own charm. But for each film, it is clearer and clearer that the idea of ​​putting the classics under the zealous madman like Verhoeven (who owns his moments) is very bad. It is obvious that money is the key issue here: the time and energy put into the script is far from close, and as a result, the "hollow man" seriously damages clichés, accidents, predictability and lack of depth. <br /> <br /> But one thing that impressed me with special effects was swearing. In making such a film, modern producers want children to see them. Therefore, language (and sometimes violence and sex) is very softened. When the whole world blows, the good guys go "Oh darn!" and "Oh my God". Thanks to this hypocrisy, the "Hollow Man" is grateful and the characters are free to say what is most natural to them. I'm not saying that the most natural response to something wrong has been swear - but it makes it more credible if someone really swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.
