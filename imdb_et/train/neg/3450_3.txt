Somebody here compared the film with High Noon in some ways. Now it's a real stretch! I'm a big Sinatra fan, including some of his actors, but perhaps the only person who could have played this part was Don Knotts. First of all, as someone pointed out, Sinatral is not just a building for a Western bad guy. He is too little in his life in this life. Maybe he was about as high as Audie Murphy, but Murphy had a pretty strong building. Sinatra comes like a big talking little boy whom no one should take seriously. <br /> <br /> The story is intrusive and not really plausible. I don't want to spoil it, but I think the end and how the townspeople don't react in this story. The other thing, these people are allowing themselves to be completely licked into some "bad thing." It's just a small town, so I'm not attracted to it and don't understand why people would allow themselves to dominate in this way. <br /> <br /> The story includes "love interest" and when I followed it right, he was upset when the protagonist refused to recognize who he was, so that another bad guy wouldn't kill him. Now you have true love. 'Get up for yourself! Tell him your name to kill you! 'LOL. Stop, you kill me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the main premise of the movie is not good enough and no matter how they tried it, there was no logical way to do it apart from the trash. Do you want to know why it is not on video and what is not shown on TV? Critics showed it in 1956 and they were right - this movie is pretty bad. I would almost predict that Sinatra paid six things deep as far as possible. <br /> <br /> Do you want to see a good west where the city is against a bad boy? Try tensioning on a board game or Gunpoint - two really good Westerners who have this theme. Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko. Frank, you were the greatest singer ever, but you didn't belong to this movie.
