I should have thought that no movie with a Poltergeist lady is good. In fact, it starts well, but during the first scene of the murder you will find out that the movie you are watching is inside the movie. When watching this movie, there are people in the theater in the movie. One girl in the pub is so annoying that I have turned around and strangled her. A bit strange but far from good.
