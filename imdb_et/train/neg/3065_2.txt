This film represents the times when it was made as much as the original, I think. What's really sad is that at a deeper level the title "Vanishing Point" is original, so ironic. I am sure this was not the case, but the original film was filmed in 1970 and appeared in 1971. "VANISHING POINT" REAL was the end of the era, which ended pretty much in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> In this reprocessing, all the countercultural elements have been removed and have become more computers, trying to reach a wider audience, probably. "Sanitized for Your Protection" <br /> <br /> Adding American Indian scenes was free and the idea of ​​"noble goal" was subtraction by subtraction. I'm glad I looked at it, but it made me value the original. The original is a cult classic and golden. This remake is terrible.
