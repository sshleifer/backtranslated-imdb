You believe in God or not. You believe in Jesus or not. You believe He is the Son of God or not. The choice is yours to decide. <br /> <br /> Director Denys Arcand has really done everything he could to bring Jesus back to a mere historical figure, a social worker, a son of two, a son of God. Spirit and Mary, who opened us again. Encouraging the Big Bang, the world comes from evolution instead of seeing the beauty of creation. The film depicts a theologian who brings some "modern findings" to the actor who plays Jesus in Passion Play, who happily adds them to his game. <br /> <br /> Drawn a priest who leads the sanctuary where there is a passionate game. A sexual relationship with a single Passion Play female player in Montreal instead of showing her love for God through Celibat. More often than not, there is a clearly visible exhaustion of the director's church. <br /> <br /> The director has tried to make a parallel between the life of Jesus and the life of an actor in Passion Play. This is a marvelous experiment, but depicting the resurrection of the bodies of the Passion Play actor in other organs means how the director thinks about Jesus. <br /> <br /> My opinion is not important, God's opinion is, but I would not stand in the footsteps of the director and actors in front of the throne of Jesus.
