Well, there's no real plot to talk about, it's just a pretext to show some extreme violence and free sex scenes (which can sometimes be fun, but that's not the case). What else to say ...? This action is inventive and has a cool scene where two characters fall from the skyscraper (one that has to be several miles high), but "Kite" is generally not recommended. Check it out if you like, but you won't miss much if you miss it ...
