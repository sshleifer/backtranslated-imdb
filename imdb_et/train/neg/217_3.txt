It is a film based on a somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism. That's it. Dialogues are pathetic and the sensuality of "sexual scenes" is absolutely missing. high school students, but the topic is for adults. This is an uneven and low film. It could have been better if it had a story and more drama. Ah, and one more thing: why are internal monologues used so much? It seems so cheap. All together in embarrassing movie Romanian cinema as well as mature audiences who are trying to watch it. I know the tools are scarce, but it is not always an excuse to flop a movie as it is. And please start using good actors in your movies and stop recycling your music (Tudor Chirila) - they can't act!
