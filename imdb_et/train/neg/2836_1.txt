I saw this obvious shock on the video shelf. And before I got my first video jacket, I thought I was baptizing this little pearl and it's a bad cinema that's the best! <br /> <br /> The dialog is accidentally fun. And it includes a suitcase with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is inexplicable in this. Like Christopher Walken, he wanted to celebrate his bad films in later years. This movie is Mr. Quinn's Country Bears. <br /> <br /> Here are the features like: "Close and let me FIGHT !!!" <br /> <br /> And "You talk a lot sh_it!" <br /> <br /> And priceless return: "Unfortunately, this is sh_it, harsh angry sh_it!" <br /> <br /> You will win the fight because Bo will make SOMMERSAULT over the billiard table! And if you're a nice kung fu kick when you get up the roll! Chop socky action and T and A excitement !!! <br /> <br /> What movie fan could ask for more? Oh, and if Mr Quinn's character makes suicide and returns to the ghost Bo as a ghost, he asks why he died himself, and then deals with his exhausting illness? He says, "Real men don't eat quiche." <br /> <br /> Uh, yeah, yeah. When Bo was a smart cookie, he called the exorcist right away and away!
