I had never heard of it before he got up on Cable TV. This is a very typical 50's sci-fi: sober, frustrating and not a bit paranoid! Despite the romantic couple's equally typical involvement, the film is quite a documentary style - it is probably a cheap way to leave a lot of exposure to narration and excuse to add as many frames as humanly possible for what is obviously an extremely low budget venture! Though the film's unanimous approach is not intriguing in itself (later the apostal-s-via-renegade rocket was used to a much greater extent for both DR STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964]), this topic results in a lot of involuntary laughter - especially in scenes related to direct childbirth and the power of marital juvenile delinquency!
