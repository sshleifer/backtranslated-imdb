The painstakingly protracted, maudlin and predictable drama, my twenty-fifth Sidney Lumet film, Garbo talks, comes for a long time in the low quality of our search. <br /> <br /> The movie documented a hard-working young man named Gilbert (Ron Silver), the son of Estelle Rolle (Anne Bancroft), an eccentric, feisty, and above all an obsessive fan of Greta Garbo. When Estelle suffers from a brain tumor, her son decides to go for her own obsessive search: follow Greta Garb and bring her to her mother. <br /> <br /> Anne Bancroft is in full swing-landscape aunt-mame mode here, a kind of feisty-what the movie loves, where she kisses people and stands for her ideals and gets her prisoner all the time. He stands next to the film as an obvious artificial construction, and each of his scenes is yuk-yuk lame; every note that is wrong. The remaining characters are equally one-dimensional but tremendously less interesting. Ron Silver is flat, as it may be, and his love triangle is like a telegraph like anything else in the movie: He's got to know the affluent Lisa Rolfe (Carrie Fisher), but he captures a pair of companion Jane Mortimer (Catherine Hicks) and I called each scene for three scene before they happened. <br /> <br /> This is another problem. One-dimensional characters can survive if they are placed in an intriguing and exciting story, but here is nothing. The tempo of the film is glacier, powerful and foreign material that absolutely does nothing, and when the film begins to follow a linear plot, it is both plodding and uninteresting. There are so many guest stars, such as Harvey Fierstein (New Yorker gay) (imagine that this is another extremely irrelevant scene). <br /> <br /> The movie's late attempt to make a semi-decent statement about the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives, but by that time no characters are real people, and the film was boring for me, so it works too little, too late. The film is my twenty-fifth Lumet-production film that makes him an easy-to-view director, but outside a few egregious misses (A Stranger among us, no one?), He hasn't made any deeply interesting depths for Garbo's talks. <br /> <br /> {Rating: 4.5 / 10 (C / C-) / # 21 (out of 24) 1984 / # 23 25 Snow movie}
