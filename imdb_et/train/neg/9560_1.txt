Thank God I watched it in a friend's place and didn't pay for it. The plot is terribly transparent and the whole movie looks like a TV show episode. If you have knowledge of computers or electronics, be careful. You feel like the film is offensive to your intelligence. <br /> <br /> The actress also turned a lot of music VJ Amanda Walsh shows the worst behavior I've ever seen except porn. He's happy that Matt Lanter is actually decent. He's the one who wears the movie. <br /> <br /> I hate to waste this movie despite almost two hours of my life! It is a shame that they had to call it a sequel because I was a fan of the original, which was actually pretty good.
