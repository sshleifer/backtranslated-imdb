POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Spy Who Shagged We are a highly overpriced and over-jumped sequel. An international mystery man came out of the blue. It was a lone star, some of whom had heard. But it was amazingly original, it had complicated humor and plenty of humor, always kept good taste and was great. Spy Who Shagged We were much more commercially advertised and mortgaged. <br /> <br /> OK, I admit that for the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was very funny, but it is only after it is viewed or three times that you see all the mistakes. Action was OK, but Heather Graham can't act. His performance didn't seem very convincing and he wasn't as good as Liz Hurley was in the first. Those symbols that flourished in the first, (Scott Evil, Number 2, etc.) are thrown into the background, hear and do not get many separate scenes. The movie is simply overcome with cameos. <br /> <br /> In particular, I hated how they completely ignored some of IMOM's scenes. When they first killed Vanessa and sat Basil, he knew he was always fembo. What was that? They killed the first number 2. And now they bring them back without explanation. It should be spyware, I don't think any characters will even hold a gun in the movie. It goes just beyond the track and beyond. <br /> <br /> New characters are highly undesirable. The whole Mini-Me jokes about my size jokes can very quickly. Fat Bastard is just a flat excuse for gross external humor. There are about two or three good jokes in total. The rest are tasteless or IMOM rehashed. <br /> <br /> If this were the first movie in the series, I would probably be easier. However, the series started with a dry spirit and then fell below the gross impulse. So I say I watch this movie only if you haven't seen your predecessor because this spy who broke me is one of the most disappointing.
