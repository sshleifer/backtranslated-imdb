Creature Unknown is the right word for this movie. Or perhaps it should be called an unknown film. This movie is a piece from the beginning. It's really a stupid "plot", really pathetic "acting" and so "special effects". <br /> <br /> Some thirty-year-old "post-teens" are trapped in an endless wild forest with a crazy, reptile, rubber suit. What you get with this movie is a lot of talking and little action. You have girls who walk through the woods and then you have boys (with heavy mascara) who walks through the woods. The whole thing is so boring! <br /> <br /> The creature is rarely seen in most movies. If it is shown that the image is distorted to conceal the fact that it is a man from a rubber suit, and the movement shows that it is a suit, then also the cause of blurring and distortion of the picture. <br /> <br /> This is NOT a good movie because the word and those who praise it are probably the people who were drawn into the street in a "really" stunning movie! Remember it!
