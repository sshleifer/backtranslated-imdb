I saw this movie a few days ago and jumped in very frightening parts. I have to admit that I found it pretty decent ... until I started thinking about what the characters are saying. Logical Problems: <br /> <br /> 1. His boy who seems to be a good guy is not killed in killing. Don't you think he could have killed at least a killer? <br /> <br /> 2. When the note is made, the gym instructor "Add SOOOO is in love", I screamed almost on the screen. If your best friend's family has been killed by a teacher who loved him, then you don't make such comments if you have a half heart. <br /> <br /> 3. As soon as Nash asks the uncle how many exits from the house, and his uncle is trying to get there, it wouldn't be a wise thing for Donna, the boy, the aunt and the uncle to get in and drive far, far, then feed the house with HRT and police so that the killer could not get out of the way? <br /> <br /> I could go on. And forward. And forward. Basically, the plot was decent, the characters were not sufficiently profiled, you were killed to kill and emotionally felt, and there were too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> HOW? <br /> <br /> This movie may be useful for teenagers or young couples who are just looking for a fun evening. If you don't think all the goats are, it's a mediocre film.
