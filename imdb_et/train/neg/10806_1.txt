If you're a fan of really bad movies, and you think it's funny, then you get a great actor from Shaqi. First of all, professional players are hardly allowed to work in movies. Shaq was supposed to be the worst actor I've ever seen with Dennis Rodman, who also made some bad films. In some way, this film is also bad for a bad child. I'd give it to zero, but it's impossible.
