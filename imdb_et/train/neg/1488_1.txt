I had to sign up for IMDb to just comment on how terrible this movie is ... my cats and strings are better than this. Not the worst thing I've ever seen, but if you destroy almost all of the movie in 5 minutes, it leaves a little desire. There were no "frightening" moments in the movie, except when they watched the television "Halloween". All around, it seems that it could have been a good story, running a credit and saying that Chasey Lain was somewhat unprofitable because I didn't know her right away and her scene was already over, I said, "Oh yes, she's there". I'm so glad I saw it in the hotel and didn't pay for it if I was real, if I had paid a penny to see it. I usually like to redeem in a movie or at least find a redemption factor, but that's an exception. It's so bad that it's not so amusing so good-it's-bad .... it's just bad.
