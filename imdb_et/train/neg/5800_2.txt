As a fan of horror, I try to look at all the important innovations of this genre, especially those of my home theater products. And I can say that "fear power" (or "Vedma" as the Russian title) is one of their weakest films. First of all, it can't even scare a little boy, this pace so slowly and predictably that there's no place for a real horror. To be honest, it is bad at all points: from a funny plot (I don't know why Russian producers / directors decided to turn the classic story of Ukrainian sorcery into a flat and ridiculous thriller of modern-day America. The previous reviewer does not burn a little) and the work of the terrible and cheesy actors. All actors, including the leading Valery Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova, who are quite famous in Russia, look like wooden dolls or something, and I think they didn't even bother playing at all, but spoke their English without any expression. And finally, I don't really understand why they filmed this movie in English with Russian actors? I think it was their wrong procedure. At least they could lead the leading parts of some American or English actors to make them more convincing. The same can be said of the "backgrounds of small American cities" that came to Estonia and look. The only positive moment I found in "light of fear" is the visual effects. They are not excellent for Russian film, but rather good. And music is OK, at least it doesn't irritate me. That's why I give him two stars. In general, if you want to see a good horror movie? Don't waste your time and money on this boring flick. And if you are looking for something that claims to be a Russian horror, I suggest you find "Viy or Evil Spirit". It's really a great movie based on the same novel as "Power of Terror", but much better.
