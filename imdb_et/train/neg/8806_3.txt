How was this "Be There" ripoff ever so loved? People say this is a proof that a decent, honest person can be successful despite the lack of intelligence. They're wrong. The film proves that happiness is everything: I hope your friend will invest all his money in Apple and not Atari; I hope your shrimp boat is the only one at sea when the storm breaks; I hope you will not die of shock if you are lucky enough to be in the butt and not behind; I hope you don't get AIDS from your wife. This film is also politically reactive - everyone who fights against a social convention loses their feet, makes drugs, beat their girlfriends, or dies young. In addition, the product placement of this film (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is shameless. An emotionally manipulative film that is very, very empty.
