I really love the sixties sexy acts and sci-fi movies and because they had an actor. They found the sexiest women in these movies and it doesn't matter if they could act (remember "Candy"?). The disappointment of this film was that it was not nostalgic enough. Here is the story of the European science fiction film "Dragonfly" and the director is fired. That's how manufacturers decide to let young hard-core filmmakers (Jeremy Davies) finish the picture. They are one real beautiful woman in the movie who plays the dragon, but she's hardly in it. The film is written and directed by Roman Coppola, who uses some of his father's early days and puts it in the script. I want the film to be a respect for these early films. They may have many actors. In this film, there is one actor who was popular in the sixties and its John Phillip Law (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell also appear. I think I have to wait for the director's unexpected respect for the sixties films. If anyone reads it, make it as sexy as possible! I will be waiting!
