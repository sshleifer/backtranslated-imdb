I didn't know anything about this movie until I was convinced that a friend who had heard it was a "non-stop epic battle scene from start to finish" saw it. It would not have been beyond the truth. It was one of the most boring, ill-written, amateur-led, terribly-acting movies I've ever failed to put on my eyes. I put it down there, which I think is the slowest film ... Battlefield Earth. There is basically no story, it is hard to believe that the makers of this film thought that this cheese soap opera was taken seriously as a real historical fact. It also includes some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard ... like this little pearl ... Guy tells the girl, "You smell like a month." The girl replies, "What is the smell of the moon?" OMG! You are kidding! The scene where the boy was pulled and quarted laughed at the audience because it seemed so ridiculously cheap and the hanging man's FX sound reminded me that someone was making a sound by mouth. If it plays in a theater near you, avoid it at all costs. This movie is so bad that I made a decision in about 45 minutes so I needed my sleep ... and I did. Awful.
