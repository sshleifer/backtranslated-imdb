Since this picture has been classified as "pure entertainment" and there are already many comments on it, I would like to address this important issue of humor abuse. We see Marlon Wayans playing a joke in this movie. Certainly, as long as he is involved in painful work, he has always acted by a small man - the actor can change his usual outfit, but can hardly change his physical appearance - and the latter may be useful if necessary. But far from what I was expecting, I saw a very masking picture pretending to expose the various aspects of childhood wrongly to a forty-year-old offender. And with a ridiculous happy ending. What's the point? Many elements blend, some of which are violence, sex and criminal activities, including a poorly prepared story and some inadequacy: where is Vanessa, when her house's peace is violated and her husband's life continues? In addition, the diamond is even bigger than the world's No. 1 Cullinan! But the worst aspect is the constant attempt to make a small man a superman, showing his physical weaknesses. And they call it humor. The diamond is valuable, hard and fragile; it cannot be cut with any other material but only conquer the hot blood of a male goat. So it is no longer a diamond but a debris.
