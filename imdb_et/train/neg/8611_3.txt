When Rodney Dangerfield is on the roll, he's fun. In my 5 women she is not on the roll. The timing of the single liner is off, but they are the best for the movie. The five women who play women do not add one whole actor between them. The plot is very weak. Even the assumption is pretty weak; there are some jokes that concern several women, but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie. Most of the film could play the same way if Rodney's character had only one woman, so the premise seems to be an old man's fantasy rather than the main part of comedy. Another old man's fantasy: we should accept that Rodney's character is a sporty skier. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller seems to be calling his role just to make a friend's favor and the rest of the name participants just have to work desperately. <br /> <br /> Strange political correctness later in the film does nothing for the movie. For those who love their movies politically correctly, first of all, there is still humor outside the computer, and seemingly excuses for it still can't get points. For those who don't see the movie in the cave of political correctness, PC add-ons are just annoying cuts. There are some funny jokes and bedroom-related scenes would have made shocking television 40 years ago, but that's it. Maybe it was topless men (funny). The DVD has interviews where most members see the depth and importance of this film and their roles. I was wondering if they were serious or joking. They seem serious, but I thought they were kidding! There is also a disclaimer of responsibility, which suggests that since the film never mentions Mormons or the Latter-day Saints, it is not about them. Don't forget that the film has a polygonal religion in Utah and refers to Brigham Young. <br /> <br /> In short, My 5 Wives was disappointing. I was hoping for a roll on Rodney, but the best thing I want to say about the movie is that Rodney looked pretty good to a man who forced 80 at that time.
