Now I've seen a lot of bad movies. I like bad movies. Particularly bad movies. I've seen (and enjoyed) all the films by Jean-Claude Van Damme, including where he is his clone, both where he plays twins, and all three where he is a cyber. I actually own it where he plays a fashion designer and fights in a truck that is full of durians. (Hey, if nothing else, he has a big ass and you can almost always see it. You can even pause and zoom with a DVD!) That's why you can trust me when I say this movie is so bad, Plan 9 looks like Kane. <br /> <br /> Everything about Snake Eater is bad. The plot is bad. The script is bad. Sets are bad. The struggles are bad. Tricks are bad. FX is bad. The actor is impressively bad, from time to time flexible, apparently showing the worst performance of every so-called actor, including Lorenzo Lamas, and it really is something to say. And I would be ready to make sure all the people involved in this movie are in bed, boot. Especially Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> <br /> It's unintentionally funny, so it's not a complete loss. However, I recommend that you watch this movie only if you are a congenital idiot or a stony stone. I could sit by myself because I need to look at something to keep me from rinsing my cat's urine. <br /> <br /> It didn't help much, but it was better than nothing. One point for Ron Palillo's home as a gay arson.
