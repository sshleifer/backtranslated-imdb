An unpleasant Eva Longoria dies on her wedding day when an angelic (without wings) ice sculpture falls on her on the back of a truck and kills her. He then tries to connect his former boyfriend with his new girlfriend, the psychic who sees him. <br /> <br /> An obviously unique film would not be badly similar in clich√©s except that the character of Longoria is angry and uncomfortable, letting her all out of the movie's fun. It's like cleaning the ears with sandpaper. To be honest, there is no problem with Longoria, nor with anyone else cast or team members, its godly terrible script that sinks in the process. Its just really stupid.
