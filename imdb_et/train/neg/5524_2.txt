I didn't want this movie for several reasons. During the first ten minutes of the movie, I grew very disappointed and concluded that if this film saved itself at least for me, it had to pull itself out of the big hole it had dug. Unfortunately, this did not happen. The two drawings of the film were for me by Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I don't know enough that Lindsey Lohan's work is interested in what she brings to the film. Later I felt disappointed in all three of them, although there were moments in all of their performances. I imagine finding each of these "moments" was a very difficult task for everyone, given the amazing lack of character development and open dialogue. Although the plot is interesting, the whole film is so badly written, directed and edited that someone will act as an actor and break it. I think the disrespectful way it dealt with sexual abuse and the tricky and offensive view of the small town in America was two of the main reasons why this film failed to capture its brand. As one reviewer has pointed out and I agree, it is almost impossible to market the film because of its form. I suspect, or at least hope, that (for the actor) there are some real gems on the floor of the cutting room. We are sad, but if it is true, the actors in this field can comfort and feel somewhat good to give their flant their talents and time. Oh yeah, and one more thing ... I wanted to see an American movie once that contained sadly disappearing but wonderfully bucolic settings, like what's in this movie, where the main characters were not inadequate and / or disrespectful of the trash. land side with pop cans, broken CDs and other such trash!
