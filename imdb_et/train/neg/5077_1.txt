The post-deleted post from another IMDb user noted that anyone who could see "Medusa Touch" should be warned of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 in NYC. But I hope that anyone who reads it will weigh this warning. Despite the interesting pedigree (produced by "Harper" and "The Long Goodbye" by producer Elliott Kastner; co-producer Arnon Milchan compiled the "Oscar" LA Confidential "and the screenwriter John Briley won the Oscar for" Gandhi ") and international cast, I found" The Medusa Touch " to be a heavy hand, inadvertent laughing. It was poorly managed, terribly written and behaved in confusion. He tried to take advantage of the genre of 70s telinetic thrillers. The movie fails on many lists. Please note "Carrie" and the underrated "The Fury" (both directed by Brian DePalma). They were two fun and exciting thrillers dealing with the same subject.
