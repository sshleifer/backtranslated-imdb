Marilyn Miller made only three films before his premature death - a wonderful SALLY (1929), a comedy for his LOVE LOVE (1931) and this gap - SUNNY (1930). It is quite poor both early and as a music test - although it has four dance numbers, it sings only two songs (WHO and ONE MAN ALONE). The rest of the score, including the spritely title setup, is jetized, even though we hear the latest scores. Miller sees overweight and amateur here - no star quality at all. Even his dance is clever. The film is very poorly written, the stock is full of old and vague jokes and stupid situations. If you are interested in Miller as a performer, check it out, but for general entertainment.
