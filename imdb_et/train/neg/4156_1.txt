Yes, this movie is bad. What's even worse is that it does not take any advantage of its title! In the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other or twice. In addition, we are never sure whether the film's ultimate character is the ultimate vampire. It can be said that they tried to "tint" it or make it "realistic", but just ends up boring. More than half of this movie is in the car. Scenes elsewhere are not great either. There is also no clear antagonist, and finally you have no idea what happened to the movie in the last 30 minutes. However, I say that for a film with a low output, the soundtrack was surprisingly relevant and instrumental (both according to original scores and samples taken elsewhere). <br /> <br /> I'm all for independent movies, but it doesn't look like it was for the public (if any). <br /> <br /> "worse than a peacekeeper killer."
