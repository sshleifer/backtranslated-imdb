"The Hazing" is one of the films I always wanted to see in the illustrated cover image on IMDb. Yes, it's so low! I don't care if ten million people call this crap movie, the poster looks fantastic, so I think I just have to look at it? Now, "The Hazing" can be somewhat described as his alternative title: Curious! The poster and title make it a real horror film set on campus and dealing with evil initiation rituals, but this film is actually more between comedy and thriller. First of all, the title of the old VHS box, which I watched, is something very wrong. He says: He had good classes, a good girl and good friends? as long as they threaten him. "This is not the case, in fact, Mr. Gilbert Lewis is a recognized campus at a recognized university campus. still on the hair in this film.) Both sides turn to the prestigious "Delts" brotherhood, but during a threat test, where they have to descend into a mountain dressed in their regular white panties? , Barney froze to death, together they planned to keep the body frozen for five days and then claim that he did not. Innovative, but the Professional here is a mistake that filling would have been much better pretty and too serious for a comedy film, even black, but on the other hand, there is no proper attempt to create a break or excitement. The soundtrack is cheerful and full of light stories, but it's not nearly enough to make this movie comedy. Approximately one hour to the film, there is also a plot of steam and an idea, and the creators have no better alternative to filling the emptiness with romantic Lewis and girlfriends from outside the city who travel through the country. I didn't like the last twist because it is quite unlikely and because it has been done several times before and after (though after). "The Hazing" is not a complete waste of time, but I am glad that I found an ex-rental tape in my friend's house instead of spending money on a recently released DVD.
