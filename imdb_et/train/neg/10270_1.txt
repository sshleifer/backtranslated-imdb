"American Nightmare" is, in my opinion, officially related to "It's Pat!" ALL TIMES FOR MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Seven friends (strangely similar to the "Friends" K-Mart version) gather in the cafe to listen to American Nightmare, the pirate radio. It is managed by a man with a beard. This is the most exciting aspect of his exhibition. <br /> <br /> Chandler, Monica, Joey and ... oo wait, I mean, Wayne, Jessie and the rest of the bad one liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears with a bearded DJ. Not listening to them, listening to the crazy sister / serum killer ... <br /> <br /> The crazy sister continues to torture Ross and Rachel and ... wait, sorry again ... making their fears alive. These fears include stunning such as "voodoo" and old ladies with dentures. <br /> <br /> No. Really. <br /> <br /> This film was in some ways rotten. Crazy Nurse killing spree has no motivation, nothing to make the viewer "jump", end blows and - again - voodoo? <br /> <br /> If you have no respect for your loved ones, rent "American Nightmare" with them. <br /> <br /> If you care about your loved ones - even a little bit - go to your local Blockbuster, rent all the copies of "American Nightmare" and hide them in your freezer.
