This movie shouldn't be viewed because it was supposed to be a flop. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to do this from the classic Bollywood movie "Sholay", but after solving the problems of the original artists, the project decided to go ahead and ... I think I will leave all the good parts of the film (actors, script, songs, music, comedy, action, etc.) and shoot the movie just because it already happens to the crew. Waste of money, waste of time. After films like Rangeela, Satya and Company, he made us with Coppola (godfather); What did you mean by RGV? Anyway, the story is, though it's hard to follow, almost like an old fool. Ajay Devgan plays Heerot (Beeru, sholay) and Ajay, a new boy who plays Ajay (Jay, sholay). Both "bad but funny" friends will help the police first grasp. Later in the movie, now the retired policeman hires them for personal security and defended the most wanted Bubban, played by Amitabh Bachan. If you haven't watched Bollywood movies, the good guys will eventually win. Then I just saved you three valuable hours of your life!
