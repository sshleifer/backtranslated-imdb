It's the biggest lamo I ever watched. It is exceptionally boring that I would rather have been sitting through a creativity seminar than I would have seen if I knew it was as boring as it was. Not even 40 seconds of hot chicks in bikini, which are big, won't let it down to 1. <br /> <br /> The reviews of this movie, claiming to be "unintentionally funny", are absurd and simply WRONG. One thing is not funny about this movie. they spend the first 50 minutes so they walk through the forests, talking about things that you don't understand or care about, and it's the same flat as people begin to die because you don't even know who the people are because they are so UNINTERESTING. Honestly, I didn't see it to the end, but it should say something terrible. MOVIE EVER. <br /> <br /> Immediately after pulling this slag out of my DVD player, I began to scrape it against the cement in front of my house because I didn't want other customer customers to have fallen on the same mistake to rent this movie. Then Zach tried his pants. Thank you for your time.
