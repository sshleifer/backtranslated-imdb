This is an OK movie, but there is no real depth of emotional or story telling. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real events, and it limits the scope of activity to almost nonexistence, and there is no real relationship. <br /> <br /> Washington is believed to be in the lead but is walking through it, there is no scope to glue him or the supporting mold. <br /> <br /> The story just falls into a small apartment, even if it has never heard of the title, the end result was obvious, but unlike other films from such injustices it has no emotional effect. Despite his well-being, it has been tried. <br /> <br /> Trying to inject some emotion using the boy who worships Carter in the hero, but it seems to be forced. .
