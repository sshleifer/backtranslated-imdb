This is one of those films that are more interesting to look at from an academic perspective than entertainment. I'll make my judgments on a movie or entertain, so I'll give it to 4. If I rate it as an academic movie, I'll get it. are elements of sound effect and reality. It is meant to convey thoughtless memory and mind fragmentation and it is interesting in these aspects. <br /> <br /> However, the film has many nasty elements that I couldn't find everything that was fun. They are mostly just disturbing. It also has very interesting shapes and some interesting concepts, but some characteristic relationships (especially between mother and son) are quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> This movie is either for your benefit or it is not. For me, it was interesting from an academic point of view, but it was not good to look at, and I probably won't go back a second time. <br /> <br /> 4/10 if you are looking for entertainment. 10/10 from an academic point of view.
