I had some time to kill before watching football, that I saw this movie on the sci-fi channel and literally after I watched it, I thought I had developed my version of the spiritual walking path of Bata when my consciousness was beaten terribly by a movie that hanged in the mummy series and Jurassic Park. It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were highlighting the film and then it went so sad that the last drop in the stock market seemed like a hiccup. The action was so bad that I hoped one and all would be buried at the end. For a long time, Casper Van Dien led me to Steven Seagal's high caliber "On Deadly Ground" because reading his line was so clean that Woody Woodpecker thought he'd sit down in the evening. I also noticed that his emotional range was so limited that I had the impression that my kitten was eating popcorn. The direction was so sad, I looked back at my brothers' 3rd grade game phase, which had more pace and better vision, and the fact that this film seems to have been put together by the above-mentioned movie franchise thoughts, which can't even be thought of as respect. The FX movie was so bad that I thought the director and the producers were very friendly because they recreated the cheap special effects of the Z-category horror of last year. What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis did in such films is not on me and they should look into litigation against their representatives to misrepresent the film with it. My warning to one and all is watching this movie at your own risk, as this movie may diminish due to longer viewing of your IQ. In a side view, I noticed that IMDb says that sometimes wages of movies are published. I was wondering if they were doing so that the actors would have to pay back the bad performances of these films. Beware and avoid being safe at all costs.
