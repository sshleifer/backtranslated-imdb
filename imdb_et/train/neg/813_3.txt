The biggest thing that hurts me is that they say Zues takes DUTCH commands. But he speaks German to him. These two speak completely different, as he says "well he takes French commandments" and starts speaking Spanish. <br /> <br /> James Belushi feels more like a comedy actor, not the slightest detective. The role just doesn't fit her, even if she wants to be a comedy. <br /> <br /> For many stereotypes / predictable things. Typical comment or return. <br /> <br /> If you don't see the things I think, it may be a nice movie to see if it's ever on television. But I don't recommend renting it.
