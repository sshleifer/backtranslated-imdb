Some of the films for which the pound is made are quite good - the 23rd century films featured dozens of hidden Italian and American films that were great, but although Hardgore released some of Fulci's films, most of their productions joke like The Zombie Chronicle. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it is not nearly as annoying as meat. In addition, it is a very clumsy anthology film with the technical expertise of a Lego house built with an ear. <br /> <br /> This is labeled elsewhere, but you really have to worry about a movie that adds preview action to your credit queue so that when it arrives in zombie attacks, you've already seen it. <br /> <br /> Bad movie fans have a ball that looks at 18,000 continuity bugs and notorious action cast (especially the hitchhiker who was so bad he made me laugh a bit) and the defenders Hardgore to get things in the spirit, releasing so bad printing that I felt like I was watching some banging home video from a camping trip. <br /> <br /> An amazing, terrible thing. We've all done things when we've got the camera shut, but common sense prevails and these movies fall somewhere in our closets. Avoid.
