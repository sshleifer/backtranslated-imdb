Such an embarrassing and flat attempt to limp. Diabolic script and dialogue and really embarrassing action. Really inferior movie I've ever seen (in the cinema). Nothing, in my opinion, captures the full disaster of this movie. I saw it in the Brighton Cinema. People walked out and there were more people talking outside the toilet than in the auditorium! After all, a small crowd left boos and scorn, which was quite sad, because the relatives of one of the main players were present and were really stupid. But the movie was so bad that I really didn't feel like it was for them. Everyone has to start somewhere and their son started his acting career with this truly terrible attempt at "Tarantinism in the UK". 5 years have passed, but sometimes I still feel sad in the memory of this fucking night! This is a movie with no redemption properties! I gave it to 1 if 0 was not available. They should invent a "scammer" for everyone who is involved in the unsuccessful clutter of this film. I know some of them have moved on to better things, the positive thing is that none of them would be less than that.
