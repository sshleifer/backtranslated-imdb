I gave it more than 1 because I thought there were moral lessons in this story, and it caused some thoughts and comments from my wife and I. Action and dialogue were mediocre, and I have to admit that I came out like being beaten by God, God, and Christ is our savior. Movie and story don't need it. If, as I am, you are a restorative Catholic or a Christian, beware that it makes you nauseous. The film did a good job of showing a thin line between a good citizen and how someone could become a possible stalker.
