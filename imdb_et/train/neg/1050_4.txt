Nathan Detroit plays illegal craps for high rollers in NYC, but the heat is on and he can't find a safe place. He is contributing to a chronic gambler, Sky Masterson, that he can't make a primary missionary, Sarah Brown, in the sky, go with him for dinner. Sky Challenges But Both Men Have Surprises in Shop ?? <br /> <br /> It is one of those expensive fifties MGM musicals that are splashy in color, big sets, loud music, bigger than life roles and performances; Broadway photographed a big screen if you like the thing I don't do. My main problem with this type of film is just music. I like any kind of music from Albinon to ZZ Topin, but Broadway shows stories at a swift time, with the endless bug-pah-tah-dah beats at the end of every fourth bar. It has been written by the team of Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (based on a couple of Damon Runyon's stories) and although the plot is quite pleasing, the songs are weak. The two numbers of Blaine are, for example, identical, unnecessary, do not promote the plot and grab the ears (and are also miserable if such a thing disturbs you). There are only two memorable stories, Luck Be A Lady (sung by Brando, not Sinatra, as you might expect) and sit, you're Rockin 'Boat (nicely by Kaye), but you have to sit for two hours to get them. The movie trick is young Brando, who gives a thoughtful and modest result; she also sings quite well and even dances little and is consistent with the always interesting Simmons. The queue where two of them flee to Havana at night is a welcome atmosphere for Noo Yawki's all-noise, church and vocal murder. Music fans can complain about it, but I think that musical must do more than just a production film.
