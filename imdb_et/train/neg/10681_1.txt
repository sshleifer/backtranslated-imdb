How unfortunate I have so many of my "a" lists and good "b" listers, they agree to make this movie, but they did it and that is what sucks me to see it. I had never heard of this movie, but there was a Cuban Gooding Jr. on the DVD. and in the background James Woods was bad? In a word, very much! This movie starts with o.k. has some turns, just an egg. The end was as weak as the writer was summoned, and his 4-year-old son sat down and ended the typist. When an ironic movie entitled "The Final Game" is such a poor one. These are the types of movies that can move the "a" list quickly to the "b" list. I hope that Cuban Gooding JR and James Woods will not make it a habit.
