It's so sad. Although it was filmed, I think it smells a little more than Flood Lake, there's nothing. The music they play in this is a more fun thing I've ever heard. I like the brother and sister in this movie. They both don't try hard at sarcastic when they say "My friends are so jealous!" Hey, who with the killer only carries the mask at the beginning? It's slowed down! I practically ignored the other side. My favorite part of this movie is the sound effect they use when using a killer ax. The same exact sound for every piece!
