Don't do it wrong, it's a terrible, clich√© movie, but it's a pleasure for Olivia Hussey's fans - probably the most intoxicating beauty ever given to grace the silver screen. One poster said he was unpleasant to watch - I don't know what his ideal wife looks like - Paris Hil-bitch? Blockbuster should really create sub-music for this type of film, because the plot of Fatal Attraction has become a genre. When will Blockbuster accept the "Adultry" part? It's pretty nice between drama and action, right? This film revolves around Olivia Hussey, who spends the passionate night of an unstable yacht owner, who may have murdered his former wife, who looks like Hussey. This kid-do-well continues Olivia's stem and makes her life hell. I like Olivia Hussey, but I have no sympathy for the characters of these spouses for the characters of the treacherous films, so I really didn't like Olivia to bring this smelly life out. <br /> <br /> (There's violence in the movie. Donison says Denison says she no longer needs to see Olivia, Murray's wife seeing she's too good in bed. Shooter and can get squeezed - I'll let you watch ). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$ (Olivia is the queen of short nudity and delivers a little here. Anthony John with Denison and also with the shower scene - shot at a distance). <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (We've seen this plot earlier - a hundred times over and often done a lot better. The culprit, when he tries to fail this movie, is William Riead, the man's dialogue is sophomore and moral; Not narrative and unable to build reactions of human origin These people, from the upper layers of society, speak like high school children - wont sleep in English class. I have put Riead on a never-seen-again list.) <br /> <br /> ACT: $ $ $ (The actor did not call, as the insiders said, but it was obstructed by Olivia Hussey calling Anthony Jonh Denison "strange" and "crazy" on her face as she started to lurk. Don Murray was basically there - demented, love-crazed stalker - his character was not perfect, and Edward Asner, a terrible actor when he gave something to the content, was badly used in this film).
