I'm a B movie lover, give me a genetically mutated bat and I'm in the sky. These movies are good to stop thinking about everything else that is happening in your world. Even the stupid B-film usually makes me laugh and I still consider it good. Then there was Hammerhead, which was so terrible that I had to register with the IMD to warn others. First of all was the creation of the shark-man of science hardly touched by the film. To be interested, viewers would just be convinced that every few minutes there is blood. During one attack scene, the camera moved out of the attack, but you saw what was probably the blood bucket that the director throws to let you know that the attack was bloody and that the person was probably dead (what a fabulous special effect). To science, I thought it was very interesting that female subjects were kept naked and testing equipment required their monitoring through their breasts. Anyway, this film had a bad plot development, a terrible story, and I am sorry that I say quite bad action. Even William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs couldn't save that smell.
