Hmm ?? I agree with the assessor who said that "strange people with great tastes have reviewed this movie". I thought the movie was interesting enough to watch it. I think it was mainly because of Marsden and Speedman - not a plot. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this movie is slightly psychologically on the one hand and deeply homophobic on the other. Thumbs up the former and triple thumbs down to the latter. I'm not sure if the film is for promoting dialogue or spreading fear and propaganda. <br /> <br /> I thought it was mediocre. A lot of conversation, about 90 degrees, of reality. I wanted to get some meaning from the country, but it is only a conversation with a madman (Speedman). I know him (Speedman) because of his loss, but not really. His loss is not greater and certainly less than the losses that have been caused every day in the world for important reasons. <br /> <br /> Does the film show naive HIV / AIDS? Yes: This is the desired audience. Is HIV a dark, mysterious and evil killer? But with its victims? The answer to both questions is NO. Neither HIV nor its victims have more or less malicious intentions than lupus, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, hepatitis, CANCER or their victims. Just because the disease is infectious, it just doesn't make it deliberate or negligent - or bad - it's just. <br /> <br /> Does it apologize for ignorance or foolproof risk taking? - NO. Should all people use safe sex? - YES. Does safe sex save the world? - NO. Is safe sex realistic in all the love and lust between passionate and emotional people? ? OF COURSE NOT. What kind of world would we live in if everyone followed the rules, no one ever took risks and sex would never be spontaneous and passionate ??? Do I ignore that the film deals specifically with gay? ? YES. HIV spreads by distributing blood or body fluids between infected and uninfected persons. Sex is not a transmission, gay or otherwise necessary. <br /> <br /> I am always disturbed by one person's intentional violence against another. In fact, I thought the film did a good job, showing Tom's violent robbery, imprisonment and intent on Dan, and such mad violence occurs every day. <br /> <br /> Stream of Consciousness Film: Tom is crazy. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't Dan ask "why" you feel it, not "what do you do"? Impact: Men having sex with men get "AIDS": HIV = AIDS Where was Tom's responsibility for sex act? Why was Dan obliged to use a condom? "maybe you would shut it down before you shut it down?" What are we talking about here? Was one side unconscious? "Maybe he didn't want to hear the truth," did you joke? He is heaven and so incredibly hurt for what he knows about me now? Is Dan alive when he has HIV? Definitely not! This is why the whole world is so homophobic ???? They think gay men are the cause of HIV, they give it to the rest of the world and we all die? Do you make fun ??? Are people foolish enough to think homosexuality is the reason ... is the problem ??? Do we feel this for the victims of tuberculosis? malaria? I see Tom being injured by his wife's death and accusing him of AIDS but seriously? who's here? Victim or virus? Are diseases actually responsible for the sick? (assuming they were not looking and trying to spread the disease). <br /> <br /> Sure, safe sex is essential for a safe life, but it's not driving, not flying, not leaving the house, not living. Do we really want to blame the victims? Is Tom and Dan a safe sex that has prevented Tom's woman's final death? Maybe, but not Dan's sole responsibility. <br /> <br /> Tom is crazy. Did I mention that. <br /> <br /> Tom Dan: "Maybe you get what you deserve?" COME ON! 24 days: violent, naive and homophobic. <br /> <br /> Am I overreacted? Maybe. However, I think this film refers to homosexual men with a reasonable finger on their "careless and malevolent" "straight world", practicing insecure sex, as the proportion of homosexuals engaged in safe sex is proportionally equal to or better than that of heterosexual people. We all have to wake up and take seriously HIV / AIDS. HIV kills hundreds of thousands of Africans each year.
