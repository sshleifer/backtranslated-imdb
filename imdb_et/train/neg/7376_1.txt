Steven, what you've done, you've hit all the new low. It's strange because Steven's last film shadow man was headed by the same director who made this trash. The Shadow man was good, it was badly bad so bad that it wasn't even funny Steven is barely in the movie and feels he's in a cheeky look and when he's in the movie, he's still half the time. As for the activity, we simply say that the oz wizard had more activities than it would hardly work in the trash and when it finally arrives, the dull depression is poorly photographed. Seagal kills someone who, unlike him, is watching movies where he goes under one man's army, the siege ring 1 and 2, and the exit wounds. The plot is so confused with so many plot holes that it sometimes does not create scenes. rage better be good, what shame i wasted 5 pounds on this garbage 0 out of ten good luck next time
