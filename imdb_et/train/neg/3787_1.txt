I have to be the American guy who didn't like such a movie. I think it just wasn't my style or something, I just don't see what's so exciting about it, it was * hardly fun, let alone one of the greatest achievements in film history. <br /> <br /> It's about a man who came up with something and goes on to become a master of the drug. It's a pretty easy way to describe the whole movie, and it's exactly my feeling about the whole movie. Contrary to what many people think, just because the film is about mafia / drug trafficking / criminal groups, it doesn't automatically make a big movie, don't forget good storytelling.
