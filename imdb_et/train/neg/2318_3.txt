A child who is found to be a garbage child and raised in the martial arts academy has the ability to sink into the baskets. With the man who found him, he gets to college and is promoted to championship when he searches for his real parents. Endlessly better pieces act in comedy for real confusion as a whole. It looks like he's trying to play the Shaolin Soccer hipper basketball version, but the comedy is scattering, its focus moves more than Chihuahua with the ADD fourfold espresso. I continued to ask "What am I looking at". I looked at it from start to finish and I still don't know what the hell happened. It is a disgrace because there are some big scenes, some amusing jokes, and from time to time, but nothing that never comes together would accept.
