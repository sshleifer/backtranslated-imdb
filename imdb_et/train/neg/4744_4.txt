The worst DCOM I've seen. Never. Well, maybe not as bad as the Smart House. It was just bad. Action and story was good, but the effect of SUCKED! <br /> <br /> They were so fake! The only good fight scene was between brother and Shen. It was probably the only scene where I was excited. <br /> <br /> In general, I found this movie to be very boring and the movie's type ended suddenly. <br /> <br /> I give it to four Brenda Songs, a very funny actress and one to fight. <br /> <br /> 4/10
