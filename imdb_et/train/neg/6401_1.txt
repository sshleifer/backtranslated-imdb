Can I do this until I need glasses? at least proves that everyone can make a movie. Talent is not a reward. People who triggered this world of embarrassing vomiting are lacking in talent, taste, or intelligence. The target group must consist of recently labotized and infants playing their stools. Someone else would be too smart to get out of this movie even with a nose. It consists of a series of sophoristic sketches in which the punchline does not even reach the obvious. It ends with a ridiculous. In jokes, there are jokes that primary school children say (usually potty or sexually linked) where they don't know what they mean. You know, like a father's car and mom's garage. Applying all of the more stern methods would be pointless, as the creative minds have never heard the usual standards of action, writing, referral, and such. behind this confusion. Not to be decisive, but anyone who enjoyed this movie should seriously think about their purpose on this earth. <br /> <br />
