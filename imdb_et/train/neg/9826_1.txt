I think this would be a great movie for a true believer organized by Christian Dogmas, but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will, rational thinking, separation of church and state, and good science literature, this is a terrible joke! br /> <br /> There are some famous actors who were either in bad need or who needed to share their personal beliefs with the rest of our Gentiles. <br /> <br /> I was in this entertainment movie the same way I did "Reefer Madness". This film attempted to teach drug education with intimidation tactics, just as this film attempts to teach "Christian" principles to hell and misery to otherwise good people who do not share their interpretations of our world. <br /> <br It was me laughing with laughter and at the same time scared me to realize how many people actually believe our society should turn to the good days of the 19th century!
