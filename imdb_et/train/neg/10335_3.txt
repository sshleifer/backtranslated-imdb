Medium (and surprisingly tame) Fulci giallo, which means that according to the usual standards it is still quite bad, but it is redeemed by its strong structure and some beautiful touches, such as pure timing associated with vision and clairvoyance. <br /> <br /> The genre's well-known weaknesses are full: banal dialogue, wood-based, illogical plot points. And the finals will go too long, while the exclusion turns out to be pretty flat or I say: stupid affair. <br /> <br /> Fulci's ironic behavior to giallo standards is fun. Yellow tips wherever you look. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 bumpers
