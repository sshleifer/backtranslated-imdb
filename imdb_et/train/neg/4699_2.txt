wow, Naked Brothers Band. What should I say. I think I can say that this exhibition just sucks. number one: they have no talent, they can't even play instruments. Number 2: On a commercial basis, he said they were famous, but no one heard them until they stayed there. Look, I really don't hate that bad, I'd give it like four out of ten, but what irritates me is how everyone says they have such a great talent and Nat is so deep and writes deeply. Deep in my ass! he talks about the intricate feelings of heavy wrestlers. wow, I could read what he says on the bathroom walls and it would be deeper. And they did not become famous, their parents are famous celebrities, and they wanted their children to be too bad to make a bad show. I feel it will be canceled soon.
