a man who wrote, directed and looked at this shocking trash should really consider a caregiver change. Yes, Rob Stefaniuk, I mean to you! Seriously, who funded this mess? there are so many talented writers who could spend money better. I think the idea is great, but acting, scripting and managing are just awful! The jokes aren't that funny, I understand they should take the mickey. HOW TO DO THIS STYLE, this film screams with a live sketch on Saturday evening 1995. Why, I'll tell you why studios make money, like Rob Stefaniuk - NEVER USING CULTURE DIRECTLY AND WRONGLY. DUH!
