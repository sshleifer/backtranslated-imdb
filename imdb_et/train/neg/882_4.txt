There is a reason why it went straight to the video - the story is funny, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a stupid way in sex churches and other scenes bordering on a tasteless (like a laundry scene) breaking this movie. Judge Reinhold, as a cuckold, is fine, but the film itself has not been well-debated and retaliated. But this is a good movie for trivia competitions - because so few people saw it.
