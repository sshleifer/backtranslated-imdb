This song keeps my head. Not the biggest song, but it's 80s. This film is about a singer who kills "supposebly" during the accusations of murder when he steals his girlfriend, who is singing a backup in his band. The singer, whose name is Billy "Eye" (yes, better), has died after two years and his band comes back to the concert, this time as a lead singer. Billy hides her and ends up killing all these people and scares the girl and makes people think about her, that there's something wrong with her and that it represents things. Finally, he decides to go to the cemetery and dig his grave to see if he is still there. He sees that he is dead, but still sees and hears his voice. At the end of the movie we find out all the reasons, Billy has one brother named John (again) and John admits that he was jealous for his brother and that he killed all those people to come back and place to blame his brother and then take him girlfriend and terrorize her because she called her crazy. The end is very fun and the actress is very flat and wood. But .... I still like it. I look at it for a song. I wish I had.
