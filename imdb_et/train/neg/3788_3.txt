Here's a lot of fun. The actors are first-rate and the script offers a good dialogue that best helps to keep a close-knit, pleasant family atmosphere. For this reason, the film does not ring. We see that Leo, who apparently became aware of his HIV-positive diagnosis, reacts essentially in a way that is inconsistent with the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself. The film also ends somewhat sharply, avoiding what Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family have to deal with for their love. The young actor who plays Leo's brother Marcel is impressive because in general it is the rest. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters were unable to decide whether they wanted an incomprehensible thesis on the impact of HIV on a functional, tempting family, or on the destruction of HIV to the victim - so it is both. Though this film provides food, thought it would leave much more behind the viewer than it offers.
