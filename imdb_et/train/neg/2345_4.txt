I was looking at the wind where Rock Hudson played, Lauren Becall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone-Robert Stack were terrible - just a bloody terrible - he was supposed to be a charming millionaire with a jet device instead of coming out like a word on the plot was stupid and burnt, and 3 "romantic" leaders had no chemistry. Somehow, Dorothy Malone won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actors - although her campy tramp was boring - I think the older sister of Splendor at The Grass was full of agony and bitterness and charisma. Director Douglas Sirk has a whole cast of surplus through his dialogue, which seemed forced and resulted in 99-minute waste. There was an actor who played the title Get Smart
