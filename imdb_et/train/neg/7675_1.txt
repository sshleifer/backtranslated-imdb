Is it ever possible to say that there are some films with no redemption properties? Answer: Yes, and that's one of them. After the fearsome "Dead House" leadership, Uwe Boll has now given his less talented eye to another video game customization. Don't they get it? For anyone who doesn't understand, it's for you in capitals: VIDEO GAMES ARE NOT GOOD MOVIES! Working here is at best atypical. Set design and special effects are bad. Unlike a video game (with its frightening moments), there is no atmosphere in the film that represents the impending punishment, danger, or threat. Sticking and drawing are confusing and the paper on which the script is printed would be better used as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with monkey grace and skill, using a brush. Hackneyed zooms, swoops, and pans are fetched into anxiety in unexpected moments, leaving the audience puzzled and forever. Why ever this man was allowed to put a movie, must be one of the most modern cinemas. Avoid at all costs.
