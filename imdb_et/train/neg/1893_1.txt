This film was very stupid in things. I didn't like any character; Susan Walters was both a tedious and leading actor (forget her name) for my nerves. You can't really remember how it ended and so on, but the whole idea that foreigners own human bodies and just seemed foolish in this movie wasn't quite open. My dad said it was a silly film ... I should have listened to him.
