What happened to British TV drama? Through John Major Tony Blair, the focus of the genre has shifted from social realism to ridiculously normative women-focused stories about the constant internal problems of middle-class professionals. (Or is TVNZ not buying good stuff? Please give it what it is ...) <br /> <br /> The writer's long-term career in soaps probably explains why the dialogue consists mainly of old clich√©s. Niamh Cusack's performance has a strong substantive look, each of which keeps the director at least one and a half times longer than they deserve. A bright look, however, is a substitute for poor depth if the writer has not been able to offer such material to the participants. <br /> <br /> This is, of course, a thriller theoretically about murder investigation; but it is not as important as the central character's failed marriage and the accompanying problems. Is Cusack's spouse a complete bastard? Does his son break his marriage completely? Making these central questions is not a sign of knowledge - it shows deeply narcissistic identification by a writer and director who is moving forward with his work. <br /> <br /> Lynda La Plante knows how to write these things so that it seems important and involves viewers other than household-related neurotics; Apparently Paula Milne is not the task.
