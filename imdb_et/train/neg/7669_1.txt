This movie manages to be one of the most unique movies you have seen. But this is due to the fact that you cannot make the head or tail of this confusion. This seems to be almost a challenge to determine if you are willing to go out of the movie or give up the money you just paid. If you do not want to feel a little bit, then you sit through this terrible movie and develop a real regret for those involved, they have all seen better days, but then you realize that they actually pay quite a lot of money to do it and you lose them as you you've already done for the movie. I can't go enough on this terrible movie, it's almost something Ed Wood would have done, and in that case he would have been his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> To get started, you have to sit through a dialog that has never been seen / heard, it must be five minutes long. In addition, it has been told to suggest that the viewer cannot read it. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the terrible lines of fire begin as if he is only working to get the movie on the poster line lines. Soon we will meet Stephen Dorff, whom I usually enjoy, and he will do his best to not sink, but in the end he will. Then the ultimate offense comes, Tara Reid plays an intelligent role, oh help! Tara Reid is not a very talented actor and somehow she always plays a role in movies, although she should stick to American-style movies. First of all, you want to see it yourself when it appears on the video, I know I got it out, I mean, I promise to be honest here, sometimes its comforting to encourage others.
