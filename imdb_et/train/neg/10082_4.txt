I laughed all over this rotten movie. It's so incredible. A woman leaves her husband after several years of marriage, is a division of a real estate agency. What happens? The office manager comes out and offers him work! Fun! The next thing you know is that two women are going. Yes, they are lesbians! Nothing really tells you in this "lifetime woman who has nothing better to do". Clunky dialogue like "I don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had the chance to be happy and didn't take it" doesn't help. There's a wealthy, distant mother who disagrees with her daughter's new relationships. Sassy black maid - unbelievable that in 2003 a film with a sassy black maid will be made. Hattie McDaniel must turn to his grave. She has a husband who speaks out and wants to take care of great teenage children. Sheesh! No climates are left behind.
