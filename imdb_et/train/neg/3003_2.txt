We all know that countless dudes have earned the brilliant genre of the 80s and often deserve only our deepest nonsense. Maybe it's a bit hasty, but the devil, when "Slaughter High" wasn't terribly uneven, even slip. Pretty much, the plot includes a child who experienced a Carrie-like shower humiliated in high school and returns to a broken building to look for a revenge group of former bullies who all show memorable. As you think, on April 1, they continually kill crazy crazy with electric shock, burning, hanging and chemically altered beer. I have a lot of problems with the details and settings of this film plot, but given the end, I feel the need to dismiss my complaints and just say it is a total waste of time. Ignore all movie thoughts ...
