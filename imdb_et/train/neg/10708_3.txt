This film had the potential to be really good, given that some plot elements have been borrowed from a science fictionist HIDDEN. And Dolph always gives cheese its roles. But no one really fell on that ball. <br /> <br /> Dolph plays a kick-off monk (!) who travels to New York to get a key that opens the door under his monastery, which has captured the antichrist for 2000 years. He must fight for the people who are the spirit that jumps from body to body, like HIDDEN and JASON GOES TO HELL. Minion, of course, wants the key to let the antichrist out. Beside driving, there is a tedious female archaeologist and along with her and Dolphi are pursuing the ministry's possession. <br /> <br /> If I am entertaining this, forget it. Stimulation is very inconvenient and slow, acting the best and fighting scenes staged poorly. Dolphi's sleepwalkers play their part and pull out some of the worst dialogues in their careers. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor really rises at the end when the minion fights the coin with the military, but the rest of this flick is surprising. <br /> <br /> Too bad, I really wanted it.
