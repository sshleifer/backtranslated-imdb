This junk piece summarizes terrible behavior, flat plot, stupid story and just a whole terrible movie. It was surprising to sit. Just terrible. Don't waste one cent on it. Cinemas should feel bad about displaying this movie so that people can watch it. This "horror film" was not even a little scary, horrible or disturbing. It was by no means visual. All the actors acted so terribly that all attempts to pull you through the film were completely destroyed by the actor / actress's mouth opening. Plus the whole story, I don't know why anyone should make a AGAIN movie with this story. Don't waste your time or money. Even if it's a free ticket, this moment doesn't waste watching one movie. You feel yourself watching.
