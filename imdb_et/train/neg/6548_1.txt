If you look at it without the meaningless idea of ​​what the story is about, you are quite surprised. Even then, the synopsis has painted a fairly understandable picture, but the actual film is something other than. <br /> <br /> As the synopsis went on, it tells of an enlisted climber you see a prologue before the opening credit and indexing of the text, telling you there is Chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in dreams of mind in manuscripts (a note for yourself, it flashes with lights ), where its inhabitants are immortal, longing for a change in their omnipotence. They see our world and mark all the people out of this climber, and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through the alchemy, creating an intelligent sphere to meet a person. <br /> <br /> What this translated is a recurring animation that a 5-year-old child could produce. Are there shapes created, even though the credit goes to the stopping style and puts it in a thoughtless loop. And repeat until your eyes close, then move on to the next scene. If anything, Chonopolisians (if that term exists) really love their sticks and balls, playing constantly in building this magical sphere and playing with it in the "other" world before the day. Nor does it improve if a man communicates with the sphere with another hypnotic boredom and sleep inducing sequence. <br /> <br /> Thanks for the runtime being shorter than advertised, which is 57 minutes (or less) against 70. Though they are dated, these cheerful colors, non-existent story, scratched soundtrack, and repetitive images of fans win. Don't waste time.
