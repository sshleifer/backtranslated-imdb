Ok, so here's the main picture. It's 1933, Peter Sellers is Dr. Fu Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese man who has lived for quite some time. The film opens with its birthday, where it celebrates a special elixir that (even the film does not mention) extends its life. This time the assistant easily falls into the elixir (Kato, if you remember the Pink Panther films) and he told his minions to go to find 6 rare themes for elixir production. It creates a global man's hunt, where his minions kidnap diamond museums and get into London, meet Dr. Fu's nemesis, retired Scottish yard detective Nayland Smith, also played by vendors trying to stop him, wisely comedic adventure. <br /> <br /> This was probably the last full-length feature of the sellers he made before his death. The terrible tragedy is that he was in it. Such talented comedians and sellers who have a memorable "funny" role in the Panther films, and especially the "The Party" movie, have something in this movie, but that's it. This movie was an absolute torture to sit down and I couldn't even end it. He finished DIES and I tried to catch the sellers' performance. After a year of great work "Being there", how can I do it and how did it get? As one person mentioned, the first 10.15 minutes are ok, but then everything is down ... <br /> <br /> Avoid like a plague. <br /> <br /> Rating 1/10.
