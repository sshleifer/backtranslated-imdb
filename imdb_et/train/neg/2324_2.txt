I agree with other users' comments that the two main roles had worked well, being the man who played the role of Gary Gillmore and Giovanni. Too bad a story was so boring. Didn't hear the story I didn't know before Gary Gillmore before the movie, so I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be something about a dead man walking or sitting in the courtroom, but how I was wrong. The whole movie spoke, talked and talked about his mother and father. The only cool scenes were setbacks where the father would lose his mood. That was the only interest I got from this borefest.
