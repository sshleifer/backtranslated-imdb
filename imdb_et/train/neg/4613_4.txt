Well, what is it? I found that Nicholson's character was low and unfortunately uninteresting. Angelica Huston's character emptied my power. And Kathleen Turner is a dirty, not a good bitch. It's not that I can't. It's not that I don't think some ideas could have brought more. It is a film that has nothing but an understanding that we should accept these ideas, and that's what the film has done for it. The fact that Nicholson falls on Turner is absurd, but it is so. But it didn't hit me a.) Funny or b.) ... even far from interesting! It was a waste of my time, so don't let the leap get you the best ... it's a waste of your time! Everything that is said is pretty beautiful in an open church sequence ...
