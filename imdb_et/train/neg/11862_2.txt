This movie probably had something; my confusion is how these completely prosaic dishonest things do to theaters, as if ideas are reused just because generations are. Indeed, the decerants behind most of the films are like dogs, they return to their vomiting. Well, they're now 19 dollars richer for me. It was not at all imaginative, there was no redemption time, the trailer was something funny (and the trailer was not fun), the performances were tense (especially Molly, absolutely convincing). What was theoretically supposed to be a comic relief was a homoerotic friend who wanted Disney movies; none of his analogy hit home, his small moral speeches were flat, I literally waited to say something meaningful to find out that it was done. The so-called "hard 10" is the most uncomfortable plastic creature (except the horse's face with a strange smile); I found honestly that his friend Patty (called Hamburglar) is much better than him. But then, gentlemen prefer the brunette;) Well, still the whole premise that society is superficial and if love is true, it crosses all social facades; how they showed it, with the guy shaving another nail and a million times a corrupted and dead horse's premature ejaculation routine (with obvious clues to American Pie and Happiness - the last of the nonsense associated with a family dog). I feel like this movie would be like ridiculous jokes on ridiculous merciless balls of ridiculous jokes. Going to show that marketing can push something out there, shine any hopeful mass and call it gold, people come (worked for me). Ready for a thirst.
