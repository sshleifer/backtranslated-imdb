I watched “Envy” two days ago on a DVD, in a house of friends. The prerequisite for this film is quite promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller, who have a comedy with many potentials. I watched it with about five friends and no one laughed at the whole movie. Jokes (which are little and far away) are in no way funny ... the story is crap, and they never answer the question ... WHERE SH SH T T GO? Of course, this question is answered by NO ONE CARES. This film lacks any comedy value, and since some other users have said it is the only thing that is even worth seeing is Christopher Walken as J-man. No characters have been developed, the plots are so thin that they are almost transparent - and is this movie funny for the whole movie?
