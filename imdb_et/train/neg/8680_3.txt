I just stopped watching this movie and WOW was so bad. In fact, the only thing that watched me was that it was so bad that it was so entertaining. The action of the characters is fun, from the hyper-dramatic way they fall to the fire, to their incredibly poor performance (were the bad guys just pulled out of the street or were they actually actors?), The delivery of incredibly bad lines to their inexplicable activities (if you are going to try and Let someone through the doorway, when they enter, is probably the thing to do is shoot directly at the doorstep!). This movie must break some records for the worst written and delivered lines. <br /> <br /> The camera's work was also very bad - you can't see what's going on in the scene due to camera angles and shaking. <Br /> <br /> I would have voted "1", except that I like Chiba and Sek Shihom, and I had a couple of scenes to entertain: 1) Crushing the criminals so that the bone jumped out of the skin get hurt) 2) a drug shrub who eats a brown haired animal (monkey?), hacking a carcass with a cutter 3) Sonny Chiba, who performs some eye-catching operations with a man with his fingers. > <br /> I'm actually a big fan of Sonny Chiba, but it's not really worth the time. I've seen about 7 or 8 of his films and come to the conclusion that the only ones to watch (and they're great!) Are Street Fighter and The Killing Machine. I've also heard that Executioner and Golgo 13 are good. I suggest you stick to them.
