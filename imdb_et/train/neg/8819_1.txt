this is undoubtedly the worst idiotic terrible piece I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This movie is that a boy goes crazy and dresses like Santa and kills people because he saw his mother give her father oral when she was dressed in santa. WHY SHOULD MEET? is it just me or is someone looking mad like EVER? and that is not the only thing. i'm serious when i say MORE THAN THIS DAMN MOVIE. something up to 1 hour and 15 minutes has passed. <br /> <br /> There's a whole friggin scene where he glues his friggin santa beard. This is a long length. WHO IS THE VERY HEALTH? but I have to say that the end of this movie made me laugh at it. so if you see this movie on television or come back like an hour and 20 minutes, then you can no doubt look at the worst end of cinematography. and I'm serious about it. <br /> <br /> It's not as good as it is bad, it's annoying, it's idiotic, it made me want to break vcr. it is not just worth your time, I am sure every other review mentioned it, but the actress who played the Mother Home Improvement was the movie in the second second. YOU KNOW YOU WHAT IS MOVIE? QUESTIONS ASK FOR USE Within sixty months after seeing this movie, NEVER NEVER.
