The great western world will hear you all say! Great first effort! Well I'm not sure which movie you were all watching, but it must be different from what I saw. Great Westerns or any genre of good movies have signs that you can believe and this movie was not! Addressing the violent example was poor and I didn't care less about what the character is, making the whole movie meaningless. the story was too big for the creators and maybe they should try their hand to make direct garbage directly on TV as you can see in the "FACT OR FICTION" sci-fi programs. <br /> <br /> Please, if you are looking for a good movie, a great western or even a nice and a half hour, please look elsewhere.
