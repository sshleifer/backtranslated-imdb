This is a version that even the author hated because it is so schmaltzy. They gave her a "happy ending" and changed a lot of dialogue and it's just big saccharin. "Stage Manager" is pretty good, I believe he got a role, but everyone else falls into the style of 40's actors that really just represent. One great feature - music. This is one of the best points ever recorded, and it's worth the record store. In general, I think the 1989 Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller version is much better.
