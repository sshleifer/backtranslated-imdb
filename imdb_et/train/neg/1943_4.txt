What's up! It started with intriguing secrets and interesting letters. It is true that it was moving at the speed of snails, but I was still detained and looked. <br /> <br /> David Morrissey is always good and Suranne Jones was good. Muslim aspects were very interesting. We were tantalized with potential terrorist organizations. <br /> <br /> But Morrissey's character was killed and all the air left the balloon. The last episode was boring, boring, boring. The whole thing turned out to be a very small beer and the d√©nouement was incredibly weak. <br /> <br /> Five hours of my life? My advice: look dry.
