At least a teenage geek gets a girl's movies, a girl is usually unpopular with girls. In the 40-year-old Virgin she replaces a 40-year-old man who is popular with women, but somehow it has been a virgin. But then you shouldn't use your movie to get your brain involved, or do I miss it for 20 years comic? for some reason, it is attractive enough to want a serious relationship with them. I find it hard to see how a country that has produced such great television comedies seems to think that it has to laugh at the raw and shallow characters. They have made general films. They've done it like all Americans are 15 years old. Where are they going? <br /> <br /> This movie is crass and raw entertainment that has nothing to suggest.
