I saw this movie in the first release of the theater rightly in an empty theater. Believe it or not, after decades of watching a movie, it's still clearly in my mind the worst movie ever; or at least the worst I would afford. <br /> <br /> The actor is far below the standard set by a random group of iodine high school students who left the street and forced their rows to study for 5 minutes or less. <br /> <br /> After the first shock, we laughed for a while because every scene was hit by new humiliation. But after some time, it was a doubtful joy and it was just very sad.
