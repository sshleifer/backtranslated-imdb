A gave him "1" instead of "2" (terrible), because there is no denying that many visual images were stunning, many talent went into special effects and a work of art. But it wasn't enough to save it. <br /> <br /> "Sepia" tinted, bloated colors are things that have been done many times in other films. There's nothing new there. I see some of the old classic films had some hats. OKAY. There is no problem with this. <br /> <br /> But the movie must be fun and interesting, not something that would make you sleep. <br /> <br /> The story and script of this movie was terrible, characters two-dimensional. Slow moving. Some scenes were beautiful, but ultimately it was boring, I couldn't recommend it.
