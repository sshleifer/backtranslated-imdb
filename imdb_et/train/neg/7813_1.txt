In my eyes, this is an almost perfect example of a Hollywood ego that was only beaten by a new King Kong. Superman is the original super hero and deserves respect although he wears pantyhose. Brandon Routh was the worst superman I have ever seen, from the beginning of the movie just just want to pull a piece of kryptonite under his throat. She's just wearing a costume. But it is enough that Kate Bosworth was the wrong choice for the wrong lane, he should be a hard ass reporter, but in this movie he sees as a schoolgirl. The plot was weak and predictable (WOW, He's actually a supermans son who would ever have thought ....) and the action was terrible. This movie has one good thing, and it's called Kevin Spacey. His portrayal of Lex Lutor was great, but even he couldn't save that movie. What this film was needed was "sluggish and clark" (except of course Kevin Spacey) and another story. I watched this movie after watching "The Mountains Have Eyes" and I was beaten to find out that there are worse films.
