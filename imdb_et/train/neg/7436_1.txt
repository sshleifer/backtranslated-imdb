This film is a waste of time and money. All in one and a half hours, I waited for it to heal and didn't do it. It was a slow movement, the plot jumped around, it wasn't scary or interesting and wasn't really anything. In the introduction, the credit was long and drawn out, which was essentially similar to the rest of the film (long and drawn). Many parts of the plot didn't make sense. During the movie, I thought several times that I might have been "zoned" because of the plot's mismatch, my companion had the same problem and assured me that I wasn't "bored" but it was really a movie. I have never posted a movie about this movie and have been searching for IMDb films for several years now. So the fact that I'm actually writing something should tell you how bad this movie is and you shouldn't waste your time or money on it.
