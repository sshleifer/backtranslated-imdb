This mini-series, also based on Alex Haley's book, such as the Queen, tried to use similar formulas, ie creating a long history that follows the family's lives for many years. If the queen was masterful then here Mama Floras had no inspiration. First, maybe in the book itself and certainly in this TV production. Too much rushes over the years, so that the opening saga is low, superficial, not nearly as authentic as the queen. In the earlier parts of the film, which were very cautious, the perfect scenarios were shown, but as the film progressed, it seemed to be the third in the last third of the third hour. I was hoping for more; but probably Haley was less inspired by this story than her almost biography "Queen" and Peter Werner III were not suitable for John Erman. Recommended only for those who want long stories of their long generation.
