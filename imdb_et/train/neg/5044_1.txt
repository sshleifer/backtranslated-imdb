I was waiting for this movie after reading a positive review in the New York Times. In addition, I am also Shanghai, so there was more than just a passing interest in the subject. But after watching it, I was very disappointed. The director remained too long for certain scenes. There was no passion or chemistry between lovers. There was hardly any dialogue. There was a great need for dialogue to compensate for the lack of action. At the end of the film you didn't feel sympathy with the symbols. That movie was missing everything. The script was weak, the operation was bad, and editing was non-existent. The director tried to emit certain styles of noir film but failed. A good movie is what draws your attention, keeps it and succeeds without having to spend time. This movie seemed like it would never end. Don't waste your money on this movie.
