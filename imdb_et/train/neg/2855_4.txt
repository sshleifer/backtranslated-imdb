"Mad Dog Time" ... "Trigger Happy" whatever you want to call it ... just didn't hit it. Maybe its just me, maybe I just don't like the Gangster comedies (as I thought Oscar, Johney Dangerously and mafia also suck) It's probably more "sharp sharp word to play" than all out of comedy, only her not so witty and sharp as this (or other reviewers). <br /> <br /> Rick, Mick, Vic Thing was old to start with the current gag was sometimes painful to watch. <br /> <br /> There were not enough changes to the location or feeling they were supposed to be. Most of the film was in "Dreyfuse Club" or in various offices / premises. .. (What was the seat pistol that Goldblum had to win?) <br /> <br /> Supporting casting was ... excellent on paper (great for seeing Silva & Drago), but characters were killed before they had time to develop. and Richard Pryors became a gift! The element of Romance and Love has also turned it down. <br /> <br /> 4/10 I don't think I'll go to it soon.
