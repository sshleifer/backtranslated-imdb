Chosen by this 50 cents flea market, it was quite exciting. <br /> <br /> I found it exciting for about 15 minutes, then just repetitive and boring. <br /> <br /> This is a pure vision of Mick and Gang in his main, I wish that the copying of the dialogue was not enough to hear what was said and played there. <br /> <br /> Sketches are politically dated and incredibly naive and simple. badly written about Monty Python's acid. I spent more time back in the late 60s to England, but what really happened in foolish sketches. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good reminder that times have really changed and what was important is simply becoming stupid. A good song, but this DVD is now dead.
