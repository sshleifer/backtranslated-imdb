Like wearing a hair shirt. Positively, absolutely, without any doubt, was one of the hidden things. Pure torture. Zero stars out of ten. One long, tedious, painstaking, pretentious, self-conscious, theatrical and leading artistic scene after another. The goal of being dreamy and impressionistic, the soul's bared, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> Half, father and son grab and whisper each other like lovers. "Homo erotic" is a point, pick and clear. OK, what? <br /> <br /> Repeatedly repeated by the son, the "Holy Life" is a raised line, "Father's crucifixion. The loving son lets himself cross." The parallel with God and his son, Christ, is difficult with hand, irrelevant and bombardous, like everything else here. <br /> <br /> Some references refer to the topic of Russian philosophy: "Mother and Son" (1997); "Return" (Andrei Zvyagvatsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev, "fathers and sons"; and, of course, Dostoevsky, "Brothers Karamazov." <br /> <br /> English credits indicate the intended international distribution, which means that no excuse can be used for you to understand this confusion in Russian. <br /> <br /> It's not nearly as achievable or impressive as Sokurov's latest Russian Ark (2003). <br /> <br /> Like her "Mother and Son", it's as robust and enjoyable as some scenes are filmed in distorting mirrors, though not so interesting. The film is almost monochromatic, from the beginning to the end through beige filters, making it visually so that it is dramatically stunning. Soft focus creates only the treated hours. <br /> <br /> Irritating sound sounds that never let, like a tape loop. The old radio plays constantly in the background. Russian romantic melancholy expands indefinitely as "Tchaikovsky's underlying themes". The existence of the "Sound Designer" (Sergei Moshkov), of course, means that all those who irritate little sounds, the static, noise, distortion and such of the radio are "shaped". <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe anyone (Sergei Potepolov) actually wrote this thing. It all seems to be arbitrary, like traffic, as if it were improvised by the eternal actors, something that wouldn't be empty. Modern art has finally been able to celebrate this thing in vain, so what we see in the idea of ​​the idea is an empty shell, but not even a shell, but an idea. Could you ask for a better definition of decadence?
