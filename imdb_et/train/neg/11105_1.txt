It didn't make sense and it was so terrible ... I think Hollywood has a lot of such movies ... you don't have to watch it. people cut or eat what I should say ... it made me sick! Oh my God! the film is about people we don't know, but we feed ourselves with people! they are teeths bla bla bla ... not familiar? I bet you saw it in another movie. The cast was so big, but I think the scenario was really terrible. and I should say that Bradley Cooper was absolutely fantastic ... he's so talented ... actually I said terribly, but I think it's because of terrible scenes ... let me explain. have you ever eaten a language? but one person in the movie did it! it was really terrible ... anyway i think the movie would be as good as this terrible person eater or cutter scenes ...
