Before I comment on the movie I was just watching on YouTube, I have to admit that the reason I checked it was that I first saw television in 1980 in the crackdown on Barbara Bach. And because the film got R-class, I was waiting for my naked. Unfortunately, he or another beautiful actor had no dice: Stacey Nelkin, who should be a teen but was actually 20 when he did. Seeing her in her bra and panty and later in her belly dancer's outfit, it was just like Bach. They offer some of the scattered smiles that this movie offers. In fact, I do not blame Ron Leibman for removing his name from the credits because his role as a tight Liceman is quite embarrassing, even though I did like a "seduction" scene that he did with Nelkin. This is also Ralph Macchio's debut, one of the confusions sent to the academy. Others are a black boy who really loves his stepmother and Mrs. Bach, an Arab who worships engine oil, and a politician's son who loves his girlfriend Candy (Character of the Carnation) so much that she can say in the middle of the night to see her in the girls' academy . Among the supportive pains, Tom Poston plays the symbolic symbol of Sisson, which I found partially amusing. In the direction of Tom Patchetti and Jay Tarsese and Robert Downey Sr (whose son Robert Downey Jr. is in the football league early), the Academy is unevenly politically wrong with humor, but if you really aren't offended by scatological and sexual content, it's actually pretty harmless comedy that Mad Magazine and her trademark cover boy-Alfred E. Newman-shouldn't be ashamed though they never had their name and character off the picture .. .PS Another "misfits" was Harry Teinowitz, who was born in my birthplace of Chicago, Ill. He played Rodney Ververgaert. He also says one of my favorite lines: "I'm trying to come."
