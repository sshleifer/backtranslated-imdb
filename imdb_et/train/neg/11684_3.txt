This movie does not make sense at all, there are large holes in the plot to drive huge NYPD vehicles. Characters do not work in a credible way. I put my comments on the board but save time and money, it's stupid. I can't stand when Hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash bangs and uses fancy editing and cool music and doesn't worry about having a plot hanging with the most basic level. But it's nice to see Denzel W. a superior man arriving with 3 flavors, Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Capt. Von Trapp. There is also a sweet little boy with a video game that is great.
