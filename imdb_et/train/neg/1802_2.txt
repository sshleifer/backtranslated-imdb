Bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, my ... it's one of the movies that doesn't even have one positive effect. Just everything from the actors story stinks to heaven. I just don't know how low I.Q. you should watch and even enjoy this type of valve. <br /> <br /> Is there anything that is worth it? Well, there's a lot of nudity, but it's not special. And if you just think it's not going to get worse, you realize that all the naked ladies look like they are forty years old. C'mon guys where you were looking for these actors. Maybe at home. <br /> <br /> In any case, leading actors have sex appeal and know how to show it. Again, too bad it is too skinny and old. All in all, skip them. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
