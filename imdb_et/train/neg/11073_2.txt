This is a gigantic bad and awesomely embarrassing Canada. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are one of the best in the world. The National Ballet has been ranked among the top five companies in the world. HOW WE ARE ALL THE HIGHEST FILMS! This is not particularly bad. This is particularly typical and typically bad, shot in two bits of hotels and public parks in a thin direction, high school level and "gee whiz ... lets see what this button does on the camera?" photography. If Michael Moriarity was going to do Jack Nicholson's recognition, wouldn't he at least have made a good Jack Nicholson wake up? And when the movie was shot in Vancouver, really one of the most loved cities on earth, and also a hunting center (part of the plot), why do we let God dictate this endemic complex of inferiority in Canada, to be hidden in Seattle ??? Not only for this movie, I'm embarrassing and a little shameful. Australians are doing great things. We produce a different level of piffles. Gawd !!!!!
