WARNING: REVIEW CHANGE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> A few years ago I was able to see the first five films of this franchise and I was going to take a look at the whole Elm St.. from the series. But just two years and I think I don't remember enough about them to do that? I don't think they could be impressed. What do I remember, some clues? Especially dream warriors? was not as bad as it was often made, even though the original was not classic. In general, the predictability of the assumption (when people dream that they are dreaming when they are dreaming) may not be a narrative tension. But if I don't remember a lot of the first five movies, I know they never thought of Freddy's dead depth. the fact that the film was only promoted from the death of character. The fact that the film's conclusion is not even hidden, but in fact, the purpose of the whole film is to illustrate how this venture was free, breathless and cynical. <br /> <br /> Having a morally questionable idea of ​​being a child molester as a charismatic villain, Robert Englund's in-no-way scary interpretation laughs. I always thought that Freddy's nervousness for teenage victims was less focused on characters than teenagers who could ever look at this track. It's like Englund wept, "We know it's garbage? But you pay to see it, who's the one who laughs?" And I'm sure the victims of child abuse would be bad if they saw such an unknown image of their situation. Did Freddy always appear so rudimentary in movies? All he does here is some "haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr? Har Harhar? Hars" and that's it. If it was the only Elm St. The movie you would ever see, you don't even know that character at all. Even if he was a symbol of boo-lift pantomime in Englund, who has a transatlantic needle (ie overpriced, misplaced and not at all funny), even before his death. <br /> <br /> Action is almost generally bad. Just see how many times Breckin Meyer crosses his hand with gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, holds his dignity. And when Roseanne, Tom Arnold, and Alice Cooper show up, you almost see that the film is going to sink even further. The script is also completely negligible, almost entirely without merit. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a road map that Freddy, like Noel's coward, wrote cleverly as "you are f ** ked". When the card is asked, Carlos replies well to the card that we are f ** ked. Who wrote the script, Oscar Wilde? <br /> <br /> Or how is the scene where Carlos has been tortured by Freddy's enhanced hearing? So Freddy tortures him, threatening to lower the pin? potentially deadly sound as all sounds are magnified. Strangely enough, Carlos does not seem to shout at the top of his voice to fail. "Good hearing, Carlos," Freddy punishes, hoping that better lines will come. It is also worth noting that the dream does not occur abnormally, so that unconscious knocking would not allow direct access to Freddy's world. Although a human computer game is part of the narrative, and the three-dimensional finale of the circuit logic is not high on the list of claims. <br /> <br /> Teenagers who do this are really the most disgusting, unpleasant group in the series. Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only one who can greet Freddy, "closed f ** k up, man" and hit scallops. And was unreasonable pop music always part of the ingredients? Freddy's dead. Don't laugh. There are no fears. No interest. Not fun. <br /> <br />
