to be honest, if anyone has a brain, there is never something positive about this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I lost that $ 1 rent. I would like to laugh at Will Smith, saying, "If you have a dream, you must protect it." <br /> <br /> All actors must be boring or have no fame at that time. even Matthew Mc Conahay * but you wrote it * was better than all the actors in this movie when he played psycho in Chainsaw in Texas 4. If you see this movie and you have something good to say, it must be very low in so bad taste in movies, it's painful . Thank you ... and the truth has been told! <br /> <br /> Save yourself from evil. <br /> <br /> Get Devil's Rejects, now it's classic.
