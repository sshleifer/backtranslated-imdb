As a fan of Eric Rohmer's sex research, I was very eager to see "The Lady and the Duke (L'Anglaise et le duc)" on the way he treats men and women during a real war, the French Revolution. <br /> <br /> The film looks beautiful, each scene is designed according to a periodic painting, such as a table. And I was expecting a lot of talk, like Rohmer's style. But perhaps Rohmer was restrained when he proceeded from the real writings of the woman, so it seemed to be mostly a scarlet version of the Scarlet Pimperel. no recognition that the French aristocrats were looted brats? I kept myself, "Marat, we are poor and poor;" you can also choose "Les Miz." voice. <br /> <br /> I wasn't all that sympathetic, because the central figure must go between home town and country manor to stay ahead of revolution. At one point, his servant claims that the pantry is empty, but he will certainly be able to put on fine replay. I just didn't understand him, an English sympathizer, who alternately rejects and protects his former lover and patron when he and the revolution continue to change political focus; I think I had to understand my consistency more than their political mechanisms, such as "The Scarlet Pimpernel". Hey, the only reason he didn't return home was his stigma after the Prince of Wales or someone's attitude and baby. Usually, there have been some changes in the relationship between men and women in the revolutionary period, but I didn't see anything here. I once went to Herbert Marcus' lecture, which ended with a long Q&A; the last question, from an audience member who is much older than the rest of us, is that he had gray hair, "Why are revolutionary so gloomy?" He was hooted and Marcus didn't want to answer it seriously, but that's the only thing I remember all night. Rohmer demonstrates that revolutions are also gloomy and didactic. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 8/11/2002)
