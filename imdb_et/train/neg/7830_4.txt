So far, Nightmares and Dreamscapes have been insecure and disappointing. The first segment managed by Brian Henson could have been a little revolutionary story or real fears, but at least it was well-managed, varied and visually interesting, William Hurt's firm action and very impressive special effects in the mini series. <br /> <br /> However, the second story of the series was just terrible and not good. The scenario is bad, insisting that the low, unlikely protagonists act insecurely to move the plot and have letters that are endless and endless for exposition. Action is superfluous and convincing, and I felt much more empathy with the cold blood killer in the first story than the newborn couple. The director used millions of tricks to capture the narrative, but for amateur action and writing, the latest film school project, where the camera moves in its own interest and with little or no tension, seems to be the end result. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the series continues like this, I'll be serious. I look forward to William H. Macy's contributions and hope that he will get a decent leader and screenwriter for his segment. So far, the quality is too inconsistent to predict.
