Since I sat under this television mediocrity, I wondered why? Why did Dianne Keaton agree with this waste? The movie uses pointless, thoughtful plot lines to bring thousands of homes to the trash. The film will take a new level of political agenda. The film was meaningless and all the credibility was lost due to excessive use of the stereotype. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that Keaton was trying to value this movie, but in the end he must keep in mind the age-old announcement that you can't burn. I hope you will not waste your New Year's Eve by looking at the other TV movie's pointless. Now I know why nets started to incite a series on Sunday evening to get rid of the trash!
