This failure of the ABC live broadcast does not give any justice to the glorious fantasy novel that is A wrinkles over time. Mrs Madeleine L'Engle brought children and adults to a magical, fantastic and original world like no author before her. This novel, the first in his "Quartet", is beautiful in life, in the universe, and by himself. However, it is easy for every child or adolescent to understand. Its steadfast morality has spread throughout the book. This customization of the film can be seen as a mockery of L'Engle's work of art. Honestly what did they mean? The effects seem cheap and ridiculous, the plot is bright and uneven, the dialogue is far removed and the magic attribute of almost every novel is gone. It was a terrible attempt to bring this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that a few days will make an intelligent, worthy director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuar√≥n) another attempt to bring this book to the screen and understand what it really is: a masterpiece. This adaptation can only be compared to dull, fake and cheap motel rooms that have no basis and no effect on the audience.
