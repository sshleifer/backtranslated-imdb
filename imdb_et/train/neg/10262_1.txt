Now, flicked this just curiosity and I had to watch - just as you look at a car accident ... <br /> <br /> I appreciate that it is a fraud, but it shouldn't stop I do not criticize the terrible leadership, action and dialogue. Seriously, this is one of the poorest movies I've seen - it seemed like Cryptkeeper's Tales episode and poor on it ... <br /> <br /> Okay - some criticism (1) when a doctor had a heart attack monster (we didn't see the monster ever, so we assume it is a heart attack), then the army launches pistons, rockets, bullet monster - what was the doctor's feet - but the doctor doesn't touch any rocket and it's still alive (2) army attack about 100 meters away and we see a flame thrower - geez, their range of things up to 30 meters! (3) when a monster tries to get a professor, the soldiers drive to the classroom and come to the ceiling; Monster falls on child and soldiers do not try to shoot the monster? come on! (4) The monster looks like Power Rangers! (5) There is one scene where five "good guys" (priest, girl, doctor, reporter and child) are all shocked and we get one after the other (by hand) - so natural! (6) the general just runs away, from time to time (7) refuses to try out electricity from the public, and does not listen (8) the actor is terrible (9) I mentioned the rubbish monster ???? (10) this godly music, non-stop!
