No wonder this film never saw the light of day. The timing of the release was terrible. The Gong exhibition was already "jumping shark" until the movie came out, so who would pay the money to see some censored video from the original show? And the exhibition clips are just a little bit of Cheth Barris's pathetic 90-minute beating about how hard his life was as an exhibition provider. Did he really expect us to know his life and that of his confused millionaire? Did she really think we wanted to even know her life? (Obviously, since he later wrote his strange autobiography about his career as a CIA operative.) Did he think that listening to everyone, wherever he was listened, would remain fresh for 90 minutes? Or the network manager who grabs him every step of the way? It could have worked as a 30-minute sitcomepis scheme but not as a full-length movie. But it was nice to see Rip Taylor, Gene Gene and the Unknown Comics (although they only included his most vulgar routines to make the "spicy" movie.) And, as someone else has pointed out, this is Phil Hartman's first important part of the movie ( although it only lasts a minute. Please note that her name is written on HARTMANN's credit, which is her name. You cannot leave your voice and facial expressions even though she is much thinner and younger than on SNL days. Ed Molinarol (Hill Street Blues ) is also a small part, one of his first after leaving the soap world.
