A couple of farmers are fighting in a small village in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) buys O-Lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (Luis Rainer). American stars appear in leadership roles, talk about counterfeits and emphasize old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. A good woman, many children and earth are the best things for men. They are considered real estate and investments. Because it is a big budget movie where many extras work together, big kits are built and special effects are taking place, filmmakers can't risk hiring less popular actors. Luise Rainer won the Academy Award for this result, which is definitely the worst film. His unchanging face builds a barrier between him and the audience. O-Lan should be the heart of the family and the best sympathy. On the other hand, Paul Muni gives a better result, showing his talent again. Another problem with the movie is the end. It seems Franklin didn't know when to finish the picture. This film can be dangerous if it is considered a true example of Chinese culture and tradition.
