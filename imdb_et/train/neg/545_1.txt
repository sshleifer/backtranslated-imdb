it's just plain Indian rubbish that turns out to be a cinema because the Indians can proudly boast that we have the biggest cinema industry, but it's the worst. <br /> <br /> How other poor countries can film characters that challenge the views of these societies with a real movie, and we continue to pump the garbage. Take a look at Russia, Iran, China and Latin America, watch the great movies they have, and get just like Kisna !! <br /> <br /> To get real people, it's no wonder the international community generally laughs at Indian cinema.
