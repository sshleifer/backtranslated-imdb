This flick reminds me of really bad science fiction in the 1950s and '60s. It's not scary or interesting, but it's boring, cheesy and stupid. The peculiarities are ridiculous, all the actors are ridiculous and the end is just terrible. waste your money, rent or buy something better. I give him 3.5 out of 10 (I found this turkey quite amusing because of this stupidity).
