Although I have enjoyed Bing Crosby in other films, I find this film to be a particularly grateful. Perhaps because I am from another era and from another country, but I found Crosby's constant references to good old USA pleasing at first, trit after a while and then finally annoying. Don't do me the wrong thing - I'm not a non-American - but it seemed that English couldn't do anything right and / or needed that brave, so smart American visitor to show them the way. This is the "fish of the water" story, but unlike most of these films, this time it's the "fish" with the upper hand. To be fair to myself and the movie, I watched it a few times a few times and I got the same impression every time. <br /> <br /> (Last night I saw another Crosby movie - Caesar's Waltz - and also what gave me the same reaction. And to my surprise, my wife - who is America for that value - found that American Crosby attitude is irritating to your face. Roosevelt, as he said.) <br /> <br /> With regard to the premise of the film, it is unique to your day and supportive casting is, of course, very good. Landscape and music are also good, as are big costumes - although I agree with the previous reviewer that William Bendix's wig looks terrible (picture Moe of The Three Stooges). <br /> <br /> All for me, this would be a much nicer picture without Bing Crosby's attitude, but since it is practically every shot, it's quite difficult to sit through this movie.
