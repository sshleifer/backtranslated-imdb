From Shrek's creators, who grabbed my attention, Shrek's creators also got Madagascar. Madagascar was half as good as Shrek. <br /> <br /> And now Flushed Away is half as good as Madagascar. <br /> <br /> That means Flushed Away is not good. Animation and all the special effects were very good, but the movie wasn't. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie was only for children. This is not a serious way for adults to really love this flick. <br /> <br /> But adults had a lot of fun. I bet kids don't understand jokes. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I like this flick. <br /> <br /> I'm totally disappointed. 4/10
