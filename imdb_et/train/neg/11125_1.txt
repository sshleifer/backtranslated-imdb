Listen, deal with it, there are much better black American difficulties than that. Although I think this story is weak, my criticism is focused on the bad performance that I mentioned, blowing. <br /> <br /> It was done in the mid-80s and is a terrible music / score department. It's funny to see Oprah as the last day's cracking whore type. <br /> <br /> Scene where the biggest things put Elizabeth McGover in the kiln. Clean classic cinema. First of all, I don't care if you're drunk, you react to the flame of 1200F (no matter how bad your action is). But they really milked this scene ... it was comic. I tell you what, I was very pleased when I saw Elizabeth McGovern artificially burning death; he irritates me.
