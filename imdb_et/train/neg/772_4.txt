This movie is not as good as all the movies of Christ I've ever seen. And I'm quite surprised that in this story Pilate wants to stop Jesus when Scripture (as well as other films) is said differently. There is also no very important question: Resurrection. No other film leaves this very important part: the faith of all our Christians lies in this case. As Paul says in his letter, "If Christ has not risen from the dead, our faith is void." A very impressive scene for me in this film was to see the streets of palm trees used to enter Jesus' Jerusalem. Finally, and contrary to my Jewish co-rapporteur, Jesus is not a myth. And actually he was JEW. There are many documents (relgious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary person (or if I should say that God becomes a human being) who really changed humanity. I urge him (if he is a historian) to read about Flavius ​​Josephus, the commentator of the first most brilliant Jew. Century.
