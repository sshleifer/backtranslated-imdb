When this film appeared in 1997, "special effects", as they were, were bad. They would have been dated even in the 1980s and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s had the same or better SFX work. Certainly, no one was looking for an Oscar in the production of this film. This is a wild departure from the usual things of director Fred Olen Ray, most of which have the title "Bikini" (Bikini pirates, Bikini chain gang, lost planet bikini girls, etc.) and little more than R&D tabs, but here we have a movie rated "U" with children. You have to give him a loan to diversify! It was a small direct-video cult hit that later led to a couple of sequels - Invisible Mom 2 and Invisible Dad. Dee Wallace-Stone (whose career went down after 1982) plays the title of the movie "Invisible Mother" and returns to the offspring Russ Tamblyn (whose career has been in free fall for even longer since 1961) West Side Story ") plays poor Dr. Woorter. It is probably fair to say that most of the casts were in their career where they would be willing to work almost everything to pay this month bills - except maybe a young Trenton Knight. this artwork again after the sequel, "Invisible Mom 2." Perhaps this movie was cursed. For a child's actor, he's pretty good - not better or worse than any of his more experienced stars. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, there are "invisibility" effects to say the least, the direction is bad, writing is obvious and nothing writes home rss movies out there though, and for anyone who is under ten, this movie is undoubtedly traceable. which adults probably want to make their disappearance when it is turned on, and I don't blame them!
