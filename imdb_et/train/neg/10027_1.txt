Action in this movie captures Sunny bhai Gadaris. Akshay Kumar has the Leonid superpowers in 300, Neo Matrix with Spiderman and Superman. This is fun. Except for the typical Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor comedy, there is nothing positive about this film. The story looks like the writer told his tenth old son to write. The film is so unrealistic that Anil Kapoor's long shot shooting with a gun is the least error of the director. Except for the directors Tashan to make this movie, there is no other Tashan. I'm sorry to waste money on this money and I don't recommend it to anyone. 1/10 is at least what I can give to IMDb, or I would give it to zero.
