My favorite memory for this show and the band was when I got together with my friends who are NBB angry and had a big campfire, and took our CD and movie DVDs and a lot of pictures of the band members and threw them into the fire and danced a happy trap burning things, singing "Ding Dong Witch Is Dead". It was the best thing in the show and this exhibition is stupid when this exhibition is an exhibition of God. I hate it so much. Free the dirty car. You guys really do! You destroyed the whole channel! No offense or anything, but you have to get out of life, I mean, who makes a stupid show with a foolish singer who can't even sing! You guys really are terrible and you need a life like a hobo or something except Roselina. She's really beautiful. But still, you guys!
