This self-proclaimed "very talented artist" has easily managed the worst Spanish film of the 21st century. The lack of emotions, coherence, rhythm, skill, humor ... it repeats the same situation over and over again. It does not show the evolution of character. It doesn't even show any violent and / or sexual content, and it doesn't add anything new to the psycho-killer sub-wall. So flat this should be shown in film schools as an example of "what not to do" in the first film. <br /> <br /> BTW, where the hell is "talent"? there are scenes that are almost identical; there are scenes with two or more master pictures, and it is quite terrible to see that one main team jumps without reason. The camera almost never moves like a "very talented artist" fearing the lack of visual skills. Mainstream actors act like amateurs and the support form is hardly believable. The script has more holes than the plot (if any) ... <br /> <br /> A really unpleasant film and all talented director.
