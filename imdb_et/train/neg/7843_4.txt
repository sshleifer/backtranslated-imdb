This is a weak sequel: it lacks the "Man Called Horse" interest and light touch in almost every aspect, and it doesn't seem to be the same genre as compared to each other. <br /> <br /> Feedback is almost the first parody and attempts to induce various Indian ceremonies, but it is so difficult to put the first magic on the bottle. In this film, the tribe is lost and abandoned, having lost its homeland, today has been attacked by paradise and living in extreme misery and poverty. Perhaps this is the point: the first film took us to the place where we would like to be, a simpler time. This leads us to the broken Indian children in the world, and the White Man is a hero and savior who rather denies the whole idea of ​​the film. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the first beauty was that the white man learned and discovered that true civilization lies in values ​​rather than Western materialism. The second film has it all, but there was no and so we get a weak movie. <br /> <br /> Great disappointment.
