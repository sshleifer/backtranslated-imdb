This movie is not very good. It's boring and not much blood for horror. Plot just trods with not much happening. And I think the female vampire was so stupid. He had many opportunities to kill vampire hunters because it shows he has lighting like reflexes. But if he has one of them, he just takes his time and something happens whenever he doesn't bite them. No wonder it went straight to the cable. <br /> <br /> END VERDIK: Not as good as the first vampire movie. You're SUCKER when you're wasting that time.
