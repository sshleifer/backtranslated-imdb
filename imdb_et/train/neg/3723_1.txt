The sects that benefit from this film are well known for their claim to take the Bible's message without any change or biblical influence. The existence of this film is only due to the fact that there is no such thing. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what Christianity was born in the seventies, just look at the word "rapture" in the glossary of culture and sects. It's faster than sitting on cellulose waste. <br /> <br /> Poor performance, uneven sound quality and script just as easily written with Jack T Chick (a paranoid Christian conspiracy theorist for those who don't know the Evangelical scene). You couldn't really put it into a "bad good" category, so its only audience is those who have a brochure collection that wants to branch out or be extremely paranoid.
