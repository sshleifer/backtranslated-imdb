Minimum script, minimal character development, minimum persistent camera. Maximum stretched scenes, maximum headaches that cause nervous zooming, maximum characters that move around in the forest and do nothing. Until 12:01, the time flashes, you can't move on, because there are three hunters we don't know. To be fair, the film has some musical music that was interesting, so maybe it would have been possible to do it with a music video. Unfortunately, this was not the case, and which should have been twenty minutes long, stretched incredibly. Forget "Trigger Man", I know I'm trying. - MERK
