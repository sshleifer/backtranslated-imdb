I first saw music at the Denver Center for Performing Arts, and it was absolutely delightful, stunning, and was so fantastic in plot and dialogue continuity that I liked it much more than most of the musicals I saw on stage. Interestingly, you never have to see Zach's face. He was always in the dark, but his presence was powerful and led the whole production line. When I heard they made this movie, I waited with breath, but when I looked at the movie version, I was so disappointed that I felt cheated on me. The film lacks the enchanting mood of living products, and it will never let you be fully associated with each character. Personally, I would like to see the live version again and if it ever revives, I would recommend that you go your way to see it. This is one of the most memorable experiences.
