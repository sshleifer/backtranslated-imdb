It was a popular movie, probably because of the humor, the fast-developing story, the character of the underworld, which closes all loudmouths, and so on. The funny thing is that you couldn't make a movie with this title when someone replaced but "white", as other police think racist. However, Woody Harrleson is a white boy who turns out to be as good or better than any black basketball player, as he is his main opponent, Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br Snips had many funny lines that offered a lot of humor. The bad part of the movie - which doesn't care about many people - is extreme embarrassment here and all the characters. This includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There are no really clean, nice people in this movie. For this reason, I can't honestly recommend a movie, at least not to friends or those who have offended a lot of richness
