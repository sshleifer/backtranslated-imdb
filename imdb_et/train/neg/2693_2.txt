<br /> <br /> Although the leader's actor is STRIKINGLY beautiful, the plot has little chance of being accepted, because the details about paying too much attention are facing the audience at the time of opening the story. <br /> <br /> One might think that middle-aged teenage school girls in the 1950s easily gave up their innocence without thinking of 30-year-old marriage, which they hardly know, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Young high school teenagers are thought to be very confident and confident as they interact with their parents in difficult social situations, but my experience has been that teenagers feel very uncomfortable and clumsy when they are adults in the world. One might think that an experienced doctor does not know the sharp odor of Stroptomycin - a glowing fermentable earth's crab microbial by-product - and does not find that any inanimate stupid powder is fake, but I don't think so. br /> <br /> It may be thought that 30-year-olds may enter and keep in school during a social school and have problems, but I think the school society is a traditionally protected environment and parents, cabarons and school workers would be to avoid. <br /> One last well, the whole Hey Babu Riba, referred to four teenage friends as a foursome. There is probably an explanation as to why VIIS was fourth, but since it was never detailed, every reference interferes with each scene. <br /> <br /> This movie wasn't right for me.
