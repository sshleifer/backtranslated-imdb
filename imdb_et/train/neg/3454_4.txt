Cutting is trying to be like most of Scream's slashers' aspirations, the horror of the horror game that was trying to be by other famous horror films. Now, I'm not packing "Scream" because I think "Scream" is a very good horror movie that does a great job of mixing horror and comedy. The cut fails at most levels. It has its own moments, but in general it just doesn't work, not even "so bad it's a good" movie that is below average. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes are so OK and pretty good, except for the fact that Kylie Minogue can't really act, and ironically she gets her tongue out. Go ahead for a while and the group of film students want to finish their movie, which is probably cursed. And as you have probably predicted, cast and crew members are slowly being pushed by the madman. <br /> <br /> Unigiginal plot, bad action, and predictable end are some of the following. There are many references in the film, everything from "Scream" to "Texas Chain Saw Massacre". It's not wise too, it seems the director wanted to feel smart when he mentioned other famous horror flicks area Scream. For Sloher, there is minimal gore and nudity, which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that hasn't done that much. Really, I should support this movie because I'm Australian and we are not as good as horror (we still have gems), but Cut is definitely not one of them. <br /> <br /> But it kept me from watching for 90 minutes, so it's at least something good. I do not recommend it to anyone other than hardcore fans who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to achieve, but if you are looking for a good movie, leave it away. <br /> <br /> 2/5
