Frankly speaking, it is easily in the top 5 of the worst films. Partially, because it takes itself so seriously, not in a normal, light-hearted bin, these films want you to be emotionally connected, know the characters, and take care of the alleged conspiracy. None of them ever happened. <br /> <br /> **** MILD SPOILERS ****** <br /> <br /> There are three main reasons why this movie is so terrible: 1.) An indiscriminate and totally insensitive plot. 2.) The annoying style-over-substants "MTV" camera. 3.) Moronic characters and plot holes. <br /> <br /> Let me work out. <br /> <br /> 1.) When making these films, they could not decide whether to make a film of conspiracy, stigma, or possession of the church. So, guess what? They joined them! Aetheus becomes a dead man who makes him a stigma to expose the conspiracy of the church. How an ordinary person can pass on death and another reptile through his rose hair has never been explained or even spoken. Now, instead of just saying what he wants to say, he gives him Stigma. WHY? Why not just spit it? Instead, the mind is treated with screaming scenes of harsh voices, carpeting of car messages and writing messages on the walls. Obviously, this priest was also a violent man, because the overwhelming young lady is also out of one character, speaking the same clich√©, harsh, "possessed" voice that we all have heard countless times. It will also relate to my second complaint, because when a young lady gets a stigma, she also fires the laws of gravity in the air and throws everything and everyone around her as if they were in an earthquake? Why does this happen? Who knows!?! I think the director thought it seemed "cool". <br /> <br /> 2.) This film contains dozens of pictures, slowly, naturally from birds that do not go out and fly, and most annoyingly, dripping water. This woman's apartment is constantly dripping water! Permanently! Of course, the place would probably break with its many holes. In conclusion, this complaint ends and for absolutely no reason the camera cuts images that drip slowly, in the opposite direction! WHY!?! I have no clue! It doesn't matter, and again, I bet because the director thought it seemed "cool". <br /> <br /> 3.) One of the main characters says he became a priest explaining science. It's not reasonable for me. I think it is enough to go to church, but no, he has to go through to become a priest. I just don't buy it. Secondly, there are lots of holes in the plot, some of which I work on below. For starters, when he first gets stigmas, the scene ends with his subconscious, bleeding. Then he's in the hospital. Who called the ambulance? The second is to the end when the aforementioned "scientific priest" deals with the spirit of a girl. He says, "Take me as your messenger!" Not a word to quote a word, but you get that idea. His answer? "You have no faith, but no doubt!" So he has a thief! The apostle has no faith, much less than any scientific priest! And then there is the fact that the conspiracy of this movie, this lost gospel (St. Thomas, in my opinion) is available at local bookstores. The characters are ready to kill to repel the document, but you can walk to the bookstore and buy it. Perhaps it should happen in an alternative history where it is not well known, but the film never tries to tell us, nor even the tips that it is an alternative to discovering this document. Finally, this movie is terribly remarkable. It is my army-nemesis that I feel the need to offend all possibilities. I created it. Final class: F
