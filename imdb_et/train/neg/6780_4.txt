This film was critical and a ticket office fiasco in 1957. It was based on a novel that later turned into a game that flipped from Broadway. The story speaks of a naval officer leaving the World War II in San Francisco. They have a 4 day vacation that they spend at the Mark Hopkins hotel. The film comes up a lot and no character seems very real. Cary Grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama, but here she plays a sort of wheeled dealer and she really doesn't pull out. Tony Curtis or James Garner would have been better choices. Audrey Hepburn was originally set to play with Grant, but had other responsibilities - so Suzy Parker stepped in. He had never been before but was America's largest photo model at the moment. I think he did a good job with the pressure he was still in. Linking Grant to Jayne Mansfield for a short scene - didn't really work. The studio tried to give Grant a class, but the character had no substance.
