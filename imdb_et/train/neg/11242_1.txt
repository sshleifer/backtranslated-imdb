I saw this movie in a hidden preview last month and I went out. It was quite terrible. Trying too hard, they made over and made a terrible movie. I was disappointed because I felt that all the actors had made respectable choices in the past so that it couldn't be far from the mark - but I was wrong. I was hoping that they would issue a study at the end of the movie so I could tell them that he didn't release that movie. I liked the free aspect of the preview, but it turned out to be a waste of my time - and I am usually very amused. He was trying to be innovative and creative with pictures, ideas and filming, but because they threw so many ideas at once, it failed. I don't usually like movies, and I don't usually feel the need to give my opinions about movies, but I had to not warn everyone. I registered with IMDb to tell you all
