I can't believe it was the worst film I've ever seen in my life. I laughed a few times. (probably because it was stupid) If someone paid me this movie again, I won't. The plot was so terrible, it didn't make sense, and the actor was so bad that I couldn't even tell if they were trying. this movie was a terrible rating: F
