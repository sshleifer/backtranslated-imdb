This exhibition comes from interesting places as fast as a travel channel. It is a reality, but in reality it is a clean first soap opera. It tries to use exotic places as a facade to bring people to fake competition and then come to seize the viewers' soap opera style. <br /> <br /> He also borrowed the Beat The Clock, a pioneer in showing early CBS, inventing situations for his competitors to try and overcome. Then it will pay the winner money. If they can spice it up with little interaction between the characters, even better. Although the game format is slow compared to Beat The Clock, its real achievement is to escape from reality. <br /> <br /> This exhibition contains many elements of successful past programs. Reality television, barely, but if your hook is a contestant, a locale or a contest, it's your cup of tea. If you are not, this whole series is like I say, dipping with chestnut sauce. This is another example that hides behind the reality label, which is the trend it started in 2000. <br /> <br /> It is slippery and well produced so it can last longer. After all, so does Gilligan's Island, Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies & Brady Bunch. It just doesn't use professional participants. The level of intelligence is about the same.
