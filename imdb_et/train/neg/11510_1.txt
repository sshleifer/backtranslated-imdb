It's not my fault. My girlfriend made me watch it. <br /> <br /> There is nothing positive about this movie. For many years, the idea is that Madonna could act, but she can't. It has been an idea for years that Guy Ritchie is a great director, but he's just in the middle. Embarrassing the whole ring. <br /> <br />
