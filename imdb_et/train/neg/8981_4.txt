OKLAHOMA! / ANNIE this Paramount version / ripoff is not so unusual or innovative. Marketing and intro comments can be there to save what is really a pretty movie musical western sound that is recorded on the audio track and like live TV. I can't find the use of background cyclone that is illuminated in different scenes in yellow or pink or red, or ... it's all innovative. As mentioned, it seems to me more than a film produced in the TV budget: all the tracks, with minimal sets supported by illuminated cypresses! (Compare with NEW FACES (1952). Participants come out pretty well. And this style was much better understood when Paramount shot L'L ABNER in 1959. This film often refers to a recurring question: "What were they thinking?"
