It makes one wonder how this exhibition is still in the air. There has been a couple who have stayed together, married and have children, but everyone else is broken. What is the point of continuing? The exhibition may be fun at the beginning. You see that all the girls from each other over one man, that almost all of them like instantly. It's like in real life! The girls are going to take the parties, lick each other and show their true clear (or so we think). But the fact that one person is left to decide who to choose what he thinks he can marry and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> What is true love exactly? How can you fall if you are forced to choose them? This show is incredible. You thought the network was unsuccessful, but people have to go to TV to find love? This is not realistic. How could a girl be with her husband when she goes out with other people, preparing them? None of these questions have been answered and, finally, when the show ends, you know that in the future there will be no happy ending. Everything we know is all written.
