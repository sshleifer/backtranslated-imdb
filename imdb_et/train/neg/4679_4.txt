What a terrible movie. Don't do it wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but in addition to some interesting works, the film is mostly involved in hysterical submarines, who scream, cry, sweat and generally err if something goes wrong. /> <br /> Take it aside for the audience to understand what is happening (a scene where Denzel Washington explains to the radio repairman how he must be like Scotty Star in Trek, nothing more than a joke) and you let yourself be a fooled thriller not worth doing. <br /> <br /> We just hope that the true nuclear force of the US Navy is not in such a script! <br /> <br />
