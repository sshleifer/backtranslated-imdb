A romantic and profoundly false vision of the middle class "artist" who has a comfortable upbringing ... It is clear that the writer-director never suffered direct unemployment and certainly has no personal experience. If you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story, unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers, have no anger, no fear, no frustration, etc. All the characters live through worship, boys' jokes throughout the day. They never look for work, they never experience rejection or distress, etc. Living in a dool is almost like a summer break from school ... ridiculous. Especially when compared to contemporary masterpieces similar to Ken Loach et al.
