Please don't waste your time. This film restores the worst Bram Stoker Drakula (Van Helsing), Anne Rice's Vampire Lestat (rock music and foolish Bible handbooks) and Blade (high-tech toys). I really like vampire movies and novels and there are many that are very good. But not that stink. Not even the soundtrack does it mostly because the film is more for ridiculous classical music than for some "kick-ass metal". Only a few times I heard some metal; mostly it was tortured violins. Avoid it like garlic and crucifixes.
