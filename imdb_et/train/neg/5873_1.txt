I don't know what they meant. They think someone even remotely connected to this disaster. I've seen so bad movies, I've seen really bad movies and then it's here too. the one who wrote the script is forced to put what could write the most intuitive dialogue on the screen. There is nothing good about this film, either from a technical point of view or from another point of view. should have been released immediately. There are some quite well-known names in this movie. In fact, I'm afraid to use the word movie.it more than a set of random scenes that have nothing to do with another and make less than 0 sense.anyway, I don't see why anyone with any dignity would appear in it. I got it really cheap and I still got ripped. If I had received this movie for free, I would still be ripped. This is an absolute 0/10
