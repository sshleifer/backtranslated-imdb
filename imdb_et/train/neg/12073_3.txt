*** SPOILERS *** With the recent gathering of Christopher Dean, John Carradine, family members and servants to hear his last will and will, they will be somewhat surprised that the dean's luck, about $ 140 million. The money is shared between them, but only after they spend the week successfully at Dean Manor. The story seemed to be a story when we later discovered that it was really a night's sleep, not a week's rest, in the mansion, so that guests could get Dean money, because almost everyone came dead from sunrise. <br /> <br /> The first victim of Dean Curse has nothing to do with the legacy of Christopher Dean, a local sheriff, Dan Garcia, Rodolfo Acosta. Acostal is finely chilled and then served on a plate of shocked guests. Later in the evening, there is a lovely little Chin Greg and Laura, Jeff Morrow & Marry Anders, little pet poets who are dead in the ponds. <br /> <br /> The movie has all the people who are left in Dean Mansion. one by one, until it turns out who the killer really is. Then that's what seems to be a story with a double twist, where the original killer is suddenly killed with the last two guests. The actual killer not only reaches the entire loot, up to $ 140 million, but ultimately does not have to share it with his companion by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot. Nonsense who did it, and haunted the house, the movie with immoral and improbable characters, that even a mother, much less audience, would be in difficulty. In the case of a movement involving selective guests, everything that can be thought of includes S&M sadism and, of course, double treatment and upside down, not even murder. You just don't care about who's living to collect Dean's treasure at the end of the movie, hoping for all the hopes, but none of them do it. <br /> <br /> Even the big surprise is not at the end. t really such a big surprise, because the killer's identity is published with the filmmaker who has forgotten to keep his face hidden, so you actually see who he is even before he opens himself! Then we have a plot twist that eliminates the killer with a number of other guests to make the movie a little more confusing than it already is. The final twist of the plot, which you can see as far as ten miles, was just to show how intelligent the very obvious killer who fooled almost anyone despite the film.
