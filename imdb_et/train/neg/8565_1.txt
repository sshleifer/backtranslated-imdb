Sorry. Someone has to say that. This is really a boring movie. Maybe it is worth, but boring. I looked at it almost as boredom. Action is a rather terrible, outlined and predictable story, score and camera-work perfectly standard and unmistakable. This is one of those films that you must not hate (because it is disabled), but I hate to suspect that almost everyone does it. Interestingly, the critics are so kind about the film. I think they too are not allowed to be objective. This was done to win the prizes - I remember that it was done properly. But it wasn't interesting or fun. I haven't seen this game that can't be compared.
