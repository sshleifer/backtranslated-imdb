I read all the comments here after watching movies, and it took at least 2 pages to find out that no one else thought this terribly unpleasant assembly was not a sense of humor in the 70s or even any other era! If this is not the least funny sketch * comedy *, I've ever seen it until it comes. Half of the sketches were already done (and endlessly better) with operations such as Monty Python and Woody Allen ... If I would like to say that a nice animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlighting of the movie that it still can't reach almost this 75 minute useless and troublesome ride is. Seminar comedy? Only in a world where insemination is actually sperm. Scatological humor? Only in a world where scat is actually faeces. The predecessor jokes? Only when we think it is a manual on how not to do comedy. Tits and sticks and odd beaver. Nice ... if you're a hairy boy with at least one hands free and haven't found Playboy there. Give it a break because it was the beginning of the 70s? Not possible. At least ten years ago, comedy was outlined. The only way I could even forgive this movie is when it was at the gunpoint. Retro? Hardly. Some circles may have hostile perverting clown sketches (and may actually be funny), but it just gets really sad. What kept me all over 75 minutes? Just believing that they could finally have fun with real jokes. I gave movie 1 because there was no lower score ... and I can only recommend it to insomniacs or coma patients ... or maybe also people who suffer from blockage ... their jaws are finally in an unholy state.
