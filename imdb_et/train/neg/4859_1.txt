You must admire the director Todd Sheets for his dedication, driving and enthusiasm when it comes to making films: between 1985 and 2000 he made 34 films. Unfortunately, if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is something they should go to, they are probably all nonsense (and a quick look at these IMDb ratings seems to confirm my hunch). <br /> <br /> Part 3 is seen by the attacking group of students who find their detention less frequent after the dead hordes of living dead have escaped from top secret military bases directly under their school. Brian Eklund's terrible scenario (based largely on f-bomb liberal use) gives the director another embarrassingly amateur effort that includes some sensationally terrifying performances of his talented, terrible visual effects (some crap CGI) and looks like the front of a giant cardboard room) and his trademark, which is a dirty gore (a handful of offspring pulled down from the clothes of his victims). Zombie Armageddon stops spoiling his life-long characters and persuasive undeads, ending with a time-travel / paradox twist that forces viewers to watch several torturing minutes from the start of the movie. Honestly ... once was enough, Mr. Sheets? What have we done to deserve it again?
