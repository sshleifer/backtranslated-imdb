I recently looked at Belle Epoque, thinking it might be great because it won the Oscar for the best foreign language film. I was a little bothered by the predictability and simplicity of the movie. Perhaps I had a conflict that, from the time the movie was filmed, it had fallen for beautiful women and eventually made a lot of good for a falling girl. After the predictability of the plot, some movie scenes in real time (such as certain wedding events) felt inappropriate. Sometimes the film was a little preaching in ideas, and in the Franco era it was a film and a church. The only thing the film had gone to was that the five-fold moments, the landscape and the Violeta character are strong and independent women at a time when women were not really related to their qualities.
