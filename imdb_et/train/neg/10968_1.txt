*** It contains many, many spoilers, not that it is all, so much so good that it is right. <br /> <br /> Oh my God, where do I start? Well, here - this is the first time I've ever come home from the movie and said, "I have to go to IMDb and write it now. This is the flick of the flick. <br /> <br /> * start digression * But let me just say one thing before i start. I'm not a Harvard-Art-Major-Film-Noir-Weenie (actually I went to college at Cambridge Mass Ave, where real smart people go without rich fathers and trusts, which should turn me dirty into a joke-amusing-love-comic book-movie census group and still hate this movie ...) My favorite preference is high-level cinema that includes Die Hards, Bond flicks, Clerks and The Graal. I wish Titanic would never have disappeared, not so much lost life, but so that we would not have received the film as a pile. And the only reason I look at a fun French art film is when there is a young and often abandoned Emmanuelle Beart I even gave it ximal overdrive in one of its valuable twenty-tenths of IMDb, for God's sake. So I'm as low as they come, so I'm not criticizing this movie because I'm looking for some cinematic excellence - because Elektra smells like a three-week dead goat. * Finish Digression * <br /> <br /> OK, there's so much badness to categorize. Here you go: <br /> <br /> MS. GARNER: One of the compelling reasons a man would like to see is to see a lot of hot JGar (I have no idea why my wife wanted to). I think that was the last sexier movie between this and "Finding Nemo". Do you know what red clothing she advertises in every good-looking ad? You see him twice - once at the beginning, one at the end. Bummer. For the rest, he basically looks at how Morrissey would look if he were a female - a lot of stripping and black clothes. What brings me to the amazing expression of JGar in his actions - ranging from "pouting" to "whipping and crying". Oh, God, you think he's still forced on Ben Affleck or something terrible. Wait, wait ... <br /> <br /> GREAT GUIDES / GAL: They show the same level of expression and ability to expect a little over-saturated grapefruit. Apart from at least JGar's performance, it doesn't get too badly. One boy's job is to stand and be huge, the other is to stand there and get out of it, and the woman's role is standing there and breathing and / or kissing people. They will be able to pull these strange fools out. The main bad guy is the hardest role - he must be ONLY ONLY a) he feels angry and b) appears in Asia. He does a good job. I think there was a fifth bad guy / gal, but my brain starts blocking parts of this movie in self-defense. <br /> <br /> PLOT TWISTS! This film has so many surprises as the speech of the democratic national convention. Let's just say - my wife, who has been in the US for only half a year and speaks only a small amount of English - whispered to me when the girl first appears in the JG pillow and I swear to God that I'm not doing it: "She's going to the house to kill the girl. And the father. " And this is before the father appears on the screen. Now, my husband is not stupid, but he has not given away gifts from him, and he had not been exposed to the Daredevil or comic book genre with zero. And he figured it out in .00015 seconds without prodding and prior information. This is a blatant manifestation of this film. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION BY RECOMMENDATION! OK, so it's a big guy in the movie. She can take a horseshoe rifle and kick off like a ribbon, and she can take the witch Electra stab to the chest and just bend the metal (or melt - or something - more defenses, thanks to God). But does JG jump on his head and explode? Achilles nose? OKAY! This is the nonsense stupidity of this film. <br /> <br /> Ack. I'm starting to get bleeding from the brain so I have to stop. But you are warned. If you have to deliberately trim your tires to avoid watching this movie, do it. And when Armageddon comes, please give it> before <appears on this DVD.
