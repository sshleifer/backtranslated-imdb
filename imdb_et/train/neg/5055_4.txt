Two years ago at Sundance, I loved Josh Kornbluth's leading debut-Haiku tunnel. So I was expecting my brother (and often co-workers) in Jacob's The Best Thief world. It is a seemingly good drama about a child who grows in the lower class of New York. The film is not without its bright moments. But sometimes it is too hard for Kornbluth to make it clear: life can be very difficult for some people. Life is not fair. <br /> <br /> The more subtle and important is our understanding that, despite all these somewhat harsh cultural bases and antisocial behaviors that they may create, these signs are not deficient in goodness and humanity. We can defeat our language and living conditions, but we cannot promote our intentions. In fact, in their struggle, keeping a family under such an accident is a certain nobility that most of us can hardly appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood and his compassion for the people is obvious. The characters are not very plausible. Writing is uneven. And the plot line is barely noticeable. And the most troublesome for many is that Kornbluth uses two young black boys imitating gangsta raps between scenes. For everyone: But although I do not question the potential realism of this phenomenon, I have the pain of seeing 5-year-olds who speak and talk to a sex woman. This is the value of an unnecessary shock and it is a forced borrowed interest.
