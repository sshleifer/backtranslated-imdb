Werewolf's eyes (1999) are a really bad film. The assumption was really good, but overall performance was just terrible. I wanted the filmmakers to take the time for this project instead of rushing it into production. Some blind guys get some new eyes, the bad thing is that they belong to the middle old werewolf. Nude things happen to guys when he becomes a joyful creature. Can he find treatment before his hot girlfriend finds out? Who is this strange little troll who helps him out and what's that female cop? If you really want to find out, look at the werewolves eyes! <br /> <br /> It's not a bad idea for a movie. I just wanted the filmmakers to spend a lot of time before they decided to shoot the movie.
