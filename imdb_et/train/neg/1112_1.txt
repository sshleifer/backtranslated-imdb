I like watching Western movies, but this movie takes a cookie. The script and the dialog are ridiculous. The act was terrible, where did they get? Music was OK, I have to say. Fortunately, I didn't buy or rent a movie, but it was now destroyed. <br /> <br /> I was at the beginning when a stranger (martin sheen) began to tell her story. I have to admit that I enjoyed the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex, where Hopalong took the finger of Tex and ordered him to practice for 40 years to reach his league. But that is where everything went after the pear. I had to watch the whole movie in the hope that it would improve, never.
