When I first saw this movie, I thought it was a good sasquatch movie. Usually, if you have these types of movies, your ONE is usually a sasquatch, but what is it like? 7 or 10 of them? Action was good, the plot was OK, I liked scenes where sasquatch kills the first victims, a very good camera work. I was expecting this to be an expensive movie, but it was very small. This movie was better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI channel really needs to do more sasquatch movies, I know the Sasquatch mountain really liked it, Abominib was not good, what I look at is OK, but the movie Sasquatch wasn't, but I don't watch it let me go back . This movie is a good rainy afternoon, but in other cases, no.
