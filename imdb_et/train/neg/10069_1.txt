It's a terrible movie. Yes, the girls are beautiful but not very good. A dog with a cowboy, with an Indian girl, would be interesting if the sex wasn't there. Well, okay, it may be interesting, but it is not because it is so badly paced and only partially acted. I can only imagine what the close faces of the dance trees saw on the big screen, probably more ridiculous than they do on television. (I don't even mention topless struggle between two women who are connected and spend all that chest on the chest. Never read it in the old western part) This is a film that requires the use of liberal advancement. /> <br /> I like schlock movies, but it's ridiculous. There is a reason I do not want to do this type of film and that they are not very good, the plot has a plot in the back seat. The original nudie cuties, as they were called, were originally nudist films or films that touched the touch, but as the adult industry grew, filmmakers began to try to be smart or tried to use something to put their pants in their seats. The smart ones were very few who were only caged with limited talent. Comedies often came out best when humor approaching tertiary level, infantile, but harmless. Something that can rarely be said about any other genre dressed as nudie. <br /> <br /> Ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces, but it's not made with Western or sex movies. <Br>> <br /> I don't have to watch it again. <br /> <br /> Apparently no one was interested in the movie's rapist and killer Bobby Beausole, a member of the Manson family arrested for murdering a school teacher long after filming. <br /> <br /> Of course, these things destroy the lives of some people.
