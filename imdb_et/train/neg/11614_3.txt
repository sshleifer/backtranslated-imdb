Lady in Cement is a true 60's social anthropology course. Writing, not acting, is central. Did I say - clean camp! Prepare that you are offended if you are a woman or gay. Broad and brisk are standard conditions, and gay baiting and bashing are represented by what they were on the day (camp). Most rows have been thrown away, although there are great performances by very few outstanding characters. The game scenes are everyday, but it's nice to see Dan Blocker playing a tough guy who likes to be tempted hard. And Lanie Kazan and Racquel Wales are at the cutting edge of their careers. It is amazing to note that they were both 28 years old and Mr. Sinatra was 53. Music Point, wait. . . was there a score? Well, you get a point. See it with friends who want to laugh. it's full of them.
