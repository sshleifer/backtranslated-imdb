Trying to take money with Deal Or No Dea and 1 Versus 100, this flat excuse for entertainment - Show me the money where 12 sexy "dancers" shine out of shiny red whore clothing. The competitor is given the beginning of the phrase, such as "Which team lost." three options, A, B or C, each complementing the phrase. The competitor has three options to answer one of these three choices. Recipient - William Shatner - asks his nasty emperor if he wants to "answer" and when a competitor says "yes" he chooses the "dancer" to whom he shouts: "Show me the money!" It opens a scroll with an amount, and if its answer is correct, it adds that amount to its winnings; if he is wrong, the amount is subtracted. (So ​​it is theoretically possible for a competitor to actually quit Shatner's money in case of this cumbersome attack.) There is also a "Killer Card" and if a competitor chooses a girl with this whistle, but she has responded correctly, nothing happens. When he's wrong, the game suddenly goes to death and has to answer another question. If he gets this one wrong, he misses something. <br /> <br /> Shatner, "let's dance" and Shatner, contestant and 12 dancers scream before the ad is launched. At the end of the show, Shatner asks the women the "last dance" and they all shake it even more. <br /> <br /> I will give the 6 episodes of this show the most, hopefully this pathetic show of apology. (It could have been worse - they could have accumulated to Cuban Gooding Jr to be a host, although I bet he is a better dancer than "Shat" as they call them today. - I was wrong! It only lasted for 5 episodes.
