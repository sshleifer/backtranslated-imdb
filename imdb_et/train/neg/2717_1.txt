Do we need a more narcissistic garbage in the Baby Boomer generation? Technically, I am Boomer, though at a time when all the "idealistic youths" of the 60s read Marx, burning their draft cards and extending the war that destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in the classroom. But I remember them well and 9 out of ten were just moral fools who believed something as long as it was destructive. <br /> <br /> This is just another self-educating child who has never grown up.
