There's a lot to say about the Las Vegas Lady. It's safe enough, but it's just over the 70's. The film is not as smart or sexy as it is trying to be. The plot has been restored to a tired old casino robbery strategy that has been made to death. Except for the Las Vegas Lady, I think the robbery site has been designed by a 3-year-old. The plan involves three women? The outside of the Circus Cicus building is unnecessarily and from the usual point of view, one of which is a waitress to blow his cover as soon as possible, and one to stand up for his splitting. That's pretty much. Complex, huh? Other than Stella Stevens and her above-mentioned breasts, the other women in the plot are not very memorable. The Las Vegas Lady cover stands for Stuart Whitman. If Stevens does not appear, his participation in the film highlights one of the most idiotic weapon struggles ever put on film. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie. It is that the 70s know that I always enjoy and some nice shots from Las Vegas around 1975. But the film itself is too boring to estimate higher than 4/10? and it is probably overestimating it. Finally, the Las Vegas Lady is a bit of a waste of splitting.
