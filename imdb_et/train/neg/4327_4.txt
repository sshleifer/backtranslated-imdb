Some amusing humor, some who fall gradually, some decent, some are quite cruel. This movie has just hit and missed, 12-year-old boys guarantee more than any other niche. <br /> <br /> The film's child actors are just uncomfortable. If you make family comedy, it's a problem. Beverly D'Angelo rises above the material to make it funny and dare to say it, human power in the midst of its mediocrity.
