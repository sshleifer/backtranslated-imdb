Bernard Rapp died last year and was a very cultured journalist. Cinema was one of his greatest passions (he put up a comprehensive glossary of global film) and so he had to use a camera at least once in his life. But the films he left left some cumbersome comments: "Tiré à Part" (1996), despite Terence Stamp's sensational performance, in depicting characters in a very cartoon, sleep Affaire De Goût (2000) was a butterfly thing even when Bernard Giraudeau gave a perverted result, "Pas Si Grave" (2003) was another abandoned, and "and Petit Jeu Sans Conséquence" is the same as its predecessors. This comic potential is little used. <br /> <br /> But the original idea was to predict a complex, spiritual comedy. Yvan Attali and Sandrine Kiberlin couples who invited their friends to move up in a complete manor house. To play with their guests, they pretend to be a company. And things do not go as planned, because their notice of separation does not surprise them. Two lovers will start thinking about the validity of their pair. <br /> <br /> Despite the lush landscapes and promising material he had at his disposal, Rapp's indivisible leadership is unable to give life to this game. unexpected consequences. The plot follows a well-worn pattern featuring well-known features and masks that are made public about who they really are. Oral or situation comic effects often fall. Poor editing disappears a little more from this bad habit of Rapping to cut down a lot of sequences. Even the sincere contribution of the actors to the venture is debatable. They seem to be bored and write their text as they live, especially Sandrine Kiberlain. The audience is about to catch up. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate to say this: Bernard Rappi's films have never lived with their intentions, as witnessed by "and Petit Jeu sans Conséquence".
