I've finished seeing the movie 10 minutes ago. If I still can't believe what I looked at. <br /> <br /> This is the worst EVER movie. If I read all the shortcomings in the movie, this review takes a lot of sentences (very bad mistakes because it is so bad). You have to be surprised by the skill-scripted rescue manuscripts. they didn't even know how to move. <br /> <br /> Ice is such a bad actor ... and the thing I don't understand is how the production wanted it to be a hero, but it is zero. <br /> <br /> of course, the main drawbacks are landing on 747, which only needs 3 or 4 tips sent to the sender, who lands the plane ... both the amazing and dead bods that had no blood at all. <br /> <br /> But I urge you to watch this movie because it's very interesting to see how bad it can get
