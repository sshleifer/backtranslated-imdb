I love horror films, with a small budget, in the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's ... but how can anyone think it's a very good horror movie? Let's compare it to utilities similar to headlines. haunting, changing, bright. or a similar technology-based horror film that was better at FAAAR (though it was FAR big), Demon Seed. OK, I'm fair .. let's compare it to horror movies made with the TV! don't go to bed .. waaay creepier and better. The Salem batch, the night stalker, the night gallery, doesn't even go to the basement or the crowhaven farm much better. * SPOILERS * First, as a good scene as a bloody shower scene, you have a scene like opening a scene .. oh boy! The Garden Hose is alive to flow some dirty teenagers! TERRIBLE. also what we understand about the house .. it must obviously use your camcorders to see what's going on and it's a very emotional house. not a spirit or a demon or unit, this is a house that is "possessed" but what? We believe that the inanimate object learned to love Suzie / Margaret, our main character? now i'm on suzie .. another scene that bothered me, this poor old crazy lady tells you she was your sister, pours her heart out, falls into a boiling pool, bothering in torment for 45 seconds and what the margaret is doing ? does he risk that his hands are burned to save this poverty in the elderly woman who warned that life? no, he's standing there and watches! it was mostly better than the average of the fear film, but it is positive. at least a more interesting and fun horror movie about a non-movie object that kills people, watching the deathbed: a bed that eats. I have the feeling that people who appreciate this have not been watching it very much, because it was originally broadcast or remembered by scaring them as children. this movie was pretty much worth it.
