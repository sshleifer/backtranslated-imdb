The main character name (Frau) is the German word "woman". I don't know if it was deliberate or not, but when I got it last year when it was shown, somewhat of a German audience at the Fantasy Film Festival. got the movie. Not that it tried to strangle, it's a terrible movie for heaven! Terrible movie in more than one sense. It is a disgrace that this assumption was wasted on the observer with terrible even unbearable moments (certainly not heart cancer!)! And it wasn't even necessary to show all the things shown. I do not even have a moral duty (because the films do not really have such a function or function) a discussion about what is shown here, but it is a new low for the entire torture movement that has grown in recent years!
