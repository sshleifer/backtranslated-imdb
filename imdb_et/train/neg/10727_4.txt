The film is only worth it if you stop it in half an hour. It starts with funny conversations at the bar and assumes that a good, funny story is coming. Well, I can tell you that it doesn't come. It will worsen within a few minutes of a movie that will question your patience as well as stigmatize the participants if you are unlikely to recognize it. In the interview, I heard that the director wanted to express in this film the sense of loss of identity that, according to him, is the majority of people in this globalizing world experience. I was surprised to hear it. Do I live in the same world where he lives? OK, many people are walking in the same outfits as me and listening to the same music and everyone, but that doesn't make me feel like losing my identity. What does Khrzhanosvky think that we are no more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch? Am I short-sighted or is he? <br /> <br /> Well my voice: The good start of the movie saves it 1, a decent 4 is my conclusion.
