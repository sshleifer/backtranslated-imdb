I don't know where to start, so I'll start from the back of this movie cover. "Alive combines Vincenzo Natali's cube tension with Kitamura's own Versus." I haven't seen Versus, so I can't comment on it, but I think Cube was a great movie that I recommend to everyone. In this case, someone is clearly "confused" with "boredom". <br /> <br /> I'm going on and destroying the whole plot, because besides being the holy Swiss cheese in the plot, it's a molded cheese and it's not worth spending the film, even if you don't know the plot in advance, so it doesn't matter. When I misunderstood the plot, it didn't hit me - it's probably because I had to open my eyelids. <br /> <br /> So American soldiers ever lost in Nevada in the UFO i Nambi desert. This probably makes sense because they are both deserts, so they are in the same place. Different continents or not. The monkey invaded the UFO and acquired something from an alien that was passed on to a Japanese scientist who had to live in the desert. What ever. An alien thing now goes on to all those who are "bloody" to kill the current host. The Japanese army wants to use it for military purposes, so they decide to switch to another guy from its current receiver (the researcher's daughter). But instead of just picking someone out of the army full of people who are bloody and already on the military side, they decide that it is probably a good idea to suppress some criminals. Oh, and the reason why they choose this particular offender's death is that he was the first person not to die as a result of a non-lethal electric shock, which is the usual method of implementation because everyone dies from the placebo effect when they get an electric shock. . I don't know if they are doing it so they can behave in the staff room, how everyone dies, though it's not deadly, or if they just want to reduce their electricity bill. <br /> <br /> Then the film will change what Matrix would have been if it were really flat, and the superfluous struggles will tear us into tears that seem like an hour. And wait, now they remember they already had a guy who was infected with an alien thing, so the whole movie until then was actually a waste of time and also a human life. Then everyone dies. End. <br /> <br /> Only one moment in the movie where I didn't want to go and sleep or eat was when the guy was fixed to the wall through a tube on his chest, and he hangs there and the other guy walks. The guy hanging on the wall says, "I'm hurt, shoot me". And the living guy looks at him, and it's not like he's an average guy or something, so he looks really sad and doesn't want the guy on the wall to suffer. So he puts it down. <br /> <br /> (Rhetorical break.) <br /> <br /> Maos. "Gee TODAY FREAKIN" HEAP ".
