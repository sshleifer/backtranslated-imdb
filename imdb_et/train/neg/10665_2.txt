About three minutes into this thing I started moving forward quickly, stopped only during nudity (why is it that bad films always contain such good pictures?). In ten minutes, I was ready and I wanted to get my money back from the rental store. People who write these films should punish MPAA. Come to the writers - bad guys ONLY get into the car with a bomb activated by a good boy remote control! So it has been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! Also, to add insult to injuries, "twisting" at the end was so formal that it could have come from a movie written over the past 25 years. Burt Reynolds was good, but he should focus on real movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a waste of time - Reach! Run away!
