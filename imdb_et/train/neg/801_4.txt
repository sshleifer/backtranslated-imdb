Despite his stereotypes, I thought this movie was pretty decent, and that was probably a low budget. much better than I thought it was. At first I was skeptical - the idea that a computer virus could also infect people seemed a little ridiculous to me. Finally, I thought the film dealt with the concept well (even if some scenes were little clich√©s). <br /> <br /> The cast was pretty good, and both drivers knew their roles very seriously. However, I couldn't think of Janine Turner being a bit of a look at Geena Davis. Maybe it's just her face or makeup, hair and clothes she had in that movie, but it always kept me behind. <br /> <br /> Although it is not a "black", or a great movie according to any standard, "Fatal Error" is an entertaining flick that keeps you up to the end.
