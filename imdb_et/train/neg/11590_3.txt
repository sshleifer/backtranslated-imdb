It is getting worse, the series has fallen seriously. The first two sequences were acceptable and since then we have seen a great, really terrible movie. Robert Englund gives another great performance as Freddy, but the rest can't work. The story is Alice, who has survived the previous part of the Nightmare series, once again found Freddy Krueger's deadly dreams. This time, a deliberate murderer strikes a sleepless child of Alice. His intention is to be born again in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice release his spirit to save his son? Check the first three, leave the next three and see the last one.
