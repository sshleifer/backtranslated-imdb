If you choose a film that I hope will be one of the factors you are considering, the film's participants have a reputation for influencing positively or negatively the moral structure of our society? This is not a political statement, it is a moral issue that affects society. If the comedian / actor makes a sexual and racist comment about the teenager and his father, we should ask ourselves (do I want to support this behavior)? In this case, Mr Foxx's social fabric that teaches our young people about wrong, bad behavior is that loving-goodness is better than hatred. Mr. Foxx should keep in mind that he is just entertainment and there is a lot that we choose. Saying that the damage won't get him out of the hook. It does not cause bad behavior and does not remove the bad behavior that it spreads to our young people. One way to stop this behavior is to stop that fan. No longer see what they are. We can't change them, but we can stop the fame we give them.
