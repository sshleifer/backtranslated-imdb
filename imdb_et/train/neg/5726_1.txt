The obvious b-class effort to cash in on the Hostel / Saw buzz, my expectations for this movie were low (really low!) And still managed to disappoint at every level. The action is so bad that it is not even funny, the plot line is non-existent and the only intimidation was to realize that I was watching it for 1 hour 21 minutes! I'm surprised that 34 people gave him a 10-star rating. I can only suspect that 33 of them are Cast and Crew. 34. is likely to be the mother of directors? - While I'm sure even it would be hard to go over 2! DVDs include the "make" function of the hour. What raises the question: "Why?" (although it helps show what not to do!). Avoid at all costs.
