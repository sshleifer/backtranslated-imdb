Raising Victor Vargas fails in what he is trying to do most: being real. Unfortunately, this film has no reality. Characters and situations feel completely artificial and fake. <br /> <br /> Cause? Bad routing. Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. It seems that Mr Sollett read somewhere that illuminating his film would give him an authentic feeling. Wrong! It just gives him a bad feeling. Similarly, camera shake does not give your movie a documentary style, but gives the audience headaches and worsens instead of what is on the screen instead of correcting it. <br /> <br /> Of course, the screen is so fake as Mr Sollett has written his script, the only purpose of which is to try to "hip" with his "Sund" friends and show how "edgy" is a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Overall, the only persistent impression this movie leaves will be that of a bad director, Sollett. Next time, how do I do some writing and tutorial classes?
