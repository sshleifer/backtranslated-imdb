If you want to look strangely filmed, strangely illuminated, strange stories of men (and one woman) who enjoy beating each other if you want to enjoy a story that doesn't come from these two men, one boxer and another gay man, then you should look at it movie. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I felt almost as bruised and cut as the film director. to defeat hell from me. <br /> <br /> This is a movie where one is not meant to look at the plot or to act heavily, it is a movie that is horrible and wonderful. Much like looking at an airplane crash or a train crash. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a great movie, a good movie, a B movie or even a mediocre movie, this movie is not. <br /> <br /> A warning to anyone who watches this movie, don't eat it before. You might want to drag the end of the movie.
