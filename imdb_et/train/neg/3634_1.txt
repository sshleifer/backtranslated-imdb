Bored child fantasy that gives Joan Plowright a stellar bill, but there's little to do. Sappy children continue their dreams. Frankie wants to be a ballerina and baseball player (yuk), while the best friend Hazel runs to the mayor --- she's 13! Completely pedestrian in every way, plus the shortcomings of syrupy performances by girls and baseball boys. Is there less effort for Showtime?
