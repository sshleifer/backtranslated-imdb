I can't believe that the city of Muncie is so hard to pay attention to torture herself, allowing her to go there. This exhibition is like a good law enforcement officer for the face of hell. I've never seen anything so stupid in my life. If they had paid for it as a comedy, which would be one thing, but to say it is a reality, there is nothing wrong. I saw it only once and was terrible what I saw. I wanted to see a little boy walking on a bad boy. What a joke it would have been. There was nothing near the show in the real world. The city of Muncie, the police commander, and all the officers should put their heads to shame, and they should never want to admit that they are coming from this city. No wonder it didn't stay on television
