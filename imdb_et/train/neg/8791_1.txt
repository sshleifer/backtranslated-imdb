Be warned! <br /> <br /> It's a mess that another mess can't even be with the business because it's under them! Okay, I got it, let me say something more meaningful. Due to the prestigious reputation of director Wong Kar Wai, the novel is a highly respected wuxia tome. Well, despite the fact that WKW has been unable to customize the novel on the screen according to many wuxia fans; mostly it is just dripping water, sweating, horse legs, etc. I couldn't sit on most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Fast years later, when I wanted to give Mr. Wong's films, he once again showed great praise, especially from Cannes. I was interested in her last, 2046. A friend told me to start Chungking Express because it is her most accessible film. So wrong! I was just p.o. that I got something for that time and wasting money on this pretentious. Some professional reviewers called it meditation alienation and loneliness in a modern metropolis blah, blah, blah. That's all right if the director has something to say, why these things happen and say. But no, he just shows what it is. Faye Wong's action is very typical of Hong Kong's style: blinded pronunciation, deer in the broad eye of the headlamp, trying to be cute and innate; The remaining cast is equally forced. <br /> <br /> I think this word, Auteur, is an euphemism for a leader who is trying something new and different, to be praised, but not for anyone who has not yet learned the cinematic story that Mr Wong has for the last 17 years within!
