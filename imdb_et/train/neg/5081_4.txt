Was this movie positive? Critics who did not know anything about video games can point out mistakes made. The primary example is no visible damage from the beginning, which is clearly visible. <br /> <br /> And I may have forgotten something but it wasn't Super Mario Bros. 3 Suppose you are a game that has never been played before? Well, if that is the case, and I didn't miss anything ... how did you know Fred Savage's character and even the girl that much of the game? We are talking about things that some people do not know through their second or third game. <br /> <br /> In addition to factual and game errors, the film has a low overall quality. Nothing here is honestly very memorable. The child was not as good at playing video games as they showed. Many of the kids I felt these days were much more experienced. In addition, the action and storyline is only mediocre in its strongest points. The characters are strange and completely uninteresting, the “Wizard” (the youngest child) is a very quiet and completely dry childhood with a little child who almost never talks about trauma. It is not that it is unrealistic, it is the fact that it had to be thrown into the movie to actually even make up a plot that would exceed even 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the only value here is nostalgic. If you grew up with this movie, you like it or not. It was about children who played video games, and while you saw it, you probably also had a NES obsession. But if you did not love it as a child, it is not just something that interests you and very little that prevents you from turning it off. <br /> <br /> No, sir, I didn't like it.
