As a fan of hairy films, I saw it in my video store and thought I'd give it a try. Now that I've seen it, I don't want a living soul on the planet. I get my movie rentals for free and I feel like I didn't get my money. I've seen some bad cheesy horror movies in my time, hell I'm their fan, but it was just an insult.
