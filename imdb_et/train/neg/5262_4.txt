We had to go to the meeting so we created the DVR to record it. After it was over, I watched my husband and said, "Do you have a clue?". She shook her head no. I said, "So you made the end of this movie for me and I have no idea what just happened." He didn't make me, but you know. <br /> <br /> The body of the movie itself was pretty good. There were many tensions. It keeps you wondering. Then the end came. The end was ... it was just over. You didn't let me in, what happened or why. Right up to that credit I had to think about would happen, but it wasn't done. So I came here waiting for someone to think of it and I just didn't pay attention. No. Here four years later, I'm just as helpless as the tom-saw. I'm just glad I didn't waste any $$ to buy it because I'd be sure it would have been crazy. <br /> <br /> OHHHHH! I get it! The end of the movie is what disappeared! ROFL
