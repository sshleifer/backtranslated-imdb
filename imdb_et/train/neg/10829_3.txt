Magnolia is a wall-to-wall canvas, screaming, screaming, burned, hysterical twis, all of whom are sorry, guilty and painful. PT Anderson is definitely a talented filmmaker, but maybe he should write to someone else or at least find someone with balls to tell him he needs this superfluous confusion. <br /> <br /> Watch the lie tell you that the performances were great and they were. I just want every scene to be unrelated to the top shouting or long-term engagement in sins and their pain. <br /> <br /> I also think that Anderson can barely create a story that is parallel to the strange table that opens the film. Opening sequences are excellent, showing how fate can bring people and circumstances that even the most optimistic cosmic cosmic who pulls our strings scream. But the story that then evolves lacks any thing they open in the fabulous displays. I was still waiting for some form of cosmic approach, but instead of all that we get, we have morally challenged waves of characters who see their past in front of them and now try to get rid of them. Throw the plague of the left generation towards the end, and whatever you finally get, is the frame of Anderson's devotees who admires his genius if it really proves that he has actually read the Old Testament. <br /> <I say Aimee Mann's music was great and I'm looking for a Soundtrack CD. In short, a good movie to watch and listen to (this is music) if the actors had kept it or stressed it.
