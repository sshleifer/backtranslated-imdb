I stopped watching this POS as soon as the snakes started to take over the plane. <br /> <br /> At first I thought maybe this should be one of the comical relief. But then I realized I could just look at the three stories for free and laugh more! <br /> <br /> Regardless of what I would have been to Samuel Jackson, he was irreversibly destroyed. And Hollywood once again demonstrates how it really has been removed from reality. When I was a kid, we used some for fun. The only thing the snakes would do is migrating at the bottom of the merchant ship. And no Hollywood cartoons can change it. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a worthwhile trip to Blockbuster. Warn: If you pay for it, the only "victim" is your stupid ass. <br /> <br /> If you want to be really scared, I'll offer Descenti. If you want humor, go to your local comedy club. Their worst performer is a million times better than this trash.
