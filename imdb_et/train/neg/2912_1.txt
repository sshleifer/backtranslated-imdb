The "Meatball Machine" must be one of the most complicated, ridiculous, terrible and exaggerated sci-fi horror movies I've ever met. It's about good evil and an aging story that aims to relax with a bloody, foolish, and humorous context. That is why violence is not particularly harsh and it doesn't make you tough, but free bleeding and nudity run freely. The performances of Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka are the worst I've seen, if not enough, and it is headed by the outrageous director Yudai Yamaguchi. This movie has it all, it's bad for the bone! ... Just: enjoyable and rare pearl.
