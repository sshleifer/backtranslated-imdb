"Fly Me To Moon" must be the worst animation I've seen at LONG TIME. It says something because I've taken my son to see animated editions made every four years. The story must be generous ... to trit. The voice is awful, too cute to sound. Humor is Romper's space variety. Animation can be traversed by Nickolodeon's comic, but it does not appear on the big screen for cable TV. <br /> <br /> It gets 2 just because it's OK 3-D visual. Some scenes had a slightly stimulating image, but we've seen much better in the past. I also ask filmmakers to demand that characters or characters appear on the screen in most scenes. Although it is first of all interesting, it became tired after the 3rd or 4th time. It seemed to me the indifference of the creators. <br /> <br /> I say this, it was a pretty cool track. And for the record, my son wasn't crazy about it. Bad movie.
