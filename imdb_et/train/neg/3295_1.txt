... it would be better to watch this movie. They have completely destroyed the exhibition space. In the movie, the Duchess's idiots, Daisy's driving, Roscoe's bad, Boss Hogg's capable, Uncle Jessie's criminal proceedings ... only Cooter and Flash are genuine characters. At least Enos is close. <br /> <br /> At one point, they will open the doors to escape the General Lee nuff. <br /> <br /> The original show might not be a big TV, but it was fun and characters make sense. This movie is like Dumb & Dumber responding to simple life.
