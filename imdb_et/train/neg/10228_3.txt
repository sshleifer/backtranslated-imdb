Frankly, I had heard that it was pretty bad before I decided to look at it, but I'm never the one who allows others to influence their views. There was one thing on the Bullwhip that went to me before watching, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and these beautiful eyes were in the interest of me. The picture is not very good and is actually very morally suspicious, all the characters are corrupt and of the same shape or shape, all driven by greed or egocentric victories, all well and good, when the surrounding film can make despicable people and create a tense peak of trembling people. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and since the eyes are filled with sugar by the finals, you cannot shout that you have been cheating while watching a rather bad movie, no one is casting any credit, the head Guy Madison is painfully extremely woody. <br /> <br /> Not even beautiful Rhonda can recommend me to anyone, 3/10
