... This would be the worst movie I ever saw. Hmmm, OK, maybe related to Boogeyman. Awful, really terrible. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations and could not complete them! I honestly think about one good thing. so here are the worst points ... <br /> <br /> 1. ACTION 2. PLOT 3. CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics .... seriously) 4. PLOT 5. DIALOGUE and finally .... 6. PLOT <br /> <br /> with so many unanswered questions, did they make a 2:32 hour movie and realized that they hadn't put Lex Luthor and Superman together in the scene and were forced to survive a 3-minute bit or do they think that no one notices that the main hero and the villain have less time than the son of Superman and kills him? "<br /> <br /> Was half the budget spent on persuading Kevin Spacey? <br /> <br /> When Superman goes to the hospital, why don't doctors ask: "What do you want us to do? F * He is an alien! We don't know about his anatomy!" <br /> <br /> What happened in five years when Superman was away to generate technology for 28 years? <br /> <br /> When people who wrote good reviews watch the same movie? <br /> <br /> And finally, why? Just why? <br /> <br /> BTW, for those who know how Superman could raise the entire cryptonide continent, I think I've understood it ... <br /> <br /> ... no superman kryptonite affect until he sees something green in the rocks, it is probably all his head. that is why the continent is just the one who cuts his fear of shiny green stone .... <br /> <br /> whether it is, or if the writers are semi-finished with loose jaws, who didn't think it was a pretty obvious mistake.
