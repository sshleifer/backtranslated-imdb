I chose this title from my friend who sat in my exhaustive DVD / Video / Laserdisc collection, so luckily I didn't have to pay for it myself. I was impressed that it would be a bad movie, but I know what a really bad movie is after watching how children should not play with dead things and incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed-type zombies, and now not really something that makes me shameful if it is amazingly bad. <br /> <br /> The solar crisis is bad, but it does not reach the sweet spot of absolute pain that some movies are. <br /> <br Anyway, the general plan is that the sun will trigger a huge amount of solar energy on the ground that will destroy it. To combat this direct threat, mankind has brought together a spacecraft and a team whose mission is to shoot the sun's anti-bomb bomb (which is described as "the greatest explosive ever"), which, through some logic of sci-fi, causes firing at a different angle, leaving the ground intact. <br /> <br /> Remember that what I've just described to you sounds like a bad episode of the original Star Trek. Even with ensemble casting (Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle, and Jack Palance), Solar Crisis can hardly manage this medium level, thanks to a simple starting plot that becomes increasingly meaningless over time. <br /> <br /> The crowning of this movie's cracking is the addition of a villain character (played by Boyle), who requires sabotage of the mission. Through means that are never explained, he sends the evil minion embarrassingly with a bad discount to carry out some vague electronic mind control over the genetically modified scientist of the space team, played by female leader Annabel Schofield. Why does he sabotage the mission? Because of his moral belief, he believes that burning will not happen and that if he does not, he will become tremendously rich because he has dug his evil nails into the stock market. In fact, you are a criminal whose imagination is the most absurd. <br /> <br /> The film's graph becomes amazingly complicated and develops very slowly, occasionally touching signs that have only a vague or useless short role story. I can sit here and explain exactly what happens when I show the scriptwriter's inability to make a plot that actually clicks or keeps your attention, but I'm sitting here writing this review of Microsoft Word and I know it would take three pages and I only lose your interest. But then again you will probably get the same effect from watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is badly corrupted if the dialogue is very bad. Imagine if everything that happened at Star Trek Enterprise was that the characters pulled the sci-fi jargon back and forth. Yes, I know they are already doing it, but imagine whether it was all they did, and that they used this jargon to create vague and almost pointless scenes that did not create any excitement, tension or interest in the viewer. This is the best example when a character in the Zero-G environment screws the bolt back into the metal box before you start crying for a few minutes before torture. The script refers to a character who is at risk of an explosion before, but does not worry about giving any strong answer as to why or how it happens, or why he or she cannot actually get away. All in all, you have a strange and ridiculous cross. <br /> <br /> Then we have several scenes where dramatic build-up brings something. Jack Palance's performance is wasted on the character, which is only meant to guide the boy's hero (do not ask) at the desert before you get bunches and a lot of costumes die. Finally, Palance speaks of her sons' hero in their surname (wearing a terrible bruised makeup that looks like someone puts the balloon under her eyeball) that she's quiet before. Colonel Travis J. Richards. The boy repeats it quietly after the expiration, giving the viewers the impression that the name is more important in the movie later. Perhaps Charlton Heston's passionate admiral adheres to him and the plot progresses when his name is repeated. Something. Something. <br /> <br /> No. Sorry. All the hopes you have are struck out when this moment will be just one of many pathetic, unsuccessful attempts to create a drama for such a definite character, to frighten it forever in Palance's career, just as the rest is similarly violated. <br /> <br /> Completing the movie is a painfully stubborn ending, showing that Schofield piloted the bomb in the sun, trying to redeem his actions when the villain is under the spell. which is another sequence of remarkably well-made visual effects of the film, which still manages to make the film evidently developed, so that it would still look the same as it really is. The saddest part of this movie is obviously the big budget that has been tragically wasted on the scarf and the back of Boyle, Heston and Palance, which can close the coffin with a clean over-effect. <br /> <br /> Rating: D-
