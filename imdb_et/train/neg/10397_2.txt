Just not the quality of Morris expected (love of Brass Eye and Blue Jam). It is very similar to a not so bad student film. What concerns me is WHY IS BAFTA? Morris makes fun of "affectionate mediocrity" (Ayn Rand) in many of his work (Nathan Barley), and is still urinating the back of his talent and tells us his rain! I just hope that he has chosen the topic I would like to deal with (the humanity of terrorism - Four Lions) that he does not intend to give it away, wasting the opportunity to express the mainstream ignorance and opinion about this emotional and spun phenomenon.
