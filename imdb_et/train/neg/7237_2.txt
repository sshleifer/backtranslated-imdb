Life is really too short for such films. I knew it couldn't be good if I realized what I already suspected - that David Schwimmer is playing exactly the same type of person he plays "Friends". <br /> <br /> Let us be honest about whether a boy can play anything but jokes, or he never offers other parts. I feel it is a mixture of both. <br /> <br /> And I have to say that it's very hard to have a movie that wastes Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette and Carol's remarkable talents on Kane !!!
