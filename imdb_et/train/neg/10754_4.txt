Waiting for me to go to the tickets, I was waiting for an interesting sci-fi fantasy film that could eventually feed my movie-rich robot technology, instead I must be disappointed with every aspect of this, proving once again that the stunning effect of stunning cannot help a boring plot thinks it was worse this year. In this film, too, dissatisfied, Will Smith did not show anything new in this film, but I never saw a change in my actions after "Men In Black", which was my only success in my opinion. He had to retire from that time, not the violations of his name with titles like "I, Robot" and "Men In Black 2". 4/10
