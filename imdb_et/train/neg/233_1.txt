This movie is calculated as an attempt to cash in cash in the city and in four weddings and funerals. In fact, if they called it Sex at the funeral, they would have done better in competitions. Characters create unlikely bright dialogues, but never act far from human. One arbitrary, pointless action is followed by another to pass the plot passes and one soon to get the company's flawless tires. has stolen Imelda Staunton, like everyone, a police detective (do they have a height there?). Mrs Staunton seems to be able to move wrong. Could we say about the same writer-director. <br /> <br /> If Notting Hill is irritating to you, stay away from it. Phonus bolognus on half-shell.
