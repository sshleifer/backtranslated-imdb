It's like a 6th film. The movie is really bad. It does nothing in the Death Department. Disposable liners are bad and should not be in NOES. Freddy is a happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes it worthwhile. The characters are extremely underdeveloped. All in all, it is better than the sixth, but one more bad movie. My Rating 2/10
