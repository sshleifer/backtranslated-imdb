At least it's not full of meaningless violence or fluff. It's not very thoughtful or smooth either. This story had some potential, but the director seems to have lost a green spot. The story is separate and goes strange <br /> <br /> towards the end. Nor do I believe that the director spent much time around the golf club club. Some images are absurd. Not very interesting.
