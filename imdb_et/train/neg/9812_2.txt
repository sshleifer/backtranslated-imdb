Not only was the creation of the plot of the film easy, when two psychos could rub a pregnant woman, but it was a terrible break of Misery. The main reason I gave this low rating for this movie was that it was completely disgusting to me. <br /> <br /> I am not someone who is easily shocked by filmmakers and has always loved horror cocks, but this movie went too violently in the face of violence and torture just to get points in shock. <br /> <br /> I think most people, when you look at just ten minutes, â€œHide and Turn to Remote Control.
