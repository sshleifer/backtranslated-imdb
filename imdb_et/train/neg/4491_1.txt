1/10 and that's just because my ratings aren't lower. <br /> <br /> Skip this "movie" and wait for the "Trilogy" last movie, don't buy or rent it. trust me that you are missing something. The architect does not give new information: _ (spoiler) _ has had more NEOs before, he is like no.6 or something. you could have excluded something like this from the first movie: Agent Smith tells us that the first matrix you created is not working because it was too perfect. Trinity died and Neo's "love" brought him back where I saw it before? Oh the right first movie roles where the opposite! the same as action scenes is nothing new just more opponents. Action scene (20+ ships) in a BIG battle that we didn't see (maybe in revolutions?) From whom someone (hmmmm, maybe a man who wanted a knife who wanted the Neo? EGM button soon). <br /> Everything is disgraceful to earn money (especially guys who went to see it more than once), which probably worked like a charm.
