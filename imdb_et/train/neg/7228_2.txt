Good: <br /> <br /> Effective color scheme. Good costumes. Top-level production. Well detailed CGI buildings and vehicles. <br /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> A shameful mix of participants and all CGI actors mixes the fifth element with Final Fantasy. A few years ago, CGI actors are even worse than video games. Lack of logic. Showing a gigantic pyramid and no one exploring it, no one asking it? And there is no explanation why Horus God was even thrown away, nor was there any reason why he should do something trivial as well as impregnate Jill? <br /> <br /> Ugly: <br /> <br /> Awful script. So many unnecessary sub-blocks that have too many ideas that have not been fully realized. The dialogue was almost ridiculous at some points. Random characters and events that are not needed. Empty characters. Jill should be the secret, but apparently she was just the secret of the writer. There is nothing for him. She's interesting and boring to look at. He has no substance, no texture. His character has no redemptive qualities. In fact, the whole movie does not have a character that has any purpose, any purpose (other than Horus's obvious), no motivation. They are weak and poorly understood. There are no bets - the key to writing to the screen. Horus doesn't become immortal, but the big thing, he's a bad guy. You can't even decipher whether Horus or Jill is the main character. This is a problem: devoting half a movie to every character means that the writer never explores one character, never bringing it to life. These are cardboard cuttings that walk around and talk and do a lot of things, but explore fine parts. First-time director's pace. Slow, slow, slow. I'm still watching the movie. I can't pay attention because it's boring. Everything is flat. Even action is not interesting because it is short-term and sometimes unnecessary. <br /> <br /> In general: <br /> <br /> Not worth watching. Threadbare story, sub-parameter development, corny CGI will not save a nice set of production.
