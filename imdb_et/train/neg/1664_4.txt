This movie is entertaining, because Virginia Madsen is great and Lindsey Haun is great. But the reason why the film is so predictable is that we've seen it before. I haven't read the book "Mother's Gift", but I hope Britney and Lynne Spears are completely different from this movie. If you don't think that ending a movie, which is essentially a music video, is the original idea, the whole movie will remind you of a plagiarism-litered word.
