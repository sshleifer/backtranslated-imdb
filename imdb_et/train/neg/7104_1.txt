The producers of this movie offer funeral expenses for anyone who dies while watching this movie. They should have offered intense psychotherapy to anyone who really enjoyed this stink. A young couple is moving into a house where a woman who has a couple of women lived. Extremely boring and very predictable. In the end, I didn't get any of this movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs.
