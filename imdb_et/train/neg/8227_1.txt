I keep it fast and sweet. When they get home from a football game, five girls decide to take a short cut, leading them down the road to an abandoned forest. Of course, nothing good happens to them, and they will safely reach their destination. <br /> <br /> All right, they don't. Soon they will be a dusky chick with some serious mental problems, which will result from 90 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> I hope you never see any of these actors ever. Their screaming voices gave me a headache and the script was so badly written that it contained many repeated phrases and meaningless hysterical shouting. All in all, one of the worst cheap horrors I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot.
