Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. What else to say. Kate Jackson must be desperate. Maybe he should be back ... the other thought he was a bad actor. Who would make the money to do something bad. I like anti-Christ movies and I usually have good laughter and strange intimidation, but it's just bad bad. The operation of the stars was worse than the soap opera. Special effects when you can name them where ridiculous. I wouldn't be surprised if you played scenes in slow motion if you saw the tubes coming out of bleeding. We had to turn off the disc in just 30 minutes. These original film prints have to be destroyed, all discs and tapes destroyed, and all people involved in making a movie have to pay back money to the people who rented the film. Then, these people should never be allowed to act, run or film, but their home films.
