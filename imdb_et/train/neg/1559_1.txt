This may be the worst film I see when I live 100. I think a group of first graders might have come to be a better landline than a class project. I'm sad about watching it, and God has mercy on the souls that were paid to produce this movie. <br /> <br /> And after I finally turned it off, I really wanted to vomit. /> <br /> Nobody made a clue about photography. No one had a clue how to act. No one had a clue about anything. <br /> <br /> I can't believe F / X sometimes shows this mess. The only time I saw it was one of Starz! channels - not even the main. And it was about 3.00.
