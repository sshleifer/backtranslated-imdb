This movie is the worst in the series. While New Line is just looking at sales, they all know that it made more money than it was before it ended up in 3D. It wasn't that 3-D was good because it was in the 50's with red and blue lenses (anaglyph.) That's what people wanted to see what it looks like. Moreover, this movie was so badly made! Bad script, bad characters, bad behavior, worse management. This movie tries to push the camp factor almost like it is a "Looney Tunes" episode. <br /> <br /> Seriously, not for the horror audience, because it is frightening and not scary and not funny or not fun for the crowd of comedy. Just a total confusion with some very bad cafes trying to play it all in the camp and it's probably not as good as they probably wanted. <br /> <br /> I remember most of us who had been in this series praying just to end it on the bad side. This is one of the films that helped to frighten the popularity and drive the belief that the audience really wanted to laugh with some foolish comedy when seeing a good and scary horror film.
