It's short. Let me first say that I am agnostic and not just xtians, especially xtia fanatics. This documentary had the same tone that a teenager was angry with his xtian mother for not allowing him to play video games. I just couldn't take it seriously. Mentioning how CharlesManson thought he was Christ, illustrates that xtianity can raise evil? I don't know it was just cheap and childish - the opposition was ignorant. What's more, the narrator just seemed snobby and pretentious. Delivery was complete. I can't take this documentary seriously. One can turn to angry teen piss3d out of her xtian mom not let her play video games.
