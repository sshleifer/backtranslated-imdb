I have to admit that when I saw this movie, I really didn't have great expectations. But even with my low expectations, I was completely and completely disappointed ... <br /> <br /> Basically, Luke Wilson is a hot shooter who tends to go with a little mad girlfriend. A little mention is made of the girl who followed her, but that is pretty much for her character. What I do not understand is that it is likely to be as underdeveloped as the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> So when the Rainn Wilson subway (who I really liked before this movie) persuades her to talk to a "hot" girl, Uma Thurman. It's strange to say a little because everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman is not in the "hot" category. <br /> <br /> Rainn Wilson's performance is far from "hot". I usually do everything for his actions, but even he couldn't save that movie. His character was nervous, unrealistic and quite annoying. You will never be able to tell whether the writers tried to turn him into a comic symbol chamber, or just desperate. It was almost painful. But still somebody steals his wallet when he leaves the subway, and Luke Wilson is the charming savior he runs after the robber. Now we all know that Uma Thurman is a superhero or "G-Girl" as they want to call him in the movie. It still disturbs me what "G" stands for, but we leave it for discussions for discussions. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes I expect should be funny, but I find myself asking who is having such sex? Because of the "passion" of Uma Thurman, they say almost through the wall through the bed. It hurts my head, but not "I mean really hard to figure it out". <br /> <br /> When Uma offended Anna Farist, she called her "whore". In addition to not being able to choose the movies properly, he cannot act and depends on being blonde and typical. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would have gone out of the theater when I didn't see it for $ 8.75. The characters are typical and they have absolutely no chemistry, especially Uma Thurman. Somebody should let him know that just because you are moving your head does not mean that you are acting. <br /> <br /> Also, the script and storyline could have used a lot of work or a game and a lighter fluid. I started to feel embarrassed about the characters and their dying career. In general, if you value your money and your self-esteem does not waste your time in capturing this movie.
