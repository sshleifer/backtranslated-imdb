Very unlikely, incredible and inconsistent Spanish production ... well, let me see how close I can get to it. The movie opens with a woman who has one of her cats to kill a young girl. Then she asks her to love her somewhere on vacation. He calls for work and demands that he lose his holiday and says he is paying for it. What is the significance of this playing is the assumption of someone at the end of the film, because the boy, the potty photographer, spies out the beautiful Patty Shepard, the king of the Spanish horror films, feeling he's taking off the bikini for a moment so he can look at the picture, ask him for lunch and then surrender to the witch's hill - for reasons we never give, we can't do that. Before they go away, Patty must stop at the house and loudly, "terrible" songs in the ears of our hero. Again, it has never been explained. The film continues with the two stops at the inn, which goes to the mountain and finally understands why the mountain is called Witches Mountain. You know, this film has several aspects that make it worse than a bad movie. It has a pleasant atmosphere, some characters of the characters are really quite good (especially the deaf guest house and the old woman), the leaders are at least adequate and the climax - though it makes no sense at all - is well-choreographed (literally) with witches white bra and long black with hair. It just doesn't make sense and it is a huge pest for me. I can watch the movie ten more times and still know more than I did after the first viewing. This is a big problem. Witches Mountain is a curious film about cheap, atmospheric European horror films that have been around for decades. If you get more than me, better power.
