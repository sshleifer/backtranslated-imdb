It is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80's hits. It's set nowadays when we see that the Afghan base is destroyed with UAV right from the start. <br /> <br /> And that's exactly where the movie pops up. UAVs are not armed. They could be, but I don't think it's ever really tried. We see a computer that has run this operation, named R.I.P.L.E.Y. We introduce the "hacker" Is Farmer (he's good at chemistry and electronics that doesn't make him a computer hacker) and his love interest, Annie & Will's first attempt to hack not only a complete failure but also his IP address logged and Annie thought who it was. We also meet Wills' mother working in a chemical company. <br /> <br /> Taking money from his neighbors' bank account (Mr Massude) is not a cage (he helped him to create an account), then we get back to the original movie where they decide to play Global Thermonuclear War and play The Dead Code . RIPLEY's office is not on Will, but on the Masses computer, so all the evidence they collected was useless for Will. <br /> <br /> Exactly why RIPLEY was shut down Will's machine has not been explained (he only plays an online game?) And why did he feel the need to shut down all the electricity in his life. Why is the Counter-Terrorism Agency understandable as a reasonable goal? Like RIPLEY activates your mobile phone? I think not, it was not connected to a computer and the message wouldn't play if it didn't actually answer the phone, so there's also a bad "hacking" science. <br /> <br /> Representatives of RIPLEY come to the Masses home, take it away, and Will be given an envelope that shows a lot of money. Whether searching for a mass number is not "hacking" because you never see him break down on a DMV computer. Representatives of RIPLEY, who take Dennis at the airport, do not want to arrest or detain him. Will's mother was not "stealing chemicals and bioagents". And even if he had no right to arrest or detain Dennis. Patriot Law or not. I do not know why Will was worried that he was arrested for a Canadian crime because it is a completely different country where the US has different laws. <br /> <br /> The computer is frustrated and all the actions he took against Will, his mother and Dennis were not punished by the government. We see that the telephone fraction makes the first film hacking show, we also get to RIPLEY, which seemed so easy for a powerful system. <br /> <br /> "Boy", who ran to the airport at Annie, and even looking at them on the street, had nothing to do with RIPLEY and the ridiculous notion that RIPLEY could watch a cell phone when underground was as stupid as the idea that the computer was reading lips. <br /> <br /> Another reference to the original film when they mention Stephen Falken as RIPLEY designer, Joshua Project. We discover that the "boy" who ran for Annie is Falken (who wasn't played by the original actor unfortunately) who was wrong in his death. <br /> <br /> We also see WOPR as "helping" to win RIPLEY and holding a similar voice. Falken & WOPR is destroyed too soon after not being used at all (the same explosion should kill Will, Annie and Russian. It is also unlikely that they will create an independent computer system capable of bringing chemical weapons or dropping the entire country where it is out <br /> <br /> The whole plot and idea of ​​"decontamination" is absolutely unbelievable - such orders should go through the presidents or leaders of the joint forces, so another ridiculous and incredible idea. <br /> <br /> IP doesn't do RIPLEY against cages, he just contacts one of his friends who recommend and apply this idea. It is too ridiculous that Will gets login just by increasing RIPLEY activity by taking Joshua as a backdoor to RIPLEY (especially after it was blown bits ) is an incredible cop and frightens a very desperate writer who had no ideas left behind and wanted to get over this movie. <br /> <br /> RIPLE is terrible Y plays Dead Code and we see a return (17 minutes), then RIPLEY says, "Decontamination after 30 minutes", how is it that if they can't keep up with their timer? The RIPLEY attack mission in Philadelphia has been stopped (I find it too easy) and he decides to attack Joshua in his internal circuits and direct the missile to Philly in Washington, where RIPLEY is deployed. The idea of ​​Nuclear Exchange to understand RIPLEY's work he does is not working (he would have known if he had had Joshua's insider since he had learned the lesson in his original film?) In the original film. <br /> <br /> Copying with RIPLEY repeats Joshua exactly the same words as the end of the original movie. This shows how many original ideas they couldn't get out of. <br /> <br /> If you want to guide your finger towards bad and stolen ideas, the men blame Randall Badat & Rob Kerchner. It's a terrible movie and it's best to avoid it.
