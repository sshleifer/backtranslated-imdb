I have to look at a good movie soon, because it seems that every other entry is something I despise. But my history speaks, I must not speak the lie. Bobby Deerfield and all this sucks big green banana shells. I've never thought I could see a movie that was as violent as it was. Al Pacino does not act in this film: he depicts. There are many, many scenes of his character, who is the driver of a racing car, just staring at the camera. He's absolutely terrible. Marthe Keller is just as bad. These two should be gracious and not just chemistry. Sydney Pollack directed this movie? There are no traces of the gene behind this product. Is this the same man I was delighted with Eyes Wide Shutis? I can't believe it. Save yourself a terrible movie experience. Run, don't walk, away from Bobby Deerfield.
