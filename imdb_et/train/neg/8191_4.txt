"Fred Claus" somehow avoids changing this year's "Santa Claus", being at least a little more amusing than Tim Allen starrer, but that doesn't mean that it would be enough to go to the theater. <br /> <br /> When holiday clubs go, it's natural and sentimental. But in fact it may be the least worrying because "Fred Claus", astonished by David Dobkin ("Shanghai Knights", "The Wedding Crashers"), contains a virtually funny, really funny moment, as it moves harshly between Vince Vaughni and fuzzy Christmas movies. . Ultimately, it is not great for both. Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz and Kathy Bates are all more frustrated. <br /> <br /> Vaughn plays Fred, Nick (Giamatti )'s older and alienated brother who once left him and their parents (Bates and Trevor Peacock) after he had enough of his parents favoring his younger brother. Nick is growing up as a Santa (and when the voice command says, the time freezes for you and your family when you are a saint), while Fred becomes a Yuletide-jaded repo man in Chicago who has a hard time remembering his girlfriend Wanda's (Weisz) birthday. <br /> <br /> She runs by law in trouble and had to call her younger brother (who waits for her at least ten years of age) to get her out of prison. Nick agrees, but only if Fred agrees to help pack the toys in the North Pole. Fred reluctantly agrees, but his cynicism has encountered Santa and the dwarfs forever with joy, even though Spacey controls the operations of the toy factory, but is too happy to close all Arctic operations when things fail. /> <br /> As already mentioned, the film has moments, but the cushioned running length stretches them throughout its duration. Sometimes the clich√©s of Christmas games, which are better handled, say, "Elf" and attempts at sentimentality, are just as pleasing as last year's fruit cake. <br /> <br /> Vaugn, as usual, brings his harsh charm to the table, but Dan Delmelman's castrated letter keeps him doing his thing. Giamatti, under a bad fat suit, brings a joyful old charm to her iconic character, but unfortunately she has to play a second violin with Fred. Spacey brings the face of his game, but his turns usually end up with unlikely coats. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Fred Claus becomes a forgotten movie that falls below what it deserves. Of course, the start of the season in the cinema is worse, but definitely there are many better ways.
