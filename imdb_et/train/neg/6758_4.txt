Quite likely, Debbie is the most beautiful show project and the sexiest woman. Although his work in the American nightmare was much better, he is worth watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Cast with its typical Melrose Place types, twisted properties and seductive curves I've never seen. Except for Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actor I saw earlier, similar to Delta Delta Die. <br /> <br /> The centerpiece of the plot is the California arrogante group, who initiate poor naive Debbie Rochon into their clicks. They tell him they have a murder club and that he has to kill someone to be accepted. Debbie does not want anything more, but to accept these cool people so that he kills a person quickly, and now the group has to decide what to do with it, after falling asleep. <br /> <br /> $$$$ (Rich! Debbie Rochon has occasionally braided blood all over her and all murder scenes are made on your face. Gore hounds will definitely enjoy!) <br /> <br /> NUDITY : $$$$$ (Much! Debbie Rochon has several naked scenes, like many no-name actors and actors. The pool party seems to be just an excuse to get all naked, both men and women. Julie Strain also has topless character is lost in the first five minutes). <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (Maybe there would have been a bigger voice because the plot was very interesting and unique, but the plot fills naked between scenes. I understand that B-Rate movies often use nudity, but this is an excessive limit). <br /> <br /> ACTIVITY: $ (Operation is less standard. Rochon is always Reat, easily the best B-Rate actor today in business, but his character in American Nightmare was better. Danny Wolske does a good job like Debbie's lust object, but other actors had nothing to write about).
