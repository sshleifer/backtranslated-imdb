... and even when they live, they don't see it. Frankly, this film (if someone calls it) is really interesting only to serfdom. Bettie Page fans learn something new (and I don't mean anything *), nor can they enjoy the warm fuzzi experienced by some familiar, loved ones or prized. - Less than community-theater performance, lack of direction, lack of dirty lighting or other favorable basement production values. It's definitely "Hey, kids, we're making a movie!" making the lowest order movie. I think it would be grateful that at least they knew how to control the camera. No, I'm sorry to say that none of it is quite clear why this thing is so wrong * wrong *. <br /> <br /> This is wrong because a young lady who plays Bettie Page, somewhat zaftig girl whose only resemblance to the Queen of Curves is dark hair and brand bangs, can't bring anything to such a role if she wants to be connected and gagged. This is probably good for his film career before and after the sad superfluous, but not his own wretched excess redundant excess of the B & D that is placed between the horribly terrible faux biographical scenes. The page falls from grace (so to speak). Indeed, there is probably more information about the life of the page itself in opening and closing credits than the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled. This is not a worthy companion to the movie "The Notorious Bettie Page". It's not worth the movie at all. It is a fetish art that engages with the greatest pin-ups of all time and does it without class, without style and without any real sense of the Bettie Page character. It is not a fan of the Bettie page that it is nothing but disappointment, I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. If it's free, remember that time is also money. You may not be worth much, but I am worth it for betting that you are sorry to be wasting this time. That's it, I'm done, you're warned.
