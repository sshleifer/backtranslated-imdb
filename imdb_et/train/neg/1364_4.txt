the more I think about it, nothing was redeemed. <br /> <br /> Film. I saw it 9 months ago so my memory could have made it worse than it was, but I know it was at least as bad as 4 <br /> <br /> 10. <br /> <br /> After seeing the film, I met the director. he seemed so wise that he did what he did or what he had done, and as far as I could say, he didn't care about the film either. he even agreed that he didn't know what he actually did, and he was forced to do certain things because it was filmed digitally. <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie was trying to fit in with the formula it had made: "9 people must be connected in some way. <br /> <br /> Can we get from" A "to" B " so to get the prostitute we see in the beginning and back to him finally, 10 <br /> <br /> minutes for each character's relationship with another person. <br /> <br /> makes one unknown, poorly drawn > <br /> characters exhausted. <br /> <br /> I just remembered the redeeming part of the movie. Steve <br /> <br /> Bouchem has one scene where he is amazing. <br /> say ... of 4 out of 10.
