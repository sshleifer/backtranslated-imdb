Pathetic attempt to use science to justify a new age religion / philosophy. These two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said in this confusion is just wrong. <br /> <br /> Examples? Quantum theory supports the ideas of Eastern religions that reality is an illusion. How? Well, in the world of the subatomic world, particles can never be predicted for a certain period of time. You can only give it that it is exactly in one place. The observation also seems to affect the event. Particulate particles can pass through barriers. All this is still accurate. But then they say it means that if you sincerely believe that you could go through the wall, you could do it. It's a full pop. Instead, the theory argues that at our level you can go through the wall, but it's just a coincidence and has nothing to do with faith. You should also constantly walk into the wall forever, so that you even have the most remote way to go through the wall, the probability is so astronomically against it. <br /> <br /> This is just one example of how they mislead science. But much more annoying is the narrative that involves an unhappy photographer played by Marlee Maitlan. About half the picture is so confused that it is incomprehensible. Something to do with negative thoughts that lead to addiction and dignity. There may be truth to this, but quantum physics has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> Plus theory is a new thing in physics today. Instead of wasting your time with this dreck, I suggest you rent an Elegant Universe, an amazing series made for NOVA in PBS, giving you a history of physics from Newton and Gravity to Ed Witten and M Theory with just a 3-hour episode. The quantum mechanics are well explained there if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriations.
