... but I've seen better. <br /> <br /> The story here is predictable - the film crew is trying to film a horror movie where the murders occurred. Three think what happens. This is not a general bomb - the cast is pretty good prof. By John Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine, who give the best results. It's a reasonably well done - low budget movie. Just do not wait for nudity, swearing, blood or gore (the film has a very light PG rating). I'm never completely bored - it's a quiet night watching OK. I saw it on the video - it was HORRIBLE print - very dark and some scenes could not be seen. But I didn't hate it and it has a cool ending that surprised me - basically nothing happens before it goes to watch you. It is worth noting, but only if you are a horror movie.
