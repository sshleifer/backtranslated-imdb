I have only recently arrived at Marilyn Miller's films because they are not displayed in TCM in the UK. I've been interested a lot over the years because it was one of the 20's superstars. Some stars of this era, such as Jolson, are still out, but unfortunately this is not for Miller. His dance seems uncomfortable and poorly choreographed, his song is somewhat limited and as an actor Ruby Keeler from Hepburn. this movie, as the public had grown tired of musicals, almost all musical numbers have been deleted. So we've left the comedy for this period with little real appeal. It was paid $ 500,000 for it! So I have only two conclusions. Did he have badly served the cinema or had no talent at all. I think the truth is closer than the first.
