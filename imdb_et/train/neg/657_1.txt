PROM NIGHT (2008) <br /> <br /> director: Nelson McCormick: starring: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis <br /> <br /> Plot: Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) showed his entire family died in his teacher (Jonathan Schaech), who has a little drunk on him. Now she prepares her parent prom with her stupid annoying friends. When they die, they will die one by one, because the killer escaped from prison and nobody disturbed Donna's warning, because her apparently is too important to stop. <br /> <br /> Pros: I got a laugh after a movie because of a terrible dialogue and a change of fool. <br /> <br /> Example: <br /> <br /> Everyone decides not to tell Donna that a man who has been strangely obsessed with him (he doesn't seem so big) has escaped from prison. Their reason: they don't want to shame him on their friends. LOL <br /> <br /> Cons: Let me start by saying that I'm a huge slip fan. Usually I can even have fun with the bad ones. I even like some PG-13 horror movies. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated PG. I also like POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that it's a buggy movie rated for PG-13 has nothing to do with the movie that I don't enjoy. <br /> <br /> First of all, I had a big problem. I like movies that don't even have stories. At least they can be fun. It is a teacher who loves his pupil so that he kills his entire family. A few years later, he is trying to do him by destroying his prom and destroying all his friends ...? Then there were the subplots, which I doubt someone cares about. Claire (Jessica Stroup) fights her boyfriend, has seizures and I don't care less. It should have been a lifetime feature, not a remake of PROM NIGHT. <br /> <br /> And then ... it's a shining film with terrible death. I don't even care about being so gory, some of my favorite toys (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT) were not like that, but they still had effective murders. Here are half the characters dying in the same hotel room during the screen, a woman who has been grabbed several times, and a close fight on the face of a bad actor when she scares the torment. I'm sure 10-year-old girls were scared, but not me. <br /> <br /> I also hated these characters. There was an unreally sensitive boy, Bobby (Scott Porter), and I can almost guarantee that you will never meet a sensitive boyfriend in your life if you are not a gay man. Then we had Donna's annoying friends Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and the symbolic meaning of the girl is Chrissy (Brianne Davis). If you thought DEATH PROOF characters were annoying, try watching this movie. And I can't start with Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and DJ (Jay Phillips) who gave me feedback on Usher's show SHE'S ALL THAT. <br /> <br /> Add all that the predicted plot will change, the terrible soundtrack and the great lack of original material and you will be pretty smelly.
