An unobtrusive, gripping hybrid of "Chronic Intentions" and "Natural Things", but it's not nearly as good as any of the mini-classics in the trash. It's about a working sheriff, Artie (Taye Diggs) has been called to investigate near-fatal drug overdose at a high level in Univesity, but keep it low. As he digs deeper, he thinks it is much more than it seems at first glance. We are also watching Alice, a girl who was also super fast. After about 90 minutes, this movie would be welcome from the start. This movie brings something new to the table. But this is the only movie so far with Miss Swain's topless, so the score is higher for it. <br /> <br /> My Class: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dominique Swain gets topless ("Happy Campers" error confirmation); another girl is topless <br /> <br /> Anti-Eye Candy: More men ass than girl tit
