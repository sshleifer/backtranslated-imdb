In the sleepless night I switched over the channels and found the film's embarrassment. What did they mean? <br /> <br /> When it comes to life after the "remote control" of "Kari (Wuhrer) Saline", it's no wonder he's gone somewhere. <br /> <br /> And why did David Keith take that role? pathetic! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I switched the movie to the end, so I didn't get a lot of plot. But this must be the best part. This nerdy college child brings home this dominant-ish girl ... this scene is straight comic - or cheap porn movies. He calls mother's anal retentive and kisses father "Oh, I didn't expect the language!" Big lines! <br /> <br /> After that I had to see how it ended. <br /> <br /> Well, of course, this devil has a delicate past, so the SWAT team is up, and yes ... they surround him! AND YES YES! The child blows his brain out !!!! HAHAHHAHAHAHA !! <br /> <br / > It's a black-watch TV. <br /> <br />
