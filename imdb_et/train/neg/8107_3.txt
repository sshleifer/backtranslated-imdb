This movie is pretty boring. In a tiny experiment, you can see bare muscles that keep the viewer awake, but they fail. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is Lena Olin - she does the masterful work she does on the character, but Day-Lewis worships most of her lines. <br /> <br /> Kaufman had no clear idea of ​​how to shoot it. The contradictions between the strike event between households / marriage issues and political crises are poorly matched. Character attitudes change without explanation. Badly scattered.
