... and how they carried you in your mind! Crater Lake Monster is a 70's classic BAD movie that is not a sign, an embarrassing script, a terrible direction, and a tireless desire to blend "horror" with mild comedy. This film introduces a palaeontologist who finds drawings of a water-dinosaur under the crater lake ... the meteor falls from the sky and the dinosaur begins to terrorize and eat the people around the crater. The whole thing is taken care of by our local sheriff, Steve. Much of the film - if we don't show blood samples that were left behind what we imagine has been the beast's place to eat - has been spent after two guys named Arnie and Mitch, who run the boat rental. They're trying to be so bad to be funny that we get features like looking at a business sign, Mitch says to Arnie, "You wrote the feed wrong, it's written in B-A-T-E." There were quite a few laughs here. Then we see how they drunk together and imagine that the tree baggage is a dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy watch out! The dinosaur seems fake, but the movie is funny. And at least the lake is beautiful.
