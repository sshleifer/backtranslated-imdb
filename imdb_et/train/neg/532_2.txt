Just PPV's it. I don't want to waste too much time on this, because most of the posters here put it better than I would ever have, but I wanted to say a few things. <br /> <br /> I didn't know what was funny: Redgrave started to suck his little sister behind the small moths; Tightly that his "expensive" boy (whom he and Mr. had decided to be drunk) has become a road trainer; that tone-deaf Ann Schmoozed with Peggy Lee; or Crypt Keeper Annie's terrifying CGI looks at its younger self! <br /> <br /> I didn't buy Danes as a younger Redgrave. I didn't buy Richardson and Collette as nurses either. If Meryl Streep's daughter wants to be an actor, she will be a better mother to give her some lessons! I had a zero idea why every girl (or Buddy) would make themselves stupid if they were brave studs in Harris! Anne's daughters are as small and thoughtless as she is, Luc is a split blaster, and I didn't give me any rotation! Evening gives Chick Flicks a bad name!
