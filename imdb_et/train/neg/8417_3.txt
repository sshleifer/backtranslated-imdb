I expected the release of the movie as much as a fan of the Broadway game. I waited and read several months of comments on award-winning performances. I mean Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover's star ... the movie can't be less than 4 of the four stars, right? ERROR! I was definitely disappointed in the finished product. The film did not respond to the public hypothesis and the only rescue work was Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy's James Brownesque performance saves the movie just as it hits several balls and Jennifer Hudson's performance forces you every time she's on the screen to pay attention. His performance "And I Tell You" was the only time I felt that the leap was deserved. You were driving when she didn't ask her to let her good man in her group and in her life. As many reviewers have said, he steals the more experienced actors in the film and deserves all the accolades he receives for this result. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong voice and comedic talent. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles, on the other hand, traveled through these shows. Foxx's skills on this film seemed before his extraordinary "Ray" performance, and Beyonce Knowles was expanded into fashion photo or video tape by placing and glowing through the film. His performance was not strong enough to take care of his character at some point in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie was too hypothetical, 30 minutes and 1 song (Beyonce's heartfelt solo for Jamie Foxx) too long. <br /> <br /> DH - Vancouver, WA
