I only give 3 stars for beautiful pictures of Africa. The rest was ... pretty boring. In about 50 minutes we have an overview of the drawing ... In the World War II, the introductory part, oh, about 10 min? Then there was real action! It's something like: "Let's take a walk in the savannah and let's go to beautiful sunsets!" And maybe you send a message like "Don't kill the elephants!". Very ecological. I would have been expecting this from the "new" movie by Steven Segal, not that ... The leading actor makes me think of artificial sunlight, colored hair, and too much base! And I didn't see a scene where her hair is confused or sweating, or her clothes are dusty. She just doesn't look like a 19th century woman! And at the bar where they're looking for our hero, Swayze makes a comment to the commander that he looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896 and became famous in the coming years. Livingstone and other researchers went to Central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So if the action doesn't happen in 1896-1900 .. Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze makes a nice impression ... briefly - on the hard side, but soft and cuddly. Not that I go with the nut, but you understand. She has succeeded in seeing this beaten puppy repeatedly. Movie Stank. Too long and getting bored. don't look at it! Don't buy it! It's a waste of your money!
