A messy mess that is comedy. Elvis Presley plays an Indian bullmaster who leaves the Rhodes to stay at home in the desert area of ​​his Arizona residents, where government suits have just invested in a family shepherd (which needs a big stud). What director Peter Tewksbury is indispensable is some narrative skills, although what he lacked in the evaluation he creates for sloppy comedy assemblies (his social comment is not precisely marked, but Tewksbury has a graceful curve for his extremism and there are some funny scenes). Despite the colorful support from Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, the overall cleverness is out of hand and overwhelmed with "and holler" to maintain great interest. As for Elvis, he is loose and dirty all the time - and while it is nice to see that he is on the screen, he has to ask if he has just left the movie. It is clear what he feels about in this picture animation, and while the spirits are high, the revenue is usually low. * 1/2 from ****
