I love these actors, but they are rubbed in the flick. <br /> <br /> I can only wonder what they thought they would agree with this crap ??? <br /> <br /> Debra Winger just called in; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were cartoons. Some people thought it was deep. Well, if you liked to "break the waves", you probably like it too. I hated both. 3/10
