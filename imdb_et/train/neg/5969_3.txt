*** SPOILER *** Don't read this when you think of watching this movie, though it would be a waste of time. (By the way: the plot is so predictable that it won't change anything if you read it or not) <br /> <br /> If you don't know whether to see "Coyote Ugly" or not: don't! Money on a ticket or VHS / DVD is not worth it. A typical "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick" could be said. The plot itself is as low as the ridiculous and critical version of the American dream. A young, good looking little town girl became a big success in New York. Few desperate attempts to give the film a depth of failure, such as the father's "tragic" accident, Violet's relationship with his boy, etc. McNally (Director) is trying to awaken the public's regret and sadness has no chance of succeeding in this experiment due to poor scripting and downfall. In particular, Piper Perabo is unable to convince one of the "Jersey" fears of singing in front of the audience. The only good (and quite funny) thing about "Coyote Ugly" is John Goodman, who represents the little hope of this film. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that Jerry Bruckheimer has created this movie. First, "after 60 seconds" and now ... what happened to great movies like "The Rock" and "Con Air"? It was a real Bruckheimer's stuff. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a superb movie with good-looking women just for a relaxing evening, you should go better and look at "Charlie's Angels" (a lot more fun, fun) and self-ironic than this flick. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down (3 out of 10).
