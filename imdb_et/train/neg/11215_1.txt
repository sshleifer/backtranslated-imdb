At first, this film seemed pretty good, although it was pretty fast, and although they only had a $ 60,000 budget, but it was good, but if you find your sister's lake dead and discovered who might have killed him, why would you trace him and pull a weapon on him with just one bullet and waste it and end all of it with slowdown and death? After you have found your sister's lake dead and found a clue and guessed who the killer was, why don't you hand it over to hate the police who thinks you killed him? And at the end of the film, when he acts like a sister who was a waitress, and he talks to the bad guy he should meet with him somewhere and he noted that he was dead and what happened to his "proof". I don't know I wasn't happy with that end. This film may be so much better than it lasted longer and the actor was better and the end did not suck so bad! Don't waste your money on this movie, because if you write it, here too, and not happy.
