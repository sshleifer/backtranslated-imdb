Another horror shot where the teenage teenager is fighting with the mad and his supernatural sidekick who wants to take over?! Yes, but the fact that it was from Canada gives it a little difference. "Brain" is a cumbersome teenager, Jim Majelewski, who will treat a treatment that turns out to be the leader of a cult, assisted by a big ugly "brain." Can Jim stop him? I think that because our North neighbor has achieved everything they have achieved, they have the right to make at least one ridiculous horror film. But they still want to know they have public health and everything. <br /> <br /> The bad boy was the brain. Why didn't people make this movie?
