OK, people, honestly ... this has to be one of the worst movies ever made, but I'm stupidly laughing (which may be why I enjoyed it). Basically, it is sex, gender and the way to get your personal 15-minute fame. Did I mention that sex is the main problem with this movie? If you have a bizzzzare character and easy entertainment, check out this movie if you have the opportunity (and you have nothing better to do). *** Attention spoilers! *** The funniest thing about the movie was the man who asked Jerry if he could marry his goat (!) Show and blink his pictures of love with his wallet. Triple A for Bad taste and Fun!
