Another trashy grade Z accelerates from the fruitful Albert Pyun. Tim Thomerson's 13-inch Clint Eastwood-like policeman from space releases an unsightly driving head to the ground (!) And participates in the South Bronx Gang War! Gracefully short, but deadly boring, with a 50Ft wife attack. They would also be constantly bored: Remember how Thomerson sunglasses disappear and appear again every second. Excitingly bad, but that's why we watch these movies, isn't it? Sequel Â´Dollman Vs. Demonic Toys is said to be even worse than possible. <br /> <br /> 0 (****) <br /> <br />
