I think Stuart Bliss is the worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The actor was terrible and the plot was ridiculous. I get the fact that the main man's husband, who left him, triggered a mental break, but for a while it was so stupid and boring that I could take care of some sign less. <br /> <br /> The film left over and over the same idea, with nothing fresh or surprising to add to the plot. The whole thing with the Geiger counter after a while was too much after Stuart opened his wall to see what was behind it after the counter had shown that there was something there. <br /> <br /> Then the repetitive scenes were flyer and confusing where he met. <br /> <br /> I should have thought this movie was a flop when I didn't know any actors. Take advantage of this movie, read the book! You're better off.
