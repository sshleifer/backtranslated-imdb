The resurrected wrapped monster goes to murder. Happy looking for revenge against members of a previous expedition. The wagon seems to be packing and new ideas. Most of the budget was probably spent on Lon Chaney Jr., who was Mommy Kharis. Other players are George Zucco, Wallace Ford, Turhan Bey, Dick Foran and Elyse Knox. <br /> <br /> How long can this madness continue?
