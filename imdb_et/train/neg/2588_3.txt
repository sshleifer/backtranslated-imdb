Band Camp was terrible, Naked Mile was a little better, and this third straight DVD to American Pie franchise seems to be of the same quality as its predecessor. Basically, Erik Stifler (John White) left his girlfriend after losing his innocence, and now, together with Mike 'Cooze, Coozeman (Jake Siegel) joined Erik's cousin Dwight (Steve Talley) in college. With the promise of many parties, numerous rodents and chicks hot enough, there are only fifty listed tasks at Beta House to become official privileged members. However, there is a danger in front of the competitors' GEK ("Geek") house, led by power hungry nerd (and shepherd dog) Edgar (Tyrone Savage), which offers bigger and better than beta. To overcome this, Beta and Gek are banned for forty years of banned Greek games to win each other and the loser moves. The last champion of the games, Noah Levenstein, or Jim's father (the only regular Eugene Levy), runs at an exhibition that shows that people release bras, a duel of a gladiator floating in the water, a caught greased pig, a Russian roulette in mouth with a cartoon old horse dirty, a woman wearing and drinking a healthy alcohol cavity (puking does not disqualify). Everything is a sudden death where the boy dances in the boyfriend and they have to meet Cumming, the Beta House wins when Edgar cums with a girl dressed in sheep on his lap. Flubber also plays Christopher McDonald like Stifler, Meghan Heffern like Ashley, Dan Petronijevic as Bull, Nic Nac Bobbyna, Christine Barger like Margie, Ricci Ricci like Laura Johnson, Moshana Halbert like Sara Coleman, Sarah Power like Denise, Andrei Bunker Stacy and Jordan Prentice as Rock. The amount of nudity has increased very little, just like the harshness of jokes, and I think it is rated from one star to five, but I like it. Enough!
