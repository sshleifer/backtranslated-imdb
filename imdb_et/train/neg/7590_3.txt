Gorgeous bodies, proud colors and camera work, pretentious dialogue, banal plot. The name Prima donna, Camilla and often appearing flowers is enough to remind us of the plot's similarities to Dumana's novel La Dame aux Camelias, Camille's starring Garbo and (I think) Robert Taylor and the last but not least Verdi's opera La Traviata. Beautiful, not too powerful young women, social emigrants for one reason or another, beloved, divided, reunited just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene ... One forgives banal plots and silly unrealistic opera in the opera, but why did Hayaki, Don Sutherland continue , a beautiful LA transfer in the 1930s, a deus ex machina earthquake that kills comfortably another woman and all that beauty in this central turkey, where there are not even some beautiful songs?
