It's just invisible. If there is a story here, it is so deeply buried under fearful characters and worshiping the camera. There are a group of vampires who go around doing their own thing, and their killed vampires have little aliens inside them. They come out of their heads and talk like Speedy Gonzales. If you can imagine that the dolls of blood and gore-covered alien socks scream when a cowboy dude pulls it with a herd, you get it here. These people are white, reluctant, violent and just extremely annoying. Then there are some anti-human people who stand around their CGI spacecraft, being so incredibly large that it is impossible to take. These people make Hillary Clinton a better extreme. They're some vampires with friends or something ... who cares. <br /> <br /> Then the camera works. Remember how all the thousands of images of the latest Rolleball remakes hated every minute? People who made this movie LOVE this stuff. There are three really filthy nu-metal videos on MTV here. <br /> <br /> Nuff said. This thing smells. For comparison, Dracula 3000 is a masterpiece.
