In the recent Alec Guinness biography, I didn't find too much love in Paris. I'm sure Guinness made a movie to get a free Paris trip. The film has no other existence. <br /> <br /> Of course, Paris is beautifully photographed with the splendid opening of Guinness and his son, who ride in the background to the Champs Elysee with Arc de Triomphe. Unfortunately, downhill is down there. <br /> <br /> There is no chemistry between Guinness and the young man he's in Paris for. According to a recent biography by Guinness by Piers Paul Read, Guinness did not like the girl positively, found her behavior unprofessional. As for what Odile Vernois thought of his co-star, no records are available. They have as much chemistry as two castrated cats. <br /> <br /> Guinness has a good moment in a movie that was just one of his Ealing comedy when he climbs a tree trying to close a badminton. But I didn't wait for that movie. <br /> <br /> At least Alec got out of Paris.
