Well, I'm blown, Woody Allen's movie, which I went out in half an hour (I'm aware of the moral uncertainty to comment on a movie I've seen less than half, but I hope you understand why). In principle, it became very clear that we were going to patronize the screen together: a script that provided the impression of the point of view; cast, all of which tried to be Hannah's and his sister's (except Chloe Sevigny's) characters and were badly targeted; and the camera that sat quietly, just to shoot nothing but to talk and act. Drama? Missing; it has been partly told in advance, but it does nothing to develop a dramatic situation. -liner-Allen clones. The script has funny moments? I was almost completely on the back of Will Ferrell trailer extracts (hooked again, doh!)? But there is little temptation to let them fly relentlessly as it is best. Worse than it is not flowability. When it comes to the wood of the film, the forest looks like a marmalade: a discussion with an open cafe is the most terrible case. The only thing to do with numbers is a review? 2/10.
