This is a Wizard review that should not be confused with Wiz or Mr. Wizard. The advisor is a film published in the late eighties that deals seriously with the silent boy's ability to play video games and walk all the way through the opening credit. Wiz is an unnecessary update of the Oz Wizard, and Mr. Wizard is the man who fixed the 100 shoulders and was drinking the child. <br /> <br /> Now that we've all got this way, let me say this: there really is no reason to see this movie. It's just a 100-minute Nintendo van to use Powerglove, Zelda Legend and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "planned" as loosely as possible, because it seems that this movie was overwritten over the weekend by a crowd of people who I had never played Nintendo and directed a man with a lesser feeling than my grandmother. Perhaps, when the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together, they realize that they are going to film all the garbage and go to a vocational school to learn how to install car stereos. <br /> <br /> I hope this is an enlightening experience for you. Surely this hasn't been for me. In fact, I think I could lose a few braincells by watching this movie and writing about it. The next time you're in the video store and see The Wiz, The Wizard, and The Wizard of Oz, sitting on the shelf in a fairly small row, let them all miss and play Duck Hunt.
