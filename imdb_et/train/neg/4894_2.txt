In this movie you will find superfluous, eternal shots, useless pictures, useless scenes. In other words, it seemed to me technically poor. Musical bits are directed to the amateur (it is not possible to synchronize in the future dance, from time to time synchronously, with bad and obvious improvisation, etc.). <br /> <br /> The film is long and boring. In the end, it makes little point and even less sense. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good ideas. Some comics are actually effective, especially in the open scene. But the film gets worse and worse so it's finally totally unbearable and impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> The trailer I saw was very dynamic, which is not right for the film. This means that there is something very close to the conflict between the trailer and the actual movie.
