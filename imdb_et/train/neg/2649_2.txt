My wife and I started watching this movie. It seemed warm and touching. It started well; but soon became dull and honestly idiot after a while. It was so bad that we turned it off. The film was badly behaved and honestly said, we couldn't really understand and didn't want to understand exactly why they hated them with hell! You lost sympathy for him after he was rude and acted on wackos singing and cleaning. I would be committed to it. And, of course, like most movies and T.V series made in Hollywood, we have to throw it into the "gay" symbol! This movie was boring. I was still waiting for Diane Keaton!
