I think it was overpriced PG-13! At least BRITTANY SNOW's performance was good and some others, such as IDRIS ELBA, were good, but some other teenagers promis, like leading friends, were not so convincing. The killer was so stupid and too stupid. The deaths were stupid, boring and completely unoriginal. The film was also very boring and very overpriced. It wasn't tense at all, I almost fell asleep. His second bad PG-13 remake, its a really terrible movie IMO. The end was so stupid and the climax was very fast and boring. The film is also quite slow. All in all, the only good thing about this jama festival is perhaps BRITTANY SNOW, which he thought he had produced a good result and also IDRIS ELBA, but it was also a terrible movie and a terrible remake. Well, that's just my opinion. I gave him 2/10.
