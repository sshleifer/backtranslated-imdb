To be brutally honest ... I loved watching Severed. That's why I gave it a 1/10 star because it was very sleepy <br /> <br /> story / filming / action / everything. This movie was RIOT for viewing. If you enjoy <br /> <br /> watching bad movies to amuse them, you can really get out of Severed. <br /> <br /> The story really doesn't matter, it involves some guy who is bald, and he has a sword and goes out of random people. <br /> <br /> But he has a supernatural twist ... no one has ever seen him. <br /> <br /> Even though in one very memorable scene, he walks in a jampacked nightclub and drops out some girls' noodles and nobody sees it. <br /> <br /> Severed doesn't just look like it was filmed on video, WAS <br /> <br /> filmed on someone's video camera. The filmmakers were <br /> <br /> knowledge about lighting (very thin knowledge) and the composition <br /> <br /> actually encountered in some scene. But most of the time you can't hear <br /> <br /> participants ... you don't understand what they're doing, and you laugh when the next baby boy gets his pumpkin out of his body. <br /> <br /> Go and rent this movie. Support such movies - they are hoot and <br /> <br /> hollow!
