You need to love cheesy low budget movies. This has bad effects, props and bad behavior (really bad). Plus, every time I see Mercedes McNabi (sister), I still mean, "Beware! He's a vamp! "- for those who know Buffy / Angel. <br /> <br /> A perfect example of what happens when someone tastes bad and wants to waste money, but that is little, of course it took. I don't know if I feel more damage to a movie or producer publisher who didn't make money back. <br /> <br /> I would say it is good for small children, but I don't know if I would like to put this baby down ... <br /> <br /> Um ... 1/10 because it's the lowest.
