The film was terrible. The theater was quietly dead because everyone was embarrassed to see such a trash. I think somebody gave Jet Li a lobotomy and made him a script written in a five-year-old dialogue. Martial arts are "ok", but if you put Jackie Chan's movies and "Matrix" aside, it's better to see one of them.
