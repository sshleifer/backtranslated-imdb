I saw the movie last night and I wanted to like it. My expectations of the film have been rising and falling since I heard it. A few days I would see something remarkable and a few days I would be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Yet I am a fan of the great hopes of this movie, but I was finally very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although I love Richard Donner's films, I did not like the changes to their sometimes campy style or Superman character and powers. <br /> <br /> Singer, however, decided to take the worst elements of Donner's films and their versions. <br /> <br /> Although his Lex Luthor is a bit darker, he is still nothing but a shyster, conman and a common criminal. He's not more intelligent when Gene Hackman played him. Kevin Spacey does his best to play Luthor well, but eventually he gets victimized by poor writing and a noticeable dialogue. <br /> <br /> His henchmen are more two-dimensional than even comic books. Most of them do not have any kind of dialogue in the film literally. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS AHEAD **** Kitty Kowalski is almost exactly the same as Tesmacher. He seems to be both evil and cold as Lex Luthor, but he proves that he is just a permanent person who melts after Superman's struggle and quite predictably puts Luthor. Perry White. I wasn't the biggest fan of Perry White in Donner's films, but at least he had a soul. She was all told and done, a veteran reporter who took care of the truth and good story. Langella Perry White is nothing more than a business stooge. He wants everyone to focus on stories about Superman because they sell papers, although every other paper does the same thing. He doesn't care about real stories, real mysteries like black, and what Lex Luthor is now imprisoned for. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, Langella is DULL! Some actors may be quiet and sober, but they still have a down stream that lets you know that the waters are still deep. Frank Langella is a puddle. <br /> <br /> Brandon Routh is not a bad actor. He's OK, but again there is no memorable line in the whole movie. Not an actor's fault. His movements are obviously graceful, as even the slightest movement of his fingers affects his flies. But it still looks choreographically and artificially. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane, as poorly written, worked surprisingly well with Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and writer is again as beautiful as every teenager at Dawson's Creek. <br /> <br /> James Marsden was my favorite actor in the whole movie, mainly because he looks more like Superman than even Routh. Without superpowers, he succeeds in finding out Lois Lane's message, flying on an airplane, accessing Luthor's yacht, and rescuing Lois and his son. <br /> <br /> The only moving moment in the movie is when they are all caught in the pantry, because it is flooded with water and the ship is drowning. You see, these are slowly falling into the waters. You know Superman comes at the last minute to save them, but you can't help but know them. <br /> <br /> As I said before, the plot is very random. Unlike Singer, he said it wasn't the superhero of the movie, who returns and tries to find his place in the world. As soon as he returns, he will greet him with open arms. Lois is the only one who doesn't see her back. Even Luthor is happy to bring Superman back because it gives him the opportunity to calculate a steel man. <br /> <br /> Superman is probably one of the darkest heroes in the universe. The big green meteorite is stolen from the museum, Lex Luthor is out of prison, now he has the knowledge of Superman's powers and weaknesses and yet he is still unable to combine enough points to find out that Luthor is using kryptonite against him. <br /> <br /> According to the film, the only thing for Superman is to really lift things up really hard. The sequences are all incredibly predictable.
