The title "borrowed" from Werner Herzog and Kubrick, Haneke, and Noe's liberal assistants is painfully evident that Thomas Clay sees himself as the usual garbage that our British cinema is throwing away. "Robert Carmichael" (in short) puts himself to be a realistic study of the alienation of young people and at the same time seemingly a criticism of the Iraq war. The problem with reality is that the characters are so obviously unreal and atypical - unlike the unimaginable imaginations of the "extreme" filmmakers, most teenagers are not drug-related rapists. As a critique of the Iraq war, a film of young violence (a gifted individual who has been damaged by a talented classical musician - a subtitle society) is so childish that he hardly thinks. There are signs of technical capability, but some reviewers have overestimated it. Like Kubrick and Noe, he shows that the desire to get involved in a supposedly serious intention can be the worst cinema in the latest films. People liked "Clockwork Orange" and "Unreversible" because they liked rape and violence, but most of all, they liked the higher that they hated the most. So too much Kubrick and not enough Haneke (a serious and moral filmmaker) marks it as one of the most moral films for years. (I am not in the film against violence. To do this seriously, it is a tricky thing - people in cinemas rejoiced Alex at "Clockwork Orange", showing how Kubrick's supposed intention was missed miles. Voluntary violence is much easier to achieve and less offensive than complaints from many art directors.)
