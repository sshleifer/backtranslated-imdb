Steven Seagal's films have never been Oscar's, but with every passing release they get worse and worse. <br /> <br /> It starts with Seagal when it is accepted by the FBI because it killed some people in self-defense. The active army has been rescued from the prison to save the stolen Stealth plane used by the clich√© "Evil English villain" that Hollywood is so obsessed, including these days. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that the film has a terrible dialogue that has almost always been delivered due to the lack of large amounts of cheese and talents. The story is not interesting and there are segments that make no sense and add nothing to the story of a movie as a whole, such as "lesbian" communication between the two main women who are cast there. To titrate purely to get viewers, but not even confusing, because there is no point in why it happened when he didn't. <br /> <br /> In short, a terrible script with a bad dialogue, sub-par participants, boring and sometimes poorly choreographed operational states and insignificant parts, are only meant to achieve almost impossibility and make the movie even worse. <br /> <br /> Save 98 minutes of your life and lose it, even if you are Seagang's most terrible fan.
