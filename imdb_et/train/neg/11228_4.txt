The main error in this movie is its unnecessary script. It captures Bettie's story and the transformation of Klaw's short films back and forth. Although Klaw's creations are well done, there is no need to re-create them. Page Richards, though not an amazing actor, generally does a decent job. And sometimes he bears a remarkable resemblance to Bettie. It is also remarkable for the detailed detailed attention. Costumes and clothes are well done, as well as some set direction. Sets are generally sparse and know step y, but they know this era. Sometimes it is surprisingly well lit and the color palette is clearly thought out to give the overall look a lively and retro feel.
