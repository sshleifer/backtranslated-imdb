Rosario Dawson stands for a girl who has been raped and then begins to get into the darkness until revenge is given. Although his clear reason for taking Dawson's role was to show his acting shackles and make a small independent, decisive and Hollywood film, it also turns out that Dawson seems inappropriate in his role after a stunning look. Forgive me for just not finding him. It's not a mistake, that's how I felt, I had no idea where he was. Yeah, I know he's on the screen, but even though I spent two hours watching him, he didn't impress me. I blame this script because, after its expiration, there wasn't a lot of hell in the real sense of the whole screen. People seemed to be more postural than real and what happened did not fit together. Forgive me for being vague, but nothing in this movie except the end (what I would like to talk about but can't break it), and the picture of Rosario Dawson as something other than a picture left me What can I say, it can click with you it may not, for me it's time I couldn't come back. Only for Rosario Dawson fans, though warned, this is a number of reasons why it is NC17. (And Rosario - please, you are a better actor, choose better scripts)
