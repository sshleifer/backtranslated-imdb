Well, what to say ... <br /> <br /> Having seen the movie, I still have to think about what the hell was all about? V.Dodgy's camera is moving in the yard at one point ... I had to get off the screen, I felt physically ill ... Round and Round and Round .... You get the idea ... <br /> <br /> Very very strange accents on many points .... "Those who should know, know" <br /> <br /> If your admission is free or paid for, or your partner is about to house or paint something ... forget it ...
