I saw "Myra Breckinridge" when it first appeared in 1970. At that time, I was a 20-year-old who loved movies and really loved Raquel's Welsh. Besides, I had read Gore Vidal's novel, which was the basis for it and thought it was very funny. I saw the movie on a local car ride, and about a year and a half I was very tempted to turn my car's engine so I suddenly died of monoxide poisoning and shouldn't see the rest of this ship accident movie. It was not "smart" or "trendy", it was big and sloppy. All the actors were deaf deaf and the director had no idea what he was doing. Casting Mae West was one of the worst choices in film history. As one of the reviewers said here, his role in the film or the book had nothing to do with it. His character in the book is sexually beaten by a young stud who never makes a legendary lady to the West. Oh no, the plot changes so that it sexually wins HIM, a very believable 77-year-old woman who looks every day. I could go, but why? It was a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Bluto
