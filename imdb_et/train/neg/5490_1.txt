When I was a kid, we were always babysat and we always used to rent a movie or watch a movie in the cinema. This is one of the movies we watched. This is one of the stupine movies I've ever seen, I think it may even be Walt Disney Pictures! Marsan falls on the ground, becomes a man, communicates with a person and tries everything he can get back home. But he is disturbed by the miracle of the earth. The only good comment I can give is the choice of actors, Back to the Future by Christopher Lloyd as Mars, Uncle Martin, Dumb and Dumber by Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah as Lizzie. But it is a complete mess. Poor!
