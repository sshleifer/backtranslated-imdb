This movie is incomprehensibly bad. It starts with a number of random explosions and then cuts the T-Rex sock puppet, which tells (!) The public. It moves between the puppet theater and the animation of the socks all the time, probably because the filmmakers cannot afford the living actors. I will save you a long, tiring and relentless plot that will comfort this merciless movie for 85 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of my friends found this very rare video from a hobby shop where I sold print b-movies and bought it just to entertain it, but as it turned out, our intervention wasn't necessary. This film does better than we could. <br /> <br /> I thought Ed Wood's "Space Plan 9" was an existing movie, but leave it on Japanese / Lego cars / Sock dolls to cross him. If you see this movie everywhere, buy it without hesitation. It is very rare and worth much, many laugh good.
