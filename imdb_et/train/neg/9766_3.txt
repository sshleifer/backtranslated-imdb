Roger Corman is undoubtedly one of the most versatile and unpredictable historians. He was alone responsible for some of my favorite fiction films (such as Edgar Allen Poe's "Red Death Mask" and "Pit and Pendulum"), as well as some inadequately cheap and sticky dumps (such as "Creature" Haunted Sea and Shark Reef gods). Corman also made a couple of movies that are simply indivisible and "just put" almost impossible to judge. For example, "The Trip", as well as the imaginary "Gas-ss", can be somewhat labeled as a psychedelic exploitation. Half of the time you have no idea what's going on, those characters are walking back and forth through the screen and where the whole thing goes to hell: The plot is simple and very effective: strange, but deadly nerve gas is accidentally opened and destroyed immediately so that the whole World population over 25 years post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi landmark, but writer George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to make it "trippy" No character even tries to avoid their inevitable future deaths; they just feast on the streets and found little juvenile delinquency syndicates. "Gas-s" is disappointingly boring and trying to be odd. The whole script seems to be improvised on the ground and funny at all. Definitely not my cup of tea, but the film has a loyal fan base and many admirers, so who have I said it's not worth your time or money?
