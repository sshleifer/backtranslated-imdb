If you are one of those people who think "according to Jimi" to a great TV comedy, it will rob your world. And maybe I can add, gold, to prove that a good talent, good writing and charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than ABC, which favors air crap like Jim Belush's exhibition year after year. <br /> <br /> "K-911" is a big, steamy, brown, German shepherd "thank you" for all the geniuses who loved the first movie. That's the fans of this movie and less of the Belush. Jimi's comedic valves and selection in projects are never far from being a blues standard butcher. Make sure he tries to introduce everyone to his diverse talent, as he is a very natural zoo. <br /> <br /> When you enjoy Jimi's work, this movie is your reward.
