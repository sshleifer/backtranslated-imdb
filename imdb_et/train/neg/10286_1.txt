Roommates Sugar and Bobby Lee robbing threatening dudes while shopping, and returning to a lonely island where girls are reluctant to talk to the tangs that they were last visited when they were ten years old and that the treasure is located. Everything that just hides a movie that has pretty much long feedback from the girls' first visit to the island and the subsequent fight with the cannibalistic family. <br /> <br /> This is extremely awful for everyone involved. note that I started to bad bad Hank Worden who really deserved much more. As much as I did not like "Barracuda" (this is the same on DVD), I have to admit that this movie makes it look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: One pair of tits (they may belong to Kirsten Baker) <br /> <br /> My Class: F <br /> <br /> Dark Sky DVD Accessories: Vintage Ads for Different grocery stores; and trailers "Bonnie kids" (feature nudity), "downtown girls", "part-time wife" (feature nudity), "Psychic Killer" and "Eaten Alive". The DVD also features the "Barracuda" 1978
