This film was two and a quarter of the excruciating hours. Please tell me what was the point? <br /> <br /> I mean to understand the historical environment. It should be on the Missouri-Kansas border Confederate bushwhacker (Terrorist?) Predators group, taking revenge on all northern sympathizers and the death penalty during US civil war. But besides the free violence, there wasn't really much point in this movie. Maybe it was a political statement? This war is actually nothing more than free violence? If that was the point that was made quite well, but I don't think it was a thing. I think the producers thought they would make a useful movie here, but it seemed to me that there was no plot. It seemed to me that I was looking at a tiny novel where such characters look like such novels cover. <br /> <br /> This movie must be burned with some of its cities. burned!
