I am certainly in the opinion of this minority. "The Hurt Locker" has won more of the "best picture" prizes than critical films from the critical groups this year. But not only did I not like having a hard time sitting. <br /> <br /> There is a minimal plot and a small character development. They disarm bombs, fight and disarm more bombs. It's the whole movie. But the worst part was that the camera never stopped and was constantly moving. It has been a recent fad of making a movie and it should be more realistic because it is cheap and documentary for him. The camera shook so much that it made me look at the screen. <br /> <br /> Usually warfare films and "Hurt Locker" was no exception. But you don't have to take that word because critics love it.
