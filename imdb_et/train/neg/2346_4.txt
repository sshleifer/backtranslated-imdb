I saw this movie for the first time not too long in the TCM Essentials series. The eye of the seer clich√© was never more careful. This viewer saw little value in it. I had an amazing endless attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed. In this case, Mrs Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this film her character appears more than tempting. I think men, like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley, would be more likely to ignore Lucy than get into her. Bacalli defended this film made by Humphrey Bogart during his last illness and his worsening health may have affected his actions. Of course, this part of Lucy's competition was in contrast to her slutty Marylee, played by Dorothy Malone and her. The scene in which he is engaged in wildly sensual dance when his father is tired of climbing a deadly heart attack on the stairs is the best scene of the film. Malone's play is the rest, although Jasper Hadley's fatigue with his two children 's frustrating behavior is perfectly presented by Robert Keith. In general, I have to say that I am not just a fan of melodrama. Character handling of characters simply makes my taste too unlikely.
