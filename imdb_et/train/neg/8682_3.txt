I want to start by saying that I am Republican, although I disagree with the many things the bush has done. And I love the daily exhibition and the Colbert report. They must be two of my favorite events on TV. I enjoy bush jokes with Conan, Letterman, Leno, because I admit that W is not the smartest man ever to walk on earth (I believe he is not the most stupid). is no longer so funny. I can see where it can be funny and that is (hey, he makes fun of our power, he's fun.). However, comedy is central, but it just tries to make it fun. I mean maybe one special episode, but the whole series is just stupid. CC seems to just say the same bush jokes we've heard repeatedly. I really don't see this example after 1 season.
