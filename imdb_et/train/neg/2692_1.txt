Nacho Vigalondo is very famous in Spain. He's a bad showman who can make you bad ... Very embarrassing. Nacho had made some commercials on television, remembering where Nacho was looking for Paul Mc Carney in Madrid (the commercial was the Mc Carney CD collection). <br /> <br /> This little movie is like a Nacho commercial: a bad story, bad leadership and terrible performances. I can't believe that such a nasty movie was in Kodak theater. Poor Oscar ... <br /> <br /> Nacho could have made this movie for his wife, the 7:35 producer, who was very well connected with a Spanish TV business man.
