I just didn't enjoy this movie. But then I loved Babet, a pig in town, and they have been spoiled by talking about animal films that have been well done. Animals were not pleasant. They were all upset by Chris Rock's guinea pig, but what I would expect is Chris Rock. I believe I smiled a couple of lovely lines once or twice, but that's it.
