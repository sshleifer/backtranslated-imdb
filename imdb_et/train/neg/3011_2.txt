I was very excited to see this film, assuming a visual excursion of artistic beauty and nature, which included "Rivers and Tides" wisdom. But that's not what I got. Instead, I get a rather endless movie about how human activity is bad for nature. This is clearly quite an unusual assertion. <br /> <br /> The photographer seems to be at odds with the aesthetic qualities of his images and the supposed "ethical" obligation with employees who occasionally portray images on the periphery. And, frankly, the pictures were generally not impressive. And according to this "artist", the scale is the basis for what makes something beautiful. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a stupid movie. For people who want to know their environmental awareness better ... but not for anyone who would like to think about the complexity of the surrounding issues.
