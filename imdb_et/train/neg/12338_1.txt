I first saw this movie in the theater when I was 10. Even at this age, "humor" was slightly offensive to the intelligence of my adolescents. <br /> <br /> Earlier I saw Ed Begley Jr. or jeff Goldblum I taste and start to feel very uncomfortable and even a little sad. Until I was reminded of the existence of this film, I wasn't sure why I felt that way. I probably blocked the memory of this movie, but my negative feelings for the two criminals remained. Obviously I forgot that I saw this movie, but unconsciously mourned the thefts of my soul, the creators of this inhumane work in EATEN. <br /> <br /> I'm not brave enough to watch it as an adult. I imagine that as part of the healing process, I should probably look at the fear of this childhood so I can really put it. Some regression treatments and / or hypnosis may also not be a bad idea.
