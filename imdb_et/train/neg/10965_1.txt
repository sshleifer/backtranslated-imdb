I'm watching this movie when I write it. . . If the following comments "prove their lack of development as a true, artistic filmmaker" then be it. . . <br /> <br /> But. . . I thought this movie was still thinking. . . to put it mildly, it is very, very overpriced. Again, very much. <br /> <br /> It looks like a really bad student film made by someone with extremely limited resources. . . and who didn't pay so much attention to the details. <br /> <br /> I don't want to go any further and look at all the different ways I find this movie missing. . . well. . . I just can't get it (rememeber, I fully acknowledge that maybe it's me, it's an idiot here - not a filmmaker - to get this "imaginative gene." Sheesh...
