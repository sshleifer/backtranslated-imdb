The plot is simple when one man lives in the woods one day from the main road to witness a man who murders a child in the forest. Soft digging follows the old man's attempts to try to convince the police that what he saw was not his imagination. However, there is a problem every time the old man runs the police where the murder happens. Soft For Digging has a small dialogue that reflects most of the scenes in the movie, a man living in an old house. During the film, I discovered that I was afraid twice, namely when the murdered child suddenly appears before an old man. The rest of the film I have to admit didn't involve me; I found the movie pace a little too slowly. Restricted dialogue was not a problem. However, the story and its conclusions after watching the film took too long. I feel that there could have been more of relationships, ghostly meetings, child and old man. In the forest alone at night, your own mind may not be sure that children are always scary as ghosts, see Dark Water.
