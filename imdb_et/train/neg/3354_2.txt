This is my opinion that if you decide to do a very good movie, you should try to do better than the original; or at least give it a fresh perspective. Robert Wise, 1963, talks about the entrance price of Shirley Jackson's remarkable novel "The Hill House Ghost". Now on in 1999 and done again. I shook my head and asked why? The action is wood, the story is recognizable and the whole point seems to be the replacement of the original horror with so many special effects computers that can be created. I had heard that this update was bad; but could not believe that it was so bad considering the source material. I was wrong. After watching and saying to his wife how terrible it was, he said; "Well, they got their money!" He's right, don't let them get you. If there is no profit on unlikely reprocessing, they will stop making them or reach a higher standard that does not violate their audience
