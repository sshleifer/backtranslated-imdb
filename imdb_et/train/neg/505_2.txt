Wow-it sucks. I will finish it as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Count invites 4 naive bitches back to their castle. Nothing happens for a long time. Some flat and erotic soft core scenarios are happening. Some girls can stop their head (turning off the screen) - end. The only thing that goes for it is decent looking kits and costumes, some bad duplication leading to some inadvertently funny dialogue, and some short nudie shots. And believe me - these things aren't enough to redeem the 90-minute tedium that this movie has. In fact, the best part of a widespread distributor is the beginning, which contains some chickens covered with blood and shows your tits and again - this is definitely not the cost of receiving this garbage. As everyone else has pointed out, the title of the film is totally meaningless, because the film has no blood or dancing at all. It may also be the so-called Kitsirull-headed circular-jerk, and at least it would have had a better title that also touches something in the movie. The exact title would have been the "90 Torture Protocol" - another tempting title that would have been at least true for the viewer. To be honest - the trailer on the disc shows all the best parts (and I use the term "best" extremely loosely ...), so I recommend that you look at it very much if you're still curious. I can't imagine anyone who would like the wreck of this movie - please take my advice and leave it on the shelf. 2/10
