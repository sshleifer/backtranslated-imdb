Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is a senior housewife living in a suburban private model with her two children and her abusive husband Kenneth (Craig Sheffer). Della pays attention to the twins, ignoring her house and appearance and mixing Kenneth. On Christmas Eve he goes to the local shopping center at night to buy gift wrapping paper and he can't find a parking space. When he sees in an old car that is parked in two places, he leaves a message to the owner that calls him "selfish jerk". When the mall closes, does Della keep the car by the driver of the old car and is threatened by four mites? Chuckie (Lukas Haas), African-American Huey (Jamie Starr), Chinese American Vingh (Leonard Wu) and Latin-Tomas (Luis Chávez). When a mall security guard protects her, Chuckie strikes her head, Della accelerates her car, trying to escape from the criminals. But he runs his truck near the forest when that gang is. He takes the toolbox and hides the tree, fighting the gang to survive. <br /> <br /> A few days ago, I saw a trailer while he was out and I wanted to watch a DVD. Unfortunately, the trailer is better than the film, and I am completely disappointed with this dull and unlikely cluster of clichés. Della Myers is an insecure and reckless housewife and not a husband; Motherhood is her only interest in the concept of family. He pursues four major criminals, but he wins them with a toolbox that seems to be Batman's useful belt. Therefore, the plot is so absurd that it irritates. The criminals are the favorite film of American films, where African-American, Chinese-American and Latin, along with American lord, are politically correct. Kim Basinger is doing well, but their children are too young for a fifty-five-year-old woman. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Enquanto Ela Esta Fora" ("While He Was Out")
