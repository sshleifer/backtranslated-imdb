On the other side of Steven Soderbergh's revolutionary bio, Che Guevaral is engaged in his latest campaign to export to Bolivia. In order to maintain his sacred vision of Che Soderbergh, he jumped comfortably to the mass executions he led after the revolution in Cuba and the stupidity of his Congolese adventure ("This is the history of failure" he writes to the forefront of his Congolese journal) to concentrate entirely on Che's support of attacking the Bolivian government against. It would have been a disaster and a definitive act by Guevara. <br /> <br /> The first chapter hit here, because Soderbergh slows down his film to study indexing Guevara. Bernicio Del Toro, like James Dean, in the eastern part of Eden. The problem is that Guevara can't convert, and he finds that he and the hungry comrades are swallowed up in the heart of darkness in the jungle of Bolivia. Unlike Werner Herzog in excellent Aguirre, God's anger at Soderberg does not use the jungle's metaphorical ways to augment the ghoul's despair. He seems to be more interested in keeping Che Numbers in his head than to look at the panic that is dead on himself. There is a moment in Herzogia where Che sits in a hurry to hunt and yell at the horse, but the overall arena of Soderbergh's mass is still flat, sloppy and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Both of his "Soderbergh" films show that he is clearly a Che groupie and that's why his focus remains myopic and narrow. He spends too much time on building his monument to Che and too little to develop his relationship with his saga, especially with Fidel Castro. It makes it worse with a slow and unpleasant approach that never comes. One might think that he was enough Eisenstein and Vertov to realize that a wide-ranging change is much better than wiping.
