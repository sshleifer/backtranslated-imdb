I was lucky enough to read the book before watching the movie. It was an adolescent epic, a dream from the summers, a great potential indie movie or a big budget drama. It has somehow got into the hands of the cages, which, when looking at Boogie Nights and Rushmore, clearly showed signs without learning anything at all. The script loses the book's meat against forced emotional notes and low eyebrows. I feel sorry for the actors because the characters in the book were rich and textured, but they cut the film into embarrassing factors. Mason Gamble is a great opportunity, as is Dylan Baker, but the story that has remained is played as special after school. Poor People = GOOD, Rich = BAD. <br /> <br /> Although it is almost worth seeing the South California beach where Gary Blue parked his trailer for the Delaware Bay. <br /> <br /> This is a good book, but an embarrassing occasion for the first time for director Mills Goodloe. <br /> <br /> K.
