I think Cliff Robertson was definitely one of our best actors. He has half a dozen classics for his credit. He's doing a hard one here, but the direction is so bad and the pace is so tiring that it never gets out of the mark. The story begins well, although it makes me think about how he could count on his wife hanging. Still, he crowns well and carries out things. The death rate is double. First of all, if we took the time taken from one room to another or one part, it would take about a third of the film. Add to that, the Robertson symbol sits in a blue light in the bed, looking for confusion that can add another piece. I agree with those who said that a half-hour shorter would have made this a pretty decent, though insignificant movie. The biggest weakness is just a complex plot, all of which has been said and done, leaving incredible questions. I won't loose the spoiler, but if it ends, don't think too much. I can get out of ten if not sweat. It would have been better if it had remained a story.
