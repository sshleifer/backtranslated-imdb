Like Superman's long-time fan of comics, the 1950s series, the first two of Chris Reeves and Lois & Clark, and finally Smallville, I was * very hopeful that "Superman Returns" is something smart. Instead, we got a Lex Luthor * second * test for real estate conversion, another Superman-beaten-up-up-kryptonite sequence, and internal contradictions: he couldn't fall into the ocean when it was stuck with 6-degree kryptonite, but when Lois breaks it 3 , * leaving the rest in him, * can he * bring the continent * into space? Really, the only hero in the story was Loise's partner - I don't remember her name. He did all kinds of life-saving, heroic things that had nothing but guts and skill - no superpower, no vulnerability ... just normal person. <br /> <br /> They make Superman so small. Why we can't fight Superman with Brainiac and don't fight to save the universe from General Zodi instead of Lex's small schemes. Oh, I forgot ... they're doing it in Smallville. <br /> <br /> Yes, I think I'd stay with Smallville ... <br /> <br /> You probably should ...
