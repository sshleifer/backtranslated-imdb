Devil Hunter was renowned for being on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list, but it doesn't really have to be. Many of the films on the list that have only known causes for God (and DPP), and although it is not a bunch; there is not much here that would prohibit prohibition ... which is disgraceful because I would never have been through it unless it was a "shopping list". The plot actually provides the film with a decent foundation - or at least a more decent base than most cannibal films - and follows an actress who has been kidnapped and pulled into the Amazon jungle. The hunter is hired to find him, but along the way he has to dare the natives, led by a man who calls himself a "devil" (hence the title). The film is basically just eighty-five minutes long and there aren't really many interesting scenes there. It is a real shame that Jess Franco made such films because the man is clearly a talent; like movies like Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Fur, Faceless and he's killing Ecstasy's, but unfortunately his good movies are just gems among the tombs and Devil Hunter is very much a part. I saw this movie purely because I want to say I've seen everything in the DPP list (two more to go!), And I think most other people who saw it saw it. But if you're not watching Nasties; there really is no reason to worry there.
