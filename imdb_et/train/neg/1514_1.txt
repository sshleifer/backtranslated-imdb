I just saw this movie yesterday. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend wanted to see it only because of Richard Gere. <br /> <br /> I feel like I was wasting my time and money and told my girlfriend that this is the last time we go to watch the movie because some actor / actor is in it. I hope he learned the lesson because I had trouble holding his seat. From me, since I already paid, I wanted to see the end at least, hoping that something good would come up, but I didn't hold my breath and fortunately I was a victim of the film. just the same. <br /> <br /> This is not a black and white film, it is black and black. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as his registrants, and all sex offenders are portrayed as recyclable serious criminals and their bad ones are really very bad. Talk about clich√©s and the use of typical US phobia. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere's actions were good as usual, but the blonde girl who was supposed to replace her was at best tiring. Fully convincing to work. <br /> <br /> The film tries to use a popular theme and gives it a cheap, dramatic and sensational turn that is simply unrealistic. They just use sex offenders to apologize for cheap violent murders, beat the beaters, rape and torture - something that almost seems free. They even have a wolf attacking the people in the movie - how little you get. <br /> <br /> I collect a movie that doesn't come out in the US and goes straight to DVD. It was so that it should have stayed in other countries, but because it was Hollywood and Richard Gere, they just had to show it. Believe me, without Gere, the film is not even worth the B-series movie.
