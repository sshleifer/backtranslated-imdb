Well ... the movie was fun. The main problem with this movie is that it contradicts everything that most vampire vendors follow. Like the vampires that are exposed to sunlight. Although there are parts that just enjoy how society is filming. A scene in which a vampire is banged and shouting: "It's painful ... It's really stuck." Then it seems that there may be scenes, but get used to it after a while. And there are random dreamers who really don't help with the plot. Come to think, nothing really makes sense, but I just got a lot of friends and looked at it twice to get the full effect. Come to think that fighting scenes were amazing and the zombies were just fun to watch. Slowly, when I write more, I like this movie more. But you know you can't wait for Schindler's list, but for a fun clock.
