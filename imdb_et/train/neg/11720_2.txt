I read in the papers that Snipes broke, so it is no wonder that he would take part in low-budget projects like a contractor. He is just the next club in the action of growing stars: the millennia of the 90s (Van Damme, Segal, Lundgren, Snipes). Here, it means cheap activities from Bulgaria. We should believe that this location is London, as it would only be bought by a full moor. The story is one of 1,000 other movies: pensioners with special strength man can work for government again to do damp work - after the government wants to get rid of him - a good man goes away after killing bad guys (was it a spoiler? Guess not!) Movie Star: Little Girl (Eliza Bennett) Outperforms All Other Hope !!! One letter is for him and one letter for candy Lena Headey makes 2 stars. Only for fans of hard hard snips!
