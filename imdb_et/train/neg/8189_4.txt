It's always difficult if your sister is better than you in your life, always struggling to get out of the shade and not let bitter keep away from your family. So, imagine that your older brother is Santa and imagine how tough it must be. This is a prerequisite here. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn plays the title of Fred, a despised loser who spends a lot of his energy ensuring that people do not go around waiting for good things or giving their brother, Santa (played by Paul Giamatti), too much praise for being just a limelight, a celebrity-hungry, slightly creepy guy Fred would like to imagine. Then, whether you know it, Fred needs a financial profit and must pay for it by helping his brother during Christmas. And the fun and the lifetime will last. Well, that should happen. The reality is that we arrive at a Christmas movie that contains some good moments of Vaughn's patented quick talk, a ridiculously non-musical video, Kevin Spacey playing an auditor to close Santa's operation (and he's one of the weakest ghosts I've ever seen), not enough proud Elizabeth Banks in a lush Christmas dress, too much John Michael Higgins in her elf dress (to be fair, she is highlighted) and a movie that is too bitter feels like a good seasonal price that is too schmaltzy in the last half to feel for a fun time in the bad times of commercial times. <br /> <br /> Rachel Weisz is also for driving, like Kathy Bates, but it's really something other than a movie for Vaughn and if you like her style, you'll find something to enjoy here. Unfortunately, the seasonal smoker is recommended. Outside of Vaughn's beaches, the script barely throws anything off, except for one particularly good scene that includes a fun support group that deals with a very specific problem. <br /> <br /> The direction of David Dobkin is as mediocre as the 20p Christmas card that sends you aunt that you haven't seen in 10 years, and it seems to think that combining ingredients without a good blend or proper care will give you a tasty Christmas pudding. No, we get a burned, strange piece with too much sugar. Forget it and paste the fun Elf again if you want a great, contemporary Christmas comedy. <br /> <br /> Look at it if you like: Santa Claus 2, Santa Baby, Santa Claus 3: Escape clause.
