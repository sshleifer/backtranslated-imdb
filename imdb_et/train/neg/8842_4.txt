It is somewhat said that most of the IMDb's great reviews come from people who have only reviewed one movie throughout their IMDb career and thought this film was "Parasomnia". I have often suspected that IMDb has suspicious comments about what is something other than a good movie than atypical marketing, but it seems quite transparent in this case. <br /> <br /> It doesn't mean that Parasomnia is terrible, but it stops well as a good or big movie with potential to be. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, this big baddie, Patrick Kilpatrick, who does a great job of depicting dangerous and evil, I saw he has what he needs to play a truly memorable baddie parallel to Hannibal With Lecter. There are beautiful visuals in the dream sequences, in fact, if the film had decided to study this landscape more, there might have been something better. The real concept of dignified misuse of hypnosis is also very good. <br /> <br /> While I realize that incredible stopping is necessary for any kind of good story, it is a good sign that you will be able to do it. If you find yourself annoying about what you find illogical or just stupid, then the story loses you and that's what happens to that movie with me. The other reviewers have mentioned this here and I don't want to enter the spoiler's territory, but I say that the setup at the end was particularly ridiculous and disappointing, not too much to mention the changing mental age of the character, which should only be experienced. maliciously misused hypnotism, but unfortunately this film cannot understand anything special.
