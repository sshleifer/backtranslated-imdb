Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. However, I feel he sold his first big budget leading role. Foxx follows the traces of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotypical producers who think black men with beautiful crimes are a funny concept (See: Money talks, Blue Streak). Okay, I laughed a few times and continued to give all these comedians fun roles, but I would like to see these men occupy Marlon Wayans in the Requiem dream. Or, The Color of Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans are moving the performances of Spike Lee satire Bamboozled.
