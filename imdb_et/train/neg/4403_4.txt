Regardless of the usefulness of the film, it is poorly investigated. As others have pointed out, the film shows Iranian locals in Arabic rather than Persian. It is enough to lose credibility for anyone with the least knowledge of the region or country. The landscape may not be different from the real one. The Turkish ambassador bears Fez (red hat), while Turkey banned Fez much before setting up the film. The Turkish Ambassador's daughter is actually dressed in Indian and Indian classical music plays against the background of many scenes. I think the filmmakers had to show an exotic woman, and the series was what they decided to make exotic.
