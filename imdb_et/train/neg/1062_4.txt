Ouch! It was a bit painful to sit. It is a lovely and amusing premise, but everything goes to hell from there. Matthew Modine is almost always a pedestrian and annoying and he doesn't cheat on it. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville made surprisingly decent performances. Among other things, Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly played it up. I know that parts are written and it is difficult to blame the participants when the script and the director do them. If you have annoying signs, it is OK, but you must have good material to make it work. It wasn't here. If at all possible, run out of this movie yelling.
