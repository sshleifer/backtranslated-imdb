This show is terrible. How does George want his mother to die funny? This show is terrible. Parents are obviously terrible and children need to be cared for. The daughter is a witch with b and the son is just complete. George is not funny, especially when he speaks of his loud and reluctant trademark of Spanglish. Ernie is a loser, but at least I have smiled her a few times, but mainly how pathetic she is. George's mother, Benny, is terrible, despicable. Of course, his wife left him, but how can someone laugh at how he treated George as a child behind me. <br /> <br /> Can anyone explain to me how George's head is big? It's not that big! I have moved characters because they are too horrible and it takes hours for me to write and, frankly, I don't care enough about it. I take care enough to tell someone who is watching it and wonder if they want to show it, whether this exhibition is an abstract excuse for sitcom and is not worth your time. <br /> <br /> I give it to start with 2 because the woman is extremely attractive.
