At the time of writing this review, it seems that over 50% of the IMDb voters rated this film as 10 or 1. I can only assume that those who gave it to 10 were either cast or team members. They say that enough for monkeys and enough time and enough typewriters, those monkeys who simply have random proddings on the keyboard would eventually write out all Shakespeare's works. But I seriously doubt that given the same number of monkeys and time it would be possible to find one that gives an evaluation of this film. or characters or maybe make some social comment or hardly provoke intellectual thinking. Otherwise, I was prepared to pay attention to deeds, arrest, comedy, horror or even free sex. Ultimately, I was disappointed, and as a result, a large part of the second half was double-speeded because I was looking for some small film redemption. Unfortunately, this was not the case. <br /> <br /> When "The Choke" was set against the Scooby Doo episode, I am afraid that the cartoon won hands with mystery, intrigue, and unpredictability. And when talking about comic characters, the ability of the various cast members to act was (at best) and embarrassingly poor, when Brooke Bailey depicted a mad, deadly apprehended pseudo-goth, London, so bad that I almost knew him. br /> <br /> I would have liked to finish with a positive comment, but even the sound that is a secondary contemporary punk rock party didn't even succeed in the sense of entertainment, not to mention a very bad flick.
