Trust me, it's one to let the movie you want to avoid and it comes from one big Denzel Washington fan. The depressing part is that it's 1/3 of the big movie. The first part of this film makes an extraordinary job of creating a character and creating a new relationship between Creasy and her protected girl. The trailers of this film mention that he has been kidnapped. So, I am not giving away when I say that the film is abducting an abduction after it has been kidnapped. Regardless of what the director was trying to achieve, everything he succeeds makes the audience literally malicious. Fast, frantic and filthy cutting follows in the next half hour when Creasy ranks criminals. These cuts are so unnatural and nauseous that everything they do is defeat you. I'm sure the director thought that this unpleasant way to introduce the story meant a change in the character of Creasy and meant that a different film would have to be followed. Well, he was right. The following film was complete and unsatisfactory. This results in a depressing ending that even destroys the first forty minutes of the movie.
