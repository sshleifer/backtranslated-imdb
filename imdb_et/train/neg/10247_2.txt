It's one of the most boring films I've ever seen, it's terrible. Christopher Lee is good, but he is hardly the only good part of the opening plan. <br /> <br /> Don't let the headline cheat. "End of the World" is really a bad movie, I stopped to look at it, it was so bad, just for dead hard b-movie fans who have a brain to vomit.
