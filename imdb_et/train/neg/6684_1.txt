It should be renamed "The curious case of undisturbed filmmakers who deceived non-horror as a hit film." It's a long, boring story about brotherhood that is so transparent that even the Delta House flounder can see it. Jeff East, a paid-in actor, can forgive any work he's got. The same cannot be said of Charles Martin Smith, who used to operate cinematographic heavy vehicles like George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah. When the tape is available but fortunately not on DVD. Misused rubbish as it belongs to a landfill and somewhere else.
