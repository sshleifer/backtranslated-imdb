This is the kind of thing that only throws the cerebrum of the movie. After all, Feierstein's Flex Crush is known to Real Men not seeing anything from Truffaut. Maybe it would have been interesting if Truffaut had something to do here. The camera-as-voyeur motif was nothing new. Have we all forgotten De Sica's "bicycle thief"? Or something about Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> So all we get is an extended metaphore of a minor as Truffu, who spends all his free-time eyes in movies that drive school market discipline, accused of plagiarism (many small thefts), and finally flee social borders to make your "movie". Sorry, ... I was there, done it too many times to make it important.
