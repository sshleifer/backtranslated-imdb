Operation was both terrible and a scenario. It was badly assembled and made you almost want to laugh at the scenes of many terrible murders. The end was even worse. Everyone died, but somehow it ended like everything was OK! They didn't give enough history about teacher obsession, etc. The only reason I give it 3/10 is that I feel bad about young actors. They needed better guidance. They could have really made an OK movie, but the scenario and action failed.
