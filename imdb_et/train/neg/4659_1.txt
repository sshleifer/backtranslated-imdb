This movie is a waste of film stock. Do you think that a military mission plan map will be placed on a ceramic plate on the terrace with a full daylight for anyone with a binocular or a camera with a zoom lens? It happened in this movie. Do you think a DEAF person would actually be in the service of an active army during World War II in Europe? It happened in this movie. Do you believe that a black (and supposedly intelligent) officer would choose the same DEAF K.P. to be part of an active combat mission to protect the dam of the dam before the Allies arrive? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that the DEAF soldier didn't think the German plane was approaching from behind and wanted to kill him? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that a group of American soldiers would keep the farm that Germans had in the barn where they saw their emotions in the eyes of the German soldiers? They did it on this film and left possible entrances to the table where the Germans could control it completely unprotected. Would you believe that the captain mentioned the General, if not his name, as a fluent and clear English, and the person with whom he spoke, and that the general, just in English, was to protect the oak the next day? Perhaps they should have just sent in to say what direction the American attack would come from to make it easier for the Germans. This so-called film should be placed on the list of the 50 worst films. If that were the case, then I'm sure it would be fine. See it at your own risk.
