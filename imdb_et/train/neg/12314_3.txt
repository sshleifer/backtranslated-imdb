Maybe I am old, but it just left me and the old funny bones completely gone. Certainly, there must be something powerful wrong with this Irishman (that's me, Schultz!). Lordy, lordy, what I would give to see the light! First, Phil Silver's mania energy, wit and ride were very much part of the comic education and general life training you wanted. Although it is possible that a series with the first title: "You may never be a RICH" (1955-59 *) could have been with CBS TV network Sgt. Bilko, it's very hard to imagine any other actor / comedian in the business world that carries these sergeant bands. <br /> <br /> This strong identification is an inevitable, though not the same nightmare nightmare that it has proven to be another man like Clayton More ("THE LONE RANGER"), George Reeves ("SUPERMAN RECOMMENDATIONS") and Charles Nelson Riley ("UNCLE CROC'S BLOCK"). <br /> <br /> One of the main stumbling blocks to successfully adapting and updating this work from the 1950s television screen to the release of the 1990s movie is our shared memory. Without being sure what percentage of the crowd Bilko character was commemorating, the original move and the revival of the early syndicate saw a significant number; even a lot of young people saw Bilko for the last time. It is obvious that the new film and source were miles; or even for the light years. <br /> <br /> To not think like a completely square old, look at some other point. In November of our Lord in 2007 let me swear and affirm that I have been a fan of Steve Martin for almost 30 years. In addition, I've enjoyed Bilko '96 Co-Stars Dan Akroyd and late Phil Hartman. After all, it was just the alumni of the boys and so many other talents, "NBC Saturday night" and "SECOND CITY TV" who kept laughing in the last quarter of the 20th century. But BILKO is doing it again; it just didn't click. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the movie was made into a service comedy (always liked!), but without Bilko's show names and gave it its own identity. more that old boys respect as I do. <br /> <br /> So we've got so many sitcom and multimedia stories to become movies lately, what's next? What does Hal Roach's World War II Army Comedy Sergeant DOUBLEDAY & AMES and the TV's First Cartoon Series "CRUSADER RABBIT" do? Remember where you heard it for the first time! POODLE SCHNITZ!
