The opening order should show the legion arriving in Paris on 13 November 1918. Wars looked out of the train - wearing a uniform in which the French army, including the legion, drove to war in 1914! This is a sure sign that the warfare you see is a turkey. (The French army realized in 1915 that the war with red trousers and dark blue coats did not work. French soldiers were placed in the "horizon blue" and colonial troops were put into khaki.) The remake of Claude Van-Damme (sp?) Was at least more or less correct. It is really too bad if the directors make such mistakes when they do everything they can to get other things right.
