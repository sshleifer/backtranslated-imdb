One person who takes a rap against a woman in a case of murder is a worn plot of + worn-out bystander on the inside, which is finally turned off. In the case, one might think that the film will rise above its hackneyed origin. However, the scene after the scene has not changed in intensity, the arches of the mark are not, and inexplicable behavior. It seems that it was only included in the viewer's title. When does Hollywood learn that making gay characters does not automatically convince the image? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a terrible movie. When will Lauren Bacall choose good? I was expecting him better and Kristin Scott Thomas. This is definitely one unforgettable.
