I am Ted V The big fan and the original "Corpse Grinders" is the main reason it is, but it is probably the worst film I've ever seen. Even the glorious casting of the legendary Liz Renay ("Desperate Living") could not save this precious garbage. This movie should be a lesson for all past, present and future filmmakers ... if you have a movie as successful as the original "Corpse Grinders", you should probably sleep in a dog and certainly you shouldn't revive it more than twenty years later (if you don't have one) financial support to draw a higher ranking as Herschel Gordon Lewis did "Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat") Even if you decide to do this, you should probably spend a little more money than you did on the original and for God ... video for video ... why filmmakers are trying to do it even when everyone knows that quality will turn out to be ugly ... yet to see one movie made in this way that is even worth the powder to break into hell ... if you can't afford to have it better than the original movie, then sell the movie rights to someone who can ... and what was Ted V Mikels thinking (or smoking) when he wrote this god-a smart script? I mean, fire, dog and cat "foreigners" from another planet? Cardboard box painted so that it looks like a devastating machine capable of grinding human bodies ... bones and clothes and everything? If any of these actors, in addition to Liz Renay, were paid more than five dollars for their terrible performances, if they were highly paid! Avoid this movie at all costs and see the original.
