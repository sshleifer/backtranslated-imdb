I suddenly wake up, knowing that I burned a plastic sofa cover and realize it is warm on Saturday afternoon. Why did I sleep? Did I hit my head? Or accidentally swallow all my grandmother's muscle relaxants? Could it be adult narcolepsy? <br /> <br /> No, I stopped for a moment Cheap seats when the channel was surfing, and the stunning lack of stunning and talent emptied my vitality so quickly that I would smear. <br /> <br /> Head shaking, foot-agape, shrugging tired. But I have to give these moral and boring twins credit to sell this idea. Maybe they had the same effect on the ESPN programming managers they had with me, and when he woke up, a few terrible episodes were already possible and he hoped that as all the viewers sleep, someone now, how terrible it is and he can keep it $ 425,000 annual salary. <br /> <br /> You are alerted.
