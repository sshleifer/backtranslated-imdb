When "My Deja Vu, My Deja Vu" aired last season, I was happy. I thought Scrubs would make something clever and unique about the clip-show concept. Instead of reproducing the film material, they play jokes in a self-conscious way and I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I found it really unfortunate that I was wrong. One season later, they went against what almost all sitcoms inevitably do, showing the clip ... and it seemed like it had been put together by a child of work experience. Dr Cox's shaved head shows how lazy editors put it together because it doesn't appear again until "My Long Goodbye" is about 4 episodes later. I can't imagine the wig is too much trouble when it comes to maintaining the order that was once built for sitcom. Who knows why it was there, it just seemed lazy and at times, reminding me (largely) of the episodes that have been fueled over the past year. <br /> <br /> Three seconds left with background music is an extra feature of a DVD on a (very) rainy day, not an episode of first-time television.
