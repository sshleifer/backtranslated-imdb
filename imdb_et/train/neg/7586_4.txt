Summer Holiday is a forgotten musical version of Eugene O'Neill's Ah Wilderness and has served as a musical adaptation of Broadway to Take Me Along. No other song by Harry Warren-Ralph Blane is reminiscent, except for Stanley Steamer's song, and even this is questionable. <br /> <br /> Immediately after this movie was released, MGM let Mickey go to Rooney and I don't think it was a coincidence. The film was made in 1946 and appeared in 1948, so Mickey was 26-year-old Andy Hardy as a teenager. He was too old for the 17-year-old to influence the radical idea of ​​a youthful rebellion. <br /> <br /> Rooney made four movies for MGM 1946-1948, Killer McCoy Robert Taylor A Crowd Roars, Love Laughs Andy Hardy and Words and Music. In all of them, Rooney played an adult part. Even Andy Hardy's film, Mickey, was played by Andy Hardy, an adult who was returned from World War II. Why did he only know about this Louis B. Mayer? <br /> <br /> Rooney's bad casting makes the summer vacation even worse because the original Ah Wilderness emphasizes the father's character that Walter Huston played here. And at Broadway's Take Me Along, which won Tony's prize for Jackie Gleason, Great One played an intimate brother-in-law, Uncle Sid, played by Frank Morgan, and it is central. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven joins Judy Garland when Rooney's sweet and adorable girl friend and Marilyn Maxwell plays a show girl who gives Rooney adult education. In the original game, O'Neill has a prostitute, but it was Code Hollywood, so all Marilyn has a young Rooney Soused. <br /> <br /> A lot of gifted talented people were in this hand and they were doing their best, but the summer break disappeared quite quickly into a cool autumn.
