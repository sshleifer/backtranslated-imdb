I say one thing to Jeanette and Nelson - even when it is puzzled, effortless, painfully uneven in music like this, there are still eyes. Yes, there is chemistry between the famous duo even when the material is thin. Even when the score is practically empty, it is missing depending on only a few memorable stories. And even if the circumstances are so incredible - yes, even for fantasy. <br /> <br /> The fact that he has more chemistry with Nelson than his actual husband, Gene Raymond, at SMILIN, was nevertheless a much better film. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I love Jeanette and Nelson as much as the next fan, but it's at the bottom of the pile. Jeanette is in her "Hep" issue with Binnie Barnes more or less embarrassing, and Nelson can only come with an empty enthusiasm when faced with the most ridiculous situations. <br /> <br /> Just ask what it was like in Broadway in 1938. It must be more witty and stylish than this weak MGM production. Edward Everett Horton worships uncomfortably and no supportive player can breathe life into this confusion. It's like an amateur at night in the studio, even if a few professionals are sprinkled with supportive pain. <br /> <br /> To sum up: painfully cluttering the music of Rodger and Hart. You can't even recommend it to MacDonald and Eddy fans. And even if Jeanette's close-ups still burn with her gossamer beauty, this movie is jaw-bad.
