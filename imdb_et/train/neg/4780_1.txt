I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I've ever seen. I would recommend this comic to people under 5 years old. I used this example when I was 4 and 5, I only looked at it when there was nothing. Now I'm the second 5 and I'd rather do my homework than watch it. The classic movie was a little funny, but it wasn't enough to laugh at me. Now I am the parent I am interested in. I've started a doctorate (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane's adventure (PG). I'm interested in what to do with a doctor. So I don't care about 5-year-old cartoons. This comic didn't last long, but it was just six seasons, it was canceled because it was low for viewers, but some people say it was because writers have run out of ideas, but for most other exhibitions they have at least 8 seasons.
