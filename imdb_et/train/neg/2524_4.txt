Title: Robot Jox (1990) <br /> <br /> Director: Stuart Gordon <br /> <br /> Cast: Gary Graham, Anne Marie Johnson, Paul Koslo <br /> <br /> Review: Stuart Gordon who we usually associate with extremely harsh horror movies like Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon and Castle Freak, took a small detour here and made a small sci-fi flick. I emphasize the word "little" because it is a very low budget flick and there is its main weakness. <br /> <br /> The story will happen in the future. A world where big powers (that the United States and Russia according to this film) are destroying their differences, not through a full blown world war ... but fighting with gladiator-style battles with giant robots. Our hero, Achilles, must go against Alexander, the fighter of the evil Russian robot. A lot of cheap stop motion animations appear. <br /> <br /> Well, the idea is awesome. Big countries that have territorial disputes with giant robots? An interesting assumption and one that could have been properly dealt with if there was a proper budget. Unfortunately, what could have been a fun movie, is embarrassingly a big director. <br /> <br /> Like a child I loved this movie and I think if you want to get out of this movie, I have to go back to a little boy mode to have fun with it. I showed this movie to some of my friends and when the movie came to my friends, I liked it, "what the hell is that piece of franc?" And I'm like this movie is one of my favorite directors, Stuart Gordon's sci-fi. it was because I loved this movie as a child, and yet there is still a bit of nostalgia, but not everyone else just got it. <br /> <br /> And I myself realized that this movie is not really good. The video is about giant robots that are bouncing each other, and you need to use some good special effects to work reliably. The expensive effect of this would help the audience stop the disbelief, but unfortunately it is a small-sized company (Empire Pictures, which went bankrupt after making the film), but these consequences just make us laugh and laugh. Sets and part of the wardrobe are unfinished or semi-secured. <br /> <br /> OK, if you agree that you are watching a modest mix of animation and miniatures, you can do it yourself and even enjoy the big robots that bounce. There are certain scenes to fight the robots that are cool, and let me go that I liked thid movie! But everyone knows and these, some nervous effect leads you to the protective small cocoons you were trying to hide. And the boom, your right to realize this movie just doesn't match that assumption. <br /> <br /> And heres are another thing that bothered me a bit about the movie. This film is basically a film for children. Do you know giant robots? Stop moving animation? Hi? But there was a lot of sexual innuendo in the film dialogue, and the violence gets a little bloody. So I asked myself whether it's a children's film or not? After a while, I just came to the conclusion that it was basically a child with adult sensitivity, which is not really a good mix. <br /> <br /> So for those of you who don't know this particular naive childlike charm, look at two robots fighting against each other and if you don't have a nostalgic connection with this movie (like me), then we suggest you lead it away . Gordons is a great director, but the movie he did just didn't do it for me. Well, at least not now, I'm an adult adult. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5
