It may have been done for this hell, but it was probably the worst movie I've seen for years. The whole DVD would be the best thing !!! I'm surprised that people took the time to do something garbage and money, but I'm glad I only rented. I think the true fans of this movie must probably be sadistic and gothic to take care of it without any CGI or any other effects, I hope Alex Chandon studied light and SFX to make a better movie in the future , ie if he is still at work. <br /> <br /> Comments for buyers This is very disappointing, DO NOT BUY it !!!!!
