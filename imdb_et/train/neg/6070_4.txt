Tony Scott leads a thriller sports clip, which should attract even a non-sports event. And some say baseball is dead sport ... boring ... too fucking slow. Well weak! Outside, he seems to be a disgruntled salesman (Robert De Niro) while he is a psychotic fan of the San Francisco Giants. In the future, there will be a new slugger (Wesley Snipes) and a designated savior. Our salesman bears the murder obsession with a hard blow to all the stars in his worst downfall and giants are afraid to crumble with him. De Niro is a terrorist person. Snipes looks very natural as a ball player. Other notable choices are: still attractive Ellen Barkin, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arbanville. You're a free agent ... so enjoy. We need to wait for violence and a very strong language.
