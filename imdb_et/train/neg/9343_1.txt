How to start reviewing a movie that will soon be felt by the worst driver of all time? A film that can develop in culture after it is so bad that it is so bad? <br /> <br /> Critical analytical approach to the film seems to be both pointless and part of the wagon syndrome - let's be free without having to worry because every other person on earth is doing it, and people who like this movie like them what we quote. <br /> <br /> The universal poor quality of the movie says untold- "16 years of alcohol" is not without the title of the worst movie, so it has to be kept low for acquiring the title and keeping it, but I believe this movie can go a long way. IMDb does not allow enough words to quote all film failures, and the fact that elements are much easier than "Sixteen Year Alcohol" is right. Unfortunately, these moments of glory have so far been buried in the shadows of this film, which is not worth the task. <br /> <br /> My impressions? I thought I knew what I was getting, I was warned to drink several cups of coffee before I look at it (I would have wished this proposal was a cup of vodka). Despite his low expectations, "sixteen years of alcohol" could not attract me even at the "bad movie" level. Not only bad but outrageously bad, as Jobson deliberately tried to make this film a poetic horror, but went over and forced poetry down our throat, making it deep but funny. .. and Jobson sincerely tried to make a good movie? Even after viewing the promotional material for "Sixteen-year-old alcohol", I find it hard to believe in Jobon's sincerity. Finally, it is pointless and unpleasant when the film has been spiced up by several smiling moments (all I'm sure no one is deliberate), and these few elements prevented me from turning off the DVD. So bad is it good? No. It was just enough "I can't believe it's a serious movie moment" to keep me from turning it off and nothing else. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a good thing to watch a movie with bad groups. Get your current comment. This would have greatly improved my experience. It is so bad that Mike Myers comments on his cod at the Scottish accent when it runs to keep all this mud in the comic farce "Ok bold man, give me annuder gliss dat wiskyst".
