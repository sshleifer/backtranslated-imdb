Happy, fucking, MooCow really admits: I'm like this cheap, cheesy 70s parody. The idea that big killer-tomato hordes are destroying the United States is a great idea, and despite the fact that moovie offers some decent laughing, tempting frightened extremes to see away from a large, probably counterfeit tomato. This movie, along with Kentucky Fried Moovie, is one of the earliest scams that became so popular in the 80s and 90s, largely due to the plane! This, like jammed spoofs, is pretty bad. Many humorous actions are unpleasant failures and a lot of momentum. But thanks to the harsh tomato hordes, the terrible "Puberty Love" songs and the fantastic helicopter collision, Killer Tomatoes is attacking some goods, albeit largely for the wrong reasons. There are so many good things about this movie ... and that's right, it's hard to explain. Enough people have had to enjoy it because the tomatoes came back on 2 moore films and a cartoon series !! Large pieces away from tomatoes are quite boring. And dig those 70's clothes, dude! ; = 8) This tomato is delicate and cheesy, but worth two or two; MooCow says to grab pizza and put on Tomatites! : ??
