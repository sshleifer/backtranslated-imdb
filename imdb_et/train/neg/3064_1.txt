The original "Vanishing Point" was a great flick. Fine motifs, characters that seemed real and spontaneous. The reprocessing was terrible. Preachy, clearly obvious; it was a point of originality of the original. The black charger was cool, but even it couldn't save that flick. Why stay with the White Challenger? I didn't think it was the best choice for '71. Some parts of the movie were unintentionally fun. Like when Vigo stood on the shore overlooking the canyon after his "Dream Quest". His Indian boy stood next to him. Vigo wore only his white briefs. Sorry - it just looked stupid - he looked at the fruit of his heroes. At the end of the second scene - after an explosive collision with bulldozers - the announcer reported that the impact was 180 mph. Then he mentions that the police said his remains were not found because he evaporated, but some people believe he was saved and hidden by friends. Then it shows that he is driving 180 mph out of the car! First you couldn't open the car door 180 mph. Secondly, the car would not continue to drive a 100-fold straight line. no one to drive it. It will roll out about 30 times. Third, when you reach the sidewalk 180 miles per hour, you would stop in different pieces. It doesn't matter that we see him standing with his daughter. All in all, a movie that offends someone's intelligence.
