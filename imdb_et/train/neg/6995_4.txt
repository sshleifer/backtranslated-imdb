Funny, how many people who say it is a much better Romero version tend to be very young (according to other posts). What we have here is shiny, busy, gory and "whoopee" met 2 hours of MTV video. Foolish Editing, Pop Video Camcorder, "Cool" Music Blah Blah Blah <br /> <br /> In fact, it's not bad compared to other recent remakes (Chainsaw Massacre was a complete disaster) ... pretty good acting all round, completely predictable "Who will die next" stakes and all the money in the name of Dawn Of The Dead, which brings a lot of income to the original fans who go and look at the curiosity ... <br /> <br /> Don't make the nerves classic reps? Do they really get something original? Why Remake Dawn Of The Dead? Things that made the original special (the middle segment kids think it's so boring, should be slow to show how you get everything you ever wanted, still not happy) are completely lost. It's glowing, easy and simple. The faster the better. If you are a flicks of action (and as it is, the 2004 version is well done), it is fairly fair, but for anyone who loves little movies for their movies ... be ready (again) ... <br /> <Watch movies in the next few years we get The Godfather series, which is the most fashionable pop director today and Star Wars remade, with all the kids talking about how the new version is miles better old version is slow and boring and owns the camera for more than 5 seconds ... <br / > <br /> Not bad, but after 10 years they're still discussing Romero, not the priest
