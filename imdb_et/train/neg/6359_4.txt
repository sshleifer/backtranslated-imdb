Woody Allen, when he's the best, is one of the sharpest pencils. He can make an acute observation and break it around with a stroke like someone else. But if he is in his worst situation, his films can be terribly outraged. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" are the opening of this smell until the closure. Created is one of his most intriguing ideas. Four friends sit in a restaurant discussing whether the nature of life is comedy or drama. To help solve the argument, one man associates the story with the beginning and asks the other two men (one comic playwright, another dramatic playwright) whether the story is comedy or tragedy. Two men continue the story and the movie plays the stories they tell. Now that I first heard about this movie, I had the impression that they were talking exactly the same story, the genre (comedy or drama) just changing the way you watch it. It would have been interesting now. Nevertheless, the stories only share one key element and some side elements. These are completely different stories with the differences between large plots of land. Drama is so rigidly written and pretentious that it can really act as an independent parody. If this happened, it failed because these elements prevent the audience from feeling emotional investment in any characters. Comedy is a story that has moments of success, but it's still short and short. Will Farrell is probably meant to stand for Woody, but he could have played that character more credibly without Woody Stutters and hand-ticks. Woody is Woody's best. When someone else tries, they don't play the character but model the recognizable actor. This kind of thing pulls the audience out. My favorite Woody Allen films give me a little bit lighter to leave the theater when I went in. my money back.
