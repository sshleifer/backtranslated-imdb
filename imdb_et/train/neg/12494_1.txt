I didn't like anything about this movie. It was so obviously a low budget with poor lighting and camera work (almost like the Blair witch project, but it wasn't). There wasn't really much on the plot and the film was just a drug and on. I quickly transmitted the last 1/3 movie, but it doesn't help much. It seemed that it might be good for the box, but I have to say once again: Nothing about this movie was good. There are no good players, special effects so fake, camera work was terrible and the dialogue was painfully terrible. On my personal scale, I'll give this movie from 0 to 10. Yikes!
