"Wrinkle in Time" series is a favorite series from my childhood. I have read and read them several times more than in the last 35 years. The characters, with all their virtues and weaknesses, are close and dear in my heart. This adaptation contained very little wonderful, magical and spiritual story that I love so much. To say that I was disappointed with this film would be a great underestimation. <br /> <br /> If you have never read a book I think you will enjoy the movie. Action is satisfactory, special effects are made for the TV movie and the story is interesting. But if you love books, avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I found this statement on the Wikipedia page: "Interview with Newsweek told L'Engle of the movie," I was expecting it to be bad and it is. "" <br /> <br /> I feel like also another reviewer here, the need to read the book again in order to make this film in my mind.
