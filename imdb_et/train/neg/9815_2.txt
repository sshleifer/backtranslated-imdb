This film is about to show off the original idea, but later it became a big disappointment. What is the initial start when the rest of the movie didn't make a little to prevent the plot? The film itself is incredible. I would like to know how exactly someone enters the clinic, gets the nurse's clothes, kills the doctor, takes the patient to bed, puts his Chevy on the pickup and leaves? I think no one could answer this question, so they just jumped to another scene, hiding those little details. Performances are just bad. The offender is another "annoying crazy antagonist", lacking in depth, completely linear in nature. After a 20-minute movie, most scenes were incredible, they seemed to be put in just 90 minutes because they were completely irrelevant. The doctor sees the woman clearly under a strong medication, she can't be examined, she comes out of the house and just leaves quietly? The end of the scene made me burst, only Mickey Mouse got it out of reality. I'll give him 2 of the first ten that say 10 minutes of the movie.
