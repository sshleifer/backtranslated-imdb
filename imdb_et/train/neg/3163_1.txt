Well, this is the first post I comment on IMDb. Do you get it, this movie has made me come and warn all the good souls who will ever stop experimenting with movies. <br /> <br /> Since most of them have given their comments I thought I was watching this movie because some decent actors seemed (although they read the worst criticism of this movie), I thought I was trying it, assuming it was some comedy. ., comedies .... then everything started to be pathetic ... the person you believe in your feelings, you feel like you are going and hits almost every time a pathetic looking woman called the heroine of the movie is helpless. ..Huh ~ ~ Well, how much can a person digest the sick of all POSSESSIVE witches who are trying to do everything to irritate you and stop what you do. <br /> <br /> The next worst thing about the movie is the "ZOMBIE" hero, yes, if he loses his fianc√©, he moves like a goat, with black marks u and the hero's "terribly stupid" sister ... you bleed from the toe when you tried and managed to watch this movie completely!
