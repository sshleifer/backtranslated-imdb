I saw this movie several times in the late 60s / early 70s as it grew headed like a rabies reindeer during November to December because of Saturday's matin√©e kiddie show. I can say "Christmas"?), perhaps the biggest, most iconic Christmas season movie of all time.But this is another review. <br /> <br /> At that time, I wondered if the color CLAUS on the SANTA screen was almost "pink and white", so much the color of the rack-torn printed colors. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit creepy! I thought so - and still. I was very entertaining then, as I am! This is an entertaining "retarted-elf" sort of. By the way, the picture quality on the DVD that I currently have is much better than in the theater, around 1969-74. <br /> <br /> If you might be looking for a "missing RANKIN-BASS Christmas special - forget about it! If you want FELLIN to NOT get - read more ... <br /> <br /> Naturally, copying these external films (original version this is always "surreal" in spanish. It adds to the strange character of the movies, and it is also quite frightening that the "uneven demon" (as described in the original US trailer) spends the entire movie trying to make decent children "evil". a boy who wants to have a Christmas elder - suddenly a "port-a-family" appears out of a giant "Christmas gift" until he realizes he's just dreaming! If you're a stoner, save your hero - this movie will make you think you are hallucinating ... without drugs!
