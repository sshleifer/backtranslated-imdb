One of my best friends brought this movie overnight with the words "Want to ever look at the worst horror movie?" I always have a good laugh at a terrible scare and said yes. I had been waiting for your typical b-slasher cheese, but it was outside B. This is the Z-slasher, the lowest of the lowest. Obviously with a low budget, a very bad effect, a bad flash, not a plot, really bad special effects, shaking cameras, and a terrible soundtrack, it makes movies like the House of Wax look like Oscar winning masterpieces. The only good thing is about 15 seconds per character topless - he had some very nice tits. Most of what I said during this movie was "Wow it really is," "It's still the worst movie," and "I'm not drunk for that." In conclusion: don't waste your time (or money!).
