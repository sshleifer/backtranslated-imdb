Inconsistencies in the confusion with a gentle horrible soundtrack, "Soul Survivors" is the last entry in the "Who's dead and alive" genre horror movies. Two teenage pairs, Sean and Cassie and Matt and Annabel, are preparing to leave for different colleges, but before they take part in the Thanksgiving Day, they will take part in a fun party at the last burnt church, lusciously slutty Annabel (Eliza Dushku, aka Faith, second vampire killer). Unmotivated creepy guys start to pay too much attention to Cassi (general Melissa Sagemiller) for reasons that have never been explained, and before that the quartet has left the party. Being away from their SUVs, they continue to be motivated by creepy guys who make a quick and inexplicable will in the middle of 180 roads, causing a nasty and fatal accident when an SUV lands over a river of embankment. Sean is killed (or is it?), And Cassie spends the rest of the movie with loneliness and guilt (she drove) when she is not worshiped by Seaman's ghost or pursued by motivated horrible boys. Much unexplained unevenness follows the further deterioration of Cassie's mental state until we reach a predictable conclusion. So who's dead and alive? After that, ninety minutes, who really cares?
