.... hang a dozen better films. Especially Steven Martin's "LA Story", which was at least a grace obviously fancy, though he played in the movie with his girlfriend playing his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Yes, naive boys and girls, "20 Dates" is a mockumentary, although I'm not entirely sure it was Myles Berkowitz's intention when he started. My impression is that he started the project half-serious, he quickly realized that it would be pathetic and not funny if he made things more ridiculous. As a result, the whole thing is uncomfortable, inexpensive and insecure. <br /> <br /> As someone wisely pointed out, the film has two "dates" that appeal to Myles and force them to limit. they appear in a movie that would be impossible because it would require a consent form. It also seems to me that most women who are "dates" are professional actors (albiet is not famous except Tina Carrere) - they are just too obviously beautiful, polished, thin and comfortable in front of the camera. be an average civilian. <br /> <br /> Mr. Berkowitz only makes a classic mistake in casting such a very thin actress instead of using different credible women that could have expected (even mockumentary) to be more plausible and funny. He also skates on what is probably his real problem, and that is that both the character of the film and the real world of Myles Berkowitz seems to be functionally unemployed (his real life IMDb credit is practically nonexistent except for this film). Even in the film world, his former husband divorced him that he was never used. I think the viewer (not to mention Mr Berkowitz's real days of life) deserves an explanation that he manages to live in one of the most expensive urban environments in the US, in a luxurious apartment that drives a fancy car and eats up expensive restaurants if he doesn't see any source of income. (Is he a drug dealer? He lives with his rich parents? No clue!) <br /> <br /> If you are really funny, you can get the most out of the movie. "20 days" is painfully, embarrassingly UN-funny. Mr. Berkowitz's idea of ​​joking is his own character, while on the dates of restaurants to inform his companions about how the food offered gives him either diarrhea or constipation - WORST type childish potty humor. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, if you discovered that Mr. Berkowitz never made a movie before "20 days" and hasn't made a movie in the last 8 years, he appeared as an actor on someone else's movie OR was written or any to produce credit. My intestinal instinct tells me that this movie was not funded by Elie (a gangster man who looks outside the camera), but more likely by Mr. Berkowitz's wealthy parents, or perhaps it is a shocking credit card abuse. Regardless of what it was, we can all just rest, so we probably don't need to see Myles Berkowitz or his creative efforts on EVER AGAIN. Hallelujah !!!
