This film had a great boost: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres - all b-movie actors. However, this film's recession did not use any of these advantages: none of their characters were even on screen (although Christopher Lee plays himself in different scenes). <br /> <br /> The motivation of aliens in this movie seems to be changing the hat down. First, they just want to repair and leave their ship, then they turn off the main game, killing most of their friends and not releasing their wife after they get the necessary part. Then the "peaceful" of the strangers' places will decide that they must destroy the planet because it causes too many "diseases" (although they provide the main character and his wife in their society on the ground). <br /> <br /> Most movies are spent watching a man and a woman ride or walk or stand or sit behind the desk. You almost want them to be over with the rest of the planet, just revenge, to die for us. <br /> <br /> If you don't like Chris Lee or the seventies low budget sci-fi, I'd give it one. It falls into the narrow range of cellulose left between Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth.
