The secret is ... this movie blows. Sorry, but it just did. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> In this bad riff I know what you got LAST SUMMER and SCREAM, Dorie Barton's excellent Beth joined friends during the spring break. The group rents a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun holiday. Then deaths begin. The first one, then the other, is murdered by another friend, resulting in sad and tricky top-level predictable results. One note, Dorie Barton, is the poor man's Reese Witherspoon? He looks like Reese, acts like Reese and can go to Reese in the police. Maybe they take them? Any kind of decent cinematography and fair action could not write a bad dialogue and a terrible letter.
