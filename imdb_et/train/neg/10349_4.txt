First of all, I'm a great fan of Madeleine L'Engle and I was so excited to see the movie for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. This movie destroyed this excitement. I'm sorry, but Meg was described in the book as effervescent curls and glasses and they are considered very infertile. In the film, she has straight hair and glasses and is a "sporty type" with a deep voice. It's not how Madeleine L'Engle showed that Meg is at all. In fact, Meg Madeleine was based on his character and depicted how he was young. This is just one main example of how the book and the film are different. So I would say that if you want to watch it for entertaining purposes, look at it, but if you are a dedicated fan of Madeleine L'Engle and her wrinkles in time series, I would recommend skipping this movie.
