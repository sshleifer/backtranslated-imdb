Someone probably heard Alberto Tombas. Former police officer, former rider and now TERRIBLE actor. "Alex L'Ariete" was supposed to be a "mini-series" of TV, but Italian television itself refused to show the film on its channels. Now this is, believe me, a ridiculous movie. The script is just fun (it should be a dramatic movie), something like a 5 year old child. But what really strikes you is this amateur action: Alberto Tomba, who was not credible as a policeman, plays a terribly foolish character: a special operation by an Italian policeman who specializes in opening doors! ("ariete" is "ram"). This super-boy is trying to save a young girl's life (real Italian "small" TV showgirl, married to singer Eros Ramazzotti): nice but absolutely intuitive. Lose it and do yourself a favor. The film that is shameful for the Italian cinema industry: only John Travolta's Earth Attack is near.
