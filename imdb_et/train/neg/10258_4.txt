Earth is meant to be more thanks to Father Pergado and Nun. Christopher Lee (who has said since then that his producers, who told him they were many great actors, were involved) is Father Pergado and he does his usual serious and frightening routine. The cast is not too bad, although most of them are now out of business. The film has terrible sound effects (which are mainly caused by the keys on the old computer) and sometimes ridiculously pondering - for example, showing a sky scene that seems for hours. Nonetheless, this story is in a humorous way to the world in a disastrous way and production is sufficient. Interestingly, Albert Band and Jackie are in one scene; Meda Band; Writer Frank Ray Perilli and Charles Band's assistant Bennah Burton. Despite my embarrassing nature, I really wanted to see how it all worked and so I really liked it.
