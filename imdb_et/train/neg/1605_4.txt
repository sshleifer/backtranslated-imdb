Recently I saw the documentary "Revolution Not Delivered to Television", I also know "Chávez: Inside the Coup". First of all, I thought it was a realistic view of the events of the Venezuelan coup in April 2002. However, I was disturbed by the fact that the tone of the narrative and the accompanying music was suggestive and that in no case was any criticism expressed by Hugo Chávez. It is peculiar, because if a documentary gives a non-impartial overview of what happened, some should have been. After all, Chávez is definitely not a saint. Fortunately, as the documentary is several years old, there is a lot of additional information available on the internet today, and it was not difficult to find, for example, "an urgent investigation into the Chavez coup that was carried out by European film companies that funded the film." presents false lies about Venezuela. "It lists a number of errors and planned or unintentional counterfeits in the documentary. (Just use the title as a Google search string, you will find it.) Another interesting document was the recording of video files in this documentary" Wrong X-ray "in the presentation of many error results. "Chávez: Inside the Coup" It's available at video.google. I suggest you look at "wrong X-rays" after "Chávez: in the coup" and then formalize your opinion. My conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Brian participated (consciously or not) Chavez propaganda.
