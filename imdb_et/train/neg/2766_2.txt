I went to this movie with great hope. Normally, I'm not too selective about my movies and movies of beings are always * fun to watch, or I thought. I read the good parts of this film: - the effect of the creature. All the creatures were well done, their movements were realistic and well suited to other shapes. To be honest, the consequences of the creatures were the only reasons I gave it instead of the movie 2. Now it's bad things: -Activities. Good Lord, I've seen bad action, but this movie takes a cake. None of the signs are * close * to the plausible. It's like the director sent out a pick-up call and chose the worst rehearsals. I tried very hard not to strangle too loudly, because I didn't want to disturb anyone else in the theater, but the action was really that BAD. - Attention: The whole story is full of plot holes from start to finish. At least 5 plot holes can be selected for each 30-minute film shot. Of course, the holes in the plot are free with cheese. This is probably one of the toughest, not thoughtful, and most direct stories I've ever seen on screen because I had a serious misfortune to sit one night and watch the parasite on the SciF channel. - Dialogue: This is a world where everyone says they can most obviously and obviously do what they get. In this world, every line seems to have been spoken in at least 30 other low budget creature films. It's the world of cheese and cliche. - Special Effects. Although creature effects were completely awesome, special effects are unhappy. Yes, they are better than other movies, but there is a lot of it in the presentation. And this film has no presentation. To be honest, there are special effects used by Power Rangers in the TV show. In conclusion: Dragon Wars is not worth your time or money. The concept is good, but it is trapped in bad film management, behavior, dialogue and joy. Wait until the next big monster movie appears. It must be better because Dragon Wars is absolutely terrible.
