This movie was so unreliably bad, I hardly believe I was watching it. Leadership, editing, production, and scripting seemed to be just what they'd done for high school students who didn't know about the movies about it. There was no narrative flow, meaning no sense. The great emotional moments and climaxes (such as one early Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and the characteristic relationships (as one of the initial implications) come out completely and are not created as if they had been a more elegant and effective film. Unfortunately, the characters are too little developed, so we find it hard to have any connection with them. Surprisingly, acting is not a bad thing, but terrible writing overrides relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly bad T.V. West / Epic and unfortunately reduces the interesting (real) story he is trying to say. I've read a lot of comments that protect the film as important topics for Australians. It's all very well, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon. Nobody says the topic is not good, but the quality of the movie. Pearl Harbor was an important historical event for Americans, but that doesn't mean I'm going to protect the movie and say it was good because it was still bad. Failure everywhere, although Heath and Orlando are nice to look at.
