I saw this bomb when he hit the theater. I laughed all the time. Why? Because that stupidity seemed to me crazy. I look back and realize that there were no funny things in the whole movie. Leat is not deliberate. It is terribly funny that Lizzie cn chew a piece of Nurplex and become a huge carnivorous demon, but her little dress is inviolable, even though she is now hundreds of times bigger than she was when she first put it on her back. Or a movie in which a person can shock with a defibrillator and fall only unconscious and return to consciousness without any medical help. And don't let me start with the ridiculous messenger they decided to create a "conflict". Mr. <br /> <br /> For a person who complains about Disney only when looking for children, the dirty parts of this movie seem to disprove this statement. Do we really need Daryl Hannah, who accuses Jeff Bridges of having kinky video tapes? You do when you are Disney and you have ideas to turn the film against the 8 crowds listed above without writing a more intelligent script! I am deeply convinced that Disney will pay off the evaluation committee so that its films can get away with the murderer and still receive family-friendly ratings. <br /> <br /> What is a waste of DVD format?
