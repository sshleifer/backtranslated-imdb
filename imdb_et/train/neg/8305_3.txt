Like most people, I love "Christmas story". I had never heard of this movie and perhaps a good reason - it's terrible. Same locale, same narrator, same director, but no original fuzziness. Charles Grodin was a bad choice to replace Darrin McGavin, but I can't imagine anyone replacing him. The story seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original. Cooperation with neighbors, Bumpus, is ridiculous. "Christmas Story" Ralphie's obsession with the BB weapon seems cute, but his obsession with this movie is boring. Scud Farkus, the original neighborhood, replaces another movie with a brisk and strange hat in this film, but little is a threat to Scud Farkus. Comparing the original would be quite difficult, even if the film was made with the original team.
