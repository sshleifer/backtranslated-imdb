I can't believe how popular this show is. I consider myself an avid sci-fan. I have read countless sci-fi novels and enjoyed many sci-fi movies and TV shows. I really can't find this real sci-fi. Every episode I've been through was like a stupid, soldered version of the Star Trek episode that dropped something that could make it interesting or exciting. Let's talk about something boring who from time to time passes the Stargate and reaches a planet that looks like Earth, with people who see and sound like humans! It seemed an extremely low budget. Characters are all forgotten one-dimensional cut-outs and many attempts to humor. It reminds me when you see trade in this famous athlete trying to be funny but he is not. It's just sad. <br /> <br /> The film was also terrible. There's so much you can get through the portal with space, but every place where ARMY people go is OFF! It doesn't show imagination! I thought the TV series "Alien Nation" was a lot better a few years ago (Alien Nation). This exhibition was actually a good story and decent characters. I was not crazy about the "alien nation", but it was great compared to this overrated devil! movie too close! They should have at least refreshed the special effect of "flushing the toilets" when someone goes through the Stargate.
