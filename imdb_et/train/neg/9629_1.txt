I saw it for free, luckily, and I want it to be better than it was, but it's really the same old thing that film studios have shown us over the last ten years. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston are pairs who are opposing - and yet they are related. <br /> <br /> If this plot line does not take you by surprise and excitement, will not the film also. Many eyesight eyes and funny jokes. On the side of the movie I began to realize that Ben Stiller wasn't really funny, but he was trying very hard. And Jennifer Anniston is not really that beautiful, but her HAIR looks good. And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seymore Hoffman had to pay a lot of money to be in such a mid-range movie, I've been waiting for more of them. <br /> <br /> What was interesting was that I saw it after seeing American Splendor, which is a really funny and original film, and I compared them in two heads and found that I would like the film's directors to be forced to sit on these two films back through - maybe it knocked somewhat in terms of, and <br /> <br /> they started making better unknown movies instead of the formula best played on airplanes.
