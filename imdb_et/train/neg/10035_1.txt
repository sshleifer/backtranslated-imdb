Absolutely terrible movie. Waste of time. <br /> <br /> Background music is so strong that you don't understand the speech. Well, if you really listen carefully, whatever they are talking about is actually incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The camera's performance is poor, editing is not there, the backdrop gives headaches, the action is dim, the dialogues are incomprehensible, the operation is incomprehensible, the operation is exhausting, and Kareena looks like a wrestler, now she looks like hungry wrestler. You can cut hell, but you can't get mercy. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie for three hours, I want to like it, but this movie doesn't even allow me that joy. <br /> <br /> Please, if you want to torture yourself, look at it.
