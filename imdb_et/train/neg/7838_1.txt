This movie was basically Velvet Goldmine, when five party writers got it and made it. Movie. The film lacks what Velvet Goldmine was, a good actor, writing and basically everything else. The film had some of the worst letters I've seen since Wild Wild West. It was definitely interesting. I know vh 1 has become the household name behind music events. which is much better than anything that would have worked if it were behind a music episode but didn't see it on the face.
