(some spoilers) - as if you don't know how it ends <br /> <br /> My expectations for HOLLOW MAN were high. A very good commercial, directed by Paul Verhoeven and actors such as Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue and a very interesting subject - invisibility. All the prerequisites for a great movie are met. Unfortunately, these things were not important at all. The film was very weekly, without a break and terribly predictable. It's all about a scientist who discovered invisibility. After successful animal testing, Kevin Bacon decided to test himself. When he is invisible, he changes completely, realizing that he does not see the benefits. From there until the murder is a very thin line. <br /> <br /> Hollow Man is a sick movie. It suffers from a disease that has many new movies: special effects. Of the challenging issues that would have brought manufacturers into a high-tension psychological thriller, Verhoeven destroys everything, focusing only on special effects, giving the film its real value. I have to admit that fx is fantastic, probably the best I've seen since the Matrix, but it's not enough to make a movie. In fact, this is a problem with movies today. Just like Verhoeven, most executives take care of only spectacular scenes - and nothing else. Exceptions are very small and probably the Matrix is ​​the only film that combines superb special effects with a large plot. <br /> <br /> After Starship Troopers, Verhoeven disappears again. Instead of a big movie, HM cr * p. There are only two reasons to watch this movie: 1. Special Effects of Funny 2 with Superman and Wonder Woman (I'm not spoiling this moment for you ...) <br /> <br /> Okay, what went wrong in the movie? Everything. Let's see what I remember. <br /> <br /> --- It's not energized at all. It should have been, but it is not. <br /> <br /> --- It's too predictable. You know from the beginning who will die and live. <br /> <br /> --- Instead of a psychological part, Verhoeven focuses only on effects. <br /> <br /> - Very many clichés. <br /> <br /> --- Of course, a bad man wakes up a few times before his death. <br /> <br /> --- As with any low quality horror, the first rule is to allow the characters to be separated as much as possible. Every time someone in the laboratory alone has the perfect Bacon victim. <br /> <br /> --- Some fences on the plot. Example: At first Bacon must scan a finger to enter the lab. If he's invisible, how can he do that? <br /> <br /> --- End: Absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> --- When Shue hits Bacon with his head, Bacon falls to the ground. Then Shue and Brolin leave quietly and slowly, despite the back. Is this normal? Then Bacon rises, attacks them, they "kill" him again. And then Shue shouts, "I heard the explosion" (happened a few minutes ago) and they suddenly ran in. Didn't he hear that explosion for a while before? <br /> <br /> --- Here is a scene where you can see the microphones hung over the actors. Come on, Mr Verhoeven, I waited much more for you! <br /> <br /> So it's about a hollow man. What was supposed to be a great movie, it became a scam. <br /> <br /> Vote: 4 out of 10 (for special effects)
