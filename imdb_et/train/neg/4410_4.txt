A typical film making formula: a good policeman gets into the confusion of crooked policemen and Japanese gangsters. <br /> <br /> A good result is decent performances, a few brief snicker-induction moments and some fair action. plus a chance to look at Danielle Harris, who makes his eternal typing the daughter of a rebel daughter. <br /> <br /> ** out of ****.
