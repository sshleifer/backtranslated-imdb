Deadly Wake is the perfect film for film students ... to learn how not to film! <br /> <br /> Let's see what this team is confused about? Worst Music Distribution Worst Editing Worst Script WORKING HIGHEST Worst Behavior Worst Choreography Worst Films Worst requisites Worst set Worst Illumination Etc. Let's face it if this "film" has been in very high contrast black and white and quiet ... it would have been terrible. All scenes are blind (lighting people call it "black"), often drowned in a score of music curving dialogues that were OK because no one spoke of two whole sentences without long pauses. The "bad" robot was fun ... what was that? Jazz Dancing? Oh ... I think it should be tactical or something walking. I am sure that this was a fear in the heart of the poor editors. And how do you edit so much material about garbage? Not possible. Garbage is a waste, no matter how you connect it. How did anyone get through this dailys ??? <br /> <br /> The bottom line is - I couldn't see more than 15-minute segments, it was so bad ... but I saw the whole thing (with lotsa breaks) just to see if it had anything at all no good parts. FAST! NO! <br /> <br /> The perfect example of how not to slip ... must see every serious film student !!!
