When I saw the preview, I thought it was a great movie. And indeed it could have been. The actor who plays the main character was very reliable and the beauty of filming is undeniable. But the dialogs put a dark shadow on the whole picture. For action in 1610, the level of language was too familiar and too modern and took away most of the film from magic. But I have to congratulate the translator because the English subheadings were more specific and relevant to the original French hints and this probably explains the good assessment of the film received by imbd.
