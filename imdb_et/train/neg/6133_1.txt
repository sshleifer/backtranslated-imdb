Kurt Thomas marks Jonathan Cabot as a gymnast who trains for a special game that includes hunting a group of nose, but these ninjas are not an option, especially since Cabot is a gymnast! Whole Gymkata is one loving bad movie, a terrifying actor, a godly script, and really incompetent management make quality down to human standards, but this movie is so terrible that it really becomes funny. I mean a dialogue like "I know I'll release them!" or "Ha!, through you!" just add a few values ​​that Gymkata will acquire more. Besides, (wisely) is the only film with a hero gymnast who finds things that are currently moving in heat.
