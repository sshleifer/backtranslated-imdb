I really wanted this movie much more than I did. This is because I love the nervous foreign comedies - especially the strange ones that try to completely surprise you. But even though it was a surprise to me, they were almost always pleasant surprises. It reminded me of South Park that almost every social norm has been broken until the only ones who were left were too sick to be funny. For example, after investigating adultery, drug abuse (almost any - from pot, heroin, glue), prostitution, S&M, suicide, murder, etc. Got a movie fun (?) Theme pedophilia. Mother encouraged her to sleep with her neighbors with a son (about 12 years old). In fact, it gives the movie a single point for dentists to pay for dental care! Funny ?! You're gonna make fun of me. This movie goes too far and goes "comedy in a black hole". What should they do next, with cancer or with rectal tumors?
