First of all, I am not really the genre of the movie "the fan of things that eats my muscles in nasty new ways", but I'm a bad film afficionado, so my adjacent neighbor said he had the worst movie. That's it. So let's start looking at it. First of all - it is stored on the camcorder's tripod! Second skinny white doctor's voice is dubbed by a big black man! Thirdly, there is no point in any dialogue. Fourth, although zombie scenes that are not convincing and bad for men and tomato paste, believe that the director (and my neighbor's neighbor) needs psychological help. It's funny for about 5 minutes, but it gets old. It's as amateurish as watching a badly dubbed high school video yearbook ... with zombies. Note to all those involved in this movie - I want to spend 20 minutes of my life watching it before I fell asleep.
