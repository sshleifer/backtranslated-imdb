I also saw this movie on local screening about a year ago. First of all, I say it looks good. Cassella is an incredibly talented and fantastic operator. I just want the film to be as good as it looks. I wouldn't call it a horror movie. Making a couple with a tiny ghost does not make it a horror film. No secret, no tension, you know who did it all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a drama. You know what's going on with both sides of the film. I think the action was okay, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> And the bridge, "Revenge can be deadly" .... really? ... should they check how many hundreds of horrors / thrillers on films this is exactly the same label? <br /> <br /> I have some to say about this, but I know a lot of people who worked on this movie, and I know they don't want people to smoke, I give my honest opinion.
