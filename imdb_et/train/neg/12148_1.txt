Honestly, who in the name of God gave this film 8.1 rating? I think the people who actually did or celebrated in the film were the ones who voted. Otherwise, this film sucks! This movie is nothing more than an amateur or even a student. I'm a fan of the movie and I've seen terrible movies, but there was literally no redemption. The story and action was the worst I've ever seen. Use of props, including the use of airsoft weapons with terrible special effects, as bad as everything else. I'm in the movies for all the bad movies, but the F-bomb dropped about every third word and I think we may have a winner when using the F-bomb in every EVER movie. It also seems to have been filmed with cheap camcorders and not the actual movie. I expect this to be an award for amateur film, which is only shown in public access points across the country, but it is not part of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Don't buy this movie. Don't rent this movie. All I can say is that it was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon. This is a worthwhile time that you will never get back to. Unfortunately for me this time is gone, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, consider it as my warning.
