Another long strip made by people who think that camera control is the same as the story. Within 15 minutes, the whole assumption is placed in just a few lines, so there is no secret that eliminates the entire distance. The only half-way maker is killed for 10 minutes in a movie, so we're left with stupid characters running around, doing stupid things. Low budget movies can't afford costly special effects, so the CGI parts are surprisingly unimpressive, but were at least valid tests. The suit of the creature is terrible, as you can see when it falls on the sidewalk, and the director emphasizes the eyes, which are not even red in the mirror images. Dialogue is clumsy and unnecessary, some lines resemble aliens or terminators. The last action takes place at the police station, and it is hanging out of the Terminator, with everyone hiding in a glass-lined office so that Darkwolf won't fall. Finally, the girl calls the "good defender" of the hero, but she gets both her partners, the original defender, and at least three other civilians, not to mention the ten police, who were all killed without a proper shot, regardless of the arsenal of silver balls and machine gun. But here's the real bad way of writing: they could have killed the beast right after the initial credit when he kept his red eyes flashing. Instead, did they arrest it?!?
