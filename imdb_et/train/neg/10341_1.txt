I rented this movie from the library (that's why it's hard to find it for the reason) just because of curiosity. I'm a big Plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment. Bell Jar (1979) is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The script is terrible, not because it comes from the original new text, but because it tightens without focus or will. Scenes are poorly built and do not take the viewer everywhere. What is the voice of Plath's poem? Lady Lazarus has little work on the Greenwood situation; Plath's poetry was completely used. Marilyn Hassett is absolutely incredible because Esther Greenwood (or any 20-year-old on this issue) partly casting (he was 32 years old while filming, age Plath was when he was DIED) and partly because he couldn't act. Hassett is all the emotions, not the crafts, the skills. The direction is mediocre; the director just covers what is there, which is not much. The only reason I give film 1 is that 0 is not an option. Sorry, Sylvia, you have to wait for someone else to adjust your fine work to something more appropriate.
