Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd could not record this movie by installing an emu-sized egg. Based on the classic Phil Silver TV series, it was bombarded because: A) It was renewed in the 1990s and B) The simple assumption of the TV series became a confusing, weak and stupid scenario. <br /> <br /> The original TV series used small talented actors to portray cute characters who acted with simple but fun worship. To extend this assumption to the film of the 1990s, there were problems, and that shows. No one could pay me enough to sit on the stinker the second time.
