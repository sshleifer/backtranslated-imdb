I never commented on the movies, but I saw this 5 glowing review of the movie and decided that I had to consider my review. My teacher got this movie by mail, mixing with her academic screens (AMPAS, the boys who voted for the Oscars) and was on the floor when the movie was terribly built to bring it to our class to prove to us how not to put the film together. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't have a plot, scenes are terribly, terribly edited (often using faux-24 picture-in-picture techniques) and performances (especially a driver who doesn't even act as a bad actor) are mostly unpleasant. No one really understands the introduction point, namely the creation of a plot. No setting! On the side of the movie, I and the rest of the class didn't know what this film should be. The open crane of a fire that creates some murder is never dealt with, and now that I think it was supposed to be a progressive flash, the rest of the movie is a setback, but it cuts it directly to the other side without any indication. <br /> <br /> Bah, I could really go on. At least this film gives me new confidence in my filmmaking ability.
