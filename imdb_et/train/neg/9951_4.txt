Johnny and Jeremy are vampires. Minus cons, of course. They are dark, bitter beings who have nothing better to do than spread their suffering. Through these charms (namely, the wallet of sharp tongue and fat), they lure the desperate soul they torment and sacrifice. It is more or less the basis of this black comedy, as I understand it. <br /> <br /> This is not a blend of black humor that I can just subscribe to, partly because it bothers me to imagine rooting for a rude, main character. However, I enjoyed the fast fire (and supposedly very witty) sound and melody. I was very impressed with the strong acting, especially David Thelis; only Jeremy's character was too two-dimensional. Photography and music, both dramatic and harsh, work very well. <br /> <br /> What really changes me about "naked" (and the main reason I didn't want to recommend it to anyone) is the way it repeatedly feels that it is a resentment as the right way to get rid of it. In other words, in a world that sucks so bad, what is the difference when someone pains girls, right? To recommend (like some on this website) that Johnny is not so uncomfortable because he is not as tough for girls as Jeremy seems to me completely absurd. They are so terrible, disgusting people. And they are especially interested in patients every time they get a chance. It can be argued that Johnny finally gets what he deserves as his bad karma suddenly upside down and fucked her. However, his and Jeremy's sadistic behavior is to some extent considered a ridicule. And I could be wrong, but I think most people who love this movie will also find the aspect of the movie that is comic in the dark.
