The race for the worst Warner Bros Kay Francis movie is rigid. I have only seen eight of them, but Comet is still the worst over Broadway. Best of all, it's short. Oh, and Orry-Kelly gowns (of course) are good. James Wong Howe has no cinematography. Kay Francis looks like he has been exposed to fat and much less attractive than usual. Going to Gombell, who is otherwise unaware, is a good semi-hard "burlesque" dancer (it looked more like a fashion show than a burlesque). At the end of the month - Kay Francis and his child (when did the baby know that Kay Francis was his mother? Did I go down?) Walking in the direction of dirt, painted in a quiet contour soundtrack. The whole movie is so cheap, so unlikely, and so careless that it feels infected by sour cynicism by everyone who did it: Warner Bros throws garbage at dolts who do not know Warner Bros, cynically, that what they get is garbage .
