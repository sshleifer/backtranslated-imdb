This movie was so amateurish that hardly believed what I saw. It's made for VIDEO! Not a movie! I haven't seen it since the early 1970s when late night networks showed a video of the weekly "horror flicks" movie. It seems to be a bad soap opera and it will cost him a compliment. Some actors give him the best picture. Michael Des Barres does what he has to do, which is like a sex addict out of control. I can't say it's a nice look. <br /> <br /> Nastassja Kinski, as a therapist, sits on a chair for virtually the entire film, with very small differences in camera corners. I can't blame her for somebody else's poor blocking, but she's incredible in her role. His little girl's voice works here. And I consider myself a fan of Nastassia Kinski. He's definitely boring and exotic, but he's out of his choice. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul is surprised. Each line it delivers is three exclamation points. Somebody has to yell at him. Why would Michael Des Barres want sex with such an attacking hair? <br /> <br /> Finally, Rosanna Arquette as a sweet, resentful woman comes out and probably the most likely bunch. But it doesn't talk much. <br /> <br /> This must be the worst film I've seen for years.
