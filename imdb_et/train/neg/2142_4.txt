If you are under the age of 6 or 7, you will really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when she looks at it. As an adult, I can't stand it! I'm all for the offspring .... if they have a decent story. But it is almost non-standard. Please forgive me for sliding what is a child's film, but if you have to sit it almost every day, if your kids who love it understand why. My daughter would watch this movie over and over again the same day as we let her see this movie. <br /> <br /> I have given this film 10 out of purely keeping my youngest entertainment.
