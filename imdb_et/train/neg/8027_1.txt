I watched this movie. Finally. And it wasn't really easy. It's so boring, bad and in almost every detail that was stolen from "BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" that you can't believe the makers are taking it seriously. It is even harder to believe whether this "product" did it on VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> So if you want to see a horror movie, just look at "Scream", but if you want to laugh out loud and in time, watching some kids running through the forest, screaming at each other and showing their inability, look at the dark area .
