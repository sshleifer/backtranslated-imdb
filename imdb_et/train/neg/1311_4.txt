Jerry Spies Tomi listening to the horrible story on the radio and seizing the opportunity to intimidate his nemesis. <br /> <br /> I couldn't find that particular episode that would be funny: humor seemed rather limited, and the whole thing was a flat glove (Jerry is essentially a "bad boy" in torture of a bad Tom for some special reason). <br /> <br /> It is an occasional inspirational box (for example, Tom's literally "heart in the mouth") and the moment his nine lives live out of his body, but in general it is not a tense frightening temple, great animation and a large number of T & She has other cartoons.
