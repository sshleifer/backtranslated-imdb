Although most of the film is very amateurish, the Kosher killing scene is played, but not wrong. The Kosher Act says that the animal must be aware of when the grain touches that skin. The scene of Kosher's killing is accurate, as anyone knows who has seen it, or seen a Peta movie showing the killing of a kosher, where animals are gnawing and the esophagus is cut out if it is still alive, aware and apparently suffers. We must remember that history has been written by the winners. Is it even allowed to think that the Nazis might be right? <br /> <br /> Does it say anything that the Nazis had forbidden to kill this witchcraft, and the Jews still practice it today?
