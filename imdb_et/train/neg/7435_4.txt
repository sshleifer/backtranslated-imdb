This film (along with Rinne) is a small gemstone that has been hidden from the horror films so far by the 8FTDF "HorrorFest". And yes, it is really a bad praise. Because the film plan is not much worse than the possible cars that think the atmosphere is a substitute for a consistent plot. <br /> <br /> And that's all you get with abandoned. This is a film that was made almost entirely in the director's head. Of course it would have been nice if he carried this movie, but it happened. This is a very beautiful movie with some real fears, but the last roll is strictly for the latte slurping cineaste crowd.
