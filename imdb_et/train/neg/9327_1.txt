It was still the worst film I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen some really bad movies. I saw this movie in my local video store and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie. Little did I know that the cover would be the best part of the film. Where to start? Filming was scattered and boring. At one point, there is one minute where no one is talking, but the car is driving on the normal sunny day of the ranch. Nothing happened, they drove quietly. The whole movie is a boring, annoying, incredible dialogue and basically there's no plot to talk about. If you rent this movie, watch it with your friends and it can make a good comedy. Otherwise, if you see this movie, run it.
