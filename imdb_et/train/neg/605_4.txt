I keep this short as a movie that doesn't deserve a full view. <br /> <br /> Taking this device into consideration, this movie would have been very special. It could have been "28 days later" or even "Blair witchcraft" <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes of the movie, which I was very excited about, made a decent job with cinematography and break even though I don't think he managed capture the real superstition of the empty London subway. <br /> <br /> The characters were big. Our "heroine" in this movie is a worthless piece, and you really don't care whether it dies or not. As many have said before, I was rooted in the homeless and the black boy who managed to give me or two (whether intentional or not). <br /> <br /> Keep in the dark on the first half of the movie, but when he appears, I was very disappointed. I'm not breaking it, but I just promise to say that my 10-year-old sister could have won her in a wrestling game. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is another mediocre horror film that falls next. simple Hollywood formula. This film had a lot of potential, but it couldn't really point it out. <br /> <br /> Just to emphasize the flatness of this movie, the characters in this movie were at least five times to stop and kill the main villain. HAVE THEM.
