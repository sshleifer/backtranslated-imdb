((NB: Spoiler warning as it is!)) <br /> <br /> First of all, it is a teen slip - Spam-In-A-Cabin genre, as Joe Bob Briggs embarrassed. If you are looking for Roshambo, this is not the case and it is not going to be BE. I am desperate for my film, director or exhibition performance. <br /> <br /> Second, it was not Zun's first horror, it was his first screen appearance, cinema, TV, whatever. What is worth; nor is Daphne Zun with Susan Sarandon or Katherine Hepburn. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, you must even provide flat slasher flick props. Of course, it follows the deeply offensive formulaic message of its genre: every young woman who has an interest or interest in sex is fur, and harvest time is now. <br /> <br /> Except what it gives, sweet, virgin main character! Now there is a mediocre teenage deadly movie that has the courage of its convictions! Interestingly, it was the only role of the film. Another blow to the miracle, except for this concept, gives the girl too much credit. (Then this film is probably one of the biggest percentages of one film's participants in history. Nineteen of the credited participants, no other film appeared thirty times, one of the other films of the same movie appeared, but one of Zun's six more screen credits. What's this br /> <br /> I testified that I saw it long ago in the cable when I was bored and I never expect my life to be boring again, but I don't see the reason to be involved all the people involved and beat them by burning with Joanne. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
