I sat down to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico, and I saw one about Nuyorican. When I go to Puerto Rico, I don't see 50% living in poverty. When I see fighting people, they are usually Haitian, Dominican, or Cuban, who have recently arrived on the island. There is no such thing as a spaniel ... do you speak Spanish or do you ... and what I heard ... you don't. Pedro Albizo Campos isn't MLK for me. MLK was a big man. Campos is a great man for those who want independence, which is 1%. The rest is like Osama Bin Laden. The loggers who want independence are a lot of fools. If you want to prove that all your dreams are independent of Puerto Rico, see Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Bahamas, all South and Central America and Mexico. He worked for them with miracles. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, this documentary was about Nuyoricans and their struggles. <br /> <br /> The person complaining that Africa was not enough was that it was around Puerto Rico ... not Africa. Denzel will do it soon for you. <br /> <br /> To sum up ... to all those unknown white people who think we need green cards to come to the US and want to know how the Prime Minister manages things, this is not a good documentary about Puertorican culture. Tell your children to pay attention to geography and history class. <br /> <br /> *** Update *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonita ... "doc." was about Nuyoricans. He promoted it as we all know. It should have been headed ... "soya poyorika ... can't speak Spanish." PLEASE STOP USE AFTER PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA OR QUESTIONAL ACTIVITIES. God forbids them to play on the island.
