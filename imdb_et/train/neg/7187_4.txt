Here we go with the other slasher movie, good looking people and all the action was really good! <br /> <br /> Few children who play worship phone calls and where parents are killed in front of the kid before the killer! 20 years after they are friends, they go to a huge house, have fun, drugs and sex (not nudity) for at least half an hour! Again, they're going to call you again! and then the killer comes back, they kill one by one and the killer is BIG BLACK COAT with an ax like Urban Legend movie, <br /> <br /> The scene of death is a very weird, really bizarre time. <br /> <br /> Nice slasher movie in this respect gave 7/10, but the twist made at the end of the movie made the whole movie meaningless <br /> <br /> Twist killed my movie so I give it 4/10
