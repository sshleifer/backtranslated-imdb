This is a real bomb. We should believe that Merle Oberon is a divorced daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to Tom DeLay in the 1930s that he deserves support as a presidential candidate. Poor Mer cannot go anywhere, but it is surrounded by politicians and their looting, spouses of spirits, and supported only by a kind uncle Harry Davenport. He joins his two servants on the dark day and Gary Cooper happens. Some rodeo shots could revive things, la "Misfits", but there is no such luck. Later, Gary breaks down at the formal dinner at which Merle leads, and although invited to sit and join the group, she reads a lecture about her chewing. Where did this cozy cowboy suddenly sound? The most painful scene of the film is the phantom party, which Gary owns an unfinished house for his missing wife Merle. Will it never end? One to avoid.
