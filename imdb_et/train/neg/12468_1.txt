Simply put, the movie is boring. Cliché clichés are confirmed and the story never comes together. The director seems to be unsure whether to make a film or documentary. The main plot is very thin (the CIA agent is required to kill the oil spray, catches and warns the prince (why?)) And therefore some elements were added to make the film more interesting. So the boy dies, resulting in the father's "natural" response: to advise the person responsible indirectly on the death of his son. The lawyer has a drunken "friend" and keeps him around why no one knows. Some children become terrorist suicides and incite the ship. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I was not entertained or intellectually challenged. I didn't laugh or shout, I couldn't understand or had to learn more or cause it. It didn't mean to me the worst thing about my movie.
