This short, harsh winter of Hal Roach's comedy is ninety-nine in our "Gang / Little Rascals" series and eleven talkies. Basically, we see the black comic Stepin Fetchit, who gets a special bill here, that he goes to his shadow where the gang hangs. Farina is looking for her letters of love and Stepin says to read it because she can't read it during the day because she goes to school at night. This happens to Tennessee from her beloved, so now Farina has to fill her ears with cotton, because she's too hot to hear her! In the second room, Weezer gives instructions to Mary Ann about making a taffy on the radio, but as she runs on to the kitchen, she leaves the hair declarer in the segment of rice pudding and Spanish tama, which mixes Mary Ann with Tabasco and Lux. After finishing, Jackie and the rest of the gang will help with a dreadful, but very sticky substance, because everyone can stick to the walls. As they all try to clean up the mess, Stepin works in the basement of a variety of pipes and electrical networks, which mixes the features of changing devices so that the vacuum, the vacuum, the rings, and the refrigerator that plays music! End. What I have just described is a short picture of our "gang" that served as a short series pilot for a potential movie by Stepin Fetchit. It's just as good that it never happened when Fetchit's characteristic lazy Negro was fun only in small doses and is considered very offensive today. Many of the scenes described here are good for some laughs, although the final sequence was so confusing that the results were too big for me. All in all, it can be said that the harsh winter is at least once worth seeing. By the way, Stepin's real name was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
