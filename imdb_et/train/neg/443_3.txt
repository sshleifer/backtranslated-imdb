In general, it is extremely disappointing. Very, very slow structure to the main line. Maria Schrader's job is to look for the secret past of her family. (Every move seems to last forever? There's really no rhythm in the movie.) *** SPOILERS *** His mother Ruth is rescued from the Nazis, a German woman, played by Katja Riemann. The character of Ruth's whole is so one-dimensional, so stereotypical. *** SPOILERS END *** The movie is now being cut between the New York and Berlin and Berlin's 40s. If you do, give the audience an indication of exactly where the story will be. Never a clear indication of time? very annoying. The worst part is the end. *** SPOILERS *** The whole exhibition and jabber that the Jews are so terribly tortured, just because of a bureaucratic accident! Leave me alone. So did the Jews get out of Rosenstrasse? The question of who freed the Jews has never been answered. Was Goebels who released them? Is Lean Fischer high with Goebels? In Venice, the film won an exhibition prize for K. Riemann, why? ? I have no clue. Must have a Jewish theme?
