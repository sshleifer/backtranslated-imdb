I read somewhere that Hollywood should focus on restoring bad movies and leaving the classics alone. We can only hope. Although this remake was not a general waste, I wish I had six bucks to go to the original DVD. A lot of violence and one of the worst end I've ever seen. This version adds nothing new. He just repeats why Hollywood should leave good things alone.
