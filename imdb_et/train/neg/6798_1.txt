This is the worst film I've ever seen. Everyone involved should be embarrassed. Everything. Ice-T is pathetic, dialogue is absolutely terrible, and hockey will not describe the performances of every actor in each film. Stealing a plot is a quorum, but compared to Air Rage, the Executive Decision is the Academy Award Material. I'm never so disappointed when I watch a movie. Air Rage should be burned when the ash is locked into the vault chamber to never see daylight. Anyone who has seen it should keep in the shower and wash the glowing film. The best part of this movie is probably over when the credit is rolled out. It was just the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T should abide by law and order, and others in this movie should retire early or commit suicide. In either case, they should never try to be in the movie again.
