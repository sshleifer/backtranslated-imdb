I can pleasantly remember the prosperity of Bo Derek and the attention of the British press (especially the happy sun and news of World Papers) - everyone followed Dudley Moore with a small role "10". Obviously, his photogenic face, crystal-clear eyes, and his perfectly formed hefty were made. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, his action has never been his forte! I think they should make one triple disc from the collections that you find in the always-favored DVD boxes - Orca, Tarzan Ape-man and Bolero. All these films could stand as "bad they are big". <br /> <br /> Be guilty of "must buy" mine! If you ever read your journalism or this comment by Mrs Derek, then don't offend- ALways was a soft spot for you and there are many more important things in the world to worry about when you are able to act. Lots of Love.x
