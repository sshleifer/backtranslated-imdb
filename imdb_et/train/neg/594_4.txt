I just rented Creep and I wasn't at all impressed. I didn't know anything about this movie. I felt sick because the gore alone was shocking. <br /> <br /> I went out of my living room several times in despair to make this movie happen. Have we seen it before? I didn't like any characters that prevent the channel from being transferred. I felt bad for him. But then I still couldn't think why he was still alive and what Creep hadn't murdered? So many questions have to be answered. <br /> <br /> Somebody mentioned references to the PS2 game at Silent Hill and I see the similarities vaguely. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, not good. Judge for yourself.
