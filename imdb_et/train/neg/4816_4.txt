I imagine that the young people who participated in the "necromancy" ("The Witching" plus other titles) must feel that they are terrible with the composition of John Houseman in the production of "The Cradle Will Rock"; frightened people think that foreigners are invaders ("World War"); and led and celebrated the biggest movie ever ("Citizen Kane"). And now, Orson Welles was in the main competition for the third course of satanic cult. <br /> <br /> There is basically nothing creative about this movie. A lot of nudity, but background music is always really annoying. Even though the film was not very predictable, it was still not visible. When the low Welles had sunk. Fortunately, during his last thirteen years, he told the documentary "Bugs Bunny Superstar" (from the 1940s Warner Brothers cartoons) and hosted a documentary "Man Who Seeed Tomorrow" (Nostradamus). I recommend these two, but not that. Just avoid it. <br /> <br /> Also starring Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkean.
