I've never really understood the popularity of Sabani Power Rangers' exhibition, which was just the Japanese version of the highly popular American version of the last three decades of super-cent. In the Japanese version, the American version, characterization, special effects, etc., were missing. <br /> <br /> Of course, many children say that power radiators are the biggest, but they would be wrong. /> <br /> I'm sure if they speak Japanese, they would learn how much better super products are over the American version. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers are absolutely terrible, try Super Sentai instead! For a better example, try Voltron's The Third Dimension instead!
