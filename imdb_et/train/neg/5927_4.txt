I'm a very politically correct man, so when I say sexist, I really mean that it reduced Diana Muldar's female guest, Dr. Miranda Jones. Despite all his supposed shine and self-control, nothing more, but a big, jealous unreasonable baby. You got a plot now, after his technical tie Marvik, also a broken lover, bounces out when he tried to kill Medusa, Ambassador Colloquia, jealous of rage, but first glanced instead. (You think he could just have closed his eyes and closed the box, too easy), he takes the business without navigating the rooms outside the galaxy before the boys subdue him. Well, the ship has been caught, at that point they could have gone to the good ladies' medical contacts and discussed it. "Spock has to think with Medusan so we can go home. I mean you want to beetch you want to remain disobedient until we stock up and die?" But there is jealousy in the real fashion of Star Trek that imagines and worships when the idea is opened, even when her Medusan idol said she would shut up and go with them. So the buggy dare to bother with Spock, causing him to forget to put his visor on, which makes Spock crazy. Of course, Kirk, what he was, and disgusted him, he fixed Spock with his high telepathic powers. Of course, Lady and Medusan leave at the end and everything is forgiven. You almost want President Battle Star Galactica to show that he is destroying the witch with his destructive stunt. In Star Trek, women are allowed to be completely unreasonable and cruel, but at the same time allegedly sexual equality. That's what I mean by sexist.
