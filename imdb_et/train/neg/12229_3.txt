This movie started well, I felt like I was looking at the adult version of Seinfeld. Much quickly I began to question the situations and activities of the main characters and found no answer as to why they did what they did. All the actors were great, but only a few scenes had short moments where they were really funny. Dan Cortese was amazing. I loved her in this role. His representative should show this to the casting agents of the film. Look at the first few scenes and then find something better, or else you'll find yourself completely lost in this mess. I found it in a video store. It cost me two dollars and because of the awareness of this film, I feel it was a good price.
