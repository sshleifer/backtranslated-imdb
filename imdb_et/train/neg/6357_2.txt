I'm so disappointed. This film left me feeling jipped with my time and spiritual energy. Here again, the most important feature of Woody Allen's film was the neurotic upper class in Manhattan, who discussed whether they were cheating on their spouses. Woody, I've already seen these signs, I saw you ten times. Where did your creativity go? You have to open your eyes and look around. The world has changed dramatically since Annie Hall - and you have to change it. <br /> <br /> There are many interesting and funny scenarios to which you can apply your brand of anger and neuroticism - why not try them out instead of relocating the same old slope again and again. <br /> <br /> When I hear that Woody Allen has a new project, it won't do anything for me, because now I have waited for his old standby: a couple who is tired of each other and finally cheat. Depressive and as old as old. <br /> <br /> If Woody wants to win his fans, he must understand that our sense of humor and intelligence must be stimulated - not offended.
