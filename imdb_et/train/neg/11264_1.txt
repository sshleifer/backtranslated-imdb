I have not yet decided whether it will replace Anaconda as the "worst movie I've ever seen". for that. I was just going to look at how I had read the book and wanted to see how they would work as a complex plot as a 2-hour movie. <br /> <br /> The simple answer is - they didn't. The characters appear little or do not explain who they are and then they will not play a valuable part in narrative. Even the main characters act unreasonably, so that when you get to the movie is not what happens to you. <br /> <br /> I can agree that books have to be rewritten from time to time to fit into movies and that it may be unfair to rate this film against the book it has been adapted to. But after my friends and cinema came out, I had to spend most of my home to explain what was going to happen. <br /> <br /> They even make the real meaning of the book's "Rancid Aluminum" by squeezing it into another meaningless voice so they can have a cool title for the movie. <br /> <br /> True mess from movie to start.
