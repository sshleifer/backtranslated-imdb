San Francisco is a big city with great actors. The filmmakers did not try to use it in the city. They couldn't even manage the most basic realistic details. So I wouldn't recommend it to anyone on the San Francisco movie. You don't think "oh, I've been there," you mean "how did a two-storey firetrap / smelly armpit change into a quiet hotel lobby?" Some wires used the East Coast speech types and effects. It reduces, but the action was always competent. <br /> <br /> The stories seemed to be shot in three different styles, at least in the beginning. The Chinatown story was most effective and interesting. The plot is weak, the ripped scene with stylish Hong Kong films. The originals had much more tension and emotional resonance, they were framed and stretched better. But the actor is fun and we see James Hong and other lighting equipment. <br /> <br /> The white boy's intro was pointless. I think the filmmakers didn't know what to do with it, so they left it loosely structured and cut it off. The father is a strange attempt at Berkeley's liberal - indeed, people, everyone knows it's not going to live in the ghetto "but his segments are the most humorous. They threw in some good opportunities. The yuppie jerk educated on the west coast is a different yuppie jerk than in New York. equally intolerable, but always distinguishable, it would have been interesting, it wasn't so. <br /> <br /> The Hunter's Point intro was the most disappointing, it was three and most stylish from San Francisco. and you have seen it better. Even the video game was better! <br /> <br /> Despite the general non-locality and targeted scripts, this character has the potential, the actors are talented, and something interesting begins to push the terrible direction ... about ten minutes before the end. Good concept is placed in the wrong hands.
