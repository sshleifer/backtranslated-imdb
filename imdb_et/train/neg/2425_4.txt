### Spoilers! ### <br /> <br /> What does this movie offer? A guide to editing and cinematography that matches a terrible plot. It is sad to see that Denzel Washington's talents are wasted in this trash. We have definitely hinted at how the Mexican people will not save themselves, the necessary external forces, perhaps the militarists, America. And we know that Dad is a shady character, he is Mexico, unlike a woman who appreciates Crease because he is American. He killed all they thought he died. And is he? Of course, he is not, he is a young boy and you should not hurt a Hollywood fan. The trade scene was the only thing that prevented me from taking the "incredibly successful" rating (as some critics have pointed out). The nausea of ​​such films takes time. According to such films, we have to doubt the reliability of IMDb.7.7 for such a movie and 7.0 for my own private Idaho. Get your finger off! The mine is in the range of 3.5-4.0
