Imagine a scenario - you are in the cinema just because you are in Washington in the weekend and it rains and you have finished with museums. You think you could watch Sarah Marshall's movie as it is in the trailer, and you don't have to get your brain involved. It's sold out. Choices? - Banking, Bruges, Leatherheads, or Prom Night. You've seen Bank Job (a surprisingly decent movie that is very good) and Bruges (again pretty good) so you're two. You don't want to see if Clooney or a nice official runs around in 1930's football uniforms so you're going to see Prom Night? Wrong. You take $ 8.50, walk up the streets and ask him to hit you for $ 8.50. It would be better to spend money. <br /> <br /> In fact, it plays more comedy than horror / thriller or whatever it should be. When I funded this movie and they showed me that the last cut doesn't know if I laugh or cry. Probably both. Insulting human intelligence ... my roommate laughed loudly from most of the film, just like the actors, they could also take robots (or perhaps dogs) into roles, they would have been more realistic. The detective must probably be the worst actor I have ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan (I hate my actions so much that I don't care how you wrote your name) if you are exempt from your title / posts) > <br /> In summary, "not good"
