I usually support independent art and I try to be very thorough and tolerant ... I tend to support everyone because their efforts are worth ... <br /> <br /> but this film moves beyond the limits of understanding and tolerance! <br /> <br /> Imagine the following situation: <br /> <br /> 1. Think of the truly truly horror film you have ever seen in your life. <br /> <br /> 2. Think of some great attractive ART for this DVD box ... and a promising plot ... <br /> <br /> 3. voil√†! you have ZOMBIE NATION. <br /> <br /> Look at it only if you have nothing better to do. Something is better.
