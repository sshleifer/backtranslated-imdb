Imagine the worst sculptures on Saturday night and Mad TV on a 90-minute film. Imagine that all these bad scores have been removed and replaced with stupidity. Now imagine something 50 times worse. <br /> <br /> Got it? <br /> <br /> Now, look, see Underground Comedy Movie. The vision you just had seems more fun ever. UCM is one of the worst films I've ever seen. There were some cheap laughs ... very little. But it was flat. Even if the film was to be flat, it was too funny to be funny. <br /> <br /> The only reason I am not angry about wasting my time looking at it is someone else I know. He wasted his money. Vince Offer hasn't written or directed anything else and it is not surprising why.
