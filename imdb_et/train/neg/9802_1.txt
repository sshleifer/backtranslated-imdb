Many people say this show is only for kids. Hm, when I was a kid (about 7-9 years old), I looked at this example first. It was disgusting for me. I talked to other kids about this and, of course, other shows and I know what? It was a hiding measure, when we wanted to emphasize something stupid (either on television or something else), we said, "Uh, like Power Rangers" and we laughed. <br /> <br /> And before visiting this site, I couldn't imagine being actually a MMPR fan. It was so strange to me that I decided to look at it again and try to understand why people like it. I didn't enjoy this viewing. But it went to me: maybe I don't have enough imagination? It may be. However, this argument is not enough to evaluate it with more than 1 star.
