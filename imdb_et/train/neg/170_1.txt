Everybody, including the title sequence (now what's funny) watches viewers, believe it is some kind of cinematic wonder, but trust me people, it's one of the most embarrassing movies you'll ever see, and if you're not laughing at it for five minutes , I would say you have lost your sense of humor. <br /> <br /> David Niven plays a dead and brutally attacked RAF pilot who thinks it would be worthwhile to involve an impressive (female) air traffic controller in an emotional conversation of love, just as he takes on his solid and fiery death. (Isn't it romantic ...) Of course, he has spared a metaphysical chance and is washing the beach, just as the same air traffic controller rides his bike. (They just arrived). <br /> <br /> Looking at the odd homo-erotic subtypes (so you need to refer to them as supertexten, a naked son sitting on bare sand faces) in the twilight-zone-esquire movie on his little flute, with a heavenly courier that is so The comb / queen-y her makeup is richer than women), the most bizarre aspects of the film are how she makes such bad cartoons a contraction of national and racial stereotypes in an attempt to claim some point about the universal nature and power of love. We can do it - fly boys like girls skirts and heels, and girls like back, and probably all you have to do is cry little to make it big enough to get 10 stars from IMDb. <br /> <br /> In terms of production quality, consistency / editing is weak enough to create friction, and lighting may even be worse than it, but you hardly notice it because the script is so bad. Technicolor plays games (regardless of whether the sky is black and white when you understand it) and prediction, (so funny my compatriot, who usually likes movies like it really rejoiced and laughed when doci motorcycle finally ended up with a fiery wreck ) and the Freezing Movement (which is most funny because the female driver is so quietly standing still that you know that the hands of the stage were torn out of the camera). <br /> <br /> The best shots are the first on the beach, but after that it's all downhill. (Moving as the escalator moves) The staircase is barely Odessa steps, and I really warn anyone that they should feel they should see this flat attempt to make a movie on their account. The movie is funny at all, and that's the best thing I say about it.
