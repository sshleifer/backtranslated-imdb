This movie is the worst film, but it's very high for me. It should be a Slasher movie. It takes place at a university where there are only a few students. Teachers are uncomfortable as hammers. It is full of good Catholic priest, sexually repressed humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. The dialogue is so fond that it is hard to believe I was able to predict quotes. The creatures have some creativity and they seem to turn around the genitalia. The lack of consistency on the sound track and the signs that deserve death because they are so bad, I recommend this movie for a fun time. Get cheap beer and some friends, watch it and laugh.
