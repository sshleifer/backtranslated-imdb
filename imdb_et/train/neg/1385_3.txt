"Hak Hap" or "Black Mask" was disappointing. I was told it was a Japanese version of a matrix. Imagine your frustration. The film was either poorly dubbed or the soundtrack did not fit with the film. Another thing is that the dialogue was pretty much bad. There was very little thought in the English version of this film, and it is limited to the genre of "meaningless action". Not a movie I would like to see again.
