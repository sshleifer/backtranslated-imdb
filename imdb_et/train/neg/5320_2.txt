It is dry and sterile filming, one of the most interesting events at the forefront of World War II and the history of warfare. The composition of the bad drama is the worst thing about this movie than Hitler's killing plot, assuming it is a dramatic event. There is no evolution of character and the idea that Tom Cruise requires a high-level commander who questions his deep inner thoughts about patriotism and treason. I believe Mr Bin is playing better. In general, the film looks pretty much like a good German movie "Stauffenberg" since 2004, but it can't keep it close. But the film's financial purpose is obviously a pop-corn audience who takes care of Hollywood's fast-paced blood and low artistic value.
