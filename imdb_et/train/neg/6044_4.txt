A well-assembled entry in the genre of serum killing, which unfortunately is truly pleased with its own claim security. Willem Dafoe is great as a NYC detective who is trying to track what appears to be a cop, using the same renaissance-related killing methods used in some of the murders he had been solving for years. Scott Speedman is Dafoe's younger partner and has quite good chemistry (at least for a while). The other characters open up so that both cases are easily linked. Clea Duval is a friend of an earlier victim and Peter Stormare is a kind of art dealer / mentor to Dafo ... it's a bit difficult to take, although Stormare is of course never boring. The end of the movie is particularly disappointing. Look quickly at Deborah Harry as Dafoe less than the future neighbor.
