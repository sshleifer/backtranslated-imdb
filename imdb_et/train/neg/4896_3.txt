I'll start with what I liked. <br /> <br /> I really liked songs, all of them were great, costumes, music, words (as long as the translation was good :)), choreography, all <br /> <br /> I loved the crab scene and cooking scene. <br /> <br /> But that's about it. <br /> <br /> I get this, artistic cinema, blablabla, but too much is too much. Too much silence (the lesson was interesting, but two hours of listening and occasionally silencing, really ...), too much boredom (no movie should ever be boring, no matter how deep it was!)), Too many porn-like scenes ( I really do, I get that they filmed a porn movie, but really, it's too much) I really think the cinema should be watching and it's definitely in no way traceable. <br /> <br /> 3 stars for songs.
