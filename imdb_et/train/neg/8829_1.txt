It's a grueling story about the story. The movie has about an hour before we have a lot of ideas about what it should be; characters are often obtrusive; activities often seem to have no relation to each other; no one seems to be concerned about who actually killed the girl; a few spooky children go swimming in waters that seem threatening, but nothing happens; The Irishman gets the face of one of his friends without seeing the reason, so that the resume would be as boring as the film itself. The only side to entertain is landscape photography; but anyone can mark the camera on the Australian outback to get memorable shots. Generally - harsh, inconsistent, pretentious - and upset to waste so much time on the viewer.
