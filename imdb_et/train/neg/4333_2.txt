Quote: theurgist: Anyone with I.Q. Over 50 would have seen this movie, that is, intelligent well-functioning prequel to today's classics, yes, it has no explosive or big budget, but it's still very well done and put me in full-time. <br /> <br /> IQ over 50 you say .. that most means you have I.Q. under 50 .. his name is CARLITOS WAY: Rise to power !!! that is, it should have something the first should do. <br /> <br /> all and all this is OK movie if .. YOU CHANGED THE NAME AND NOT FEATURES NAMED CARLITO BRIGANTE !!! <br /> <br /> Ps doesn't comment on the movie if you don't know anything about movies. but I think I.Q. under 50, you don't know what the fuck I'm yelling ... <br /> <br /> Peace!
