According to IMDb, as well as all other websites that have a review; there is no director for this "thing". Well, that would certainly explain a lot! Just a bunch of people gathered together to shoot perverted porn series and throw an ultra-thin story about worshiping devils and sacrificing women on lonely sanitary walls. "Hardgore" is an excellent example of the perfect hit of the 70s, because it is really made with minimal product values ​​and inspiration for scripts. Horror films related to satanic cultures were very popular in the early 1970s and also in pornography, so why not combine the two? Here we have a simple story of a young nymphomaniac girl who is committed to providing spiritual refuge, and has been pulled into the network of drugs, psychedelic organs, rape, torture and dildo activities since the first evening. Really, a lot of Dildo activities. The friendly lesbian sister tries to warn her, but she has a throat break even in the evening. The aspects of fear are really poorly developed, starting with the ridiculously scary Satan's masks until the attack of virulent broken penis. Photography and exemplary performances are almost intolerably amateurish, but what do you expect from a film that contains material from sperm dildos and amputated male reproductive organs? Leading Lady Justina Lynn is a pretty good looking girl, but most of her co-stars (males and females) are nervous and excessively hairy.
