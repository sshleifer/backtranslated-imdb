This is probably the best horror film made after Ed Wood's death. <br /> <br /> I can't break the end because I have no idea what happened. However, I try my best. There is some lesbian vampire, but they keep changing their bodies so that any sign may or may not be the sign you should think of, or it may be a lesbian vampire. Sound confused? It's not as confusing as you think, because no characters start to make any sense. There is no plot, no character development, and random people appear, speak a few lines and then disappear, never hear again. There are also zombies who are * vampire enemies, but in a psychiatric hospital there is a dream inside, so none of it happened, and this is all the hallucinations of the main character. <br /> <br /> Back side? Both leading girls take their shirts briefly. Special effects are just outrageous (especially like incredibly slow, inconvenient sequences). Everyone has a really foolish Canadian accent that adds a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Rent is worth it. We laughed until we called.
