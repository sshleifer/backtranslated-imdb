1 is quite generous here. I really enjoyed BOOGEYMAN, although it is not really a BOOGEYMAN advertised on the DVD cover and we all know it! It pulled me out. But this movie is something else. Because someone who has been led by a man who has been in the film for a long time seems to be 10 years old with a VHS camcorder! The story and the behavior are cruel! David Hess, you have let me down. After you play one of the most threatening crooks in movie history, have you used it? However, the story and action could have been forgiven if someone had taken the time to be a professional to watch the video. There are a lot of pictures of video movies out there that don't look or at least not so obvious that it reduces your attention to the movie. I can't say it's the worst movie because I couldn't do it all over the movie, but it's definitely close.
