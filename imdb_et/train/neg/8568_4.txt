DEAD HUSBANDS is a somewhat silly comedy about a number of women who knock down each other's spouses in the conspiracy. It is by no means embarrassingly bad as some comedies I could mention, but it will never recognize its potential. Imagine how good it would have been if we had Farrelly's brothers who led Ben Stiller as Carter Elson. <br /> <br /> Oh, is Carter Jerry Springer? Just curious, because Dr. Elson's catch statement is "caring for and talking to each other"
