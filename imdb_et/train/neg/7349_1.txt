Polyester was the first John Water movie I saw, and I have to say that it was the "worst" movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The "talent" group of water included a number of people who I was sure I worked for, and I was ready to say that Waters wrote. Every thing in the movie is terrible, acting, camera, editing, and the story of a woman who plays the 300 pounds transvestite Divine was purely absurd. <br /> <br /> That means I have to recommend this movie because it's very funny, and you don't think the fuck that happens to the bad Francine. His son hates solvents in the grocery store and unlikely to hit the feet of women. Her daughter is a slutty slut in the city. His wife is a pornographic harassing A-hole who makes every effort to shame and humiliate the bad Francine. <br /> <br /> Francine's only friend is Edith Massey, perhaps the worst actor. Edith looks and sounds as she reads the lines from the map and has never seen a script before filming. <br /> <br /> Despite all Francine's travels, Waters is preparing for the end of a great Hollywood, and everything (who lives over) lives happily.
