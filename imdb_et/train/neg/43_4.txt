This video was disgusted initially in Britain and was released in November last year without any cuts. <br /> <br /> Here is the Playboy Playmate of the Month October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. The opening cut is going back and forth between Buchfellner and the foggy jungle. I'm not sure what its purpose was. It would have been much better to focus on the bath scene. <br /> <br /> Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and kept in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find him and the ransom. Of course, one of the robbers (Antonio de Cabo) manages to pass on time, while the other (Werner Pochath) is consistently hiding. <br /> <br /> The ransom exchange goes to hell and Laura runs into the jungle. Will Peter save him before the cannibals eat? Oh, yes, this jungle has cannibalism. Why do you think it was a nasty video! Muriel Montossé has been found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - an angel of death) on a robber boat. Montossé is very comfortably dressed. Peter leaves them and goes alone to find Laura, who is now caught. They spend time with sex and do not see the danger approaching. Who is anyone? Great fight between Peter and the naked fucking (Burt Altman). <br /> <br /> Blood, decapitation, guts, lots of full front, some big anger cannibals priest (Aline Mess) and a line, "They're good at your heart," which is fun when you see the movie.
