The first home was a good movie ... the queue in the new environment was pretty much the same. It tries to be original and to some extent successful ... of course, the formula is basically the same, so it's like watching the same movie for the third time with a slightly modified plot. The new score is quite bad (although the new "trap" piece was, if nothing else, interesting and different), especially when compared to the first score and almost-but-not-quite good result from the other. It (almost) makes it, using some pretty good non-original music, but it's not just the same. The plot is fair and somewhat original for the franchise, but it is still essentially the same film as the first two, a worse operation and a less impressive example of a "scary character that proves good". Operation is mostly unimpressive. Characters are mostly cartoons. The new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones (and they make fun of spy, which is almost criminal, given the limited number of good spy clips and how few are cool). The fact that there are more of them (and therefore more traps) is just a weak attempt to go beyond the first two higher films ... and it doesn't work. The thoughts of thieves and their mission are too ... serious for an adult and children's film (and there was a sexual joke or two, although this is not the first time in the series). It is also unnecessarily complicated, as is the plot in general. I can follow it, but I doubt the child could. Part of the exposition is so obvious that even children can be stupid. Animal stuff is usually not amusing. There are fewer siblings that should mean they are more developed, but they have less personality than the least of the first two films. All in all, it's just not good or worth looking at if you don't * really * love watching criminals who create anti-career violence. I only recommend this to the huge fans of the series. 3/10
