When you look at this exhibition, you are not sure whether it is a story or a behavior that is more annoying. First of all, the story of each episode is very predictable, writers must have used all possible clich√©s, you can not only guess the general plot, but the layout of the scenes, as well as the lines of each character by collecting the exhibition in each police series. On top of it all the exhibition "message" is that the goods are good and bad is bad and that at the end of the day is a good thing and that we should all love each other, be better and better. better citizens, all in the most visible way. Participants, if the vehicles of this message and nothing else, use a limited amount of operational skills: "I'm a good carrier" smile, the look and the "victory is our" posture, while the bad guys are "I'm bad" frowning and "you stick me "Look, followed by" I'm good at something and I should be removed from society "by the head of the band (such a summary of the overall development of each exhibition). True story or not, the show is a garbage, another proof that manufacturers don't give viewers any ** that we are all idiots. Well this series will make every effort to bring the brain out of your life.
