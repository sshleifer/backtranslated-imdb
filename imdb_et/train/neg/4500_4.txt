This movie is not really terrible. Someone commented that Mo is a type of American Europeans. But there are those who may not be Anglo-Saxon speakers who don't care about French; and the character of Xavier does not discourage them. <br /> <br /> Let's look at his stereotypical French qualities: <br /> <br /> 1). Cynical - very cynical. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 2). Reedy, underestimated appearance, control, despite: <br /> <br /> 3). Great kitchen price. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 4). Happy work ethic. Check it out. (Forget that she's a supposedly rich stockbroker, looking at her in the movie, she seems to put ten hours of work a week.) <br /> <br /> 5). Beautiful woman, check it out. Despite this: <br /> <br /> 6). Interpreting a marriage allows. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 7). A great sexual ego that says the American girl owes you when you buy her dinner. Check. <br /> <br /> Whether Mo is a hick or not, there is no reason why he would fall for this secret European twit that the script does not require. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, like other male experts, I enjoyed Karen Allen's cute petite body. I give the movie four stars; two of them are for that.
