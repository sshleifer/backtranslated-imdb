Ever wanted worms to eat? Here is a documentary that shows you how! Yes ... The child eats live worms! And that's the most interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite boring by previous reviewers. I totally agree here. The movie just doesn't go anywhere. This is one movie that is almost impossible to write a spoiler .... because nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Now on the technical side: they should have given this child a haircut. Who's trying to look anyway ... Bozo clown. It was almost comic ... I was expecting him to become a shaggy dog ​​or something. <br /> <br /> And moreover; the boy was too thick to ever be hungry! We should keep him junk food a few weeks before filming. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is almost asleep. And my kids could only handle about 15 minutes before they left something more interesting about the scene. <br /> <br /> I admit that the terrain was very impressive. And if it were accompanied by a decent story, he could have hit. <br /> <br /> It seemed safe enough for kids to watch: bear scenes and "oddball" eyeballs were too weak to scare most kids and a short "skinny-dipping" scene didn't show anything. <br /> <br /> I gave this one very generous 3.
