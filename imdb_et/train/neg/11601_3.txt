Nightmare Elm on the Street: Dream Child, the fifth nightmare of the Nightmare Elm Street series and the worst order in the series, even worse than the Nightmare Elm Street 2. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare Elm Street on my birthday DVD set and I watched all the sequel. The child of dreams was undoubtedly the worst, I was also surprised because they did so well in the last two stages. But I think they just lost their charm, the story was just ridiculous and I wasn't happy where he went. Alice was just annoying, she was neither Nancy nor Kirsten, so wearing her own movie didn't work for me. Freddy also loses his fear, it was just a little stupid. <br /> <br /> Alice is back and she's carrying the baby, she couldn't be happier with her life. But Freddy is back and he's not going to be too easy because he won so easily in the fourth film. But still she wants her baby and is born again. Have you ever wondered if Fredd had parents? Well, this is the nightmare on Elm Street: The child of dreams is studying and Alice will soon discover what Freddy's childhood was and what might be one of the things that could hit her. <br /> <br /> Nightmare Elm Street: Dream Child is just a bad movie and a series of insult. I don't think anyone could be happy with this. Just the story was really stupid, I thought it might have worked, but again it was wrong. I know that if you want to see the nightmares of the Elm Street series, you should look at it, but I really wouldn't recommend it, it's not worth it, at least in my opinion. <br /> 3/10
