This is just one of those nervous movies you can find on Lifetime TV, which depicts the disgusting behavior of some disgusting women. Together with other nasty movies like "The Burning Bed", "Enough" or "Monster", this film takes a nasty criminal and tries to show the viewer why he is not so bad. Give us a break! Here's my question to the filmmakers: If LeTourneau were a man, and Vili was a 12-year-old girl, would you have sympathy and empathy with that person? Answer: hell no. <br /> <br /> Imagine sex being turned on in this movie, and then you see why I and others here think it is worthless garbage. When sex was changed, the criminals would not try to feel empathy. Instead, we would probably have been treated to imagine a monster and a terrible man attacking a young girl, his innocent behavior in prison, and his brainwash victim carrying the Stockholm Syndrome. The only reason why LeTourneau does not get the same treatment on this film is because of his sex <br /> <br />. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Simple and simple. No, if and, or. He is a criminal who is in prison and deserves our contempt and contempt, but certainly not our loss or empathy.
