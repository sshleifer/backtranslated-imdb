Before watching "Dahmer", I thought no film would be worse than "Freddy Got Fingered". I was wrong. The conclusion of "Dahmer" is the story of homosexual serum killing, which has almost no killing and consists almost entirely of Dahmer's meetings with homographers before being killed. There is no plot that can be found, and it does not have any purpose to tell us about "Dahmer". All you can do about Dahmer watching this movie is that she liked having sex with men. Terrible action, terrible management, horrible writing, terrible things ... If you have to choose between "Dahmer" and vomiting vomit within three hours, go with vomiting .... it's less painful .....
