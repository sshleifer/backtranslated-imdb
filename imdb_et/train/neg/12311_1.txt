I know I've already added a comment, but I just wanted to explain something ... <br /> <br /> I'm not an old baby boomer who grew up sliding with a shaking b / w image of Phil Silver, Jackie Gleason, and so on. <br /> <br /> Bilko was already born 20 years old, but I was delighted to discover Phil Silver's Bilko with BBC2. I don't know if I would have enjoyed Steve Martin's travesty if I hadn't seen Phil Silvers or heard - I don't know - maybe I would. <br /> <br /> Some other filmmakers who think this movie is worth "10" to admit they haven't seen the original. I can only invite you to spend 21 minutes watching one episode while watching your life. If, after watching the original Ernie, Colonel, Ritzig & Emma, ​​Duane Doberman, Henshawi, Dino, Flashman, Zimmerman, Mullin, etc., you still think Steve Martin's film is something other than "2" - I'll stand on you.
