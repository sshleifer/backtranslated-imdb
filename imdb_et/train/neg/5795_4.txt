"Lies" speaks about an 18-year-old female student and an abstract 38-year-old married man whose couples spend about half of the screen time on naked sex and hacked whipping and on the other side worshiping a pathetically naive story that seems little more than an excuse for sex scenes. With a very poor production value, including a story of obvious sanitary equipment and fake soft porn, which is a dirty comedy and drama mix, "Lies" quickly becomes superfluous. Almost 2 hours of driving, there are no subtitles and so little substance "Lies" is simply recommended. (C-)
