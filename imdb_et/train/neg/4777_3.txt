The idea of ​​this movie was good. Too bad it wasn't well written. The pouring of Sidney Poitier as FBI agents was a good idea and he did a great job. But Tom Berenger knows only one emotion in most of his films, anger. The character of Kirstie Alley could have been a great and even some opportunity to show, but the writer gave us his role, making his role mostly helplessly a woman. It was completely in contradiction with the strongly independent character he was supposed to be. I don't care about Alley's behavior anyway. The film should have ended about fifteen minutes earlier. The director milked the cow before incredible final action. I keep it in my collection only on the example of Poitier's performances.
