The four best friends of a young male chinin pig (with an emphasis on pigs) meet weekly in NYC's canteen to introduce their dating sex plots in this misanthropic and visceral comedy. Beet is a common denominator that drives three groups that cause conflict and inevitable "whipping". Although the film's premise has potential and there are some funny moments, the flick generally does not work when girls are probably better than those who contradict the story. One of these one-man band flix with ten producers, "Whipped", is probably only the type of young men who think "Man Show" is Emmy's material.
