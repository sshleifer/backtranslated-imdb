It's funny when you stop and think about it: fans of fear films tend to be deeply and permanently opposed to those who scare them into daylight. Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE can give us nightmares, but who of us (Believers) did not feel the love of Gunnar Hansen very real for BRUTAL MASSACRE or Ken Foree, forever and always the original hero of the original DAWN OF? In the transformation of his furnace, he made me want to stand up and enjoy (like Tom Savin's home); I'm not doing you. And Brian Halloran and ... Well, you get my drift (if not, stop down ...). These are some of the horror heroes. In order to see that many of them are filmed together, it is almost unheard of (at least, to my knowledge). If only the writer (s) had performed such a monumental task. Maybe somebody else is trying somewhere on the line again. As long as it is not yet a cordial effort (for example, BLOOD BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD).
