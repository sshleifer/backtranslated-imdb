Okay ... it seems that so far only the fans in this community have commented on this movie - time to the contrary. Beware that this script is * LONG *. <br /> <br /> For those who don't know (mostly non-Belgians): Tom Barman, the director of this film, is at the forefront of the dEUS, one of the best known rock bands of the late 90s in Belgium. Basically, they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose at national level. Then the egos began to hurt and the band broke down basically, Barman, and some others who continued the albums under the dEUS. The way this always happens in such cases is a post-distribution dEUS much more variable and less interesting than the original. In 1999, with their international album "Ideal Crash", they tried to break into an international breakthrough, presenting their earlier style of song writing in a much diluted form. They didn't do it completely. However, the egos were still quite big, they seem big enough for Barman to consider himself an artist to watch the film. <br /> <br /> Such a thing is usually a very big mistake and this movie doesn't make an exception. And Barman clearly went to this art *, another very big mistake. First, he is a musician, not a film director. Secondly, dEUS does it best for fun and provoke music, but never something close to what I would consider * art *. It shows. <br /> <br /> What is this movie? In principle, this story tells of a completely uninteresting person who makes things equally interesting on Friday, which is completely uninteresting in Antwerp, because it is even more interesting for them to be interested. The characters are low, the plot is completely pointless, and the film has no other redemption qualities to compensate for these shortcomings. Humor? The whole film made me smile (slightly) about 3 times and really brought out a 5-second laugh (not quite loud). Fashion? The film just doesn't seem to have any emotion at all. Mystery? Well, the (* MINOR SPOILER *) film-inspired "wind-man" idea is as appealing as pizza with banana pepper - not very, and it has been made thousands of times before (someone remembers Johny Destiny) - one of Tarantino's worst performances to date (*) END MINOR SPOILER *). And well, its * artistic *, so don't expect any real action to make up for all the previous ones. In other words, except for a few smiles, whatever my short pants are out. <br /> <br /> What's up? Well, the soundtrack is pretty good, although it suffers from some of the same problems that other OSTs have recently shown: first, it makes the movie more than a CD. Secondly, it gives the impression that Barman tries to hide the weaknesses and the lack of emotional content in the film behind the essence of the film, which just doesn't work. Finally, the film makes more than just an example of songs. And unfortunately, this is Barman's own contribution to the soundtrack that has attracted the most attention, even though it is the weakest part of the entire sound track when I'm concerned. All in all, it just shows that Barman knows more about music than movies. The work of the camera is also fine, though not something that would make you shout. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie looked at me was a vision-based factor. Since I come from Antwerp, it was fun to play some kind of "likely place" game. However, I do not consider it to be of high quality. <br /> <br /> All in all, Flemmish's movie is another way. I note that recently the best Belgian films have come from the French part of the country. This is mainly because at least they have something to say and lead to say it both sharply and emotionally (brothers Daerden come to mind). Perhaps Flemmish art artists should also try it.
