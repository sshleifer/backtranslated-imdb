This third Darkman was definitely better than the second, but still much worse than the original film. What made it better than D2 was that Bad Guy had changed and Durant was not restored. Moreover, there was in fact some hint of character development when it came to a bad family and Darkman. It made my heart softer and gave it a flick as much as 4/10, ie ** / *****.
