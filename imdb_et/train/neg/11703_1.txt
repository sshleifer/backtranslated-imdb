You will notice that a chemist who appears on two scenes and can talk is played by Stephen King. "Don't give up your day to work" is a standard thing to say, but it's not fair. The king understands himself well: he is no worse than any other cast member and better than most. But the story is pure rubbish. Please give up your day. <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many terrible performances that the leading actor (LEAD ACTOR!) is probably the worst - one movie collected. Everyone is acting hammily, but not in any entertainment; they are all able to switch over without spending or showing energy. I blame the screenwriter / director Tom Holland. It cannot be that all the actors are really bad. What's against it? Of course, I've never heard anything before, but I don't believe I can walk to the talent agency and get out of it with many bad performers when I tried: one actor, despite his best efforts, would turn out. So, what is more likely - that Tom Holland rolled a dozen consecutive snake eyes, or that he wrote a bad script and headed it badly? This would also explain why the participants are in direct proportion to their importance in the script. The more direction the actor was, the worse he was. ("You want me to bend like a hunchback, talk about my throat, show all my teeth and see it boring, all at the same time? Okay ...") <br /> <br /> The theory is that the Netherlands managed to succeed write a dog. Several writers have commented here that Billy Halleck is not a pleasant character, but it is a misleading way to put it. He's not a familiar character. All we know about him before the onset of supernatural things is that he is fat and that everything he can think of is food. ("Everything I mean is food," he says to us, usefully.) And finally ... <br /> <br /> (Sigh) I think I should add a spoiler warning here ... <br /> <br /> Finally, he becomes evil. Why? I can only shrug. Maybe she's under some fascination. Yes, this is probably it. "Bad" maybe I mean "inexplicable" - it is not as bad as the socially undesirable suspension of the conventional means of psychology. In any case, there is no point in the end of his activity, no one makes sense, and that is despite the fact that the characters do little but explain their motivation for the audience. <br /> <br /> By the way, here's my candidate for tooth line / delivery: "I don't think you want it. FACT ..." [big dramatic break] "... I don't think you ever do it want. "
