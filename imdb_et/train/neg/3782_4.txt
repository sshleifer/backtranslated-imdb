Here's the first good news. "Spirit" is the most visually incredible animated movie in the present home theater release. Art and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend that you watch this movie only because of the visuals. <br /> <br /> And now for bad news. I really mean when I say that animation is the only thing this film does for it. You may remember that "Spirit" got badly "Lilo and Stitch" last summer. The first person who claims it was precisely because Disney is more mature and has better advertising can write me a four-page essay titled "Why" Lilo and Stitch's script didn't fade. "<br /> <br /> For all the incredible new animation technology that is displayed in "Spirit", the story is almost * amazing * boring. Here is a lesson and (needless to say) that it does not only concern animated movies. You can have the most pleasing visual effects to give mortal grace, but If your story is boring and, more importantly, we don't care about your characters, it's a bad filmmaking. It's easy. Animation is still delightful; I just can't wait to see what anyone does with imagination.
