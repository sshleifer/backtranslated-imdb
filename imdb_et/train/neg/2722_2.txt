For our great thinkers, "The Intruder" is a crazy inconsistent film from France, which gives "art films" a bad name. The story is something about the bitter old cage, Louis Trebor (Michel Subor), who is looking for a heart transplant in Tahiti, but after that I have no idea who any of the people in the movie was or why they did it. Without a single logic to boast, the film loses us early, even though I am quite ready to admit that there may be SOMEBODY from who really gets the deep message of this movie. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> This confusing, snail-pace drama runs for two hours and five minutes - though I seriously doubt that someone with any life ends with a closing credit.
