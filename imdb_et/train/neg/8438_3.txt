I think bad Laurel and Hardy are better than Laurel and Hardy, but hardly. It is sad that Fox movies are the ones who get a great release on DVD, exposing people who may not be too familiar with L & H from their classic comedy. <br /> <br /> The boys are back with a silly romantic plot associated with an inexperienced boy invented. She's in love with her boss's daughter, who hates her and prefers some slick man. It's incredible to think that the Fox geniuses thought it was what L&H needed in his films. <br /> <br /> With no pancake makeup, boys are tired and old. Only the scenes that work for them in this picture are when they try to get out of the bedroom window at night and a rather strange scene where Robert Mitchum, a classic bad guy, is trying to sell Oliver Hardy for "insurance." br /> <br /> Otherwise, this script is just a mess. Forget about it and see if you find a copy of "A Chump at Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Desert Sons" instead.
