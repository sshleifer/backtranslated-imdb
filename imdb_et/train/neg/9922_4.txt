Growing, Joe Strummer was my hero, but even this movie was cold. For the better and worse, the future is not an unwritten style of documentary "Behind Music". Rather, it is a film of biographical art, interviews full of images, performance materials, home videos, and mostly nonsense animation images raised from "livestock". The film is consistent, but it takes about one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> Campfire design is really annoying when it comes to thinking. First of all, without headlines, it's hard to even know half of those surveyed. Secondly, who really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp and John Cusack mouth butt licking a man? They were not relevant to the life of Strummer, and their opinions did not add anything to their story. <br /> <br /> This picture is best when Strummer, recorded by interviews and conversation, touches the facets of his life, most people did not know about: the suicide of his older brother, reaching the death of his parents, joy of fatherhood. For me, they were the most moving because it showed that Joe Strummer is not a punk icon that we all knew and loved, but a normal human being who had to deal with the joys and worries of life. br /> There have been better, simpler documentaries about Strummer and Clash. (Westway, VH1 Legends, and MTV documentary from Kurt Loder from the beginning of the 1990s.) Joe Strummer: The future is unwritten only for dieters.
