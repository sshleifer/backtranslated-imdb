I can't say I liked this movie very much. has some fun moments but it doesn't seem to be able to think about whether it is comedy or drama. not really working either. light as a tone to be a drama, and fun moments are little and far between, not even a lot of thinking. What it seems to be happening for some reason. And it is very difficult. I feel they just did things If they had just taken some time to explain things, it might have been a better film. that would mean that the rest of the movie would actually have built something that it just didn't sort, and that is that I couldn't find it boring, but as I said, there's no point at all. I give Winter Kills a reluctance and a weak 3/10
