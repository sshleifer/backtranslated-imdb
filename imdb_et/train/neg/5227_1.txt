........ and very bad! How long did this train wreck last? 14 episodes or something? I see why now. <br /> <br /> I bought the "Serenity" episode from Amazon Unboxed. It was my first purchase, so it was free. This is ONLY a good experience experience (incident ??) <br /> <br /> I don't really comment on the actor because they were, I think, quite new people who didn't really get the job right now. At least I have never seen them in any major exhibitions, theater or television. If I did, I just forgot about them. <br /> <br /> But the special effects were totally terrible. True, this is not a multi-million dollar project, but the original Star Trek did it better than it was thirty years later. Especially, I smiled a ship from bad boys (staplers or something) because it ran a fun Firefly, where smoke came out of engines that look like a giant model rocket. I expected to end up seeing Wiley Coyote cycling, while we track the Roadrunner. MODERN jet / rocket engines do not even do so bad. <br /> <br /> And it wasn't even the worst. The North-West-type shooting games had thought to me whether I was actually watching a sci-fi movie or Gene Autry. <br /> <br /> Regardless of whether or not you are wasting your time ... I did ... all of the 80's disaster "Firefly".
