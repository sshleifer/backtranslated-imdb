I do not know why in the film business this behavior was never let down! This movie (short) is gross (at least say)! These are children aged 5-7 who wear diapers with large bobby buttons, acting as adults (and too much!). But it is interesting because it is a good example of how "good old days" might not be so good! (Thank God, we have laws against such material now!) <br /> <br /> {This is a short Shirley stamp festival}
