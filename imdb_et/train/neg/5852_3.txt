Bradford Dillman plays a scientist who wakes up in the morning in a bloody crime scene; Partial Amnesia (or "Global Amnesia", which one sign says she defines as planned memory loss), the scientist finds a private detective in the phone book, hoping to put her life back together. Scary production based very loosely on Walter Ericson's "Fallen Angel" (filmed in 1965 as "Mirage" by Gregory Peck). It was probably too funny for television - the addition of drugs and hippies to the mix - that NBC refused to breathe it, which is how it was eliminated in the low budget employee's theaters. Director James Goldstone gets terrified by hyperkinetic visual images and camera tricks, while editor Edward A. Biery goes wild with zigzag sections. Unfortunately, these fairly colorful tricks cannot cover the weaknesses of this updated plot and the actor is outrageously overwhelmed. Dillman exerts pressure to recall the events of the night, through dialogue like "Dream ... Dream ... Drugs". ... yes, drugs ... that SOUND ... watches ... help! "As a Cheshire Cat smile, Pat Hingle knew almost at Dillman's Grand Thesppi's Department, constantly giving everyone a child's call while he was like a middle-aged peacock and turning his mouth around in torment. Hope Lange's scholar / love interest is given to short strokes, but not until he screams at the indifferent lovers of Dillman: "What do I have to do to talk to the Ape Man? This is one frantic "Jigsaw"! * 1/2 from ****
