Randall "Memphis" Raines is a pensioner who is forced to return to "play" when his younger brother experiences death because he does not fulfill the order of the British offender Raymond Calitri. Work includes "lifting" 50 cars in 24 hours, or Calitri will impose its penalty. So Raines quickly gathers the team to which he trusts, and puts it to the task. But the police are with him and some of the cars on the list are not easy. It seems almost impossible to finish the job. <br /> <br /> It's completely cast - gone 60 seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan and Timothy Olyphant. All who deserve better. Porsche 998 Turbo has enough horsepower to move around. The problem is that there are a lot of cars that offer too many signs in the car park, many symbols, not enough fear. From the outside, we have no doubt that it is Bruckheimer's / Simpson's production, the harsh noise and cheese ties, scattergun editing, and Dominic Sena's haircut. It's essentially H.B. Halick's 1974 indie film with the same name as the potential of a car-based film with adrenaline. A potential that unfortunately never materializes. There are one or two high-impact moments, sure, but enjoyable. But if you gave the punishment, the film never gets out of the first move, it's more pleased than working with your characters trying to make a nervous scenario {Scott Rosenberg}. <br /> <br /> Car fans get something (cars are aces with eyes), as well as fans of unintentional comedy movies (see Ecclestone's Carpentry Moment). But no, it's really pretty bad. 4/10
