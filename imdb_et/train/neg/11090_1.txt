This movie looks like a TV. For years I was expecting a movie from Rubin Carter because I loved seeing her in the old MSG, and I was very disappointed to see this movie. I have a lot of respect for Mr Washington, but he was terrible and boring. There's really nothing to say about this movie except when I like this song.
