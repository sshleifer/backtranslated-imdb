Hayden Christianson and Jessica Alba are two of my least-favored actors of this century competing for what is probably a flatter attempt to make the already terrible Butterfly Effect. The awakening is so boring and totally uninteresting that you would be better off to sleep. Terrance Howard, who is still recovering from the miserable August Rush, creates a decent fight as a sadistic doctor who seems to be hell of killing Christianson, and I would be happy to help after viewing his presentation. <br /> <br /> Alba, which is recovering after a fantastic four Silver surfer rise. It is, of course, catastrophic and equally recorded as it always was. Only once has he ever been quite brilliant in the place that was safe for Captain Robert Rodriguez in Sin City. Perhaps it may be that Jessica alba is not as poor an actor as most will give her credit and that her ability to act is under a poor scenario. If so, it explains the awakening. What is a script that is ashamed of 9 plans from space. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba, Hayden Christenson and Terrence Howard starring for the first time director / screenwriter Joby Harold's nervous psychological thriller on a person experiencing a terrible surgical phenomenon called "aesthetic consciousness" where people at the operating table are aware of it what's going on around them, despite being completely paralyzed and unable to seek help. When a successful young man (Christenson) goes down with a knife and realizes that anesthesia hasn't done his job, the horror will start quickly if his anxious woman (Alba) is waiting for anxiety and a scary drama will appear in the operator. <br /> <br /> Hoping to make the Operational Tables that Final Destination made for airplanes, Director Joby Harold's first quest for blood frightness. The order of pre-credit tells us that one in 700 people suffers from anesthetic awareness, where the patient remains conscious during the operation, but paralyzes. One such unfortunate person is Clayton Beresford Jr. (Hayden Christensen), who finds himself awake during the heart transplant ... and he can feel every slice. <br /> <br /> Alternatively inventive, when he tries his torture to the psyche, waking up cannot inject true terror into his new prerequisites. The chilling of simplicity by an absurd conspiracy is hampered by the complicated turns of Christensen and Jessica Albas. You want to see a sedative before calming? <br /> <br /> VERDICT: Waking up is the most demanding one. Pull the punches that were undoubtedly better on the paper. As a film, though it is terribly general and highly derivative. The awakening does not give terror its new premise. The end result is really quite weak. Alba and the Christians are the least worried because the main mistake in the movies is that they can't scare their audience. Awakening is the film you most likely sleep.
