This time the hero of the first film has become human and this time uses the combinations of legs and feet for superuniverse soldiers and a computer that has gone astray and is ready to take over the world. I'm pretty sure it was the Double Team, who convinced everyone that Jean-Claude Van Damme was no longer credible to offer the follow-up activities. But that was what crushed his credibility forever. Although the Universal Warrior: Return is not as boring as Double Team or The Quest, it is still a terrible, but none of the original style and elegance or star tying. This sequel is simply made for children who enjoy professional wrestling. When I look back, even the action sequences were not so exciting, and that's why this movie is worthless. In other words, in the old Damme conveyor, another clunker. <br /> <br /> * 4 (bad)
