VERY GREEN MOVIE ........ And I mean VERY COUNTRY ... The matrix is ​​predictable and it's EALLY cheesy, the creativity of the battle and the dancing scenes of the time is the only reason I didn't give the film one, except that ... this is a def movie that you can afford not to watch ..... I feel the movie idea interesting one type of cliché while watching a movie. ..bing bins blah blah blah but i think it could have been at least a little better if it just wasn't so cheesy, very poorly portrayed from the idea to the screen, i guess. The plot is sometimes predictable at times when the dance I can say that at times is pretty good, break the dance battle, the twist was good ..... if u just pop the movie and watch the dance scenes and make up your dialogue maybe it might be 5 .. lol
