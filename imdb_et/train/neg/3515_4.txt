Basically, the latter is a typical propaganda film of a good war. But there were a couple of things that hit me. Oral epithelium was first used. In two cases, Scott's character can one, once in the beginning, when he falls off his bomb during a bomb bomb ("fraud") and once he attempts to bombard a pilot ("s *% t"). I could be mistaken for the second degree, but I repeated it several times and it looks like me. The third case is when Anne Shirley's character wants to say goodbye to O'Brien and good luck ("Give Hell") to the noise of the engines. He had to think it was too unpleasant because he clearly said "fucking." I also found an interesting character that has moral problems with bombing, especially by bombing civilians. The Avuncular boss assures him that only military targets will capture the accuracy of the used bomb strength. Considering what we know about LeMay's later strategy to forget the Japanese cities, this scene plays with little irony. I remember McNamara's quotation from LeMay in "The War of War", something that if the US did not win the conflict, it could be tried as a war criminal. The end has been filmed, in line with the film. It reminded me a little about the end of the White Heat (I do not compare the movies but the end!). Perhaps this is just the reason why he is breathtaking. Pulled up real good !!!
