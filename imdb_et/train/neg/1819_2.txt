I was looking for this movie for one reason - Al Adamson. He is one of the worst directors of all time - right there with Ed Wood, Jr and Ray Dennis Steckler and the terrible pantheon. But then I was disappointed because even though the film was really bad, it never reached the terrible level of some of its earlier films. That's why this movie wasn't particularly fun for us for bad movie fans. <br /> <br /> Now I was cautious of watching this movie because the title "Naughty Stewardess" makes the movie a pornographic movie - something I wouldn't look at at IMDb. However, this film seemed to be the time - especially in the first 10 minutes. But you might say that the script has undergone a lot of changes, because a lot of the movie is not at all titrating and at the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out where it is violent and certainly not sexy! This results in complete confusion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the many parts is good. For example, if it is a porn video, it shows surprisingly little AND it's incomprehensible why they put a 71-year-old man in some love scenes. Of course, Mr Livingston, a 71-year-old, seemed pretty good - but he was still an old man and no one wanted to get him with the young nymphs. Then when the last 20 minutes becomes very violent, when Livingston became a Rambo-like man! Talk about strange and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> In general, there is little to suggest this sad movie. It's not bad enough or sexy enough to take care and the movie will be quite boring even with a mad title like "Naughty Stewardesses".
