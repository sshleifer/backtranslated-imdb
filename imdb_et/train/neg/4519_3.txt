Three Stooges - Is Rocket, Will Travel - 1959 It was the first full-length movie that marked Stooges and is pretty bad. This makes THREE STYLE WORLD in DAZE (since 1963), which looks like a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Stooges have rocket spaces. They climb the rocket and go to Venus. They meet there a few things, including the lonely monk, which they call the "Uni" they bring back with the Earth. "Sleep" talks like an average, pleasant person - "Oh, hello. How are you? Lovely planet here. I hope you like it." Pleasant. <br /> <br /> Very few gags and so many scenes continue and continue. <br /> <br /> Space is coming back from the space and the movie is over, but no one said the picture for the filmmakers will continue another 10 minutes party where nothing happens, Stooges leaves the party and then the movie is almost over. <br /> <br /> High point of the movie - the end where Stooges sing a little song about their journey Larry and Curly Joe hit Moe The second lawyer mentioned the fine musical score. ‚ÄùThe only music I even noticed was two classical music - I take ROMANTICS and OLE WHO MANAGED, both are played at the party, and * it is really the highest point of the picture - music from old Columbia movies. <br /> <br /> The high-sexy blonde was nice. <br /> <br /> Awful - A brand new VHS video to save only 99 cents.
