First of all, I would like to say that I'm a Chris Rock fan. I like his other movies, but this movie is like my summary. The biggest Crap bag ever. In the beginning, Chris Rock is an ambitious comedian who will be on the stage with a comedy building called Apollo. While driving home, she has seen the woman she likes to ride a bicycle and is hit by a truck. A little later, he chooses the body of an old, white and selfish millionaire. Then she dresses up as a music group Outkast, trying to play the scene from the original where she leaves Jockey. Secondly, she goes back to Apollo and tries to be a comedian she tried to be in her previous body and started to scatter the white population and tries to be black. Do you get my drift? This movie is terrible because it tries too hard to be like the original and the process comes out like a bag. Just take my advice, don't even look at this movie.
