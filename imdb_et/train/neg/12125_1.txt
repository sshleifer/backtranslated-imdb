Why did people who didn't know what time was in the past felt the need to try to define this time? Replace Woodstock with civil war and Apollo moon-landing with Titanic sinking, and you have the same realistic flick as the formal soap opera, which is populated entirely by a low-life trash. Is this what the children who were too young to go to Woodstock and who couldn't do class teaching? "I'll show you these old thoughts, I'll put my movie out and prove that you don't need to know about your topic to still make money!" Yes, we already know it. One thing that looks at this movie was a small overview of the subclass thinking. The next time I see a bitch in a bar that looks like Diane Lane, I work the other way. It is child abuse that allows parents to raise children with no value. This is an abuse of the audience that just sticks to Woodstock and moonland, ipso facto means depicting a 1969 film.
