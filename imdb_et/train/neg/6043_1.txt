you have to see my comments on many movies under Evren Buyruki. I've made one more comment about the movie, which is not even worthy of talking. This film is basically two hours of drinking Dafoe character - almost literally - of death. The only surprise in this movie is that you didn't have enough clues or character training to be surprised. It was just a gloomy and sad waste of time. <br /> <br /> Willem Dafoe is a great actor. Peter Stormare is a great actor. But this movie was sucked. Slow does not make the movie bad, it was just bad. The sketched plot mixed with the artistic rambling of an anamorphic detail is not reasonably plotted uniformly, except to highlight some gore, illustrated by several perspectives, in the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as an amusement, he made me sleep. (Seriously I fell asleep and had to look at the film again - which was even more disappointing.) I generally do not want to make negative comments or comments about other works, even when they suck, but this film is justified. It is just too bad that these big actors were disgraced with its end result.
