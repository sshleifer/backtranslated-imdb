When I looked at this year's Wrestleman playing card, I was so forced and unable to control myself because I was full of excitement. > I'm sitting there, angry about hell, how much I wanted my money back. I mean, you look at Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) that goes into classics and then you expect the same and get the average garbage they have at any time. One moment in the show that destroyed it for me was when HBK used it !!!! Just this moment HBK loses JOHN PRICE !!!!!!!!!! John Cena is such a loser / poser. It shattered Wrestleman 22 for me when he beat TRIPLE H! I didn't see WWE after the 23rd Wrestleman. I'm gonna look at it again (luckily). I again believe in WWE after Wrestleman 24 (the biggest I've ever seen), which was pure classic Wrestleman. It is definitely for Mania 23 and also gave us many memorable moments. to me as a fan), DO NOT look at it and make the same mistake I made, and leave WWE behind. And if you look at it and you are angry, start looking at it again and look at Wrestlemania 24, it's classic.
