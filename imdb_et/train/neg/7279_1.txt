I saw this movie at a local television station (TV8 "Big Chuck and Little John" in Cleveland, Ohio). I had never heard of this movie and decided to watch it. <br /> <br /> I don't know any thesaurus, it can even help, describing how bad this movie really is. The script is terrible. Action, well as one of the two exceptions, is pointless because there is nothing in this material that deserves a real effort. <br /> <br /> It seems that there are a number of small ideas left in the different writing sessions to be thrown into the mixer. It's not just funny. The parody "parody" is at best tight. Some references that are almost obsolete (even when it was published). No wonder I've never heard of it, it's really bad, worse than Saturday night, MAD-TV, or even the vibrant color that has been put out in the worst days. <br /> <br /> When you see it on TV, it's a great example of how not to shoot. Whatever you do, DO NOT notice. <br /> <br /> Adam
