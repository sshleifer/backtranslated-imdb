In the 1930s, Warner Bros made a lot of potboys and most of them are fast paced, economical and very fun. I really love how the studio used the less glamorous elements of our everyday life. It's one of Warner's few hard melodrama that just doesn't work. Edward G. Robinson plays the ruthless editor of the newspaper, restoring the story of a 20-year-old murderer with tragic consequences. Robinson gives a lively result, but is surrounded by actors who do not cut mustard. H.B. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but the bad behavior of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell on the other is really a painful film. Starr is especially bad during the big dramatic scene at the end of the movie. In addition, the moral tone of the film seems ridiculously in the context of the Hollywood precursor. The direction of LeRoy is full of innovative visual touches, but it cannot overcome bad behavior and unintentionally funny situations. The work of the Sol Polito camera is strong. Somehow, this check received the best picture of the Oscar nomination (the year that gave us "M", "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
