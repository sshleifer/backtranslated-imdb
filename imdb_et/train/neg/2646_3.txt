If someone receives this type of film, it does not mean that it is very convenient to overdose this large over-the-counter medication, not to feel it. <br /> <br /> Jeanette MacDonald plays two roles: Anna / Brigitta, a woman who has ignored Nelson Eddy from the beginning, but who is - an angel sent to Earth. <br /> <br /> My reaction when I saw it was silent "Hunh?" Where did I see it before? It turns out I've seen it before, but in a movie that's much later than that. ANGEL'S DAY, an unforgettable foam made in 1987, made by one of Emmanuelle Bear's ethical beauty, who did not speak, also wore a blonde wig and made a living for hell soap actress Michael Knight. Much worse in every conceivable corner with the ultra-low 80's, but it is probably an updated version of the 1942 turkey. <br /> <br /> Anyway, not to work, this is not a memorable movie and information is there because it was the last time MacDonald and Eddy, who were not very good actors, but terrible singers, play together "innocent" and The "pure" novel they were known for. After that, you may need a cold shower, not because there are steamed scenes, but to get rid of memory.
