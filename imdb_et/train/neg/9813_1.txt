... and I've seen some bad things. <br /> <br /> I have nothing to say about this movie. Jennifer Tilly is acting poorly - presumably. Daryl Hannah does OK work, but there's nothing near this movie. The biggest mistake in this movie is that the plot is so weak - though based on a good premise - that the writer used the "stupid heroine trick" to create a meaningless break. If all Daryl Hannah had to hide it, she ran to her chaser. The hospital scene is absurd. I don't think it would be difficult for a bloody petite woman to be hospitalized without having noticed it. Lame. Very flat. <br /> <br /> Save yourself for a while and choose another flick.
