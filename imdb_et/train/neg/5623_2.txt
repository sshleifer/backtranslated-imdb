Hollywood's attempt to make Jack London's life a "Jack London" adventure movie is not a bad idea; he certainly led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life. However, this film slips flat and does not satisfy. Most importantly, it lacks integrity. Michael O'Shea (London) has some Londonesque calls; and it's nice to see that Jack, his beard, gets "Invitation" after spending some time alone in the snowy mountains with his dog "Buck". Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very beautiful. The film draws regrettable parallels between London's life and World War II, which are both tense and offensive. <br /> <br /> Jack London (11/24/43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo
