I am very open to foreign films and I think I understand what they are trying to achieve, although some things are lost in translation. But the simplicity and "intelligence" of this movie was boring. I've often wondered how interesting it would be to make a movie that simply shows a typical day or a period that really didn't make sense. Now that I saw such a movie, I don't think about these features anymore. There are tones of society, racism and some desire ... but South Park has it. And when I look at South Park, he moves me to know. The closest thing I felt during this movie was what I experienced in the first five minutes. I appreciate a typical movie of seven or more because I love most of every movie. I gave this movie one.
