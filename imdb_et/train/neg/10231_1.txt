Frankly, I am quite tempted that, on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to Steven Smith, I wasted my debut order for almost two hours. Have they written all his balms? Action floats along, music irritates and moves, the script is just terrible and actors (except the gardener) are at best mediocre. I think we should support the efforts of young filmmakers, but saying that it is great, if it does not definitely encourage him to make the same mistakes again, ie continue writing his script and using the same actors for another project. Yes, it's his first movie, low budget, etc. - I get it, but it's also where the public can buy and it's not just empty.
