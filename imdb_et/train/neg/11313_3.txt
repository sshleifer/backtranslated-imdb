and it doesn't help to bump into a couple of years later, when Syberberg came together and worked on the same topic (with little help from Wagner) for a surprisingly great job. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this movie didn't look as bad as the Siberian film does not compare what was probably even lower with volume and less resources. I can't recall at the moment whether the syberberg movie has horses. I know the German version is pure magic, while it looks like a college production documented for filming for film. <br /> <br /> music ... la musique ... not even credited here in IMDb ... but someone relied on it "12. - for the 14th century airs "or something ... it is not a great help for the film, it comes out as unfair and cheesy, comme le frommage mon cher !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! selling some special bicycle he invented. ... <br /> <br /> I despise to think about watching what I am watching on a video camera, as I remember, the last time I saw the movie in the theater was that the print was so bad that the experience was a 5-hour travesty, but even then it should exceed the offer of this version, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> Chutzpah, but ... this movie just needs more bou-coup. it doesn't look like a medieval manuscript that looks like CHEAPO! BON MARCHE !! oh and yeah, it ends very arbitrarily when Parsifal goes to church and this cheesy passionate game has intervened ... blah!
