The burnt direction leaves a decent but boring adaptation to a decent slant, where the dialogue seems rather cordial as well as cordial, and the spirits of the spirits of the spirits do not round up any awe or magic; Edward Woodward, like the ghost of Christmas holidays, throws around and seems to impress Bernard Cribbins. Like Scrooge, George C. Scott is too nervous and never really believes in what hinders his outcome. The scenes in which he has shown his past will have the same effect if he were in the heart of his family album. No one else seems to be struggling, except for Frank Finlay, who is chronically crossing.
