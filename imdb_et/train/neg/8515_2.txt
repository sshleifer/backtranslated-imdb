I was so disappointed with this show. After hearing and reading about it, how it was a "groundbreaking show" and all kinds of natural promises, as quality, I tried to look at it. <br /> <br /> What a drop! Operation was both forced and exaggerated. There was very little story. As for all the enthusiasm, "look at the lives of teenagers," I only saw an evil experiment with both reality and reality. <br /> <br /> Some think why there are so many negative comments about this show. The reason is that it is not really all that is good and drumming the quality of this exhibition just to attract attention to how bad it is.
