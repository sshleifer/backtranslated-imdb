Have you ever heard of a horror movie from Taiwan? Or any Taiwanese movie? Probably for a reason. It was really boring, even though he has black magic, including wilted baby bodies and people who explode from thousands of eels. <br /> <br /> Having read the thoughts of other people, I waited for violence and gore, but not much at all. Some blood bangs and other flat things, if you are expecting a graphic gore or any merciful impact, you are disappointed. They didn't use unique eels and other things for their maximum strength. <br /> <br /> There's not much good about this movie; one sign that was not entirely sharp and some OK black magical spells, such as eel. The plot was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. The fear aspect doesn't work at all, the most terrible thing was the albino girl (not so scary really). It's the worst Asian horror movie I've ever seen.
