If you are looking for eye candy, you can enjoy Sky Captain. Sky Captain is just a video game with live performers. Visials are nice and interesting to watch throughout the film. Now, saying that visuals are the only thing a good master good. I was hoping that this movie would improve, but it didn't get any interest. After thirty minutes, the desire to go out grew and grew. I now own over 2000 films and have probably seen five times more. But this is just another film I felt like going out of my life. <br /> <br /> Acting --- None. The three main speakers are pathetic. Jude Law (also in the second movie I wanted to walk on) is just terrible in the title. I'd rather sit through Ben Affleck Gigli when I look at the law again. The last article I read, said Paltrow is thinking about staying home rather than acting instead of mother. After this presentation, I welcome this decision. <br /> <br /> Story --- Sepia operas are better written. Sky Captain's story begins badly and gets worse all the time. <br /> <br /> Calling --- not. Everything was put into the special effects that the story, behavior and leadership suffer. Even "Phantom Menace" worked better and it doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> I should give "0" to this movie "10". Avoid paying theater prices and wait for the video to be released.
