What happens to the ITV drama. First of all, "Losing Gemma" is simply the worst television show I've seen over the years, and now "Perfect Parents" - the perfect ambush from start to finish. Anyone responsible for starting this journey should get a P45 there by special delivery. <br /> <br /> In most drama / thrillers, there is a requirement to stop a certain level to develop the plot line, but "Perfect Parents" took it to a new level, halting so many beliefs at the end of what I felt was me forced to wear "Magic mushrooms" truck load, it was like the scriptwriters had decided to try and create "Drama with numbers", which includes some serious problems - Religion, Education, Greed, Fear, Murder, Paedophillia's only problem was how big Eric Morecambe said the piano playing, "I play all the right notes, just not necessarily in the right order. For the boys in the next script, I suggest you read some script development books as" writing scripts for dummies ". <br /> <br /> Running a ridiculous script and lack of tension was the low key, not the guilt of the actors, because the upper limit was cast, but I suggest that everything in this unfortunate Drama parties should instruct their representatives the next time a postman tries to send a script from the ITV drama department, make sure the mailbox is firmly closed!
