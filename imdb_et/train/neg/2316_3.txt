After reading for many years how big this film was, how he founded Ruiz among French critics (especially the snobbish Cahiers crowd), when I finally looked back this year ago, I found it to be quite disappointing (but then I think my expectations were high). Saturated black-and-white, intentionally brainstorming (made for the TV and gracefully, for only an hour) is spoken in the form of a conversation between an art messenger and a screen narrator when they think through a series of paintings (shown in a table style) and try to find out if they have some clues in the hidden political offense. (A scary Kate Beckinsale movie Uncovered has a similar argument). Borgesees is a word I read a lot in the comments about this movie, but I would say that almost every Borges story is more interesting than this movie.
