I chose this movie alone, thinking I was on an adventure to the "Indiana Jones and Doom Temple" level. Unfortunately, I was for a virtual horror. Not as I had before. This horror was so great that I could hardly find anything high in this movie. Kate described amazing special effects. There were no. The film was so easy that even stereotypes were horribly depicted. This gives you the idea that you can solve problems related to violence. Good if you want to teach your children about it. I do not. Keep away from it. If you are looking for family experiences, you can find something that is more inspiring elsewhere.
