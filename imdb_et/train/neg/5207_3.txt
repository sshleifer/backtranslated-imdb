An anemic comedy-drama, an unhappy, seemingly rushed thing that includes Cher as a Woebegon housewife, who is slowly communicating with the striker who has been hired by her husband to kill her. Chazz Palminter, like a narrated hired weapon, adapted the scenario from its game, stagnant settings, and back and forth dialog, which quickly picks up with the eye and ear tires. Throughout the project, the air of darkness hangs and director Paul Mazursky does not get Cher from his eternal funk (he is hopeless). Despite all the high tech (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), "Faithful" is fraudulent, without the story and characters that rarely live. * 1/2 from ****
