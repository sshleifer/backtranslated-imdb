This movie is another budget that does not contain any budget, no effort, no video recordings of talented movies, and a slippery cover in the video store that offers unpleasant tenants. <br /> <br /> If you want to find out what this movie is like, take a video camera and some red food colors and film yourself and your friends around the clock by moving around and attacking people. Congratulations, you've just done "Living Dead"! Now see if the distribution company buys it from you. <br /> <br /> I've seen a small budget, filmed video that showed talent or at least effort from filmmakers and actors, but that's not. Avoid, if you are not a real masochist, or if they are fascinated by fear films.
