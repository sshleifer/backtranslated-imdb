Okay, the ads allowed comedy and people (few) went to see it. The first edition of 2006 is not a bad thing or for this year, because the first and last movie is mostly flop except GHAJINI and some more <br /> <br /> Okay for JAWANI DIWAN <br /> <br /> about Emran Hashmi, who does his usual things unfortunately because it repeats repeatedly. It is irritating Hrishita Bhat and floppy Celina Jaitley <br /> <br /> Intelligent dialogues, comedy scenes and badly treated drama, and lots of gaps <br /> <br /> Direction bad Emran Hashmi is annoying, luckily he is now ages, but post FOOTPATH ​​and MURDER and some decent work in some movies where his actor took the back and the leaders focused on his kisses and a female picture, which unfortunately lost the repetition after Hrishita and Celina's bad Mahesh is terrible
