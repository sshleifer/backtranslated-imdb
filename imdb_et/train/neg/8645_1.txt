I got this free screening back and this "Osama witch project" is the worst film I saw this year, worse than even "Catwoman" - who was happy at least fiction. "September Tapes" directs the "documentary journalists" "film crew" to Afghanistan - despite being thoroughly prepared for the trip, conditions and oh, their psychotic and ridiculous vendett. member of the filmmaker to get the death of his wife on September 11 - to follow Osama bin Laden. <br /> <br /> They "made" on their journey eight tapes, which now "document" their journey and, of course, their terrorist leader. (Eight tapes are fortunate enough to end all the important points in the narrative that are suitable for the "documentary".) <br /> <br /> Psychotic, idiotic protagonist - who is given long, important speeches that he probably learned by watching "MacGyver" - doesn't care about him his own life or the life of his innocent crew, as he gets them even more dangerous through a number of foolish failures. I don't know why he just didn't carry a sign behind him that said, "Shoot me." A team translator, supposedly their reasonable voice command, does a little more than whining and gets confused when the idiot's hero takes them to punishment. <br /> <br /> You want them to have brought their trip to invite them all to moore. <br /> <br /> "Tape 4" around, I started capturing terrorists. .
