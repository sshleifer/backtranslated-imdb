Users who have appreciated this movie so much cannot compare it sufficiently. Are they all brainwashed? I have rarely felt so frustrated about the film and some of it must be due to the ridiculous leap from this movie. <br /> <br /> In the first, BU is just a chase. We take it at the end of one chase and go straight to another. And the other. And the other. And the other. Do you see a pattern? There is no time to "waste" on the plot, character development, or boring old reality. <br /> <br /> If you don't see the other two Bourne movies, you're pretty missing. If you have - only WANT that you were lost - somewhere far from the cinema. <br /> <br /> The unpleasant style of Paul Greengrass worked exceptionally well in United 93, which was a desperation that happened desperately, but in Bourne and his infinite disruption is that it removes the audience from character. He runs. He jumps. He strikes. He's blown. He cleans high buildings. Yada yada yada. Above all - he is dying. She lives like a plastic Action Man survives, which makes only ridiculous stunts that she pulls even more and does not have any tension. So he drives the building? So what? He will survive. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There's a girl who mixes up because Bourne's love of interest died in the previous embodiment, but she's just an outfit. In Captain Scarlet episodes I have seen more character depth and understandable dialogue. <br /> <br /> The Bourne's own written outlook journey is boring and unformative and doesn't tell us anything we didn't know about the first movie. He became a killer machine. Great thing. He discovers his true identity. So what? It has no emotional resonance. <br /> <br /> The Twist ends with a telegraph and a weak one. Oh, dear, the more I think about this movie, the more I hate it! While writing this comment I have already reduced my score to 4! I'll finish better before the slide continues. <br /> <br /> I love the good momentum and I love a good thriller. There is no Bourne ultimatum. It is a picky, annoying line of flashy changes, ridiculous sound effects and comic strip violence. The idea that it "shows the way" for the Bond franchise is complete. Casino Royale blows it out of the water.
