If there were no immature light idiots, then I know I look at this "documentary" I would never have seen this comedy! This movie is full of bad scripts and ridiculous moments. Especially where the Afghan police / soldiers arrest Don Larson for filming the streets when they allow the operator to continue filming his arrest and then drive, still in the movies, probably his plush hotel. Then there is a scene where the car falls on another car that has been turned upside down and parked well on the side of the road without evidence that it is in a collision or explosion. <br /> <br /> I am surprised at the current rating (5.8 / 10). I thought IMDb users had more sense.
