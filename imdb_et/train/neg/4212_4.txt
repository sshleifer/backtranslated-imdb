The beginning of this movie is great with huge sound and some nice humor, but when the movie becomes an animation, it quickly loses its appeal. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons that was so, at least for me, was that much of the animation was too silenced, with too little contrast. It doesn't look good, at least in VHS. From time to time it breaks down and looks good, but not often too Characters come and go too fast. For example, I would have liked to have seen more of Mobi Dick. When the film begins to drag, it rises again with the dragon's entrance and then the film is strong. In general, it's not just enough to be memorable or able to compete with the big animated films of the last ten years.
