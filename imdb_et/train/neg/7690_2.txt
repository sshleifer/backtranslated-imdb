Anyone who gives this film a good overview must obviously be associated with its creation. This film is a painful breastfeeding. Action is rigid, the overall sound track of the stock is ridiculous, the direction is boring and strange, the teacher is not really that attractive (making the student's blatant advancements even more uncomfortable). The creative senses behind this trash should disperse and spread to avoid such a concentrated constraint. I am sure some African hungry children might have wasted money on this project. Hell, fonts would have seen a more enlightened goal that would promote crack addiction; at least someone would get out of it. Because it didn't give me a terminal illness, I'll give this movie two.
