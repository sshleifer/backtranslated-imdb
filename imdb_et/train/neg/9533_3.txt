The Prologue of the Text warns us that we should not allow evil to enter our home, but I think that the word "entropy" is more appropriate. Good sadness with these two babes! <br /> <br /> George (Seymour Cassell) is alone in his San Francisco office and his monstrously expensive home in Tiburon when his wife and child are away from San Diego. Two girls (Sondra Locke like Jackson and Colleen Camp as Donna) knock on her door asking for instructions. It's a rainfall and they trembled like two drenched evil cats and they're not sure about the address they're looking for, and what one thing and another is what George invites them to and get involved with his pizza fire. All three of them end up with George's bath and there are about five minutes of mostly undifferentiated nudity on double exposure, triple exposure, quadruple exposure, and dodecacoon exposure. They spend the night at 3pm and the next morning girls will have breakfast. But something has been somewhat relieved, because Georgie's guests are pulling everything down with their fingers and pouring the entire bed of ketchup and syrup, and - "You eat like animals!", George shouts and tells them. In his dreams. <br /> <br /> Now, don't get me wrong. Sondra Locke is an extraordinary young man, cobalt-blue eyes and Colleen Camp bounces like a superball. You have to say they push Tennessee in Shelbyville, where Locke comes from, and they brought with them body bodily rashes because we can't help but mark it in the first five or ten minutes. But if the girls wilt, then the film. The film is then flooded with a light green light. The couple put a ghost in the makeup and made themselves look in the mirrors. They give the boy a brain and then drown him to make sure. They rush to storm and break windows and furniture. They have one of those scenes where two people sit at each other, tie food and then jump on each other's bones. <br /> <br /> And Georgie? First of all, they change Georgie's subconscious (which does not contain anything you can't find in this little red bottle McIlhenyi Tabasco in your kitchen cabinet), bind him, pour him flour and milk, put him in a psychotic study, put him through one of these Tolstoy semi-executions , hit him, dress in extreme costumes, then tell him and his virtually destroyed upper class home, and send the delivery van ex machina. <br /> <br /> As for the actress, as if someone told Georgie: "First, act politely against these girls, then panic if you're stuck." And for the girls, "The first act is shy, you don't want to put anyone on, then act crazy." And that's it. <br /> <br /> Photography and location are porn movies from the 1970s. I'm not sure that this refers to a complete lack of skills. Efforts and talents are needed to change San Francisco's ugly. The result gives us two flair motifs. Georgie has some pop music with words about "freedom of being" and "giving". Jackson and Donna are a catchy rinky-tink thing called "My Good Old Dad". <br /> <br /> I appreciate the story for a moral lesson. There are some things you shouldn't just give, though they may seem fun at first. All very educational.
