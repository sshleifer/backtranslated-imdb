I want to say that this is bad, but I think it has led it. I've never thought much about Highlander (the same director), but that could be blamed in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for this. People get fired when they leave the trenches in front of him!? Such flaws, with an unclear schedule, strange battle tactics, right-cutting and bad visual effects make it one of the right-hand films. <br /> <br /> As so many others have commented, it's all American shit. The German general is afraid of his detained American private sector. Be prepared to swallow a lot of it, though in small doses. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's not a terrible but definitely right-wing war movie in every respect.
