A really creepy movie that continued to feel like I was in my 40th minute, or I can stand. Not the actor's guilt, but the writer / director, the producers, the financiers, etc., need to talk very hard. Maybe it thinks it's deep. This is not. There is nothing to say or add to the amount of people's understanding of this rape and extreme violence, unlike the central aspect of Clockwork Orange. It's not Straw Dogs I've seen. Rather, it seems that Pete Walker could have turned his hand, even saying that I am probably a little unfair on Pete Walker. <br /> <br /> Revenge is a powerful human desire, but the bedroom window has more to say about this and male emasculation than this pathetic effort. <br /> <br /> I don't think it's particularly misogynistic, just too gleeful in its portrayal of certain details - the blood runs down GA foot post rape, par for example. It is not complicated or contradictory, although I am sure that filmmakers consider themselves "very brave", just deeply unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Is it as high as we can? Is this the reason why the people wanted to make movies? (I wrote here a Latin sentence interpreted as Oh Times! Oh customs! But a new spell check in IMD doesn't let me post until I removed it. I also had to remove square brackets. Sorted IMDb.) <br /> <br /> Where is the ultimate aspiration? Superb impulse? Watch the British comedy comedy Ealing or Boulting Brothers; Carol Reed's work with Graham Greene on Idol, our man in Havana, or the sublime Third Man (a film that has much more to say than a thousand straight); The work of Powell and Pressburger; or if you want to talk about sex, violence and emasculation of men, check out The Offense Dir. From the original game of Sidney Lumet, John Hopkins, check out "Tunes of Glory", which is worth it. Unlike the above, unfortunately, straight lines are totally angry with celluloid.
