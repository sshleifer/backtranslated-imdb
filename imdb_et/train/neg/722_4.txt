One scene shows the "Terminator Woman" mentality pretty well: Karen Sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain camp. Karen runs over an armed guard who puts his gun on him, but after a few seconds he throws it away and challenges him. Karen hits him, asks for a gun and runs away! Then, when the film is directed by a martial artist and written by another member of his family, you know you shouldn't wait too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble get an amusing pill early and the film can be better if it is more focused on its love-hate relationship. But after about 20 minutes, the movie is subtracted and the film slows down, and even in a casual struggle to liven up things, there's no excitement. In the finals, there is a Trimble fight inside the Qissi cave, and Sheperd goes against womano-a-womano against Ashley Hayden on the speedboat, but the battles are mixed in a way that breaks their flow and reduces their value. On the positive side, the costume department is honored to give Karen the opportunity to show the outstanding cracking of the whole movie! (* 1/2)
