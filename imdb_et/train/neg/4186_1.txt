My comment has nothing to do with the political feelings in the film. In fact, they are quite similar to me. What happens to me is that it is stupid about the movie and there is no story, motive or dialogue. Perhaps someone should tell Neal that replacing the words of songs that do not inspire anyone who is not in a diminishing audience is not the same as the events created by a writer or director motivated to speak. Despite the iconic legacy of Neal Young, the silly narrative remains so. The most childish scene is where the devil dances to his bar, slides into the tonic's unsuspecting hero, who then finds a mouth on the dance floor, letting words in front of a young hero who doesn't know what's going on. Somehow those two dream of a scheme where they go to the west coast to look ????? Excuse me, Neal, paste with music and leave movies with Steven Stills.
