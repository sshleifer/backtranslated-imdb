Many people see it as classic, but I probably had to forget something. Life in Anarenes, Texas in the early 50s is pretty boring - that means the movie Anarene, Texas's life in the early 50's is pretty boring! What is it that so many people see it? When the last Anarene picture exhibition is closed, there is really nothing to do in the city. Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes this point at the end of the movie. However, even before it is closed, there is not much to do, so basically everyone is turning to sex. High school students make plans to lose their virginity - sometimes with one another and sometimes with the same adult city. You see, they don't have much to do - except to have sex (sometimes with each other and sometimes with boring teenagers) or with a local high school football team. Something happened three times that thought a drama was added to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but that's why nothing happens, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd), but that's why nothing happens, Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) robs a little girl, but nothing really happens because of that. The only thing that brought dramatic value to the film ended with the death of Billy (Sam Bottoms), which really shows the mercy of life in this pathetic small town, as men face the body where they go to breakfast. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovic filmed it in black and white, which is meant to assume that the gray city is, but the only thing I was interested in was an early look at actors such as the North, the Shepherd, Bridges and Randy Quaid. (Leaving aside, it was frightening to see how much Quaid - in 1971 - looks like his character in Cousin Eddie's National Lamp Vacation Films.) Classic? I do not believe it! 3/10
