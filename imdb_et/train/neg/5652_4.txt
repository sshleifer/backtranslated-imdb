It's not a bad movie ... but it's your girlfriend. The story is not bad .... only one and a half seems so long. I find it hard to throw this movie in the trash because I really like this idea, but it was just a long and thin story ... too bad. The main character never seems to change from beginning to end. I mean going through something "life changing" and he can barely smile. I thought Mac was very good. His strange quirkiness to keep the movie is a complete disaster. Maybe I just can't get this movie. If anyone can explain this to me, I would like to inform you.
