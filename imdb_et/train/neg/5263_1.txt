It's hands down to the worst movie I've ever seen. Everything was incredibly cliche and slowed down. Action was also terrible. The work of the camera was not bad, but it could not be redeemed. The writer / director of this film must suffer for the syndrome if he believes that this film will help his career. I want the hour and a half of my life back, which I wasted for watching this mess. I'd rather watch this grass growing video. I can't believe that IMDb makes me write 10 lines to post, but I feel this movie is so bad that I have to warn it with others. The reason for this film is that my girlfriend asked the local library that it was Kris Kristoferson's film, which was titled "Fads". I don't know who was guilty of the rubbish that came to the DVD player, but I feel that someone owes me at least $ 20 for his time, pain and suffering. In conclusion, the director / writer of this film hopes to know him once on the street.
