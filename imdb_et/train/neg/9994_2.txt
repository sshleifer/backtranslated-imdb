Hmmm, a sports team on an airplane blow, gets into the snow on a hill and faces a difficult decision to eat the meat of his dead companions to survive. Are you familiar with someone? I refer to "Alive" since 1993. Of course, the only big difference here is that a big, white, drunken scary by Yeti appears a few times to pull the dead away. I think people taste better than jackets. <br /> <br /> Stupid: The first scene doesn't have a firearm during the Yeti hunt, nor does it have any backups. <br /> <br /> Flight crash is completely fake. It would have exploded in the air, exploded when it hit the ground or extinguished. People wouldn't have survived, but hey, it's sci-fi. <br /> <br /> Stupid: They survived and they're cold. It may be a good idea to utilize nearby burns to not freeze. The fire is warm because it's ... <br /> <br /> WTF: The pilot is cold all the time he lives and speaks, but strangely no one else. <br /> <br /> Stupid: One of the boys tells others they are looking for matches and lighters, but there are scattered parts on the plane under fire. <br /> <br /> Fool: They find coats and hoods and there's still no Hoodies in the Himalayas! <br /> <br /> Stupid: They look at the lollipop when I repeat that there are pieces of the plane ALREADY BURNING. <br /> <br /> Stupid: Himalayan is known for its storms. It would be wise for them to collect debris to strengthen their structure, not to sit outside the grating. There are a lot of pine trees with excellent insulation. <br /> <br /> WTF: When in doubt, use a dead man's hand as a splint. <br /> <br /> WTF: If one man knows so much about the hibernation habits of squirrels, bears and leopards from the Himalayas, why doesn't he know enough to make shelters and traps right from the start? Stupid: When you try to catch wild animals, a meaningless conversation will always help near this trap. <br /> <br /> WTF: Do you know how difficult it would be to have a frozen body with glass?! <br /> <br /> WTF: The group was ready and armed to fight against Yeti, the other two were defenseless. Yeti broke the boy's heart and stabbed her head and the gang did nothing. So love is so. <br /> <br /> So two Yetis and a comfortable avalanche that bursts the evidence forever .... or we think. Mwuhahahaa! The story continues to be more idiotic, but it works the most in the last 15 minutes as usual. A nice way of thinking about the foot and the disk, though it's a bit of a resourcefulness (with a magically appearing disk) that they didn't have a movie at the beginning if they couldn't even fire, despite the fact that it was around them. br /> <br /> As typical for the Sci-Fi original, the loving couple can end up at the end, as they did not experience any terrible (not to mention that they ate human flesh and were not used to teeth for several days). <br /> <br /> But the end is a quote.
