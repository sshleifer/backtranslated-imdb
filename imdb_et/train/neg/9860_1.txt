I usually like such movies. It's a documentary, but the actor and writing are just terrible. The action is wood and rigid and writing is just such a clich√©, but not at all good. After writing this, I am surprised that it is in IMDb 5.2 / 10. I'm sure most of these voices have to come from the movie's relatives. I think if that is the case, you can draw a couple to laugh because it is always funny when the film of your relatives / friends takes place. I think it gives hope to all and future writers, directors, actors, etc., because if they do, you can do it. Although maybe you shouldn't.
