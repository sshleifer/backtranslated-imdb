Carlo Verdone managed to combine great comedy with smart and subtle social analysis and criticism. <br /> <br /> Then something happened, and he just turned into another moody leader. <br /> Il Mio Miglior Nemico can sum up one line of "working class = kind and warm, while the upper class = snob and devious. But love will eventually win". <br /> <br /> For such a smart driver, it's tricky. <br /> <br /> There's really nothing to talk about in the movie. Every character is a walking stereotype: a self-made person who forgets his roots, but who is "good" again, a scary woman, a rebellious abundant girl who falls on an honest but poor guy. barely average. <br /> <br /> There is serious disappointment in every aspect.
