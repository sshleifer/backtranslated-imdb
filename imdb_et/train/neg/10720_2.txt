I saw this movie last weekend and it's stupid and pointless. An ancient curse turns a man into a pajamas of pajamas? Victims are scared and they can't drive from a slow moving old man. They drop their torches and tremble instead of trying to prevent him or burn it. Quentini aka Honeymooners Mr. Fabersham is married to Diane Brewster alias Miss Canfield. Leave it to Beaver's fame, who's married unhappy. Wow, love. The rest of the majority will follow each other in the graves and expect the hairs to react and get their help. An Egyptian girl is not bad, but does not offer much to the film. Where is the Mummy? Really only the curse fired. It does not diminish the slightest torch of Universal Rubber films. Watch this movie if you need to sleep because you give it away.
