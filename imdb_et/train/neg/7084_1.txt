As many others have said, this is a terrible film in every aspect of film making. How they ever got the known name links for this project amazingly. <br /> <br /> Many people have complained about being made on 'cheap' camcorders. Yes, it was shot on the video, but not "cheap" video. It was bad at lighting, white balancing, shooting techniques and editing. <br /> <br /> There were so many different shooting and editing techniques that it was a mess of production. Tough, inconsistent lighting, manual shock use (area Woody Allen), dirty editing (second Allen technique), but badly done, with no real purpose. <br /> <br /> The lack of white balance in the restaurant's kitchen scenes is embarrassing; very hobby. <br /> <br /> The simulated sexual scene had no level of action. <br /> <br /> How has this video ever been printed, otherwise. It is worth looking at how surprised it is how bad it is.
