I think this director had something to say. Let's see what it could have been ... a. Frog storms would be horrible? b. can I tell Tom Cruise like a C-word many times and look like a bad Patrick Rafter? c. Create my wife and give her the word "F" every 2 seconds. It really liked the start and frog shape. The rest was relentless, too long (underestimated), redundant failure. Glad that many of you enjoyed it! <br /> <br />
