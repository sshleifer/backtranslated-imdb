It is pretty much a small budget made for a TV, a type of movie designed to lose the success of the original. I am a fan of b-movies and it could have been good if they didn't add the name "Cube" because, as it was, the original director and plot was better, and this movie almost destroyed the whole series's taste. The characters are annoying and clich√©s, problems with continuity and a number of direct production screws. The story cannot evolve and suffer as a result of unnecessary dialogue. They use more or less the same horrors throughout the film and over and over, and since the first was so good, it just turned out to be disappointing. <br /> <br /> If it was an independent b-movie, I would probably give about four. The "1" rating I gave was quite a statement about how it completely influenced effects and intelligence compared to the first.
