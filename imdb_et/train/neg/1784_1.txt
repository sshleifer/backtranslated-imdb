OK, I recorded it off the TV and stayed from the beginning. The movie was about ten seconds in headlines (I assume) so if something happened before, I didn't miss it either. Many people say that Mark Hammill is in it, I didn't see him. I knew Clive Barker, John Land, and obviously Stephen King, doing a terrible job as a graveyard sender. <br /> <br /> Even with opening titles, it is never very well described as what Sleepwalkers is or where they come from. Based on the order of the title, I assume that they are close to the cat's bipeds who live in human vitality. I assume they live for a long time and these 2 are probably the last ones of their kind. <br /> <br /> Add a very large dose of incest to it (yes! I thought it was a bit suspect), formatting, killer cats and invisibility, and you have Sleepwalkers. viewer explained. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
