I found out about this movie because there was a Jew from Ben Chaplin Game On. The game is a funny British sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break Hollywood and his movie star. He did not thank God. <br /> <br /> The film is a very simple romantic comedy where Janeane Garofalo plays an ugly woman who is using her neighbor Uma Thurman today to Ben Chaplin because she thinks Ben Chaplin doesn't like her because she's ugly. For so many reasons, the film is simply bad. The plot is incredibly predictable from publicly shining bits to serious breakpoints: just the assembly where all three of them are fun and then photos a bit. These two scenes made me worry! Janeane's character is maliciously arrogant (and guessing about her role as "comedienne" and arch-feminist in real life). He argues that the film is "feminist" when in fact it is just realistic. Men go more than a personality. His hypocrisy is also interesting. He had been a feminist and "comedienne" for years before taking this role, and then suddenly decided that the film was bad. I imagine that he hated the idea and script of this movie before it appeared, but he made sure he kept it quietly so he could pay for the traverse of this movie. I mean come! He was in heaven for heaven's sake! What this movie really was was an opponent of men. It depicts men as stupid animals whose brains are in their grooves, where men do stupid things to attract Uma Thurman's characters Noelle. <br /> <br /> There are other bad things about this movie, like the character of Ben Chaplin, a British man whom every American girl finds cute, and Jamie Foxx is Chaplin's symbolic black best friend and of course Foxx had to try and repeat his accent within a few weeks. Is it the best that script writers could come up with? Blimey, whom they've never done before, except for every film by Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore that was ever made. There's also a really terrible sex element in the phone that's just grotesque and proves to be cheap. Other comments here say how Janeane Garofalo is not ugly, but is actually beautiful. Erm watched the same movie as they were? He is definitely not an observer and the only good thing about this film was that he was cast correctly as ugly. Having said that, I don't see Uma Thurman's complaint either: he is harsh and odd. <br /> <br /> I guarantee three things about this movie if you have never watched it: <br /> <br /> You know what ends, <br /> <br /> The sex scene of your phone can be painfully embarrassing and; <br /> <br /> You will be bored after ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Look at your danger.
