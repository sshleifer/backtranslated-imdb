I hope everyone who guided these losers with their accents was fired. The only high points are some supportive characters, 3 of 5 favorites were killed by the end of the season (and one of them was a cat to put it in perspective). <br /> <br /> The whole story is focused on sex and nothing else. Sex with vampires, gay sex with vampires, gay sex with straight vampires, sex with vampire, sex after vampire blood drinking, sex with vampires, vampire sex, non-vampire sex, sex because we fear vampires Sex because we are angry with vampires, sex because we just became a vampire, etc. <br /> <br /> There would be nothing against sex, it would be nice if it were a bit thinner than it would have been in the stories. Maybe you have a story and then worship this sex. But they didn't even bother to do it ... and Anna Paquin is a dizzying salmon-tooth bitch. Whether he sucks or his character sucks, I can't figure out what. <br /> <br /> The second part of the story, which I think is very unlikely, is why the 150-year-old vampire Bill, who seems to be doing things together, would be interested in people like Sookie. He constantly drives him out of the handle he can't control. She leaves for two days and she already decides she "won't come back" and unexpectedly have feelings for the dogs? Leave me alone. She should be a 25-year-old woman, not a 14-year-old girl. His close people are dying all the time and he's got the brightest smile on his face because he just gave his V-card to some guy because he can't read his mind? As a story, I have hoped that the exhibition would do a little more to make her understandable and someone who invests your interests, not someone you secretly create, read or put into coma. I find nothing of my character that I like and even the fact that she can read her mind is impressively uninspiring and no less a bit interesting. come in June.
