Elvis has left the building and she is happy because she didn't have to look at this unpleasant stinker. Scene manager Joel Zwick's scene finds ways to make an unforgettable script even less amusing. This movie is full of dreamy deaths, amazing gays of character and cage jokes, this movie is desperate as fun. This is a film that gives hope that Kim Basinger will follow Doris Day for early retirement. Let's remember him as he was (talented) and not what he's got. David Leisure, delicious Dennis Richards, and the rest are gone. Zwick finds how to minimize his talent at every step. The man who plays Elvis sounds more than Gomer than the king. The only really good casting is a young girl who plays Basinger as a preteen. She looks like her and is really pretty good. The only other reason to watch this movie is to look for Tom Hanks home. It's not that funny, but at least not painful. You have to think about whether Zwick has accusing pictures of Hanks or something that would make him film.
