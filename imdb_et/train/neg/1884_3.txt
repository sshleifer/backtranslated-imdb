Fragmentary film about a couple of people in Austria during heat waves. Such a movie has been made more often and above all better. The stories do not really have anything to do with each other, except for the pathetic final: "people are cruel". Ugly meat, unpleasant people and a movie that goes too long without actually making it a point ... Ultra-realistic? Hardly ... boring? Indeed. Not even proud Franzisca Weiss will not save it! 3/10
