Denzel is the only thing that is right in this movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was a better film at an early stage. Someone decided to cut and draw some activities at the beginning of the movie, giving most of the story in about 5 minutes. The destruction that was built up at the pace and rhythm of the movies was before. <br /> <br /> So first it will mess you up and then it will put you out. Dramatization pushes beyond incredible stopping. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a feeling of great injustice and anger that such films can feed into viewers. In this case, this is what you are looking for ... tap it out.
