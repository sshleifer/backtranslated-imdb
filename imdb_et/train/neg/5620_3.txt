There is really no reason to look at it far, because some very prominent and prejudices are misleading. <br /> <br /> The perfect example is when the filmmaker claims "from Saul" or from Paul's Tarus (the Hebrew writer). He claims he has no idea that Jesus is or was a human being, this statement is either deliberately wrong when he accuses others of presenting, or he is aware of what the Bible says. investigate your misleading claim to the Hebrews 8.4; what he shows by quoting "If Jesus was on earth, he would not be a priest", then he puts here a ignorant and an unaware viewer to accept his false assumption .. why? He does what is most commonly called Bible believers, whom he accuses, the same. It takes things out of context. <br /> <br /> The verse of Hebrews 8 is; 1. "Now that we have spoken, this is the sum: We have a high priest set in the right hand of the Majesty 's throne in heaven. The above - mentioned context speaks of Jesus who was on earth and wanted to heaven after the alleged resurrection. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to get out of its context. Here he offers the foundation that "Paul did not know HUMAN about Jesus, but only one" heaven "<br /> <br /> follows? <br /> <br /> can see if the filmmaker is honest to the Hebrews 7: 14." For it is clear that our Lord went out of Judah; which tribe Moses did not speak of the priesthood. "<br /> <br /> heh, did the filmmaker just quote a Hebrew writer who tried to show that the writer of this book doesn't know about" Human Jesus "? Paul probably wasn't written for the Hebrews, but I'm not going here, but the filmmaker confirms Paul and this is a prerequisite for this point. <br /> <br /> This does not like the filmmaker does not make proper points in certain areas, but he does the same blind attitude he believes and if he treats these tactics he loses in my opinion, he chooses a very religious faith and the film is no longer a documentary, but a personal opinion and a filmmaker's incline, nothing more, no less.
