We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes. These and other friends and family members who have died in the attacks at the World Trade Center may film the coats of arms. Sweet, serious, although a language-related firefighter recalls what he can get for his lost colleagues, a supreme journalist who converts his fragments into horror. They think about the results. He's even worse, he writes another horror, and so on. <br /> <br /> The terrible events that caused the need for several thousand eulogies are overwhelmingly sad, but this bold dramatization is boringly boring.
