this movie is not rented. It has nothing to do with deaths, despite the (English) title. I don't think about a good thing about the film. Poor performance, poor editing, bad leadership ... a ridiculous "plot" and sound / music were so irritating, it's a miracle that this film has no warning sign. The only possible way to sit and enjoy this film is that it is of historical quality. They just don't make this movie worse.
