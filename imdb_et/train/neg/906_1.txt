Yes, this film makes me feel like a real horror when I realized that I paid for it and spent more than 1 hour of my life trying to see it. Kalju guy gives me the impression that I am a psycho - Junkie actor and girl is the worst actor I've ever seen. Believe me, when you appreciate your time to avoid this movie, I understand a movie that needs money and some movies don't have that money, but it's not justifiable for a foolish plot and bad action. I always support independent films if it deserves support, but such films make a bad name for such films. I'm still traumatized. I no longer trust a nice cover.
