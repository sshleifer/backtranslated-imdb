Surely this is the result of young thoughts, this piece can very well turn to the 20th crowd, who is still trying to find its place in the world while against every neurosis. But I can't imagine looking at a narcissistic navel, a trick of humor or a banal theme for anyone over the age of 30. Another problem is that the peripheral characters, for whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt, are built on such absurd cartoons that they are not relative in any real way. <br /> <br /> However, it is necessary to give some style points to filmmakers who have obviously grown in the video generation, and use all the imaginable editing tricks in the book to create a otherwise non-existent plot. Here are 2 points. First, beware of the gold of the festival. Secondly, while we live in the youtube era, everyone's counting on their daily lives does not deserve a big-screen treatment. However, these young filmmakers have the right to make their own movie, and if others find something they can detect, the better. However, at the end of this film, I could not think of how this last generation, right now, can bring so many challenges and complications to the real world. The age at which each child is always sure how special they are, and that they all deserve a 15-minute contact, is not endurance and the ability to cope with accidents, precisely the strength of this generation.
