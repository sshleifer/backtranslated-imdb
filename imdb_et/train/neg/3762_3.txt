I got this movie from Blockbuster on one of those shelves where you get like 5 movies for 20 bucks. I have to say I got the money for that. I had been waiting for a terrible dialogue, terrible monsters and shaking cameras. Well, as Meatloaf said, two of the three are not bad. <br /> <br /> Action is bad, though not as bad as some of the movies I've seen. Or maybe I've been watching so many low-budget movies recently when I've lost the perspective. There are some bits that are acting terribly terrible, but for the most part it is at least a high school level. <br /> <br /> Sasquatchi CG is probably the second worst part of this movie. The first thing I thought when I saw it (and I noticed another reviewer agreed with me) was that the person in the monkey boy would have been better. Clunky stop-motion animation would have seemed better. <br /> <br /> So you might ask why I call CG the second worst part. This is because the very worst part of the movie is sound effects. They are loud, tedious and constant. I've been camping, I know what insects sound in the woods at night, and while they may be loud, they are not as sad as the cacophony in this movie. Usually, when the "background" sounds out of the movie dialogue, this is a bad thing, but what I was catching on from the film's dialogue was not much lacking. <br /> <br /> Action was rare and boring. The tension was nonexistent, as was any empathy with the characters. Speaking of characters, they were all biscuits and smells. The only easy gripping game was ... actually, I don't think anything. There was a line or two that made me break a smile, but it was about it. <br /> <br /> Cinematic art was a decent, step or two above that you would normally see in such a movie. However, this "home movie" was still of high quality, which you can get in your pocket with movies and prayer. <br /> <br /> If you are like me and hit the budget of worship, you will see this dollar in the trash, think of it. Otherwise, disregard all costs.
