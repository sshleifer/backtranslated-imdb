Was it supposed to be a comedy or a serious drama? This movie starts with three women with ease. Good. It moves between women in conflict if one of them meets a man. Good. There are few contrasts between them. Good. But when the plot thickens and finally becomes black, I began to wonder if I had misinterpreted the first part of the film. It will continue in this water for a while until it finally tries to return to its original lightweight barrier. But it's too late now. It is hard to see why these women are still talking to each other and the final is not convincing. Really a lesson (for British filmmakers) how not to film. It's hard to see how the producers themselves are convinced that this film will work. And the box office proved that it was a real flop because I never heard of this movie this weekend (four years after its release).
