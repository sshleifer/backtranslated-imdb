I have to say I was disappointed with this movie. I've never been big BNL fans, I think their songs are childish and obsessive nostalgic (it's my 9th grade when I had a million dollars, a shoe box, etc.). But I've seen my live show clips and I really like the improvisational and buggy nature of the show. I was hoping that this film would highlight what is unfortunately the most interesting part of the show, because their music is well played but somehow blissful and not so convincing (in the middle there is a standup bassole that was totally meaningless and boring despite how much Jim Creegan himself digs). The film does not show and shows only a few minutes of it (and you know they have had better moments, like the Koffee Anan concert in Afghanistan, he's the responsible man, my name is Steve Paige and I'm really big) <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As I went to Europe a few years ago, I heard the "Blue" song "Effeil 99" or every two minutes I came back to Canada and then a month later this song was all over again *, I almost chewed my hand. BNL is that many years ago I remember many Canadian memories to sit around the campfire, listening to people playing "If I Have A Million Dollars". BNL was a cult phenomenon in Canada and a great deal of their humor is particularly inclined to him (Kraft Dinner is the key here for many students, and the name "Gordon" is basically Canada). vague and I was somewhat grateful. Then suddenly they become huge in countries and all the people there think they are this new band (yes, they are brand new, but they are all in their 30s!), While the rest of Canada goes "Oh I thought they boys folded years ago, do I have to listen to the "million dollars" again? "<br /> <br /> Concert film is not bad, but I would have liked to see my stage more routine, shooting is not as big and things like for example, their big free show in Boston, has been glazed too fast. Interviews are surprisingly boring for such funny guys, I think they're all old and have families and houses and things and they've got a little down. There are times when they are going to spinal tap the type of material in which they deliver the body of a satire, then they break the laughs and giggles of this type of ruins on it. Interviews with Moses Znaimer (Canadian media release) and Terry David Mulligan (music guy) are very intent on getting in the Tap area inadvertently. <br /> <br /> This movie really does not document very much, I mean it is basically one exhibition and at the beginning of the movie they are already big and they have a huge tourism environment, they don't like it when we see that they rise from vagueness and "surprise" "which is popular, it is a methodically planned event, so in the end it is a rather inanimate, semi-live concert, half-documentary and not much. <br /> <br />
