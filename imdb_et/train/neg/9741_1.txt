(Spoilers) One truly memorable part of this otherwise rather boring and dull British kitchen is the Steiner henna rinse, which is one of the worst color jobs. This and excellent Caterpillar eyebrows an old evil guy who tried to steal Steiner's invention. MST3K does an amazing job of making a dull bored and funny movie. Especially like Crow killing Mike's "touch of death" and when he revives him in the theater, Mike shouts "Guys, I died, I saw eternal truth and beauty! Oh, this movie ..." It would be a hope for retrospect to come back to see the rest of the designed man. The film could give a fortune to sell sleep aide. Some of the punches in the movie were evil: police inspector - "electric shock!" Crow- "shocking, isn't it?" police inspector - "It's LOwe, all right" Tom Servo- "Very Low, Right Under The Floor!" police inspector - "Can I go ahead?" Tom Servo - "He's dead, but knock yourself out" MST3K is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer.
