I can't believe some people really like it. Yet they call themselves Batman fans. Even going so far as to say it's better than a BTAS. What it is not. It should be plagiarism to use Batman's name for this barrel. It's not Batman. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for the show is '' if you can't get hit so someone can help you with a bigger weapon. '' Batman isn't all about weapons. He uses his batarang and harassing hook and Batmobile. He won't come out with a new brilliant tech every time he can't hit anyone. I don't know where the fuck they got from the Batbot idea. or whatever. They've ruined all the villains. Mr. Freeze has gone from a sympathetic scientist to a small criminal offense that fell on some cryophers. Catwoman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman with a foolish costume. Penguin is now a ninja with a 50 ft long hat. Ventriloquist is now called Scarface, which makes Dummy the center of all character. They even got a foolish idea to make him giant! wtf? and the two worst character changes are The Joker and Riddler. they have turned Riddler into a gothic / retro teen freak. and The Joker Acrobat with Fears. She looks like Bob Marley wannabe. they have totally and completely destroyed batman even when the b & r did! I wish I could meet the creators of this exhibition and / or the writers and animators so I can put them down with a baseball bat.
