The end of the badly finished season that started so well ... <br /> <br /> Exodus Part 2 and other significant episodes were one of the best examples of television in every series, where it was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Well I am not sure if it was an episode that was disappointing, but the guitar music that accompanied the closing sequence was ridiculous and would have been more in the original series. <br /> <br /> Its almost as if the execs of the company did not like the low key note and wanted to jazz it up. They failed and rather corrupted everything. <br /> <br /> We hope this is not a trend for the future. <br /> <br /> At least we saw the return of a certain person even when somewhat odd and tritely made.
