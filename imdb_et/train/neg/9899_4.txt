Necessarily ridiculous film version of the literary classic "Moby Dick". John Barrymore is Captain Ahab, who falls in love with pastor's daughter Joan Bennett. His brother, Derek, is a rival of affection for Mrs Bennett. If Mr Barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident, Bennett pushes him. He must kill the whale and win Bennett ... <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that might have been thrilled by the 1930s theater audience; especially scenes related to the loss of Barrymore. The film is not well outdated; there have been many better films since then, both in the 1920s and in the 1930s. Two names of sight, John Barrymore and Joan Bennett are not their best. <br /> <br /> Moby Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
