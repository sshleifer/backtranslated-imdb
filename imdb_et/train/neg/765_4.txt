Seriously, what did they mean? Over the years, the Columbo series has tried some new things and deviated from the usual successful formula, but this movie is really superfluous. This movie is basically very different from all other Columbo movies, but the differences are not good for the film. <br /> <br /> The main thing that, of course, makes this movie different from other Columbo movies is that it hasn't been murdered. The whole premise of this movie is completely different and puts Columbo's character in a completely different environment and situation. The general is also completely different and "modernized". It also makes it a strange choice that she chose this to control the movie. <br /> <br /> Columbo's character also feels quite different, perhaps because he is placed in a completely different environment and situation when he helps his nephew after his bride disappears immediately after the wedding. The lack of a good remedy and the humor of the Columbo brand does not reflect this accurately or pleasantly. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the movie will not get too bad, but the movie will start to change and more ridiculous stories than its story as it progresses. It is such a stupid written robber-thriller whose story begins to become more and more unlikely. It also makes the film increasingly invisible. This is a very small interesting Columbo item that doesn't really know how to attract your viewers in any way. <br /> <br /> It also doesn't help the supporting actors not the most talented people. Despite the fact that his character is in such a completely different situation and the film has been made in such a different style, Peter Falk is still good and his presence still captures the film. Do you just imagine how this film would have been without him? It would have been a very bad and ridiculous cheap movie that I can tell you. <br /> <br /> A strange Columbo entry that could be described as a failed experiment to deviate from the usual formula. <br /> <br /> 4/10
