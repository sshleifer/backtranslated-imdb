First of all, I'm white, so I'm gonna try to race racing ... anyway ... White people hate black people = BAD, but black people hate white people = OK (because we probably deserve it !!). where to start? I wish I had something good to say about the scene of the unwanted comedy about this movie: the infamous scene was Ice Cube and co. Fight for some really big, really strong, really angry and frightening looks and win !!! neo-Nazis, where twice the size :) and chase! chasing is invaluable ... It's not a film of race, tolerance, and understanding, it doesn't ... it's a racist film that reaffirms all the clich√© stereotypes, the white spiritual man at his disposal, the black roommate automatically turns into skinhead ... just scary if I ever see it. <br /> <br /> Save your time and terrible experience from a poorly written, poorly-acting, boring, and clearly biased picture when you are on a theme, go and Rent American History X, now it's a movie
