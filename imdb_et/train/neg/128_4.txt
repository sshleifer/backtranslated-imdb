This film, if it is sensational to its forward-looking politics and images of free love and sexual liberation, has simply diminished over time with curiosity. It now seems absurd for governments to ban and confiscate a small film in many countries. Given that Sweden became socialist, its policy seems to be "radicalism" if it was controversial, naive, and almost four years later almost universal. And its sexual scenes, which are simultaneously the subject of sensational darkness experiments, are quite dark in the modern context. Nevertheless, the film and the accompanying documentary films, which describe its many contradictions and effects, are still very traceable as an early relic of the 60's youth rebellion. One part of the film that still holds up: his self-awareness of the fourth wall. The filmmakers film every time they film. Its satirical playfulness still leads to a woman.
