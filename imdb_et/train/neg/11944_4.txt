I rented this movie, I thought it was a weird sad version of 1959, which I saw as a child. It wasn't. That's why I was very disappointed with what I felt like marginalization, bad character development, and above all, not emphasizing the relationship between the boy and his dog. In this version ... the "Flanders dog" for the movie is just a cute "bypass". Get the 1959 version!
