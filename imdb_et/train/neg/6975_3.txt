Oh god, what is an idiotic movie! Incredibly cheap with fake special effects (the creature is played by one guy in a flat costume) and stupid. All dialogues are incredibly bad and those actors (HA! HA! HA!) ... they're just ridiculous. For example, I have never seen such annoying signs like this junk (these foolish children or pregnant woman with husband and much more). Together, this is great entertainment when you are drunk. Avoid this I am drunk? I don't think so ...
