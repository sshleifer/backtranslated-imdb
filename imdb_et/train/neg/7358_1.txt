This lifestyle-style film takes the victim of a middle-aged divorce, who then fights with the genre for new, multi-minded absurd depths. <br /> <br /> Here's a former successful spouse of a 40 successful lawyer protagonist (Daughter away from college), starting a new life after divorce, helping a female college friend open a new clothing store as a sort of franchise expansion deal. He has even started his attractive, slightly younger, landscape architect / gardener (who is black) with friendship. But then, the horror of the horrors of medieval women, NOT a woman she took as a tenant to allow room to take over her life. <br /> <br /> What this new younger woman is threatening to flirt with a gardener and offer her a glass of wine that * seemed * really famous for divorce! He runs up on utility bills, leaving the thermostat down! And back up the toilet! cold and fridge! And his (African) artwork hangs in the living room! And so he's killed by the cat. Yeah, okay, to what extent this thing is bad enough, but it's more than a little ridiculous, especially if it turns into a campaign. The reality of the character is that no small part of it would lead this particularly ridiculous woman crazy. (Why did he rent a room and horror horror), a much younger woman?) <br /> <br /> An allegedly naughty younger woman is more likely to be in control of mania. And our brave 40 must learn to fight against this evil (and, of course, with an erotic hot look) 20. But that's the problem. Every time he's about to do something he's using his POWER - and just flirting or having sex with some boy and escaping from the consequences. (Well, there is actually such a capacity for a good look 20 times. It's just not used * generally in this way.) <br /> <br /> The house is moved by device 20 that separates the divorce to formalize your room for rent, is written by him. Of course, 40 of them don't know anything and 20 have been helpful. The lease gives the younger woman an equal right to the whole house during the lease, with utilities being thrown at a fixed price. Although the evacuation procedure is about to be completed, 20 things will soon get a temporary detention order for the older woman because she has threatened 20 people. You know, the judge is sympathetic to all the afflictions of sexy young people. Finally, the "heroic" fight for the house begins with 40 houses. Woopie !! <br /> <br /> The only realistic or imaginative thing about this movie is how terribly simple TROs (or defenses) are more than just an unreasonable saying for women - though they are generally just that easy for people. They are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to use home control as here. Indeed, girlfriends with girlfriends can often displace them from their homes or from Condos, without any evidence, but only unsubstantiated allegations of threats and sometimes even without listening to them. Even when a hearing has taken place, it is routinely impossible to refute the threats (if proved negative) if the burden of proof is actually on the accused, not on the accuser. (This is one of the only areas of American law where this is true - and it is a signal of feminist overpopulation and the inability of any organized group to resist the steam roll.) Of course, this is probably not any Life film in this life. <br /> <br /> The absurd assumption of this film is based on the explanation that nothing is psychotic and does not take his medicine. Even that doesn't make sense. She is not a former spouse after a successful lawyer, although she does her (husband's rage) in her quest. He is after the HOUSE (technically, he leaves the divorce during the rental period). This other younger woman is after the divorce after she is left, after things are with 20 other STOLE her husband !! (The former spouse seems to be intermittent and basically promising after her fling - it doesn't matter, she's still dusk !!!) <br /> <br /> The main character is good enough to look for her age. But his perspectives, attitudes and focus are so small, frumpy, and completely without imagination or vitality that he cannot care for. Well, the main group of lifelong fans will take care of, I think the average score gave this small number of wheelers. (I just looked at it because it was so bad and it was a comic that he had a camp complaint. I couldn't see how far they took it.) <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** (if any command is possible). Well, here's a clue. The film ends with 20, which released the prisoner, allowing "listen" to her 20 something male workers and sometimes a lover and "do everything she says" and "let her take care of her" she continues to take the medicine) - and then beat her and returns to HOUSE. There he climbs a staircase with a knife, demonically pursuing his noble 40, which is in a candlelight bath, sure that the younger woman is out of her life. There's a fight - and 40 something mom wins - sticking to 20 something with a hypodermic needle that is full of antipsychotic medicine she found. Then he will worship him, as mother and two women are bound, the moment of women's solidarity! How cute.
