It seems that Salvatores was unable to decide what to do with this film: some of them are very weak thrillers (and I say very, very weak), some of them are attempts to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both things have been tried on psychological thrillers, but in this case, the film cannot keep things together because of poor, superficial scripting, bad behavior and too dark, too faded cinematography. I would say that Salvatores did his best for other genres and other devices where he could watch the characters freely without thinking about the ticket. In general, B-film, hardly worth the money ... Vote: 4/10
