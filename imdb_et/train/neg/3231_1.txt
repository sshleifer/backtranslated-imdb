There are many people in this movie who say it is always the most cruel. After I have just looked at it, I can say that it does not meet these claims. <br /> <br /> The movie's idea is really demented. In general, performance was not worthy at all. Even the last scene (eyeball thing) is not really disgusting. I was expecting something mad, instead it was of a lower quality than the movie that was featured on films like the extremely low budget Violent Sh! T. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to see a real movie is frustrated because there is no story there (although most people will certainly know it). Gore fans are disappointed because, contrary to faith, there is little and far between blood and blood. Not to mention the actors playing the victim may be one of the worst in history. <br /> <br /> Regardless of what people say, this film is not so shocking, it just sucks. Avoid it.
