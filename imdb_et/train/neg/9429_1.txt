I bought this movie from the $ 5 CD used and I regret it. I'll start by saying that I'm a big cheese requirement. They offer terribly sticky cheap entertainment. This movie was amusing in the first semester because it was so bad to make it fun in the MST3K style. Then it got bored. <br /> <br /> Action is a more frightening part of the movie. Although no major action is expected, it was ridiculously bad and, frankly, all the entertainment that was supposed to be. This is the plus side of the movie. When a movie really entertains entertainment, it is writing, lighting and editing. <br /> <br /> This movie gives too much "What is% $ @ # going on?" a moment. There are a lot of moments, like a strange fit for a mother's dinner, and it doesn't have any consequences in the film. Next to dinner, everyone who was responsible decided to watch people eat refined food within five minutes without dialogue with each meal. During food and other inappropriate moments, the scene cuts out pure darkness. Then he cuts back. And speaking out of the darkness, one of the most fun parts of the film is the climate, which is probably not at night when it rains. When talking about darkness, the big problem with the movie is that it is so ill-lit that you don't see what's going on for half the time, which is more disappointing than anything. In one of the climatic scenes, you can't even say what you should see as being so shocking. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to climatic conditions, Unhinged has one of the worst. I've seen people say "Wow, it surprised me and that's good." I can tell you that the great revelation surprises me because I didn't see it come. The reason I didn't see it was that it didn't make any sense. I will not destroy it for you, but I'll tell you that my friend and I spent twenty minutes in different parts of the movie to find something that would have confirmed it, and all we found was more of a thing to say it was not possible. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is actually better when you look at it with comment lines that entertain it. I love crap horror movies, but it was too much.
