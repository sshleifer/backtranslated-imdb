I want to know more about this movie when I rented it. I put it in order by Heather Graham and his strong religion (IMHO). While some of the film was charming, much of the film felt lively, undeveloped, or otherwise simply boring or predictable. Not to mention so many people who think the chips were couples, the ICK factor. I don't care how big a part of the story is, it still felt a bit gross. And Charlie, for the zoologist, probably doesn't seem to be very similar to the other Homo sapiene signals. What was about him (besides his heat and some common interests) that made Gray him? The story could have been a little more deeply so interesting. High points - Molly Shannon (although I agree with the reviewer who sometimes found it annoying), the dropping cup and the dance series (if Sam & Gray were such big dancers, I'd like to see more because the bits we showed were indeed better than most of the others movie). Could be better.
