This is not just my assessment of this movie, but also a big part of what's written about it. Now don't get me wrong here, I'm not a complete Philistine, I didn't fret about the movie because it wasn't enough like "Police Academy 9" or whatever, I like more than my fair share of high eyebrows I swear. <br /> <br /> "Magnolia" is bad, and I'm honestly mysterious about why it was so recognized. Long, complicated, self-conscious, silly from the beginning of the nonsense to the end, there is so little that could be believed to be what people so love about the film. There are some highly qualified participants who are fair enough, and none of them will change in the middle or worse. In addition, my wife (self-recognized Tom Cruise hate) tells me that her career is the best. But the plot is so completely disconnected, tangled between the stories of several loosely tied characters, that even when depicting important life-changing events, they seem so pointless and uninteresting that you find yourself shouting that someone could blow or something new <br /> <br> /> It doesn't help that no characters are very easy to identify or empathy (well I didn't think, but I don't like most people). They all play their endless life stories for a very long time, showing their characteristic mistakes and emotions in increasingly complex details and playing their deep and meaningful relationships. Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack is also terrible because of the bone marrow's irritating quality, which I thought was unique to Alanis Morisette's music so far. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was enjoyable for about three hours. Repeat the "Friends" episode repeatedly, while the frustrated navel is slightly broken into the ribs. The frogs are good.
