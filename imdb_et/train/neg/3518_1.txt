I saw this movie with my climbing teacher and found the whole thing so ridiculous that it would be unfortunate. (One, when Stallone himself climbs freely, does not need any move, but I think those hanging carabiners will see sorta mountaineering, so throw them in. For those lobbied to people who think Colorado looks like the Italian Dolomites (where the movie was filmed), Hollywood moguls have got a lot more ridiculous and unpleasant smell.
