God, what a terrible thing! Oliver Stone had probably wanted to experiment or something (see the terrible use of music and pictures here), but what really? The thing behind the "naturally born killers" seems to be a "smart" look at how the media can become a complete garbage, but unfortunately this film becomes a garbage can. Please, Mr Stone, the next time you want to criticize the television show fascism using violence to get high prices, avoid doing the same thing with your movie! Michael Haneke quite cleverly said in this film that he condemned media fascism with fascist cinematographic modes. How true ... Only he forgot to tell us about the massive headache that you get after all this nonsense!
