I feel like I was just looking at a snuff .... beautifully worked, tight, tempting and terrible! Two hours of perversion of perversion in the most common and all-encompassing meaning of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, decapitation, incest, corruption, living, burial and abuse, abuse. There is no redemption. And I was entertained. I couldn't look. What it says about me, the people who make and operate such a thing, and the world that has become so unknown, that ultimately are real sniffing movies. And I'm not puritanic or humorous, I'm not trying to hide the presence of darkness, and I have certainly not guided my life, but I am ashamed of myself. AND I am sorry that my British relatives are dragging the sewer of the object as my own tribe does. It doesn't have to be cozy, but does it have to lurk in the rain?
