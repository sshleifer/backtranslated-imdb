As an enthusiastic fan of George McDonald Fraser's Flashman books, I looked enormously to see Flashy on the big screen when I first released the movie. Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment - so I left it 20 years ago before I look back, but it wasn't the second time. Mr. Fraser is a hugely skilled writer, but I am not a fan of his film scenario with Richard Lester. Stylish impact resistance broke the "Three Musketeers" for me and the same is true here. For me, the whole film's tone and feeling is wrong. Some of Flashman's books are amazingly funny, but they are adventure novels. Flashman's adventures are very serious - after all, he's involved with dangerous situations. It is transmitted in novels, but it is not transmitted to the film at all because of its comic style. It is a tremendous shame because it can have a big movie if it is a more accurate adaptation of the book's style. When I first read that the book should be filmed, the article said the film was Oliver Reed's star. I rejoiced, like Reed, to me as Flashman's uprising. How would I have loved seeing her in this role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor but does not match the Flashman visual image created by the books (too bad looking! Flashman should be a big strap holder). Neverheless Reed was great as Bismarck. What kills the film is that it is made in comedy. The only scene where it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene where Flashman kills Gautet (Tom Bell). Great shame, because production values, costumes, kits, etc. are excellent and casting is generally excellent - almost all filmmakers are well-off from Malcolm McDowell. It was possible that the management of the film was responsible for the management of the film, as the adaptation of the recently made radio to "Froner Freedom", adapted by Mr Fraser, worked quite well. Maybe one day we can see Flashman making it right on the screen.
