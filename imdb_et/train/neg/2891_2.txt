I'll start this review during a break when I watch a movie. This is the first time I have tried it, but I have trouble getting it through without occasional breaks. It is not because it is intense, but because it is bad. <br /> <br /> It is almost painfully annoying and unbelievable, especially when the inherently strong dying brother Ryan (Colm Feore) is on the screen tragic and fucking, self-conscious and self-indemnifying. It would have been a much better film if they simply excluded the character of this character. Maybe someone decided that if they couldn't believe Ryan, they would just make him terrible. The problem is: Who cares if the spoiled, whining, unpleasant jerk dies? Not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing this sign is for him is that he dies and apologizes, but that's not enough. Death doesn't make anyone special. We're all dying sooner or later. It does not give anyone the right to expect sympathy when acting like a jerk. <br /> <br /> The other two characters and their acting actors (David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah) would be much more interesting, and their story, without Ryan's own unfortunate interruptions, would have made a much better movie. But it's not over yet, and it's time to play PLAY again. Maybe something big happens before the end ... <br /> <br /> No. Sorry. This hired turkey is back today!
