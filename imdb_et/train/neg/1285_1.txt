I was born, raised, and educated in Scotland, I was terrible for the disgusting person who was no more than a cattle farmer. Worse still, the entire movie thread was sexual in one form or another, indirectly or orally. To see this, one might think that in the 18th century Scotland there were a number of sexual perverts and homosexuals. Lange was a joke who was a "young" mother at the age of 49, but Liam Neeson was even worse! Taking a "bath" for a Scottish castle is not common when he depicted him - but it gave them another opportunity to show how we have acted sexually. Save your money and see Pinnochio.
