It's a low budget Roger Corman's horror / creature flick. DinoCroc is created when prehistoric genes are handled amok. The engineering facility first kills its own and gets the taste of the human being and becomes a rapidly growing terror after flight. No symbol has any depth, but then it is not the center point. We're just looking at a big two-foot dinosaur offspring and some of the best "kill" scenes with a small budget movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is of a moral character, trying to use a three-legged dog to feed and start eating. There was nothing left on the mule, but the ankle legs. Without real outstanding roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. Most pathetic are Matt Borlenghi and the unpleasant professional croc hunter Costas Mandylor. I was most impressed by the enchanting Joanna Pacula because of the respectfully frightened dr. P. DINOCROC redeems as a pickle.
