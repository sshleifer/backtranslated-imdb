Flat, clicked superhero action movie. I had great hopes for this movie and the genre of HK friend's creators is what I don't despise, but I rarely see both the loyalty and the ridiculous as it was. It would have been forgiving because it is always in such films when it unfortunately compensates not. The action bears the surreal character of the trademark and the top character of HK's activities, but it is not very inclusive, obscenely gory and, in fact, often completely inconsistent (perhaps due to American editing, it shows in many places). I was very disappointed.
