There are many beautiful women in this flick. But unfortunately this film is nude. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one. <br /> <br /> Ahem. One story in this film takes place in 1971. Then why hell are the main characters of Kia Sportage? Hi? Continuity, anyone? <br /> <br /> As you know, this movie appeared on stereoscopic 3D. And this is the toughest effect I've ever seen. I'm not sure if anyone put it to work, but there was no 3D, but a double blurred vision. I had no problem with other 3D movies from this company, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Of course, 3D also swallowed in them, but with them I saw the similarity of the 3D effect. <br /> <br /> This thing is not a big ball. <br /> <br /> And who also women who played the ear-eating disorder daughter, yum! I'd like to see her more. Also in the movies. Janet Margolin seems to be young. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
