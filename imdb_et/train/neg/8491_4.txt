In spite of the sometimes original touches, such as "virtual kits" that give the background to the Victorian interior of Ada Lovelac and her circle, this film is short and ultimately disappears. The newcomer Francesca Faridany seems talented, but is wasted as Emmy, who has been reduced in the middle of the film to more than just looking at a monitor that looks at Lady Ada's autobiography. "Storage Ada" takes a short look when Lady Ada (Tilda Swinton) appears; The camera captures its facial expressions, exhortations, even if it seems to be transparent or for a moment unseen, discovering scenes to dramatize Emmy's "virtual" rendering. <br /> <br /> Ada Lovelace's simple biopsies would be worth the film, but unfortunately this film makes both Lady Ada's life and today's computer scientist (and her broad-based, doltish boyfriend).
