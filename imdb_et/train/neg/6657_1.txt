I really hate this slow motion, it sucks! great time and I think it is offensive to fairy tales (if you believe in fairies); I mean, the people who came up with this kind of mess should look into your head? and there is also a lot of madness (the evil schoolteacher I think it is really aging) and also the stupidity (the boy's parents and the fairy tale) in this show - two things I argued and what is high in the world (especially stupidity). <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, this exhibition is both f ***** annoying and should not be seen by the teasing eyes of ALL (it would die). !
