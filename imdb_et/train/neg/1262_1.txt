This film has a weak scheme, weak character and very weak special effects, which I doubt I lost my valuable life by looking at it. It has random characters that do not add a story and seem to be an excuse for the director to get in her girlfriend's movie. Robots are sad and the main "hero" bot is turned on by a large knife switch. If this film wasn't so bad, it would be ridiculous, but it is not funny. The main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters and he is killed. It's sad when you get angry with your roots because it's the best. When all is said and done, this film was better on the floor of the cutting room or never funded.
