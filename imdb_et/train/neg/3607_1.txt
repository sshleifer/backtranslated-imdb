I'll start with this overview of the big movie. Don't read on ... come here, avoid your eyes! Here, the main heroine, a girl who always lives in other films, is murdered. Then I saved you 79 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> This is one of those cheap films that was thrown in the mid-80s. Despite killing the heroine, it is just a poor quality junk. <br /> <br /> Both the priests and the students will get bad rape here. They are portrayed as excessive sociopathic mores with too many internal problems to deal with the life of younger college universities ... and college students are getting even worse. <br /> <br /> "Splatter University" is just a gunk to put on your video recorder if you have nothing better to do, even though I recommend looking at your head cleaning tape, which would be more entertaining. <br /> <br /> It is rated (R) for strong physical violence, gore, misery, very short female nudity and sexual references. <br /> <br />
