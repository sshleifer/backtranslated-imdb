It was the WORST movie I've ever seen! Molly (molly gray) couldn't work ALL! he had no emotions because it was all blah blah as he read the boring textbook. The clever boy and the child who loved food (the names didn't like to remember) were so annoying to get me crazy. Mollys Dad didn't show enough feelings about his daughter's absence. The policeman and Mollys's father said the same thing four times. it was just terrible. Everything was repeated a lot. Beatrice should have done something wrong with her to be so meaningful. I just spent a moment in my life watching this movie!
