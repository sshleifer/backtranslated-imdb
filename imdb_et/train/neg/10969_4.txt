Maybe I'm out of date or just wondering what Electra is in current publications ... But Electra, which I read, was much more manipulative and always seems to be a plan. He usually used others to do his dirty work and more often it was a double cross. Just when you think it's all thought he's pulling the wool over his eyes and going his way. <br /> <br /> This film was relatively weak in the dialogue, the operation was not particularly convincing and the action was spotty. I was looking for Frank Miller's book "Electra Assassin." What is much darker in this film. <br /> <br /> A special effect from time to time was interesting, but more often than not the story or graph was slow or illogical. Tha Hand wasn't dangerous enough and Electra wasn't enough ... She's a girl you love to hate ... but in that story I didn't care.
