Currently, this movie is listed in IMDb as the 42-year-old worst film that has just rented NetFlix. However, I am sad to say that although the film is bad, it is not where it is bad enough to be in the 100th film ever made. I have personally seen at least 100 films inferior. Hardly a glowing attachment, but it just did not match that infamous list of horrible levels. <br /> <br /> The film starts with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew in her late honeymoon (otherwise they are married in real life). He is a doctor who has bats and confirms that they are going to a nearby cave. When they go there, they behave very, very, very foolishly (a feature of a bad movie) and soon a bat. According to this movie, bats love people to attack and there are vampire pills in the US - both are not at all true. <br /> <br /> Strange, after biting, barely man even goes to hospital! The first thing about someone's mind (especially a doctor) is to get immediate medical attention, but not that. Soon he will have seizures - but he is not interested in seeking help! Again and again, you think this must be the stupid couple in the history of the film !! After a while he finally goes to the doctor and is sent to the hospital. But by this time it is too late and his attacks will become more violent and will kill people to suck their blood. If it is all obvious that a man is a crazy killing, a woman (who, like her husband, has a grapefruit for the brain) refuses to believe that he is dangerous - even after the attack of people steals the ambulance and runs the police car off the road !! <br /> <br /> Today, Moss goes through these episodes, his eyes rolling and looking like a normal person. Strangely enough, he develops a pair of bat-shaped hands a few times and finally used some nice prosthesis to make him a bat. If it were really exciting, the movie would have become valuable. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the husband, who had no idea at all, turned into an inexplicably mad bat and had bats killing evil sheriffs. How it all was organized was a mystery, as Moss and McAndrew believed that this film somehow contributed to their career - though they both had a relatively long career in television bits since 1974. <br /> <br /> Overall, very stupid. The plot is silly and doesn't make sense and is firmly based on people being too stupid to be real. Not a good movie at all, but not one of the worst films of all time. <br /> <br /> NOTE. For some reason, IMDb shows three sets of DVDs for which IT'S ALIVE is, and this is a two-order BATH HOME website. Although BAT-HUMANS are seen as "It's alive", these two films are not at all involved. The mistake is easy to understand - especially since they both came out in 1974, but the movie I just watched was starred by Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew and the second was starring John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.
