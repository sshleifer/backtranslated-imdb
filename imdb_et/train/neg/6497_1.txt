I really had great hopes of getting into this movie, so I took what was given to the salt blade and hoped for the best. Approximately 1/3 of the way through the movie that I just had to give up is just the movie mish-mash of stuff happens for no apparent reason and it's all open. I love movies that think of you, but this movie was just a bunch of ideas that were put together and never really connected. elsewhere than in some trippy visual plan. Saying that it's artistic to hide the fact that the visible plot or story isn't just or justifiably the reason why you wasted 1.5 hours in the movie. Operation was good, but it does not save the story. I agree with a comment posted earlier ... "It's like the head of another person ... when they are on drugs," in other words, it makes no sense.
