I decided to look at it because it is an Oscar candidate this year. I think so many people here I really wanted to like this movie, but I was bored and disappointed. The first scene was OK, but the rest of the movie "shaking hands" in camera mode is really annoying. <br /> <br /> I think this is the main reason for making such a movie and naming it an Oscar: <br /> <br /> The American "military machine" (the people who make money for war) urgently need an excuse for the Iraq war or justification by blocking something (sort of) of patriotism. <br /> <br /> Why "heroic" director and protagonist aspirations for the audience _inspire_ the idea of ​​"loving-war-like-medicine"? .. Oh, please, come on! what bears! <br /> <br /> See this to get an idea of ​​how low a academy can fall ...
