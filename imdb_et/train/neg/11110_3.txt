I would like to know that I often don't rate movies below 5. I was originally very excited to see this movie. Its numerous trailer bundles on television for several months made me REAALLY see this movie. So, the second night, when I saw it was available on FearNet's Demand, I got some popcorns and sat down to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The story seemed intriguing - some guys are uncut. subway. A photographer has become a missing person. Where are they going? What's going on with them? One day, the photographer sees some of the photos he has taken and fits in with the butcher, following him, yada yada. The film had a chance to suck even though the plot was predictable. "Oh no, it's dark, look behind you," I say, pretty boring cheap thrills. <br /> <br /> The plot, although predictable, was intriguing ... it's up to the end. "It was good until the end .... Then it just got silly," says Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. And I totally agree. And here comes the spoilers ... <br /> <br /> Look, I was hoping it was a crazy killer, some psychotic person who was guilty of cannibalism. No. It was a secret society that kept creatures alive for centuries. Woo. How the original. Unrealistic. How boring. <br /> <br /> 3/10 Come to Lionsgate. You've had amazing movies, but it's sunk.
