This movie was not very entertaining, certainly NOT as original or as good as a Christmas story. The characters (except the youngest) try to emulate the previous participants and they fail. The mountainous neighbors are coming out because they were not part of the first movie. It was really marvelous, it could have been the original, then again, not because the story is so weak. Skip it.
