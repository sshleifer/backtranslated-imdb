Am I wrong, or is the 2007 version just hanging up on the original? I have to ask, because just bought a DVD is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ..... bad behavior, poor editing, etc. money buying this mess. It's nothing more than a light porn movie ... no real gore, scary pictures, just cheap garbage. If somebody wants to see a great movie with no name links, some slippery gors and a decent story ... get a Baby Blood ... also for a cheap budget, but well done ... and a real story! a waste of money, but I just keep laughing ... it's pathetic! New Comment .... September 3 ..... I keep this movie forever just because it's SOOOOO bad, it's almost good .... in a very bad way .... the worst ever works ... a real crap-movie classic!
