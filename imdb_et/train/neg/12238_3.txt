Potential concept and it was fun to see these two holiday tones together, but ... <br /> <br /> Rudolph's glowing nose didn't require the "explanation" offered in this movie - like The Force in Star Wars movies don't need "in the cyclone of mediclans "explanation. But mostly the film left me cold because Winterbolt was too complicated to destroy Santa. He is able to make suggestions in people's minds, so why does he make things on such a roundabout? Rudolph nose magic crushing, Rudolph design, threatening Frosty family to melt ... Comyically exaggerated plots Pinky and Brain and "Phineas and Ferb" dr. It looks simple and straightforward compared to Winterbolt, which we are expected to take somewhat seriously. <br /> <br /> It's a particularly (and amusing) strange moment when a character throws his two weapons at a bad boy like boomerangs. I understand if they don't want the weapons to fall under the family picture, but why are the weapons in the first place?
