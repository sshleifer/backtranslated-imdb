I was so nasty about this movie, I felt obliged to warn others. This film has no story, no plot, no expediency. The film begins with the usual introduction of "let be scary", which is now used by every filmmaker. So we can completely ignore it from the beginning. Soon we will introduce the main actor and from that moment it turns out that you have just lost your hard earned money and it would be better to look static. (If you have not seen white noise - EEK) By acting DISGRACE and all of them should return to the traveling pantomime they came from. Having said that, even the best actors in the world would be in a hurry to make this movie remotely. Their bad performance contributes to the disaster. Unnatural violence and what I can only assume is another word written by the jeted "eccentric" writer who will probably consider himself an artist, resulting in a film that tests your patience. Only when my guard turned to me and said, "We've been watching it for 45 minutes," I realized that this film was as thin and tasteless as a tea bag without a tea bag. Obviously there was something missing and unfortunately it wasn't the audience. Instead of suggesting what a film is missing, let me tell you what it has: Dumb Blonde (surprise surprise), victims, bad-monster-dude-thing, about 2 minutes story stretched for hours, days, weeks, for months ... and credit. <br /> <br /> Do you want a silver lining? Well, the blonde girl is a bit bright looking for some scenes, but hopes she wants to see her face hanging on the rest of the movie!
