so I found this documentary strange and really pointless. I know it got prizes and things, but I didn't enjoy it too much. there was no humor or drama to keep you interested, but a bunch of wierdos and their jobs. some people are quite different, which is not a bad thing, it just didn't leave me impressed. I had this movie very boring, my creative writing teacher did not blame. The whole movie circus theme was cool, but I didn't get it, and robotic and lion taming is definitely not my thing. the green animal thing was clean, I really liked many colorful flowers in the garden, but how did these four jobs combine? it just didn't mean to me why someone is making a movie about it. But if you have such things, you can enjoy it. who i have to keep my way. I only warn you of possible suffering.
