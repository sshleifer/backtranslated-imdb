I read somewhere that, when Kay Francis refused to pay the bill, Warner Bros decided for the rest of his contract for his worse projects. He decided to take the money. But his career was suffering accordingly. <br /> <br /> This may explain what he did in Comet Over Broadway. (Although this does not explain why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter are in it.) "Sloppy" is the word that others have used on this film plot, and that is exactly the target. Slaughter trial. His gentle vaudeville career. His success in London. His last scene with his daughter. No part logically creates the next part. <br /> <br /> The kits and costumes also showed B-movie things. And her hair! Turner shows many movies this month. Look at any of you and do it yourself.
