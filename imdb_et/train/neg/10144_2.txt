As Steven Segal goes to the movie, it is at the bottom of the barrel. His best was just to feed the adolescents. It hints at the weights, then falls off. The characters are all cardboard. The story is double flat. I can't ruin it when I tell you the end. You already know how all Steven Segal's films will end when you see it. Here goes. He is a super-dooper government agent who knows too much to disassemble it so they decide not to kill him to die his brain until he remembers squatting. He escapes, of course, gets arrested and is with his old general who needs his one million people to get back the hidden plane that is surprised by a fraudulent air force pilot in the Afghan terrorist attack. , surprise, Segal trained. All heroes, with the exception of Segal's character and his dark girlfriend, die heroically and Steve-Baby rescues the whole world from swelling or falling. What ever. Made with Air Force and Navy Excess Film. And many boom booms. Get some Popeye cartoons.
