Let me say otherwise: balls. Or how to bollo * see It's really terrible, more embarrassing than the ones he's trying to satirize. Julia Roberts is a qualified actor and usually has the highest level of work. This film is not the direction that it can even feel. Usually she is a perfect professional, but I swear she had signs of confusion and despair. <br /> <br /> One of the things that could have saved this move was the idea of ​​making the film a secret documentary about actors (Chris Walken). Unfortunately, this issue was not explored with full potential. Too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was wooden, Cusack was Cusack and Crystal should act. Two talented ex-Buffy stars had different experiences - green hopelessly misused and Balfour unused. Well done to Julia for not being the worst film ever.
