Why? !! It was a terrifying, unobtrusive and embarrassing film. Embarrassment comes from the city where they did it ... Pittsburgh PA! Why did they let these people do such a movie? <br /> <br /> When this movie was originally released ... it was more romantic comedy ... and no ROBO anything. It all changed with Disney's coolness. WHY ???? They made this terrible interpretation of this classic comic character. Matthew Broderick's eyesight did not interest his films either. Sheesh!
