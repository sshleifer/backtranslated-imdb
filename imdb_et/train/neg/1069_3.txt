I saw this movie at AFI Dallas Festival. Most of the audience, including my wife, enjoyed this comedy drama, but I didn't. He celebrates Lucas Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kissed, The Five Senses, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, Art School Confidential). Director is Matt Bissonnette, married to Molly Parker. All three participants in this film do a good job with 3 friends, their two marriages and infidelity, which includes the third. Everything is done in a lake house and it looks wonderful. The film wants to treat his subject as a comedy and then as a drama, and I thought it should be the opposite.
