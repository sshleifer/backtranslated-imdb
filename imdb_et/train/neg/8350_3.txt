I just came back to "El Otro" who played here in Buenos Aires and I have to say I was very disappointed. The movie is moving very slowly (can't get me wrong, I enjoy slow moving movies!), Slow until your mad ride. All you hear is Julio Chavez breathing heavily on the film. It's a badly made movie, but more importantly, it's a movie without inspiration, I didn't know anything about the story or its characters. <br /> <br /> "El Otro" was made just for making a movie ... forgetting. I suggest you pass it on if you want to see good Argentine movies, look for Sorin's movies.
