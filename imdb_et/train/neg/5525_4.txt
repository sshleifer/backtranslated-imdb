The problem with family drama is that, outside TV movies like lifetime channels, most people do not want to watch them. And those who are being monitored tend to be sensational and current (or recent) news or problems about the news. Movies that explain or study the condition of a person are not popular. Especially for the young crowd who is Miss Lohan's fan base or a younger crowd that tends to make movies not only popular but financially successful in the studio. <br /> <br /> The specific problems associated with this film are some of the testimonials in the cartoon. It was a little much to blame all of Lohan's character images (car crushing, drug use, etc.) on what his father did to him. While this is not unlikely, it is just a bit to wait for the audience to swallow. In addition, all these aspects, such as giving him to young Morman boys, were not oral, or that he would actually be a good assistant to the vet, who accidentally happens to have something for his mother, etc. this movie really helps. It made the comedy element of this situation, which tried one of its "special dramatic episodes", then made it a fully realized, well-written feature film. <br /> <br /> Watching a DVD and listening to a comment, especially for the various alternates, is really a sharp focus.
