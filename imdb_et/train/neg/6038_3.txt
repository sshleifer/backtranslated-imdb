I had no expectations other than 90 minutes of entertainment, and that was exactly what I was. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is campy, of course, some dialogues were not perfect, of course, "special effects" were a bit of a hockey. That's why I enjoyed the movie so much. It fits perfectly into this 70's Horror-classic genre. <br /> <br /> Talent must start in some places where it takes place for the participants and the team, and what better material to sharpen your skills is this. <br /> <br /> I look forward to another movie from these producers and leaders.
