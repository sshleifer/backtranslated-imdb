Why do they require a change to big movies like "High Noon", "From Here to Eternity" and so on? <br /> <br /> Why do they think the color is more binding to the viewer than harsh black and white? <br /> <br /> Why did Robert insist on wearing this butterfly, a broad baseball hat? ... it made him look like Jim Varney. <br /> <br /> Why does anyone spend four hours suffering through this? <br /> <br /> See the original. Then you don't have to ask yourself why.
