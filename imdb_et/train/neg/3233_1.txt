C'mon people, you can't be a serious, second sniffing case, if it's absolutely not! It's not even far from scary or frightening or scary - it's just a terrible amateur video editing done for the next party to put on girls. <br /> <br /> Gore is incredibly bad, even an eye - it is far from me that I would like to tuck it, but just put me in the camera and hit these guys over the head. The girl just puts on a rubber surface, doesn't move at all. It would have been funny to use a real doll instead. <br /> <br /> One season "I'm a celebrity, go here!" is more scary than this. Don't waste your time or money.
