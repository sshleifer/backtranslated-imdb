Like "First Blood", it is trying to think about the treatment of Vietnamese veterinarians, but there is not really much time for monotonous fire, burns, burns, torture and explosions, when Rambo, the impossibly indestructible, takes over half of Asia's troops, Vietnamese soldiers, most Russian armies , different vehicles and everything else he can bring a rocket launcher. The only woman who is in the middle of all these boys' toys will soon have broken up, allowing testosterone to reach a dangerous level and degenerate one after the other by loud noises. Jerry Goldsmith, who carefully controls some of the hackneyed musical tips, carefully checks all of the Russian rat-a-tat cliche chinese ching-chong just if we don't understand who we're looking at. Stallon has a head brain; this empty crap is under him.
