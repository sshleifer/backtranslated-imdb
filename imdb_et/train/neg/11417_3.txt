The youth group "St. Elmo's Fire" who just graduated from college hardly seems to be able to do it through high school for much less than four years at any renowned university. Mostly these children are irresponsible, selfish, greedy and stupid, but co-author and director Joel Schumacher seems to be touching them for the generation. In today's outdated "up and coming" pain, there is a backdrop that sounds awfully like the "Endearment" conditions, and in writing, which gives us the mystery of this circle, the "fire" of the bad joke, one of it gets even more embarrassing when years go by. * 1/2 from ****
