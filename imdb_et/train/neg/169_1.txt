I saw this movie recently because a friend brought it to her from NYC. After 30 minutes, I told him, "You have fun. Is this a joke?" He thought it was good. I told her I thought it was probably one of the most captivating films ever made. "What was it supposed to be?" I asked. "Children's Propaganda Movie?" The plot is stupid. Action is the worst for most directors and, frankly, people who look at such fear and think it is related to life, love, or even life that it offers an incredible idiotic view ... need some psychiatric help. Please, if someone tries to hold you on a DVD or video player, keep it like a virus on your computer ... it won't destroy your player, but it will destroy your evening. If they had done Razzies in the 40s, it would have won in each category. (PS. It also questions "Stairway to Heaven.")
