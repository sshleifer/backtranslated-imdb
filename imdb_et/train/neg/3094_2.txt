**** SMALL SPOILERS *** As a bad film owner, I had to watch hundreds of bad movies and still "Hobgoblins" differ from everyone else in their unique way. Classical baddies like "The Creeping Terror", "The Mighty Gorga" and "Manos" are equally bad from start to finish. "Hobgoblins" on the other hand are starting to get bad and getting worse. When I first saw the famous rake fight scene, I thought it was a really bad film. I was blissfully aware that I had just seen the best that this movie offered. The film takes its most massive nasal celluloid during the hell of a failed "Club Scum" sequence, which is another sequence of unique jokes after another. It is with this one film that director Rick Sloane proves that he deserves to be mentioned with Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as the worst leaders of all time. How bad is a bad movie? See "Hobgoblins" and wonder more.
