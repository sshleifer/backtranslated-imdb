I admit I didn't give this film a lot of opportunity. I decided quite early that it wasn't just my movie. <br /> <br /> For the most part, it is excellent in cinematography. The Manhattan scenes of the early 1970s are very good, as is the actor. It is very crisp black and white, which can make the film almost unchanged and fresh. But some of the other methods that filmmakers use to shoot this outlook all hell. Difficult editing is very late between the 60s, somewhere between surrealism and the new wave. The story also seems to come from a very specific time, somewhere between the idealism of free love and artistic experimentation. <br /> <br /> The film is followed by a young city looking for a city when he is looking for a man with an anonymous phone to have sex. As he meets other odd characters, he discovers his church and exposes his own. The film seems to be considered an external, failed comedy, but it adds an avant-garde. I hope that if you like Andy Warhol's movies, you would be very pleased to discover the phonebook. <br /> <br /> Some of the problems I had: At the end of the movie, does one character say it lasts more than twelve minutes? There is also a very clear animation sequence, which I found to be a big and a minor, which acts as the climax of the film. I laughed out loud four or five times and I liked this ending (minus flat nasty animation). And when the film changed color, I liked how it was even better. It was one of those experiences where I felt that I really liked it if it were a little different. But that's what the filmmakers gave us. It's unclear, artistic, and the way to the left, but none of them have any reason to suggest it. I didn't find it unique or creative, both forced and pretentious.
