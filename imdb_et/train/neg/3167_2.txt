Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd) and his bossy fiancé Kate (Eva Longoria) are looking at the last-minute arrangement for their reception. This is the morning of their weddings and Kate is madness, giving catering companies a comprehensive demand for their food. But the horror of horrors, the "angel" ordered by Kate arrives without wings. In the next fight with the sculptor, the heavy "ice" falls on the girl Kate and sends her here. Now, one year later, Henry's sister organizes that the psychologist would have told young veterinarians that Kate would have wanted her to start getting to know other women and moving on. Yet Henry himself is interested in the beautiful media, Ashley (Lake Bell), much of his catering partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate, on the other hand, returns to Ashley for death because she has no intention of getting another woman to Henry. Is it possible to do something to get Kate back to heaven? This is a silly romantic comedy, one of the worst dedicated fans. No, it's not cast because they're trying to play games. Longoria is beautiful and funny, because the frightening fiancé and Bell are a style and humor that is also contagious. Also Biggs, funny, is completely wasted. The very talented performer Rudd (see Anchorman, Knocked Up or Clueless, please) is trying hardest and actually this is the main reason to see this clown. His charm, appearance and light spirit will endure the film. But nothing gets an arbitrary script and a terrible direction to win, nothing. So, if you are a dyed-in-the-villa fan of romantic comedy, think long and hard before you start over for that money. Even free tickets to the laptop were warned that this movie is a deadly experience for those who love love and laugh at the cinema.
