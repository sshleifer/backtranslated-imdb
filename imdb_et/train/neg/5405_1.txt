I got this turkey film and I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br /> By acting - although many have been in other films, it is clear that they had to work hard to make the film, which is accidentally allowed to slip to some extent, to function so badly throughout this time. <br /> <br /> Capacity - generosity I can say that the screenwriter originally started with the plot, but did his best to ignore it. The plot broke faster than the Chinese knocker computer. <br /> <br /> Scrip - now that was the abomination of nature. it did not pass any rhyme or reason. most of the character lines were inevitably admirable. The script worked hard to make no sign memorable. I've watched other movies where the extras were more interesting and memorable. <br /> <br /> Special Effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! They were short buses special <br /> <br /> Control - until you get your driving ability copied into your favorite style, otherwise you will only make such failures. <br /> <br /> It's good to know that your friends / family have given you 10 stars for this movie
