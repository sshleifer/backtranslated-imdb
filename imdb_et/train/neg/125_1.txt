Only avoid this type of movie in the future. This movie is interesting as an experiment, but it doesn't talk about promising stories. <br /> <br /> You may feel that it is virtuous, because it touches so many important questions, but it does so without a noticeable motive. The viewer does not come out of the new perspectives (if no one speaks at the same time as he speaks because it always works during this pointless movie). <br /> <br /> Maybe you can spend your time watching a window growing on a tree. <br /> <br />
