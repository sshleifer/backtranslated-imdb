Although production and the direction of Jerry Jameson are definite improvements, "Airport '77" is not much better than "Airport 1975": slippery, commercial rubbish downstream (this time literally) decent cast. Jack Lemmon is a pilot pilot pilot that is hijacked by art thieves and falls into the sea (the whole public claimed it was near the Bermuda Triangle but was not mentioned in the film itself). When lifeboats come out of the water, we can see all of their cranes (quite blindly) in the ocean and it is hard not to laugh (imagine that the lifts connect the airplane, the passengers and the waterproof script). NBC used the air, which seemed to be a "director cut", with at least one hour of extra material - mostly setbacks - injected with the nuance of the entire "Gilligan Island" episode. The most exciting moment is the plane failure, and some players are a little fun: Lee Grant is an unpleasant drunk, Brenda Vaccaro is not a pointless flight attendant, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland flirt with the parents. However, personality conflicts and scary military detail will end up with a little patience. ** from ****
