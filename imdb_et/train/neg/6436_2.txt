I'm a kind person, so I gave it to film 1 instead. 1. It was undoubtedly the worst film I've ever seen. There were very few plots and deeper interesting areas that touched, ie what Jesus really wanted us to know, went over and instead gave us great visual doses of the sadistic punishment suffered by our heroine (Arquette). The general crucifixion in the first 15 minutes would have been more humane for both its character and the audience. The action was barely and the direction was forced. And when I saw another drop of water or a dove running toward the camera, I can start louder than Patricia.
