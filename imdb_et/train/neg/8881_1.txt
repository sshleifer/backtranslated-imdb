The character acts a bit rigidly, as if it were the first actor's man. Unfortunately, one of the better actors, Jean Simmons, dies (played a lot of roles on television, such as Star Trek TNG and In the Night of Night), and then his action can be missed. <br /> <br /> Leading role is Mr. Ballard, represented by Cliff Robertson. Cliff is forced to wear this film with his body language most of the time. He does not do a bad job, but it is a bit superfluous to require the actor to unite the ocean of empty screen times, during which the characters spend their time, not to mention and also do NOT act. Robertson's most memorable role has been the last three Spider Man's films, Ben Parker (starring Tobey Maguire). <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable. The man murders his rich woman for money. After that, the woman seems to be returning and haunting her husband crazy until she jumps from a high window (carding to her dead woman approaching her) on the same day when she is predicted to die no less. <br /> <br /> Another driver, Mr. Ballard, hires as an English mark for Hamill. Unknown! The only thing that stands out is the total disregard for dialogue. Many minutes go quietly, no one is talking and little action. It is a shame that the MST3K boys did not catch this movie. It could have been much better, if not so predictable, more dialogue or a "nothing" of a shorter scene. works "live" on this movie.
