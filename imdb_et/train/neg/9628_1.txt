It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. The DVD was given to me for free and I ordered that I did not place items related to DVDs online. <br /> <br /> It is no wonder that they were given away, so no one was able to pay for this driveline. <br /> <br /> How some reviewers can say they found a fun beggar's faith, the one who puts it into the worst movie ever came. <br /> <br /> How on earth is a talented actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman this garbage could be incredible. Mostly the toilet is humor and poorly made of it. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants entertainment should avoid it at all costs.
