I can't help it, but it looks like movies that are meant to be scary and just bad. I have personally listed it under my top 10 worst films under the abyss of the abyss! Watch this movie and laugh just don't wait for the Academy to show prizes. More ways to understand the film about yourself. Frankly, though I have seen it much worse. Plus some magical tour of the desert, wiping the same people that just died, it's incredible that it must be original. I think this is one of those love or hate. you can make your mind yes this terrible, but it pulls it out somehow why i love it
