Kurt Russell (like Steven Post) works as a post-boy who fights against UBC (United Broadcasting Corporation); he goes somewhere to work, offering ridiculous projects like "Abraham Lincoln's doctor dog" for studio managers - as Lincoln, doctors and dogs are popular. Programming director Joe Flynn (Francis X. Wilbanks) wisely rejects Mr Russell's suggestions, but he doesn't know how to choose a TV show. His secretary, Heather North (like Jennifer Scott), who performs a double duty as a Russell girlfriend, has a chimpanzee who pulls out of Russell if she wants to watch television. It turns out that the monkey follows all the popular exhibitions and can easily hit the beats. Russell discovers the talent of chimmi and uses him to advance his career. It is understandable that things will get Russell for HAIRY and cast! <br /> <br /> Raffles chimp (managed by Frank Lamping) works well; Raffles does not seem to be bored and / or confused during some scenes if the simulation should be of interest; they could have been corrected by taking or editing again. There is a light satirical edge - imagine that picking monkeys hits TV shows! AND this is a monkey who gets BEER during advertising (Drinking Disney movie)! Look through the cast to reveal the fun of TV participants to recognize and try. You can make a drink game in honor of Raffles' beer jumping, having guessed the actors and where you saw them before. Here is the start - Hey, is it not "Dr. Bellows" from "I Dream of Jeannie"? Hatch Down! <br /> <br /> **** Barefoot Head (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
