I saw a "Shiner" on a DVD. When I watched it, I thought, "It's really bad porn, without a portnet." I also thought, "Who wrote this is some real questions." Then I watched the director / writer Carlson explain his process as special. Yes, it was a real special. <br /> <br /> The film's emphasis is placed on two alcoholic losers who hit each other. They are little attractive. It is front and full of nudity. These factors are probably the result of seeing the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The most troublesome element of the movie is homosexuality and the subsequent homosexual bashism of the same victim who is trying precariously to revenge his attackers, two drunken losers. The subject is not only absurdly and badly considered from a technical point of view, but acts scaryly. <br /> <br /> Then there's a boxer-stalker theme. It's really crazy, not just absurd. This hunky boxer is somehow under the constant attention of a traumatized carnal mommy who works in the gym of his gym. It's in LA. The boxer is so traumatized that he rises in a stalker house, strips in front of him and excited in the process. <br /> <br /> Can you say why a boxer who is an exhibitor in the heart is under such a traumatized stalker? It just doesn't make sense. And I'm afraid some psychological dynamics actually make sense when you take the time to read about them. However, bad scripts make sense at all. <br /> <br /> The director / writer seems to have thought that this film represents a significant minority in the gay community. Well, he may be right, I think. We may never know, because this minority would be so dysfunctional that they would not be able to organize enough to ever get into the hidden ghetto festival or the DVD store, but the two places where they could find this turkey. Thank you for that.
