I think this version of Merry Widow is the worst version. There is no tenderness or love or spirituality for this version, it is all a spooky, Germanic, messy mess. It reminded me that the Nazis fell in love; who cares? <br /> <br /> This silent version of von Stroheim is not a faithful customization of the original story. In it, we have John Gilbert and his relative relative, Prince Lusting, after this stupid American actor played by Mae Murray, who had a modern permed hairstyle and an incredible feminist way that kicked me over and over again. I like the light and beautiful, slow construction of my romance; it is not tough and sadistic. And come, these bees died of lips, freed from them, girl! <br /> <br /> Go see the live show if you want a real idea of ​​the sweetness of Franz's original operetta Lehar. Otherwise, wait until TCM shows the audio version of Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier. That's much better.
