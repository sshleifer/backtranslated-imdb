* WARNING * Contains many spoilers! <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I have great respect for Gillian Anderson's incredible talent as a versatile and versatile actor, so I can't understand why he agrees to accept the movie when he saw the script (or its absence). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the film's premise was a great idea and there were some really thought-provoking topics, but it came as a collapsed souffle. This shows why I hate 99% of British cinema. It seems too long, it is annoying, usually not happening after the first 20 minutes. Just when you think it has speed, it will disappear like Paula Radcliffe, who works on the marathon. Little imaginative leadership and a minimalist plot don't have much to make the audience unable to kick off their popcorn. As for the script, I can only assume that the writer was trying to save a couple of trees, reading something like "Alice: F *** OFF!" (Adam walks. Adam runs into the woods) (Alice next) Alice: ADAM! ADAM! "I suspect that the actors literally got more money than Kate Moss for their Virgin Mobile ads. There were not many variations on the lines, often using f, which would make Bridget Jones's friend Shazza proud. The start of a variety event is scarce, which leaves the audience with a lack of sympathy for the automatic "Oh, what's a terrible" reaction that transcends characters. <br /> <br /> Alice is not a woman who also has compassion for the courts. where there is a roof space to die, but he comes on the screen with intent, bitter and dissatisfaction before his life turns to the worst. After the attack, some layers are peeled off to explain why he is starting up, who thought that teaching his weapon was the ultimate expression of love, so he ran into a metropolis instead of following his footsteps, looking for something to make him feel u is worth living. Instead, he found a group of stereotyped middle-class Toffe watching someone who is not rich enough to travel with Lexus and luxury goods equipped with an integrated security / entertainment system (ie becoming Mrs. Robinson's central Cockney electric boys electrician) Someone passes the tissue to me. One of the sustaining graces of this character is that he is played by Gillian Anderson. He would have been unbearably one-dimensional in the hands of a smaller actor, but Mrs. Anderson actually succeeds in bringing a few short moments of humanity to this otherwise lifeless human being, especially when she apologizes for her way out of rage in vain to prevent her attackers from continuing their attack. <br /> <br /> I can't say that Adam was also much better. Danny Dyer played well as a water-water Jack Jack Lad, but the good result was unable to save him due to the absence of the script and the lack of any character. <br /> <br /> This movie was mainly based on shock value, but the timing was off and seemed too early to finish. With regard to shock, the most shocking thing about this film is the shameless example of how slim Mrs Anderson hurts; It was almost as confusing to see brutal assault scenes. Not to mention that only a British movie would have a gang of violent sex attackers to offer each other a contraceptive before continuing to rejoice with their friends - talk about a rigid top lip! If this is the kind of film that the National Lottery donates to do, I'm not surprised that fewer and fewer people choose their pounds every week. <br /> <br /> I said I hated this movie to give him too much credit, I didn't care enough about any characters to secure that strong emotion. I want my life a couple of hours ago, please!
