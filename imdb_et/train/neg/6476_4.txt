I had such great hopes for this movie because I loved the original so much. However, Disney seems to be trying to perfect the art of crappy lakes after DVD. They deserve joy. Several, actually. I thought the idea was worth it, but the music was absolutely terrible and the story wasn't much better. What happened to the great music that Disney used in his films before. Mary Poppins, Aladdin, beauty and beast, lion king ... even Hercules and Notre Dame hunchback. They have made so many great films over the years that it is really sad that they have sunk into scoring, which is not even good enough to put in the theater. <br /> <br /> I hope this film will not refer to the future of Walt Disney Corporation.
