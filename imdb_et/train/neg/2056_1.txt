Anyone who loved two classic novels by Edward Ormondroyd is disappointed in this film. All magic and romance have been modernized from their original story of a girl who does good deeds with a mysterious old lady and in return "three". Three What? Not three wishes, but three races in the 1800s rickety lift ... <br /> <br /> The first novel is Time at the top. The second is a good time.
