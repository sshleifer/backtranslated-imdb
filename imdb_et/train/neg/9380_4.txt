The wife of a deadbolt who died in the last few weeks is talking about setbacks. Like a vagabond, the film moves aimlessly and with little sense. Mona, lazy, sullen and drug-dependent title are inconvenient and Bonnaire makes her interesting. Although there is some pretentious dialogue that tries to explain why Mona has chosen this unhappy lifestyle, her motivation is never clear. The episodic nature of the film, which includes some random signs, becomes tiring after a while, making it much longer than its working time. It is also difficult to believe that an attractive young homeless woman would not pay more attention to men.
