Jimmy Dean couldn't be hammy or absurdly loutish. Hysterical when viewed in the eyes of Mystery Science Theater 3000, which I value as 10. I think that seeing this obese, tasty edible hog around Malta should be enough to send you to the bitch when you make this movie. This ugly, hysterical farce should be placed on "Booty Call", "Pumpkinhead", "Swarm" and "The Smurfs Go to Bangladesh". Such a gulp movie proves that sometimes the actors, writers, producers, etc., fall out of their mortgage or get stoned. This raises the question: "Who was so stupid to finance such a whale?" But when there was a good decision and "final justice" never existed, we would not have a surprising voice command in "Mystery Science Theater 3000"!
