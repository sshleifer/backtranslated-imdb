This film is not in any way entertaining, but rather deep in the depth of the darkest side of human behavior. Loosely combine half a dozen stories of the worst abuses, perverse sex, greed, violence and intolerance. All activities are played on some very hot and sticky days during Vienna's heat waves, and heat may be responsible for some of the film's anger and hatred. For me, the security equipment vendor slowed down the treatment of a girl in the worst episode, followed by the scenes of intoxication and perversion in the "slag" apartment. You will be captured and I hope this film will frighten you. I hated it, but I felt it needed to be seen. 1/10 "fun" 8/10 to display "human" as it sometimes is.
