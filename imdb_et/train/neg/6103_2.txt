To be honest, I am surprised by the positive voices that this film has received. The film draws its 81-minute life and the audience has to endure all the way. In fact, this film has some positive moments; Charlie Spradling makes a great result. He has a somewhat pathetic dialogue and he does it quite well. In contrast, Scott Valentine (Merrideth's boyfriend in family ties) is a pretty tough track. I think his performance is a testimony that a man who puts on the beach is wearing a tiger-patterned dance .... give me a break. Valentine also gives us an outrageous and pathetic image of suffering vampires who are unable to make the day (to see a much more convincing vampire victim, see Denice Duff's "Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4"). The film is moving so slowly and is only positive, and frankly, Charlie Spradling's dance scenes. This movie can only be honestly suggested to Charlie Spradling (which I am, and I was still looking at the hard time) for dead hard fans.
