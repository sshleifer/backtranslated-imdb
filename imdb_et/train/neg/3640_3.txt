Before I bought the movie, I had no background in this movie, but it seemed cool and I've been watching a really quiz movie for some time. Unfortunately, this movie was not what I was looking for. I had hoped for the best, but instead it gave the boring Nordic soap opera, which seemed to be too long, despite the 84-minute working time. The premise of the film is intriguing enough: it is about the Viking warlord, who breaks his God, and Odin is so furious that he kills the son of a warrior named Barek, a death and rebirth as Berserker. This Barek guy is then forced to live a lifetime of rage, mad and violent life. The film is filmed with enough competence, with a rich cinematography and quasi-good performances of the participants, but again I found myself bored and questioned when this drift is over. The filmmakers had the opportunity to do something quite fun and semi-unique, but they fell on the ball. Maybe it could have been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics like free free nudity and a lot of gore ... I mean we're talking about "Berserkers" here, aren't you? The Vikings had to be poor enough, all with rape and robbery, so Berserkers should not be more extreme? All in all, if you are not a fan of youth and anxiety (etc.) or you are crazy, Berserker, who likes torture himself.
