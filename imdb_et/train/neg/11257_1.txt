This movie looks so EMPTY. In every scene of the movie, the maximum number of actors on the screen is 10. As everything was photographed in front of the blue screen, there are never any extra options and the film seems strange. <br /> <br /> ACTING was HORRIBLE! It is so obvious that it was in front of the blue screen because all the action scenes see the actor / actor thinking about running halfway when they should run for their lifetime. /> <br /> Spoilers: You'll also find yourself having to watch a movie. At one point, Sky Captain has a home base like 100 planes that sit at the airport. They're an advanced warning that the attack is coming ... What are they doing? nothing. All the planes are blowing up and again the only wanted person is Sky Captain ... <br /> <br /> The whole world is under attack and he is the ONLY person ever fighting. At the end of the film, you can see hundreds of plains that will eventually pull out ... but what will they do? Nothing ... the movie is over ...
