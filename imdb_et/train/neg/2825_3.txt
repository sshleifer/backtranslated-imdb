This week I was just thinking that Corey Haim will have fun when I saw two "Lost Boys" movies and everything in the last week. Not that I'm a fan-boy - not far away - but I liked these two Coreys in some movies back in my early teen days. <br /> <br /> So I prepared myself for three films starring him. Unfortunately, I chose "Dream Machine" for the first time (never seen before), and it was so godawfully terrible, I just decided to lock Corey back in my closet and let her first breathe again before I get anything else on her. But I managed to drive this movie first. I had the impression that he desperately wanted to play in the same league as "Ferris Bueller Day Off" (1986), but got into his own misery. Practically all the film he wants to be comedy and at the end he's trying to be a thriller hopelessly. The only good thing about "Dream Machine" is the premise: the dead body in the Porsche trunk. All the rest are not so bad, it is embarrassing. Even for most Haim. I can sue him for his young, enthusiastic self, but at least when he has got some guideline. It was not clearly the "Dream Machine". So, we have the perfect car, yes, this black Porsche. Haim's perfect girlfriend? Just a blonde chick, who hardly has any features on the film. The perfect murder ... almost? Some guys who fall on their ass as the film's sneakers trying to steal the whole movie from the trunk will never succeed, and then at the end of the film, he thinks he's Michael Myers (minus the white William Shatner's mask) and the mistakes Corey Haim Jamie Lee Curtis. Don't think they could have slipped it when they tried. A stupid, unforgettable movie whose story leads somewhere that is directed by a director who doesn't know how to manage. Great achievement! <br /> <br /> One last question for Mr. Haim: who was the idea that you would smile the film in the last frame directly into the camera? You or the director? So it wasn't done.
