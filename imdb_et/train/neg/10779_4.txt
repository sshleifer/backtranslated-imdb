I found this film to be totally inconsistent. The talent of the director, especially Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria, and Alan Arkin (without mentioning the four main roles) - is a totally imperfect, mediocre story that could not be overcome once with the use of the radiant stereos. Julia Roberts is weak, Zeta-Jones is just annoying (she seems to repeat her role of fidelity, minus humor), Crystal just plays her same old hyperactive, neurotic, annoying alter-ego, and Cusack just walks through her part Obviously boring all over for the project. <br /> <br /> Because what should be a "romantic comedy" is not a central character, not to mention chemistry, or comedy (possibly SPOILERS) well, the only moments of light humor came down from Cusack's role in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin - The obvious failure of the scenario to show some originality. (Spoilers) Azaria was reasonably amusing because the Mexican lover and Walken made a pretty fun arthouse-maverick-Dogme-type director's parody, but these parts were very little screen time and instead (Spoilers) treated us Billy Crystal dog sniffed his groin. A pure genius. <br /> <br /> Most of John Cusack's great fan of the work, not to mention the rest of the fantastic light, I had to shoot a movie with lots of good ideas, and at the same time, he doesn't want to explore or develop any of them clich√©s of the genre and even humiliating sometimes with the almost "gross picture, teen movie" humor. <br /> <br /> Very bad 4/10.
