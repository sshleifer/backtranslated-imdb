Like some other reviewers have said before, I would like to know what the letter actually read and what went, "Yes! That's it. This is the next movie we'll do on the green light!" And whoever this person is, his head should investigate the actual brain activity. Because who is responsible for actually withdrawing money to do this after reading the script, I would like to give you your email address and maybe you just want to give up a little more money. This movie is absolutely cruel. <br /> <br /> Wayans are funny, at least they can be. They have made some good films and have had unbelievably funny performances on the journey. But here the premise may not only ruin the logic, not only the terrible acting, not just attacking the entire movie from start to finish, not just what is amateurish, as you can find, but they really want to pay you to see this movie. Maybe if it was free ... naaah, it would be a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Normally I would like to write a long time, a detailed overview of why this movie is so bad, but just enough to say let me talk briefly. It is the smallest common denominator of making films and it is about the same heart attack. <br /> <br /> 0/10. Think of my top ten worst movies all the time!
