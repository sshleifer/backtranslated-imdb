Dahmer, a young confused man. Dahmer, crazy movie. Building on, I had a couple of beers while watching the movie, but that doesn't explain why I started to get bored with this flick. <br /> <br /> Its setbacks are nothing more than confusing and annoying, and not the beginning and the end of the actual story, the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explanatory text at the beginning and end of the movie. A style that would be a movie is just a boring picture and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> We never see real murders, everything is just a bunch. Sometimes you even get the feeling that Dahmer dreams about the whole thing, but you know he is not because it is based on a real story and it actually happened, at least most of it. But what happened? It's not easy to say. <br /> <br /> I don't encourage people to waste this movie time. I <br /> <br /> didn't like it a bit and I felt it suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> * / *****
