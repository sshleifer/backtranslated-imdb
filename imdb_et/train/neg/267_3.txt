The episodic version of Robert Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" plays fatally slowly, after Johnny Rico's departure from his parents, (not a very attractive) girl he desires, and a mobile infantry. The foreigners in the show are not like the barbaric mistakes of the film, instead of squid-like monsters letting their lasers out of their mouths. <br /> <br /> Looking at this version, I was constantly surprised how fruitful they were to make the whole thing. The exhibition mostly touches on the relationships between the recruits and the painful, long-lasting images they give each other through their anti-burglary visions, between the 80's birthdays, which sometimes reach * during rare battles that eventually became the episodes. From the construction point of view, the debt to Top Gun, which shares a lot of pace and content (and all that means).
