This movie proves that "commercial" movies or other Hollywood movies are in serious crisis. There is no reason why this film should have been produced after someone expected success based on Shaquille's name. it is worth referring to the plot: it is a bit of a confusion than a knot. What else? The screen is somewhat dim, O'Neal is a bad actor, but Francis Capra is even worse. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10.
