I saw this movie the other night and I have to honestly say it's one of the worst films I've ever seen. Operation is fair, but the plot is completely ridiculous. The killer is born because all the "energy used to make the movie" and when the film is burned dies the killer? How incredible is it? The characters were underdeveloped to say at least ... for example, maybe the man "Didn't you try to finish the movie because your mother didn't get it?" So should we go with it? We didn't know it was her daughter up to the movie. The movie was not shown by anyone, we knew nothing about the main people who had survived, except for the Ringwald character who was a terrifying actor, the guy was dead when he died and Raffy wanted to be his mother's manager. Don't really dive to find out who they are. Things seem to hurry to kill. The whole plot is completely weak for my taste and I was very disappointed. Anyone who enjoyed this chick must obviously learn something about making a film. I can't believe anyone would agree to celebrate or even work with this picture. It's not funny, it wasn't scary and the whole movie clich√©. I found myself predicting what would happen before every scene that believed it wasn't difficult for me to do at all. It is a disgrace and I am very sorry that I wasted one and a half hours of nonsense. 1/10.
