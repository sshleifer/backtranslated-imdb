This early John Wayne Lone Star in the West has a little more than the mill-oyster Wayne had done for Lone Star by that time. First, he has his old friend Paul Fix; Fix, being a much better actor, the standard Lone Star villain, brings to the surrounding environment the much needed professionalism, not the usual hesitation, often presented in these oaks. The plot, the wrong identity, the robbery of wage billing and murder, is the same trick and perfect, as you think it is in the low budget of the 1930s in the west, but Wayne's fascination with good looks, gentle charm and the way with the line make it more enjoyable. Chubby, wacky Eddy Chandler is not quite believable as Wayne's feminine "partner", and there's something going on that happens when Chandler and Wayne start to get into a fistfight that is growing tiring. On the other hand, Wayne's love interest is played by anyone other than Mary Kornman, a little "Mary" in the early "Little Rascals" fame. She is an adult 20 years old, blonde and cute button. Most of Wayne's leading women in these Lone Star / Monogram "B's" were pretty gentle and colorless, but Mary is perky, cute and yes, sexy. In a general store, there is a scene where she works, where Wayne asks her to get her a bottle of "nerve tonic" that happens on the top shelf, so she needs to get a ladder and climb up the shelf. Wayne is a little upside down when he stepped up, then again when he comes down, then a few minutes later, when he asks him to climb and get another bottle for him, it's surprisingly surprising for the 1935 movie. try to hide the fact that she is definitely her butt. Anyway, it's an interesting little "B", not big, but not so dirty and casual as many of his LoneStar timings. The ultimate bomb attack is not being treated as well, and Chandler will become somewhat irritating after a while, but it is worth seeing only the cute and sexy Mary Kornman.
