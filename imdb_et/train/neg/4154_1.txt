Vampires Vs. Zombies were not the original title. It was actually ... <br /> <br /> Nasty Lesbian Half-Borders and Two Zombies - Coming from Cars: Special Guest Representations Lesbian Gypsie Witch and Her Dog, Special Mandate Casual Woman and Catholic School Girl Short Skirt Zombie Cream. <br /> <br /> Also in Box: Warning: No graph - only the writer and director will understand the end of this movie or something else. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I love bad movies. I love vampires. I love zombies. Hell, I even have lesbians. This movie combined all three vague and confusing (or non-existent) plots, the terrible (I mean READY BAD) dialogue and the random STUFF and PEOPLE who have nothing to do with anything (or do they know what's going on in the world) ). Oh, and I can't forget the green oatmeal "latex gloves" of the zombies (yes, the filmmakers were so cheap that they couldn't even cover the zombies with their hands on oat flakes and colors). In no way, this result was this scary BAD movie if you even called it. <br /> <br /> Was it supposed to be pointless? Vampire was really a sister and another girl was a mental patient? Where Were Vampires Vs. Zombies? Hell, where were the vampires at all ... you really couldn't invite any girls vampire. What ever. <br /> <br /> Never rent or buy this movie. If you are really curious ... okay, I understand. Seriously, even BAD lovers can't stand it. 100 should be number 1.
