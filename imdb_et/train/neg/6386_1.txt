I really wanted this movie to like, but it was just impossible. The action was ultra-hammy, the plot was annoying and the pace was SLOW, sooo slowwwwww. All the time I was in the theater I wanted to finish the movie. Twenty you went to the movies and I pray for the rest. Of course, there were some beautiful, but familiar guys. And there wasn't much talk about the music about tuning magical instruments. The music was tedious and boring. Sometimes the sound was loud, they were also annoying. Mainly this film was able to bring me and slid me at the same time. <br /> <br /> I am delighted with this. I have to go look at "Tideland" and wash this bad taste from my mouth.
