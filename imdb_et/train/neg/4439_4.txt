Yikes. It's pretty bad. First of all, this game is not very good, and the decision to transfer it to the film does not support the advantages - especially since Peploe does not decide how he wants to deal with the origin of the theater (we look at the occasional theater picture, etc.)) and has decided to go with a leap of editing style is meant to remind you that you are watching a movie, while in fact it only reminds you that you are watching a very bad film by a director who is overwhelmed by his material. Mira Sorvino's central performance is soul-afflicting: stage-y and plummy; it's like playing part of Helena Bonham-Carter's commercial ivory creation. Only Fiona Shaw will present the presentation - and it may be that her theatrical genealogy means she can best handle the material - but it's hard to see one movie alone, even if it is as easy, true and as Shaw's. Ben Kingsley turns to the middle and off, and Diana Rigg's daughter Rachel Stirling plays her supporting role just like that. Unfortunately, none of Bertolucci's magic has rubbed his wife when this film is evidence.
