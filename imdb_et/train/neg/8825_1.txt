The only reason why this movie is even given one star is how much at the end I laughed at me. I had great hopes because I usually love bad campy vacation horror movies, but it just doesn't qualify. It is really just a bad attempt to show a sign that is slowly madness, which again is not a bad plot, but is badly done here. There are some scenes (like the end) that are not meant to be funny but actually made me laugh. It was a couple of times when I thought the film would go in an interesting direction, but it never does what it could and should be. In my opinion, if you are looking for a Christmas change, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
