Description: Corny, totally stupid and worthless. It's so cheap and flat, it makes you wonder why these abnormally dark people even wasted 2 months or so to spend the budget (I think it's ...) probably no more than $ 700 to make this movie. It was just a hysterical look with or without the Mystery Science Theater. I'll give you the best tips in the world: <br /> <br /> Free yourself, save your time, life and money - don't repeat, don't even think about seeing this movie. This movie is so funny, it makes your face complicated from boredom to purple. If you have a single IQ, watch my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie. You could really admire it. (As I said earlier, if you have a single IQ) <br /> <br /> About 12 of your participants, some of the dolls you bought in garage sales, and of course cameras and music, will do a little more fun with your home video than this absolute movie.
