After quasi-gothic, fruitful music, the film begins with Cassidy, who is killing himself. In a perfect world, this and the final credits. We do not live in this world. Stylish band members decide to go to a clown to contact their dead nature. When I say a clown, I mean a real clown. He tells them that they all die with Cassidy's ghost (in the spirit of Dora, one of the band's companions). We couldn't care less because the characters are boring, coarse and very horrible. Written by Adam Hackbarth (incredibly surname once there was there) and directed by Corbin Timbrook (who, after the transmitter and the blood tower, must know that he is alive), this film is a constant battle between the incompetence of the film and the need for the viewer to stay awake. There is not enough blood to reassure gore actions, nor enough nudity to satisfy the pervs. This movie has no suggestion to recommend to anyone. <br /> <br /> My Class: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Amanda Carraway can topless <br /> <br /> Where did I see it: Starz on Demand
