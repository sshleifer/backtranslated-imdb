I've seen a lot of movies in my life, but not as bad as that. This is a movie that makes fun of fat people, no real story, bad actors, no fun and much more. Is this the movie you want to see? I think not! <br /> <br /> I think the filmmakers tried to be original and creative, but it seems to have been done by a 12-year-old child who doesn't have any cinematic skills at all. The so-called funny parts are as funny as breaking the pies with the breaking of people's face or wind. If you have the humor you like, this is the movie !! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money on this movie!
