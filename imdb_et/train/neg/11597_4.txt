I put the land with Alice, who has survived the previous part of the Nightmare series, once again found Freddy Krueger's deadly dreams. This time, a deliberate murderer strikes a sleepless child of Alice. His intention is to be born again in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice release his spirit to save his son? This movie really started well when we see that Alice has dreamed that she is Amanda Kruger, who is stuck with 100 manicures, and when she's raped by 100th Manic, she was rushed to hospital, but then she is no longer pregnant, but then Amanda gave birth again to Freddy <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Alice and Dan are the only two people to come back from the 4th movie, and then they've got new friends who don't not long before Freddy kills again. not as good as other deaths or dreams. <br /> <br /> Freddy himself didn't seem to be scary at all in this movie, the nightmare was really boring, they weren't scary or scary at all. /> <br /> Participation in the film was for the fifth movie, but in general I think this movie was really boring. (Still the worst movie, Freddy Dead is the worst) <br /> <br /> 4/10
