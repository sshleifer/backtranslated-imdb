I just watched this movie 15 minutes ago and I have no idea what I just watched. Most of all, I think this is a film about the "stars" of the Internet on the CD-ROMs, which is about as realistic as flash cartoons online. Somebody kills him, causing his sister and two FBI agents to die. Also exploring the United States Big City's local assassination attempt, although most of his work comes from the CD-ROMs he claims to be as realistic as the real thing. I know. Wow. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen is the only movie with all sorts of credit behind him. He's been in the movie for about 15 minutes, and half of it is his main girl without apparent reason. I don't even explain the end, because frankly I can't do it myself. But just before the final scene, the movie is only about 3-4 minutes long. Frankly, they could have been running to the last scene, and it would have had the same effect as a cross-eye direction and everything. <br /> <br /> Get away from this movie. I got it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I could have used it for some 80 minutes and been more satisfied. Similarly, playing this game with a knife where you repeatedly hold hands. That would be 80 minutes much more fun.
