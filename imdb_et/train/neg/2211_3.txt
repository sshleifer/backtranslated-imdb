Hahahaha !!!!!! Funny-this adds up to this movie in one word. What this mess was this "thing" because it could kill me to use the word movie!?!?! I hope the director, writer and producer didn't want it to be good because it wasn't sure !!! A scientist who turned his son's hammer, and a shark died of a number of people whom the scientist called the island !!! I hate this movie so much that if I watched it, I laughed at all the serious parts because they were so indignant and unprofessional .... and they couldn't make shark unrealistic, even though this "thing" was a bit bigger than most low budget movies. All I have to say is to watch this movie that is waiting for him to laugh at all the bad behavior and the foolish bright dialogue, because when you wait for a good movie. I am very disappointed.
