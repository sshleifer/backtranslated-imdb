I thought this movie was pretty flat. If you are looking for cheese, you may like it. I don't think of honest cheese, but it was ridiculous. The film's advancement, whatever it was, and the story was very weak. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this movie was day-glo zombies, but even this is not a good reason to see this movie.
