Okay, let me start by saying that nothing surprises anyone reading other comments. Saying this: MY G-D, this movie is! I mean, WOW, I didn't know it was possible to throw so much money when they obviously did something and still worse than any Roger Corman movie! Corman had probably caught up with this movie for a while, but it decreased due to poor quality of the script! The only reason this film got is that someone said, â€œHey, zombies are popular. Video games are popular. What kind of game can we own from zombies? Resident Evil? No, someone got there first. Quiet mountain? No, it's too quiet. People never sit in a dark room to be stupid. Hey, aren't Sega games where people ran zombies while shooting? They're out of the platform, we get that penny! "<br /> <br /> In principle, they tried their best to make a video-sensitive movie, even when he fought as if the characters were playing the game. <br /> <br /> The first and big problem is that the original game was terrible. I mean, <br /> <br /> bad-movie-merchandising-made-in-worse-game-in-two weeks and-then-d-out-and-bought-by-morons- and-those- older Christmas fears. The graphics were boring. Monsters were bored. The levels were boring. The interface was boring. CASE was boring. In other words, it was a boring game. And that was the ARCADE version. The home opportunity was even worse! With a home opportunity, you couldn't even hold a shotgun when you were bored of this pointless game! Another problem is that they went so far that in reality the game scenes would actually hit during the fighting scenes. AH ??? Didn't the editor have enough influence to show that the actual fight is taking place? Not to mention the fact that ALL the struggle was shot from the point of view of video games, which can explain the tedious use of Matrix-style effects. The problem is that the game was a shooter for the first time (the player goes from the character POV). Maybe they put the game graphics to let you know they are referring to the game ... Right, no matter ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the only thing that made this ENTIRE experience far-reaching was that everything in the theater, the movie was fun, so my sudden hysterical laughter and general disbelief reached the ordinary and didn't get me out. <br /> <br /> To sum up, DON'T HAVE A PLAY WITH THIS GAME! Don't even give up renting it when it's in a couple of weeks. Run. Just run.
