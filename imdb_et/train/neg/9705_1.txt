I saw this movie as a child when it appeared in the theater, and it was so bad that it became a family joke. If there were zero on the leaderboard, you could get this movie. The dinosaurs were terrible. The story was ridiculous. Actually, one cannot act. The only reason I remember the name of the movie so well is that my family is still talking about how BAD really was.
