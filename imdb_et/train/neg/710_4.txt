I read with interest the novel of Rice and became part of this story and the heartfelt story that was based on historical truths. <br /> <br /> But I was just terrible about this catastrophic adaptation. The casting was based solely on the physical appearance and not on the talents (an obvious exception, except for Peter Gallagher, who was not blonde-haired and could not leave the wet paper bag). The embarrassing and clumsy attempt to influence the French accent was fun, but not entertaining. I found myself struggling with this unpleasant and melodramatic momentum and I was surprised that I did it to the end. <br /> <br /> Warning for novel fans - stay away from it.
