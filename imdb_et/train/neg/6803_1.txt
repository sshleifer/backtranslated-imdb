When I came on IMDb, I've always seen "as the worst movie ever" in the post. After watching this * movie *, I think I'm going to create my post right now !! <br /> <br /> Opening headlines: big, some kind of flat zoom on the gas cooker (yes, focus on fire = explosions = big action packed film !!) <br /> <br /> Cast: I think Ice T is cool rapper, even a nice actor (sometimes i ask, "sometimes"), but with Steven's pig like a policeman he plays, ... is beyond words. The rest is ... well, I don't know where these actors were hired, but jeez! I bet my dog ​​would have been a much better actor than that! <br /> <br /> Plot: Hijacking.original is not it ?? <br /> <br /> Action sequences: The first shot in the movie is an explosion. I told myself, well, cool! At least there are some nice pyrotechnics. I was dead wrong. The rest of the movie is mostly filled with a small rental price from the air force ... <br /> <br /> The dialogues are fun, the music is nonsense, the end is happy (I mean, I was happy at the end because the movie was over !!!) < br /> <br /> My cousin who was watching the movie was glad (I'm 22, he's 42 ... well). was on the brink of filming and burning. Maybe next time I watch it ... (who never said ???)
