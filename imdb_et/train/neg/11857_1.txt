The worst movie ever made !!! Please refer to Real movie reviews from the professionals in this movie. Check out some good independent comments on this movie on the Rotten Tomatoes web. Comments on this site are probably people who have some financial interest in this movie. In my opinion, positive comments are very misleading. I find it amazing how negative comments about this film are so bad and the positive comments sound like the Academy's prize speech. Don't waste your hard earned money !!!!!! This movie has slowed down! I can't believe that such a movie would ever have been made. Why should Hollywood waste time on such junk? This movie is nothing. I ask myself what to relax when actually bringing your money to such a trash. I went to the explosive and even the sender said we didn't waste our time or money. I didn't listen or waste my time and money. Please do not make the same mistake! It's really the "worst movie ever made!"
