This movie was long and boring. Surprisingly, it was chosen for Cannes, even though they tend to pretend. The thing is that, unlike other Dutch marks like the artistic genre like Kerkhof and Kruishoop, Guernsey feels completely empty. Moreover, it has no cinematographic quality. Long opening does not mean cinematic depth, it is just a long boring shot. The story was not interesting and the characters could not be detected at all. The actors didn't look in his direction and seemed to disappear from time to time. Leopold tried, but he's not the talent I was hoping for. Where is Kerkhof and Kruishoop? They made some waves in the Dutch cinema. Leopold just made another attempt.
