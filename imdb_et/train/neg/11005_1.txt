This film shows a series of sketches that partly move on one another. I realized the late passage of the movie, first it irritated me. <br /> <br /> Many episodes of this movie come without recognizable punchlines, and are simply trying to turn it around using absurdity and darkness. This attempt to remain in comedy without funny bits fails. Dare to try to make something big. But it failed. At least the director did something. But that's not good. <br /> <br /> Many movies were not as funny as they were planned, but one of them is the best. This is the real life of the worst-case scenario of making a movie. No. To improve yourself, it's even worse. The film is very bad that they are not funny at all. It's not even fun to see a leader-actor, a writer, and a director (all three of the same men by the way) die by drowning in bad movies at sea. The film is too bad for it.
