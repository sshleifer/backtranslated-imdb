Kareena Kapoor in bikini hmmmmmmmm. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar ... <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor ... <br /> <br /> Maybe Saif .... <br /> <br /> > Kareena Kapoor in Bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Good Banner .. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in Bikini ..... <br /> <br /> No good reason not see this movie ... <br /> <br /> Or so I thought ........ Didn't these people make JBJ ... <br /> Why o Why am I I forgot. <br /> <br /> For all the criticism, the first part of the movie is not so bad ... <br /> <br /> There are some intrigues and you are the BIRTHDAY SYSTEM USED WITH THE RITCHIE FILMS LIKE LOCK STOCK AND SNATCH. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor shines a very lean model of its kind. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is Akshay Kumar because he can only be. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor is annoying, but somehow funny, WANT TO RECOMMEND THAT Most of the time she can't understand her. <br /> <br /> Saif is once again a side area of ​​Main Khilad .. <br /> <br /> It's occasionally laughing and a couple of crying. s, and some goosebumps during kareena-saif love story (kareenas rain, behind my bicycle hmmmmmmm). <br /> <br /> IF YOU ARE NOT ALL HALF PROMOTE THEIR QUESTION ..... <br /> <br /> WHAT IS THE SECOND HEIGHT VERY HIGHLIGHTS ... <br /> <br /> It was almost a joy if the interval came not only because of the damp karen that people thought were the things that came. <br /> <br /> INSTRUCTIONS WHICH ARE VERIFIED FOR CALCULATION, WHICH IS NECESSARY IN INDEPENDENT INDICATIONS. <br /> <br /> Saif suddenly sews like a cartoon. /> <br /> SUGDENLYA SEXY CAREER SHOW ANOREXICALLY, RECOMMEND THAT THE SECOND TIME IS CANCELED AND THESE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ATTENTION! ). <br /> <br /> ANIL KAPOOR AND ITS SUCCESSFUL SHOWS ARE EXAMPLE. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the only one who carries a degree of madness, but even after a while he becomes unbearable. <br /> <br /> ALL ASK ON YOUR QUESTION ON YOUR QUESTION. <br /> <br /> WHY? !! WHAT ?? !!! WHEN? !!! WHERE? !!! WHAT TO DO ... <br /> <br /> Collective impetus went through the audience before every second song that was common even without a movie. <br /> <br /> It is no longer possible to relieve trauma .... <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION. <br /> <br /> This movie is BUZZI, WHO MAY HAVE THE HIGHEST OUT OF THE HIGH CHALLENGE AND AS A RAPPLE TURN ON ALL MIGRANI ATTENTION. <br /> <br /> Please do not look at this movie for any reason other than academic interest. <br /> <br /> Cast Kumar, first half. <br /> <br /> +/- s, when, when, how, who makes a lot of confusion (fill this book). <br /> <br /> + s cast, all over the other side (needs several pages to fill it). <br /> <br /> A total of 3/10 (im trying to avoid the 1st and 2nd too, doesn't seem to be extreme, but don't make the mistake that this movie is invisible in the first half).
