I was really looking forward to this exhibition, given the quality of the participants and the fact that Scott's brothers were involved. Unfortunately, my hopes were broken! What's more, we have believed that the KGB is a group of stupid groups that have no idea what they are doing. At one point, there is a ridiculous scene where 4 KGB agents could not cope with one CIA agent. I'm tired of the images of their biased, one-sided, and completely inaccurate Spy games that continued during the Cold War. I find it ridiculous that the US is unable to make objective films about their participation in the world and elsewhere. Just like the pathetic U-571, where we believe that the US once again got the wrong Enigma machine. <br /> <br /> Your company's credit has been well filmed and acted. Places are also extremely well realized. Alfred Molina makes a great result, as does Keaton (their conflict is very well done). I really wanted to show it, and no doubt I'm looking at other 2 episodes, but I really want US productions to stop trying their spies, military, etc. as a supermen who is much better intellectually and physically than any other planet. It gets old quickly and seriously bad for what could have been 10/10. <br /> <br /> S
