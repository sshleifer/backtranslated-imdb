Wow, this is, on the one hand, very unusual: usually the first film in the long queues is the best. People are surprised if the sequel is actually better. With Tarzan I thought this movie was the worst, or at least the first six that contained my Tarzan Collection DVD package. I'm glad to follow the queues several times, but I'm through this turkey, thanks to several characters. - Many activities with many wild animals, even if they are just stocks. You see lion attacks, crocodiles, hippo, panther, call it, and you see many different kinds of tribes, including Pygmies (called "dwarf" in the movie.) Because this movie was made almost 75 years ago, I can't capture any realism because they hadn't had this movie long ago. They do the best, so you put together with the actors who talk about the false backgrounds. But Weissmuller did a lot of activities and was in great shape. He and O'Sullivan are doing well-built beautiful couples when the cinema has ever had one in the golden years. Acquired Jane and her start learning English. <br /> <br /> BAD - from the moment Jane Parker is with Tarzan's almost every scene with her, Maureen O'Sullivan's hysterical, buggy and screaming scenes after the scene. It's enough to give you a headache and it will destroy the movie. Fortunately, he calmed down in the lakes, but not in the movie. The film also does not support the image of the "Great White Hunter", such as C. Aubrey Smith, who plays Jane's father, and Neil Hamilton as "Harry Holt", a safari guide, to shoot every animal visible whether animals are threatening or not. These people have been killed, especially Smith. In the second note, it is too bad that there is nothing here that explains how Tarzan first got into the jungle. There is no history here or its growth. He's right there when Jane and the group reach a certain point in Africa.
