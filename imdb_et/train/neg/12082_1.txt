Unfortunately, bad hamlet. I knew him, dear reader, and let me tell you this version sucks! I do not know who made all the money for this flameth, but I hope they are proud of themselves. They took the classic game and made it the most boring melodrama. This version is so badly literally so that even a large reader such as Maximilian Schell in the title can't save it. The only quality of redemption in this movie is that it made a big feed for "MST3K"; Mike, Servo and Crow were so much fun. <br /> <br /> But I'm sure Shakespeare wouldn't have wanted her name to be associated with it. This "hamlet" is not so bad that it is good; it's just bad. Absolutely terrible.
