Frank Capra's creativity must be almost spent by the time this film is made. Although it has some charming moments and many excellent performers, the direct recycling of Capra is not only a script but a remarkable shot of its first story version, Broadway Bill (1934). It is understood that he will again use video footage during amazing horse racing. But with small players, he uses all the scenes in the dialogue, then brings these actors back and looks forward to not noticing, for example, that Ward Bond is 14 years old! If you don't want to see Oliver Hardy's last performance, leave it out and watch Broadway Bill instead.
