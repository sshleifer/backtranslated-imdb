Peter Fonda is so deliberately so enchanted as his actor that his laxelines do not let any irony or humor in the dialogue. He trades the tailed barbs and not the spiritual repartory with Brooke Shields, as if he were a wooden block with retarded hair; even his minor touches (such as the lack of sight-seeing) do not reveal a sign such as a confident actor, led by himself, a certain filmmaker. In the southwest of 1950, the poor gambler (not over fraud) wins orphaned Lolita, who has played in a poker game; After the Grand Canyon has a prize-winning card, the scandalous two will become the bosses. Some beautiful prospects and strange but interesting Henry Fonda cubic canyon man are the only compensations for a tired comedy drama, both run by comic strip killers who won't stop until they get it on the map. Shields is very beautiful, but - although the camera loves its pouti, its shiny beauty - it doesn't have a screen presence (and its voice has no choice); every time he opens his mouth, there is a tendency or a spider. * 1/2 from ****
