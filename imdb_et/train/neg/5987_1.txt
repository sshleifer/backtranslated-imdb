I didn't like this movie. The plot was very predictable. A typical American plot, I'm sorry. Finally, the boy gets a girl. And London has a monorail? London Bank ??? Bank of England is what it really is! However, I liked the look of Tracy Island and Thunderbirds. And the British were bad? (except Parker and Lady Penelope) What was it? Oh and they said things like "The Thunderbirds come here" - but it was never the series "The Thunderbirds", why do I want to see that this was done again in 20 years by a British majority. !
