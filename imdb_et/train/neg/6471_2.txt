It's a movie that's bad in any way. Of course we want to know what happened 12 years ago from the last movie, and it works on some levels. But the new characters are not just interesting. Baby Melody is terribly awful! Unfortunately, although the logic that people cannot stay underwater, they remain ignorant of other basic physical logic. It's great if you don't have cold weather clothing when you're in the Arctic. I don't know why most of the comments here on Jafari's return are worse, I thought it was terrible.
