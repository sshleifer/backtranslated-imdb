Once a film that deserves a high fat zero rating, it is a bunch of nonsense. I love zombie movies and even bad ones usually have something that goes for them, but not that fear. I really started watching this movie because it is so insulting, I can't believe the people responsible for it really think it was acceptable. <br /> <br /> There is no plot and the non-primer is cut with sadism and swing scenes. People do not respond, do not act or remind people. The whole movie is also filmed in two rooms that are little decorated, to vaguely recall the places they should be. The whole thing is a nonsense confusion, it doesn't go anywhere, and when the zombies finally emerge, they see the debris and don't do much. <br /> <br /> I could make a better movie, so could you and someone who has never seen the movie before. This is a bad and undoubtedly the worst film ever. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the slowest movie of all time. You will notice that the only positive reviews give it a 10/10 and invite you to buy a DVD. I can't imagine someone being neutral because it's a good movie, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> 0/10 and it's generous.
