If you've ever wanted to see a movie that emphasizes style over content, it's for you. For me, Son de Mar is beautiful, but there is little substance if mawkish, melodramatic, manipulative love yarns don't turn you on. It may be one of those famous "chick flicks" you've heard so much. <br /> <br /> We are halfway through this movie before something really happens: Jordi Molla goes to the sea to look for tuna and does not come back, leaving his wife Martina (Leonor Watling) and son to take care of her. Then they buried Ulise at the six-minute screen, Martina marries again and her son grows into childhood. This quick takeover is the least telling and very sloppy: after 40 minutes more or less hanging around, we are suddenly infused with melodrama, all in six minutes. I think this is called the perverse storyline. <br /> <br /> Five years later, Ulises (like wandering superhero Ulysses, get it?), returns to her 'Penelope' (Watling) to find she is married to Sierra (Eduard Fernandez), an inexplicably wealthy man (what does it do to serve all this dough?), who inexplicably keeps crocodiles as pets. When Martina asks about the great anger, the lack of the Lord, she tells her that she will take her to Sumatra one day and she will understand everything. <br /> <br /> And here's the thing: he does it I take him to Sumatra. The reference just dies in the script somewhere. She does not explain where she was and why she disregarded her wife and child for five years. She does not recognize herself as a respectable man and does NOT fill the film with holes in the plot that look at at least half of the film. I can only assume that director Bigas Luna wants us to perform a story that offers mystical tips (fish, reptiles, the sea) that are offered to him through breathtaking cinematography and inevitable dialogue. It just doesn't work. The narrative "arc" on this film comes to a hostile laundry line. <br /> <br /> I am sure Jordi Molla is a good actor but I just couldn't buy my Ulises as any hero (which was what the original Ulysses was supposed to be). With a damp sensuality, he gives Virgil a short, identical poem about 2000 times and every time he excites Martina's explosive orgasm. This man should be rented to enliven older marriages. I'm sure Virg would be impressed. He didn't get it often as I understand it. <br /> <br /> This poetic "device" is highlighted in the film and I had no choice but to assume that it was the sailors of Ulysseus' famous "siren song" (ie beautiful virgins who sing poorly) who were doomed assigned if they responded well, siren call). If this is what Bigas Luna has to do, you will see the problem - he offers a complex symbolism of high art. Again, it just doesn't work, at least in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Watling is a beautiful and magnetic young actress, but she gives us her character here, who doesn't seem to have much intellectual or even romantic depth. I do not like how he could desperately fall in love with a boy who is sporting on his face (like the free) sporting event, fatty 1960s style hair that looks more like seaweed, and one of those trendy 21st century beard "(you know, four days of growth , not more, not less). He wants to be a dreamy boy (I think), but the eyes he suggested may suffer from over-exposure of an overwhelming script. <br /> <br /> But don't despair, this movie is good to watch. Just don't try to combine red herring or think too much about what you hear through dialogue. You can lose this movie fast (especially in the first 40 minutes) and you won't lose much.
