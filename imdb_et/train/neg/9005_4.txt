When Alien, Jurassic Park and countless other sci fi horror movies are in your cup, add a lot of sugar and get it off. The film begins at the end of the 1100s in the old England and then pops up in today's California. Our hero, Carver (Dean Cain), is a new security head and military advisor in a science lab at 400 meters. He arrives (Carver is also a helicopter pilot) with a leading scientist and we will soon find out that it is a cloning laboratory and they have something new to clone. Is it a dinosaur or what? As with the films mentioned above, all hell breaks down and our characters begin to crash. Monster's special effects are pretty good for "straight video" and Dean Cain does what he's paying for. But forget the rest of the group if we explain why we haven't seen them before. Again, don't go with high expectations and you're ok.
