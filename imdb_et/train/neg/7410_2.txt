I love horror films that bring out a real mystery like saying a "quiet mountain" (which I found to be pretty good, but still missing something) and movies that keep you away, I thought it was one of those movies. Initially, the film starts with some very good breaks and creates a good starting point for a good horror, but after that it just rolls down the hill and it goes down faster and faster. I first mentioned a quiet mountain because I see a lot of "stolen" themes from this movie. Everything I would say I look at a quiet mountain instead, its better, its more scary, it's much more tense, and the ending is much better. And best of all, you don't feel like I'm hanging out because I did one. It just seems to be one of those "I like this movie, so I'm gonna do it again in my very bad version," a glove movie .. Oh and another thing ... Lord .. horror movie ... it's like trying to scare a child carer who has "hugged me" and I love you forever "written on its belly.
