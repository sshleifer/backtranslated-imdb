It was a somewhat nice experiment, but it is too violent and boring if it is higher due to low budget constraints. The use of virtual kits is almost working, but in some cases it fails happily. They used a small budget that I think. I just want a story and most of the actors were better. There are many parts where you see what they were trying to do, and it would have been great if they actually hit these signs, but they don't. Confusing and incredible story. Bad DVD transmission too. Watching a movie in one session doesn't take much. I had to turn it off. It was too boring. I can make movies slowly. But make them attractive in some ways. Visually, the story is sensible, acting, etc. This was not the case in all departments, so it never added an attractive experience. Perhaps the filmmaker's next attempt is better.
