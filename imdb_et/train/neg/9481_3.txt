James Bishop (Matt Stasi) goes to the psychiatric facility where Dr. McCort (Bruce Paynes) is staying. There he understands that "Ripper" kills many practitioners who take their breath to the devil, Dr. The cult promoted by McCort. This story is so absurd and imbec that it is impossible to write a summary. The dialogues are so ridiculous, especially when Helena, the blonde bride of James Bishop, comes to the refuge, that it is almost unbelievable that the writer has the courage to add these scenarios. And what about going back to the hospital to bring files for dead patients? And cast, which consists of ham actors and actors? Frankly, I don't know what the worst thing about this film is: scenario, director or cast. The correct answer is definitely everything. I saw this cable television slip and I'm surprised how the manufacturer can spend such garbage. This horror film becomes very absurd, given the absurdity of the plot. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Devil" (Devil)
