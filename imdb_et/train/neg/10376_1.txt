I saw this movie on a pre-release screen at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills. I remember that film producers and directors were involved, presumably for our reaction. it was supposed to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> If the audience is not afraid, the filmmakers seem to have been. They rejected the release for over a year. For curiosity I saw it again to see if they were cutting it again; as far as I can say, they were not. It was the same tough film that was just a year old. <br /> <br /> It's almost "bad, it's good", but it's slow and boring.
