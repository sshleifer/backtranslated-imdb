There was a Bugs Bunny comic called "Baby Buggy Bunny" that was just this plot. With the baby's face, Finster kidnapped the bank and the money in the roll and fell into Bug's rabbit hole. She dressed like a baby to get into the Bugg hole for money. The "Little Man" image, where he looks at the mirror in the bathroom with a cigar in his mouth, is a direct comic. It was a fun 5-minute comic; not so much movie. If you are very interested in it, buy Bugs Bunny DVD. It was much more original for the first time (1954). Plus you can launch many classic Bugs Bunny cartoons!
