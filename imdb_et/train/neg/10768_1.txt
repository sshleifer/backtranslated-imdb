This film turns Canadians and Britons into asinine, a moral idiot. Men get stoned / drunk and then they worship each other in almost every scene. Are the story superfluous? I don't understand what they are there for? they spend every scene that causes robbery or, worse, grinding like mesmerized cattle. Apparently, Canadian women are either cumbersome vulgar trams or hippie chicks. It is a standard knocking girlfriend, her loser boy and the ridiculousness of her evil mother, which we have seen countless films before. <br /> <br /> Every character here is bullying, an infantile stereotype. Not to mention that they all saw the shower need! And the idea of ​​any scene that refers to sex with George Wendt? to tremble? is enough to make anyone gag! I watched the movie because Samuel West was in it? but I do not understand why he would have accepted such a role. Maybe he needed money. Ian Tracey is a great actor - the only one with a vague redemption time, but his talent is wasted here. <br /> <br /> What about the rest of the plot? three imbek who are trying to get their hands back? yawn - or Karl ?? who is dead, but who is really alive in terms of people (almost like Rebecca Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece? While I'm ashamed to even compare these two movies), why not bother? Karl is so frightening that you find the circumstances of his death happy. <br /> <br /> At the end of this wretched movie, I thought they would all be better off with this boat!
