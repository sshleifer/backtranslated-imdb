WARNING! Don't even consider watching this movie in any form. It is not even worth downloading from the Internet. Every bit of porn has more substance than this celluloid wasted piece. The so-called filmmakers probably have no idea how to make a movie. They couldn't save their lives with good fun. It is an insult to every person. If you are looking for a fun movie - go look somewhere else. <br /> <br /> We hope this Mr. Unterwald ("Jr" is a good example of his obvious inexperience and intellectual childhood) dies of slow / painful death and NEVER make a movie again. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is even a waste of time to write something about this mess, so I'll stop right now and watch a good movie.
