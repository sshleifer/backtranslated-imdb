The thing that really gets me about this movie (that is, the film that makes me physically sick) is that someone actually paid for it. There is no purpose for the existence of this film. It's not scary, it doesn't make sense to provoke, it's not fun, it's not good. It's a cyanide sleep. In the case of DVD, Blair Witch, Evil Dead and some other decent films compare it, so the filmmaker's despair is obviously obvious. It's never been anything ever done; it's far, much worse. The allegations of an "extremely shocking end you never forget" are equivalent to one tonne of stinking horse stools. Please never waste your time looking at it in the trash because it can make you sterile. The man who wrote this film should consecrate the Writers' Guild member list and never film again. Because if he thought it was a movie worth doing, he probably didn't have much to offer in the future. Zero stars. Mai Grod has mercy on every unhappy to see it. I'm going to vomit now.
