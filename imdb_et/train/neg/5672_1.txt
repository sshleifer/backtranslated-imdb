I am ashamed that I have this movie in my collection. The most redeeming factor for a DVD is a short film of bonus features. My vote for this movie is a big fat zero. Don't get it wrong, I'm a horror girl. but I want a story behind it, not to mention that I prefer to happen to evil people, not to look at what seemed forever, the snuff of animals. The acts of brutality interrupt painlessly long silence and bad action. If I were forced to compare with another movie, the only thing to remember is Cannibal Holocaust. Bad, boring, pointless and completely awkward.
