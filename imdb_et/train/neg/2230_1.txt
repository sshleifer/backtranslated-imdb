If you want to see a slowed homosexual karate expert, you repeatedly try a hard wannabe Mexican gangster, that's your movie. if not, choose another DVD from the 20c trash bin, the only place where this movie belongs. acting was so terrible that I had to force myself to look. Kate changes it so cool, but just another cheap b-class gangster movie with 2g and a key, bloody street and danger. I will not buy or rent this movie if you are not going to stone stones and prime, edit and act is not important to you. it is really the worst film in human history !!!
