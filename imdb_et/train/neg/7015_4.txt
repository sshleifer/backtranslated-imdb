"54" is the movie of the notorious "Studio 54" of the 1970s, which is a hangout for the social elite and party clubs. The film features Ryan Phillippe's main character, based on the studio's actual employee from 1977 to 1982. <br /> <br /> The film's problem is that it is all shining and styling and non-existent. He's trying to be really grimy and probed like "Boogie Nights", but ultimately it is a lower wannabe. Mike Myers is grateful for playing Steve Rubell, a cocaine snoring club owner. It's just a little comical role and if it was Myers' best attempts to slip a drama like Lemmon and other comic artists in their time, it's completely unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> "54" could have been attentive and interesting, but instead it is just another stupid teenage flick that is not entertaining or even remotely related. Look at your threat.
