As the front cover says, "The village of our age for our time". <br /> <br /> I had to investigate this filmed version of Hamlet directly after watching Keneth Branagh's version and it was really disappointing. <Br /> <br /> In this version, the game, including sexuality, has a different aspect; one very very homosexual Osric and interesting communication between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think this time (60s) was a very good version of Hamlet, but it can't be compared to the full version of Branagh. <br /> <br /> Just a note ... I found a video in my local video store (Australia) and I'm actually looking for Keneth Branagh's DVD to buy when there is such a thing. If anyone knows one, tell me.
