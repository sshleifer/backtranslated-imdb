Oh man, what was Sam Mraovich's idea? What was it that was involved in this "movie" thinking? Morovich is almost the leader of "Ben and Arthur": director, writer, manufacturer (also EXECUTIVE producer!), Wheel, lead - you name it, he did it. And she (Moraovich) sucks more than anyone has ever been breastfeeding in every department of cinema. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with this movie? Everything. There are about two gay lovers, Ben (Jamie Brett Gabel) and Arthur (Mraovich- * groan *). Ben and Arthur want to marry a world where everyone basically hates gays. To make things worse, Ben's crazy "ex-husband" (they're not exactly divorced), Tammy (Julie Belknap) steams mad that Ben left him with another man and asks Ben to come back (saying he might be too, too!) and Arthur's Christian devoted, too hypocritical, equally dirty as Tammy's brother Victor, is the devil that Arthur would turn straight and then try to kill him after throwing him out of church. <br /> <br The film is an absolute chuck with so many goofes (ie, Ben and Arthur fly to Vermont to marry - they go to Alaska Airlines and Vermont has palm trees; they fly back on a FedEx merchant - I hope they were in a wooden box plus lots more, lots and more) and plot openings to launch (Victor calls to kill Arthur's "Final Plan", which later becomes "The Final Deed"; Arthur and Private (intern) Detective are flying the same car, blah, blah, blah) . "Actors" are all very bad and are five up; the script is ridiculously terrible (one example is "I don't understand? You don't make sense! I have the point, it's the one who makes sense!") and there's a lot more wrong with the "movie" I get But don't write them all down. <br /> <br /> But the most ridiculous but incredible thing about "Ben and Arthur" is that Sam Mraovich thinks he has created something that is truly fantastic (see his fake comments). Ben & Arthur "and his obvious comments on YouTube.) Mavovich is a narcissistic, and his arrogance makes him unaware of how terrible his name is. <br /> <br /> To conclude, forget that all the bad movies you you claim to be the worst film that has ever been. Arthur "strikes them out of the headline, even Paris Hilton movies look like" The Dark Knight "compared to the monstrosity known as" Ben and Arthur ".
