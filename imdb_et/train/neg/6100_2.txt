Attempt to bypass (this is not an overview of good intentions, of this final product), this film is poorly written, excessive and badly directed. The story was obviously potential, but this story is not in this film anywhere. <br /> <br /> Clara Barton was a human. He was passion, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness and self-consciousness like our rest. You don't know about the lead actress's performance. In fact, apply it to the character of each movie, but for Barton: Each sentence is a call. An epic upper speech over an inhuman robot. In fact, the only scene that plays well in one meeting, and I realized it was because he was calling! Every idea he has is incredible in his context, and he comes up with ideas that sound like they are living in the soul while searching on the spot. For example, when he sees a wounded man, he starts thinking about the needs of the battlefield and defends the soldiers and puts white flags on, etc. As played in the movie, he has no chance of such a detailed, well thought out idea in seconds. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie robs Clara Barton of his struggles. It robs him of his humanity, and it rather weakens everything he did because the script is written in a clich√©. The writer does not know Clara Barton and his script seems to have been based on an article in the Britiica encyclopedia. (Yes, they had them back) But hey, nice Technicolor! (who cares)
