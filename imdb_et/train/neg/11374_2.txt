I couldn't associate this movie. It didn't involve me intellectually, emotionally, or aesthetically. The dialogue was very tight and engaging. I couldn't connect and take care of any character, and I find it hard to find a lot of what's positive about it. <br /> <br /> I have read it to understand some of the more uncertain aspects of Catholic theology. I admit that as an atheist, I am probably unknown to many of the finer details of Catholicism, but I have also seen many films that deal with religious issues that have touched me because their subjects are universal and not based on professional knowledge or beliefs.
