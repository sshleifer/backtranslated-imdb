Serum is about a crazy doctor who finds a serum that should treat all illnesses with the power of the mind. Instead, it creates a monster that has to eat human flesh and brains. The crazy doctor creates some zombies from the frames and has some problems. Every activity has a very long lead, where many scenes get to know acquaintances. The crazy doctor's nephew gets into a car accident and the crazy doctor is trying to use his new serum boy. The results are not good. It is a C-Class movie with OK, but with some problems and continuity errors. There is not much zombie action in it, and the effect, though sufficient, is nothing special. You can move forward slowly and enjoy the scenes. Watch for nudity and bad language.
