this movie only comes with a second star because I work in downtown and wanted to destroy it. the effect was pretty good - I heard it was never a more expensive Korean film. it is the most expensive and still terrible, it makes a huge waste of money. I rented it so that I wouldn't complain too much about what I paid for, but it was a few hours that I would never get back. Plot holes are plentiful. terrible action everywhere. I don't want to give up watching this movie, life is too short. if your friends want to see it, run. I can't stress enough how bad this movie was. <br /> <br /> Where the hell came from another dragon? why didn't he appear earlier? how do they have dinosaur rocket carriers only 500 years ago?
