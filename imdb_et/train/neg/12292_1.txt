We brought the joke of the friend of this movie and we could play our worst joke. The film is hardly traceable and the actor is terrible. The worst child artist and Hasslehoff gave non-standard results. The plot is disgraceful and, at the points we were so bored, we were wondering what was going on in hell. It's trying to be terribly awful, but it's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Just terrible
