In this game, it is (dis) an honor to be the first game I've stopped playing in the middle and felt that I could crush bits and then burn. Congratulations. The first and last Tomb Raider I ever play will assure you. <br /> <br /> Fig: Just writing this word made me laugh. Not one. Also, there is no character development. Finally we have a girl hero who can take care of her, who is not * beep * mary-sue, but unfortunately she dresses like a slut and her boobs are huge. They had to seduce a sexist boy who you see. Anyway, whatever he does, goes to the tomb after he grabs the grave as he goes. Why does he do it? I had subtitles and t.v. as loud as I could, and I still didn't think anything. The development (or lack) of him, his two friends and * the villain * was ridiculous. There are also levels that you have to go through so you don't give any clues as to what you need to do, and you literally are bored like hell tombs HOURS trying to find out what the hell you should be doing. A motorcycle is one of two (especially two) courses (believe it is not fun) that you are at ATLEASE HOUR if the NO point is not visible. That means you hit another driver and boys who are driving with you or driving towards the tree that you start in the hour from the long track OVER. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: You know that you shoot the levels very well for a long time, there are basically no recording points, no story, no character development, no different options in the game, most music on the longest levels in the ear Bleeding and doesn't give the player any clues so they can stay longer than going to a non-existing plot. <br /> <br /> Fool F * ck one: those that sound like an idea idea. <br /> <br /> Fool F * ck Two: I agree. Who needs character development, plot or game play. <br /> <br /> Todd: I'm sorry, but these ideas seem to be a very p * player player. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: Close Todd. You're fired. <br /> <br /> Game: Everything he does is shoot. Of course he can fold, SHOOTING during the jump, or hit while SHOOTING again. But flipping, jumping and kicking do not erase the fact that everything he finally does is SHOOTING. CAUSING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Music: Intro music is extremely beautiful. I love listening to it. The music of the game goes from being allowed to cut off your ears. Visuals: In view of this game made in 2006, I was expecting visuals to hit me. Well, I was blown, but certainly not in a better way. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This game is plot-less, the character's confusion is hardly dressed in unmarysuish (THANKFULLY) among young women who go through some boring reason (which you can't tell) for some eternal tombs with an unimaginable picture game . AFTER THIS B.S. NEXT !!!!!!!! It gets two stars that have women who are not in trouble with a girl (no matter how rare she is) and beautiful music.
