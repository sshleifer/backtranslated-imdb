Like most of the comments, I saw this movie under the name The Witching, which has reissued the title. Apparently, necromancy, which is the original, is better, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Most witch scenes still contain most of the necromancy scenes and are still bad. In many ways I think that the added nudity adds at least some entertainment value! But don't be fooled by only 3 scenes of nudity and it is among the people who stand around the variety. Diabolique rumpy pumpy isn't involved! <br /> <br /> This movie is so terrible that it's hard to know what to criticize first. The dialogue is terrible and right in the Troma closet. At least Troma is an oral language. It is a straightforward boredom that is personalized. It works with Pamela Franklin (Flora, who is a conquered child in Innocents), which is the worst with her high-level voice. Welles just looks forward to waiting for his wage control. The other women's union has a horrible face, so I don't know why Pamela thought she could trust the movie! And the doctor is pretty bad. He looks just like Gene Wilder. <br /> <br /> It has been filmed in the movie without any reason to change and the editing is negligible. This is because sorcery is a copying and pasting job, not that exquisite. Only lighting is OK. Sound is also terrible and it's hard to hear with a terrible new soundtrack that never disappears. The "ghost" mother is also a garbage, but the actress is so badly bad that she at least inadvertently laughs. <br /> <br /> Really, this movie (at least witchcraft) is only unnecessary. It can't have a lot of sensible fans, because it's pretty secret and I found it dull-numb! <br /> <br /> The best bit was when credit was rolled - little enough to say the worse apology for a movie like STEP!
