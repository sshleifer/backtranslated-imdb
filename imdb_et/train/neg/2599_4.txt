I have a very cheap DVD and I am completely Drewbie and this is probably the only constellation where this movie could be of interest to anyone. <br /> <br /> Early Drew-film, he's looking great and he gets quite a lot of really cute scenes about him, like a shower scene, a sexy dance scene, quite a lot of sexy outfits, etc. He never shows a friendly charm that we know about newer movies. <br /> <br /> The film itself is quite average or lower than average, and much more than it was made for television than for cinema. There is no real horror or tension, and dialogues are often nervous. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part is probably the end, because honestly you don't understand it. But maybe there's nothing to understand. But at least you won't end up with what you would expect, and it will come much earlier than you would have expected. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this movie is only for Drewbies.
