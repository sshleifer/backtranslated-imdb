It has been around 30 years, and I still hate everyone in this movie. It remains the worst film I've ever seen. After seeing the film, I have an allergic reaction when I accidentally saw him on television. <br /> <br /> Then I got it - against my better assessment - with blood pressure. However, friends who came out of the theater swore an oath that would never change the choice of their movie. Almost thirty years later, we still carry mental scars from this film. <br /> <br /> In my deathbed, one of my regrets is that I waste, hoping that this movie can get better. It's never done. <br /> <br /> If you are ever given a choice, you would prefer your eyes to sit on this movie. <br /> <br /> I signed up for IMDb notes, I just hope I can warn others about watching this movie. If I can only save one person for this, my existence on this earth is justified.
