To quote a movie: "It's better not to know. Better to forget. The best thing is to give up." Oh, irony. <br /> <br /> A ghost story with all the technical improvements to the Hollywood horror movie, but a terrible bad conversation after the first quarter of the movie, and you feel you're being preached as a cumulative character dialogue can be summed up by a bad cop and a Jerry Springer show. Maybe install a movie like The Hitcher, not a horror movie set by Russia. The result is that a potentially large device and some potentially large gore scenes are wasted and simply become foolish, not scary or meaningful.
