see that there is a team of bomb experts in Iraq that will let your time go home. <br /> <br /> This itself sounds boring. Every time a little headline appeared, it tells us how long they had left, it just caused a movie that didn't have a plot to drag it on and on. hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go home. <br /> <br /> I have something missing. I'm a very good fan of warfare if they have done well. It was a "jarhead" syndrome. A film that was sometimes beautifully photographed, but cinematography does not stop it from being boring and pointless. <br /> <br /> Stay out of the slow-release cartridges. they would have been able to save money and get the film material with this gun from other films. <br /> <br /> I did not have any emotional emotional affection for my mother's head, I was constantly hoping she would die for her carelessness. In fact, the film would have worked much better than it would have been. <br /> <br /> I read some comments and felt that I felt that those who were in the armed forces did not want it and everyone else loved it. I've never been to the troops and I'm with them. It's a pretense. 3 stars are for cinematography.
