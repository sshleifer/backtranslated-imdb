I think it is a noble effort, but ultimately poor. Before seeing the film, I felt that "Bartleby, Scrivener" was unclear. After that I see, I still do. Unfortunately, I think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on and they are disturbed by the unnecessary changes to the film (from 1850 to 1970, moving from New York to London). Even Paul Scofield's magnificent talent cannot save what I like, that is well meaning, but it is mistakenly trying to film Melville's metaphysical classics.
