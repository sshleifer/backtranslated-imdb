Have I seen a worse movie? Perhaps only "Manos: hands of destiny" pulled more than "Dukes". I was more fun than poking a giant plot of holes when the film gave me at some point.

He shrugs and moves forward because Knoxville or Scott doesn't know what he's talking about (nor does we). It was like the engine died and restarted. <br /> <br /> A few times when General Lee flew through the air, it wasn't even that exciting. Something I haven't seen in the TV series. <br /> <br /> Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scot. The best part was when Bo irritated Luke's stealing. The only reason this works is that the script actually hides it (though about).

I wanted him to disappear. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson comes on a great screen. He felt he was one of the best actors in the film. It will tell you how this movie is terrible. He's a goddess. <br /> <br /> At the top of the movie, I was rooted in Boss Hogg and the bad guys to demolish all Hazzard counties, starting with Willie Nelson and his companions. A nuclear bomb would have been enough. <br /> <br /> It is not meant for uncoupling a movie, but for getting rid of the frustration that can be a truly warm-hearted film. br /> <br /> If we only delete and start ...
