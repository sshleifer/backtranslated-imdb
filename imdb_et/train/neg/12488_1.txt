0.5 / 10. There's nothing good about this movie. Action is one of the worst I've ever seen, which is really amazing that everything is terrible, not just some here and there, all. Direction is a joke, a low budget is hopelessly obvious, the score is terrible, I wouldn't say the film was changed, a brutally cut would be a more suitable phrase. It combines successive killings, voodoo and tarot cards. Hull. Hull. Hull. It's not scary at all, special effects are hopelessly flat. ridiculously bad. Writing was terribly bad. Cinematography is sometimes very cheap and very grainy, and camera work is terrible. Again, what really is in the movie is how bad all the participants are. Cheesy.
