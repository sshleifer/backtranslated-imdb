A completely ridiculous "period" film is just a sheer excuse for its extensive and graphic imagination of the hero's relationship with the "beast", a monster allegedly appearing every century to rape some women. It is pretty much what he does, and portraying a movie about a beast is really terrible; it is basically a tall man with a fur coat and a huge PVC pipe with a hard surface that splashes a lot of white liquid. Fake animal porn, fans, I think maybe it's a real turn on. However, I was interested in horses that had sex with public squares.
