I can't say it's ever made the worst movie, but personally I think so, because when it first appeared in theaters (1), the initial buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted that we watch it, and we actually STOOD IN LINE to get tickets, and (2) it is still the only "serious" movie I remember when the audience started to wilt at some point and basically smiled the rest of the way through the film. When we reached the infamous (and infinite) snake fight, I think everyone gave up. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I promise is shooting a lush location. Oh, and there are Bo breasts, though his action is so pure that nudity is unerotic and doesn't cost much more than Playboy's pictorial. <br /> <br /> The "dramatic tension" of this film is a terrible act between Bo and his terrible direction. Snake fight must be one of the most incompetent "action" sequences that have ever been filmed. But this is one of those films that is bad enough, it may be worth looking at the unintentional sense of humor. Definitely the worst movie I've ever seen.
