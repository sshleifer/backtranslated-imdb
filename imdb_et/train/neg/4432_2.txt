Tatie Danielle is a hesitant old man who tortures his loving and unforgettable family alone. There's a little subtext that may be from the French colonial past, but it's mostly only for Daniel, who is doing things like giving up a deliberately small child in a park that will soon begin to grab his teeth with broken fingers. Unfortunately, this is not happening here. It looks good and the actor is good and there is nothing really wrong with the concept, but it's just so SMUG. God, this movie loves itself. It is a pity that it is not nearly as smart or funny as it thinks. The only push in the show - sorry, movie - comes from Danielle's nastier and nastier, and the only surprise comes from the increasingly unlikely ways he does it. That's right: just like a sitcom, which is what's added to the "bonus" of grandness and 110-minute work.
