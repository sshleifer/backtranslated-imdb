A small town is being attacked by a horde of vampire blood clots. The only hope is a lonely avenger and a group of ragtag survivors. <br /> <br /> In 1993, "Darkness" appeared after the release. It's easy to understand why - it's loaded (and I mean freaking) with gore, and it's energy and enthusiasm, like what is found in other budget cult samples like "The Dead Next Door" and "The Ravensback", Actually it is quite contagious. <br /> <br /> Although this may be true, it is unfortunately not enough to store it. The movie was filmed in Super 8, so the picture is grainy and dark, so it's very difficult to see things (it would have been nice if it had overshadowed the scary mullet.) The grille is also a sound made up of tedious Casio Keyboard and even more annoying Death Metal (seriously, what are these missing horizontal shocks and bad metal?) Although one does not expect an Oscar-worthy performance, the actor is still an amateur hour, as actors sometimes seem confused rather than frightened or threatened. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'm sure budget gorefest fans love it. But everyone else wants ribs to have a little more meat.
