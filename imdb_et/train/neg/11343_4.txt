1. Review 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Jim Kammerud & Brian Smith): Drab and un-spectacular anticipated aftermath for the original classic animated "101 Dalmatians". Yes, the film continues where it ended in the first, but the problem is that it plays like the original. One of the greatest things in the original was the story that it is not. Animation is also very un-spectacular for Disney and all we get is the same characters that go through the same story. When Disney stops our boredom with aftertaste and do it again. Etc. We are likely to stop renting or buying this mediocre ticket.
