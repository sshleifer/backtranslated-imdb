It should come to you when I say that there is a dirty movie alone in the dark. Frankly, it is like a wet monster defecated, ate a result and then vomited. The final product is still out of this movie. <br /> <br /> It seems to be based on an ancient (!) Atari video game that has something related to the Earth's gut portal, demons and ancient civilizations. Something about two worlds, the world of darkness and light. (Guess what we are.) Oh, and 10,000 years ago, the genuinely super-duper advanced civilization of the portal opened demons and had a blast, then destroyed civilization. That's why we've never heard of them, just enough. when he was 10 years old. He is a hot artifact trail of advanced civilization. Carnby was previously part of a secret institution called 713, which has tried to find out what happened to this long-standing civilization. But Carnby believed he couldn't find the answers he was looking for, so he left the group. <br /> <br /> But these beasties are out and they get their harvest in different ways, for example, by splitting them, splitting them in the middle, implanting neurological control devices, or simply killing zombies. Yeah, that's another zombie movie. <br /> <br /> It's so distilled that I can make a plot. It is quite complicated and incomprehensible. It can be seen in similar films that the seemingly scientist / adventurer sees things at once, and when we communicate with the public spiritually, it is a lot of fun. But when scenes become an attack without a perspective or context ... not so much fun. <br /> <br /> Operation is terrible, except for Slater, who (although she almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie) showed that she was able to bear a working load. He had to; get it - Tara Reid is the curator of the museum! To be honest, I thought I saw a lifetime casting when Denise Richards was cast as a nuclear physicist at Tomorrow Never Dies. But Reid fits with Richards, which is a funny emotion. Hightlights include Reid's pronunciation of "Newfoundland" as "New Fownd Land", Reid, who gives most of his lines exhausted, throat monotone (as if he had been a week before filming), Reid - a curator of a museum, remember - you spend a lot a movie from the Middle Ages, wearing top and hip-hugger jeans. Oh yes, he was as plausible as Jessica Simpson, who gave stock quotes. Oh, why do they have to be pretty stupid? (Note: I don't think Tara Reid sees all this good. She looks like she's in constant food.) Almost everyone else cast is completely forgotten, except perhaps Steven Dorff, who played Burke, one of the leaders at 713. Dorff's character was not terribly well developed, but there was nothing in the movie about the characters set by Tara Reid up to characters. But I ground. <br /> <br /> In any case, the amazing and superfluous storyline is harsh enough to keep the movie moving at such a staggering pace, but the director Uwe Boll throws into a distressing, desperate soundtrack; it's so loud that you don't hear what the actors say in some scenes! That can't be right. Perhaps taking into account the level of action, maybe thanks to Mr Boll. <br /> <br /> Oh, and a fun note. The opening moments of the movie include narration ... of words that are simultaneously indexed across the screen. Remember the first Star Wars? You now heard about the familiar Star Wars theme at the time the prologue crawled. Certainly there was no need for narration; Why do I need some doofus to read what's on my screen? Did the producers just look at the blind? Maybe it also explains why the soundtrack was so loud - they also watched the audiences. The narrator also had an inexplicable extra check on the first lines of crawling - then it lost. Bizarre. <br /> <br /> Alone in the dark, there is a harsh, frightening, frightening, inconsistent script and ham-hand control. There is hardly a remark. There are so many chaos that the audience is simply giving up the care of characters and roots for their death. Even in the dark, demonic creatures seem cooler and more advanced in comparison. <br /> <br /> Ironically, as there were only three people in the theater, I looked at it alone in the dark. I don't know if Uwe Boll designed this? I can't give the lowest rating because I had little hope that it would start - and because it never seemed to me enough to understand it. It's cruel though Slater redeems himself a little.
