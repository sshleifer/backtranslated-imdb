Looking at Smother was probably the longest non-real 90 minutes of my life. It wasn't a laugh; I never really remember a smile. Diane Keaton was a daunting as a medieval chain smoking dog hoarder, a textbook that suffered a mother's character, a relentlessly irritating woman who clearly suffers from a personality disorder. He is manipulative, binding, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic and worst, boring. <br /> <br /> I think I should briefly mention other characters, but why? It was just a long movie clich√© - dippy, socially unfair to a distant relative who just tries to break into "industry", terrible and long suffering, but somehow a loving father, a weak woman who just can "t take it any more (but eventually goes beyond the inconsistency and leaves home), a herd of ungunted dogs who like to chew pads when everything is away, etc. <br /> <br /> God, what to snore, I've never been a fan of Diane Keaton, and Smother reminded me why. , no matter how many pictures you made in your prime, his attempts at physical comedy were particularly humiliating. What was the director's thinking? <br /> <br /> Although I like Dax Shepard and even sometimes tolerate Liv Tyler, they were the performances were so weak and boring that it was clear that neither actor gave the film a damn. It was okay because I also didn't have Keaton's endless self-inflicted bullying intolerable and sometimes seemed Shepard's will against him is genuine. At the end of the movie, I wanted to defeat him. <br /> <br /> Awful.
