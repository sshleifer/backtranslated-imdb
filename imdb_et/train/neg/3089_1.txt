This movie is so bad, it's comic. Mystery Science Theater 3000, a TV show with three characters and parody bad films, used it to mock the movie. I recommend that you look at it (maybe on YouTube) instead of seeing the actual movie. <br /> <br /> Please do not look at Hobgoblin if you are not ready to stop in the first scene. In fact, this movie does not see the period. Please. At least not seriously. His jokes are not funny (at least), and you have a lot more fun watching a parody or a parody, watching a movie. save yourself. Read the book. Wash laundry. Something more fun than watching Hobgoblins.
