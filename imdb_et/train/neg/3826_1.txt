Damn, I thought I saw some bad west. However, it cannot be typed. Hell I think the eyes would be clipped to the Trinity triple function, which is designed to crash out loud. I don't think I can look at Ben Huri again without laughing my ass. Just really bad. <br /> <br /> But hey, if you like the stupid westerners who have the acclaimed stars, take a shot at Gregory Peck. It's just as bad, but much more fun. 1/10
