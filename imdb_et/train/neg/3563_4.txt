In most cases, this film seems to be a "television" effort. The direction is bent, the actress (except Fred Gwynne) is burned and soap. Especially Denise Crosby offers her features as she is cold reading. Only one thing makes this movie worth watching and it is once Gage comes back from the semester semester. There is something annoying about watching a child's murder, and this movie can be more than some who can do just that. It is absolutely bone-cooling. This movie only does one thing, but it strikes one out of the park. It's worth seeing the last 10 minutes or so.
