this movie was definitely the worst film I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen pretty bad movies. I didn't like how the film was filmed. all the actors are unknown and it seems like a bunch of friends came together and decided to film their movie. but it is absolutely terrible. I've never seen a worse movie. the story is so fake and I just found that it took a long time to finish the movie. there was no plot, it seemed that it hadn't started before filming. the story is too weird. I didn't like how slow it was to get to the movie point. there was no point in even filming the film. if you watch this movie, don't. you're just wasting your time.
