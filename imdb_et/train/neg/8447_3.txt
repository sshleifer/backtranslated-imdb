I don't know what I missed here, but I can't believe all the positive comments many people in this movie have made. I thought it was stupid and a little over the top. I liked the performances by Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker, but others were just ... bored. <br /> <br /> Now I like B-movies, I really do, but it was a little bit further from the alphabet to me. I saw someone comparing the humor and horror in it with the "Army of Darkness" and "dead" with Shaun, as well as "On-Re-Animator". You're gonna make fun of me. I didn't find this movie funny, he tried, he made an effort (maybe too much trouble), but I didn't think it was successful. By the time I hit the 3rd or 4th single lining, I drove my eyes and checked my watch. <br /> <br /> For many other movies that are always cool, there were definitely respects. Inside joke us horror fans. But here may be the lack of original thought. True, there were some nice special effects, good gore, but it can't carry the whole movie. The mutated Grant looked like a cross in the early stage of the Jabba Hut and the mutation Chet "Weird Science" (after he was a monster) and one of the foreign creatures / children of "The Explorers". It just doesn't work. I thought it looked like something that was a child of the 5th grade art class. Then Brenda was the woman Grant impregnated and chained. When the aid finally arrived, he looked like a giant bird waiting to jump. The design was once again unimaginable. Round meat colored balloon with face in the middle. * yawn * <br /> <br /> Now zombies - the more movies I see with zombies these days, the more I want George A. Romero to have granted them a patent and was the only writer / director about them. He is the only person to do so right now, except Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (but it was a comedy). Oh, and Danny Boyle, but they were Zombie different. Maybe Mr Romero has destroyed me for a zombie film because he has found his creative ability to make his actors sad, mute and ignite as if their joints had dried up and had no drop of synovial fluid, and their muscles struggled with the consequences of rigor mortis that was just before the animation revived. "Wheelsy" people just didn't have the right motivation ... they were terrible zombies. <br /> <br /> So finally I'll give "Slither" a 3, a few laughs and some nice gore scenes.
