Truly terrible movie. I didn't know at first that it was a Kiwi effort - but very soon I began to realize that all the characters barely speak of the covert Kiwi accents under the fake American. Why was it supposed to be in America anyway? - It could have been set in NZ and then the participants could have used their usual votes. Can anyone in the production team hear a terrible attempt to talk to an American accent? Bad bad movie. I am surprised that it has been going on for so long - how did it become? It just seemed like a very bad test for the Segal / Willis type of action man flick.A money all the money! When there was TAXPAYER money in this trash, I managed the revolution to get all the money back to the treasury. I still roll (get it?), With the absolute rubbish I just saw. Why did I continue to watch? Well, I'm a movie fanatic and help myself!
