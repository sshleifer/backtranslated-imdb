The story idea is great. Unfortunately, this implementation allows you to download. <br /> <br /> The film has no speed, one thing. It should be an exciting journey, but it's slow and more than a bit boring. <br /> <br /> I think the problem is mainly in scenario and editing. There are not enough obstacles and inversions to prevent strength, and there are scenes that really don't really move the story. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers should have dealt with it and demand a great rewrite. Unfortunately, if the manufacturer is also a writer and director, it probably won't happen. Other projects have been quite competent. <br /> <br /> It is a disgrace because it would have been a really good thriller for better writing, editing and directing.
