at first I was happy to know about a new superman movie, although it is great but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> A bad copy of Richard Donner's work, Lex is again a villain that no longer does anything, even playing Kevin's spice. <br /> <br /> The evil plan is the same as Donner's first movie, which is just forced. <br /> <br /> The script is predictable and simple (all the things Luthor finds in a museum or an old lady). <br /> <br /> The story is the wrong thing, it must be a Kevin Smith script and it may be better. <br /> <br /> I hope there's nothing new, not a copy, with Brian Singer and the new talent director. <br /> <br /> Everyone will read you later
