After I thought it was a masterful performance on two roles of a man on a snow river, why was Brian Dennehy replacing Kirk Douglas? It wasn't the same, without Spur and Harrison, as Douglas did. Perhaps he realized how bad the plot was - Jim would return after a long vacation to find Jessica what the other man was following. She couldn't wait for any girl to wait for that long without contacting her, and she couldn't find the competition. For the Disney movie, it contains an unpleasant language, plus a very unnecessary part when Jim & Jessica was hit without marriage - very much LAME. According to my family members, the intelligence of the viewer is quite offensive. I'll stick to the first one and try to forget that I saw the sequel!
