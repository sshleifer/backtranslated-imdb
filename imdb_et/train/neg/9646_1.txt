The lack of content in this movie amazed me the most. First I wanted to compare it with Rock On! but i'm really surprised to say it was the worst than Rock On! So the story of Frightening Ajay Devgan Jamming with Salman Khan and Asin is fun with me. The music was okay Khanabadosh was on the film's journey, the rest was bad! The Shah is still not learned from Singh. Now I was .. where did he come from Asin's fan, but he sucks in this movie badly when he didn't see a good look. My final decision is to look at Alad with my family, wasting my time here.
