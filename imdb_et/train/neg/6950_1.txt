We all knew even before Ron Moore's mini-series was Battlestar Galactica. That's fine. It just means he has to stand alone. It cannot be relied upon by Battlestar Galactica. If that's good, it's good on its own and Ron Moore has something to be proud of. If the reports are true, Moore wanted it. But when his mini-series runs, he has disgraced all the great actors who made the screen, not to mention the numerous screen workers. And that's what he's done. <br /> <br /> Yes, this mini-series is not a remake. I would not even call it transformation. This is a new production inspired by Battlestar Galactica. It does not happen in the Galactica universe, which has the same places and jargon and technology. This is not about Galactica's direct thirteenth tribe. Nor is it based on the legends and secrets underlying Galactica. Ron Moore's mini-series is a space opera, a race of momentum with a ceremony for Battlestar Galactica. Because when the plots go, he has little that is original or even interesting. I can pass the whole thing to you without a spoiler warning. But I don't do it for you. I just hit the most important point. Ready Now? Here it is: Just look at the trailer. It tells you everything that is a story. <br /> <br /> Yes, human creation turns a person and tries to destroy a person. (I think they forgot Azimov's rules again.) They look like people, so the whole foreigners have a thing. At least no time to travel. Oh, and a lot of fighting scenes and casual sex and violence. The end result was that when Moore pulled Galactica, which was a ceremonial arrow, it came more frightening than respectful. I mean, he couldn't even think of anything else? <br /> <br /> After a few minutes I wanted to see something else. I didn't care about any Moore characters because I could not identify them at all. This fact hit me when Cylons started their attacks. Armageddon on the planet, and I didn't give a damn. How frustrating. <br /> <br /> Moore's heroes, when confronted with an insurmountable obstacle, rather than overcome it, rather than a tailed tail and rescued their pants. After all, this was the only way to save humanity, yadda yadda yadda. They took a safe exit instead of risking their lives to protect others. At least the nuisance is not apathy. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Ron Moore's mini-series was just an action without a goal, a movie chair, forever running, but nowhere. And I wanted it to end. And by the time it was over, my vitality was sucked from me. Against my will, I was becoming a meaningless, breathless zombie, probably the type that this mini-series likes. I needed to upgrade myself. I needed - and I swear it's true - I need to look at Babylon's 5th episode. Two episodes, and I felt much better. And happier.
