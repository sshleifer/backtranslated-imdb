I got a copy of this movie, I thought it was the 1964 film "Zombie Bloodbath", one of its alternative titles. This film has a better price on this site than the above-mentioned title; which may mean that the other is really bad! This movie is too bad; Apparently you can't go to a movie that calls itself "Zombie Bloodbath" and looks forward to seeing the masterpiece, and fairly lives with the title that is displayed ... but it all seems very old and tired, which does not help the terrifying effect and the fool. It's just your average nuclear reaction that causes people zombies and the like. Etc. The film starts with a sequence that sees people's melting and that you can find out a lot about what you are; Low Quality Zombie Garbage. The movie has a lot of gore and it's really a good job, otherwise the movie would have been really boring. Zombie Bloodbath also looks very cheap and experienced by inexperienced filmmakers! The main impact seemed to be Romero's superior dead day, although it can really be almost anything that contains zombies and gore. It just goes down to a predictable and meaningless end, and generally I can't say I was impressed!
