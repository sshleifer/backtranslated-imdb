By 1941, Columbia was a full-fledged studio and could produce the film with the same technical polar as MGM, Paramount or Warners. This is the best thing to say about Adam Had Four Sons, the leading soap opera, featuring the almost inaugurated performance by Ingrid Bergman (first in American film) and Warner Baxter. Bergman plays French (this was a time when Hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as the other) who hired Baxter's four sons governor and stayed (one interruption due to the 1907 stock market accident) until the boys are adult men, who serve in World War I. Almost all the people in the movie are so good-looking as Susan Hayward as the woolen enters the middle? he is the only observable person in the film, although he clearly directs Bette Davis and Vivien Leighi; is it also the first in its long-term order of alcohol roles? but the script remains saccharin and the end is completely disgusting. No wonder Bergman turned to the "Decision Valley" drawn in the same way in four years.
