I'm running a group to stop the use of comics, and I just spent the last 2 months of horror stories from comedians trying to listen, "The last comic stands". If they don't have a good agent, they won't even have the chance to play, so more than 80% of the comedies who turn up have been rejected before they can show someone they have a talent! If they do, I was told that it was "pre-determined" when they get a second chance. So what a TV viewer can't see is not the best comics in the United States. <br /> <br /> When the comics show it, most of them don't get IMDb credits. I know this because I made a credit for all 6 seasons "The Last Comic" and I can't pay for the work of the producers. It's really shameful. A month ago, I asked, "The last comic stands on 7" on Facebook, why manufacturers do not give IMDb credits and I was banned from their Facebook page !!! I'm not a comedian, so I don't have a personal contribution. I want people to know the truth. I don't like using ANYONE and that's why I've been helping comedians. Comics use HBO, BET, TvOne, and other cable networks, but NBC is a big three-core network, so those responsible should be ashamed to allow this exploitation. <br /> <br /> Please watch this video comedian who has fallen victim to: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
