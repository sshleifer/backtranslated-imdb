Perfect little cruelty ... I doubt if one shot lasted more than regulatory-MTV 4.4 seconds. Amazing casting, even worse than the Kusminski version (reminder: he managed to fail Juliet Binoche and Ralph Feinnnes). But hey-rich got what they deserved. Dark and incredulous Heathcliff, reduced to a golden zippered angel, a weak and angelic Catherine, depicting a chubby, melon-breasted heffer, bright and weak Linton, is terrible, and innocent Isabel gets the cruel intentions of Sara Michelle-Gellar's character. 15-year-old Eddie Bauer and Abercrombie and Fitch donners-take. This thing was done for you. It's a half-hour long music video where everything is given to you; you have been saved from the uncomfortable need not even to understand the complexity of the characters, but even from the initial shock of their actions. Attendees tried, but as I mentioned earlier, they were improperly recorded. Decent photography, but editing takes place in high school television production class level. I ask you all: read a book or even rocks; see its previous versions, even Kusminski; but stay away from many future rumors during which you will not get a free commercial premiere.
