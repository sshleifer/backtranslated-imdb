Don't even bother with this movie, it's bad if it is judged by its own achievements, but compared to the original 1972 (which is classic) it's just terrible. And BTW, somebody commented that the 1972 movie is bad about the book. It's silly, movies should never be judged against the books they've taken. These are 2 completely different art forms (as if it were necessary to note it, but probably also). If you used this criterion for all movies, "2001" is a miracle, and so would "Forest Gump" and "Lambes".
