First of all, I had only doubts about watching the DVD box and reading that it's about collecting teens by the lake where they do or something. Any such film with such a prerequisite has failed, even for the first time, except for the first Friday, 13th. I just thought it was going to get a little better. It wasn't. I usually think that every movie has something you can do about it. It has nothing. <br /> <br /> Take advantage of yourself and find something constructive in 80 minutes. Similarly, give yourself papercuts or eat dirt.
