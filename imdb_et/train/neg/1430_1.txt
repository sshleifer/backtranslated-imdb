Even though my Saturday night channels slipped, my friends and I stumbled over the film. First, Irish actress Pierce Brosnan as an Indian? Seriously?! His accent was so much broken, although his character was apparently Scottish. Next, I was surprised that this film was made after playing at least twice James Bond / Agent 007. This film plays stereotypes, an inspiring professor's figure. The girl who played the pony should be paid to keep her mouth shut. And this movie got a prize? I can't believe it. Brosnan is an attractive man, but we wanted to seriously think our eyes after 10 seconds of viewing. We exchanged "Kicking and Screaming" about it, and we wanted to go back. We looked at the children's classic "The Indian in the Cupboard" in the night of 1995, where Iroquois was also discussed. The next line represents our desire to escape: "Take me out, the ground eater." From "Gray Owl": "If you don't like it, you don't have to look."
