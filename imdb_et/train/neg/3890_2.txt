A really unpleasant movie. Although Rick Baker's special effects are quite impressive (when the stomach changes), it has no other redeeming qualities. Like many 70's movies, it feels like you should keep a long shower and clean the mucus from yourself. The characters are equally unpleasant and the plot doesn't make sense.
