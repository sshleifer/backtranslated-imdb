Frank Sinatra plays a former soldier and a frustrated writer, a lively and hard drinking who returns to his downtown hometown and reunites with his stranger brother (Arthur Kennedy), now a city with his uninteresting wife and troublesome daughter. Frank participates with gamblers Dean Martin, unshaven swimmer Shirley MacLain, and has some laws, but what he really wants to do is write and live with a good woman. An over-simplified drama based on the soap opera, which plays the role of MacLaine, which in turn is "colorful" and embarrassingly sentimental (his drunk "After You" is still highlighting the film and professionally handled). Director Vincente Minnelli follows it in a straight line, but he is surprisingly strange with alcohol and most large scenes are flat or dense. The image is incredibly beautiful on the widescreen, for fine eye details and composition, but the story and these characters are captured. ** from ****
