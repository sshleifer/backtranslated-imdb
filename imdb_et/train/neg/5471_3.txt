A typical Troma trash, this dirty 80 is considered to be one of the "highlighting" of Lloyd Kaufman's notorious production studio, released a year ago by "The Toxic Avenger". "Toxic avenger" is much better than you ask me, but this demented splatter flick is still durable; Make sure you leave your full brain power on the door. The events take place in Tromaville, a small town that proudly says it is the world's toxic chemical capital, and they certainly do not lie. The safety requirements of a local nuclear power plant are of poor quality, saying the least (even Homer Simpson has never been this unpleasant) and toxic waste penetrates into a nearby high school. The first in a state of intoxication is a stereotypical nerd, who starts dropping things out of all body cavities, but his death is thought to be an accident because he didn't have at least two microwave ovens! Oh, humanity! Soon after, nuclear currents will also affect the planting of the weeds in the school and the matter will really start. After smoking in the common room, the school is considered to be the most beloved couple in the school with a giant worm that lives in the basement and feeds teenagers. The Nuke 'em High class is making a barrel horror film. The dialogues are so stupid that they damage your ears and makeup effects that give the word a completely tasteless meaning. If you like faces that melt, break, or split, it's definitely a must-have! Unlike the above-mentioned "Toxic Avenger", this film suffers from a really empty and longer moment, where nothing happens, such as when Chrissy and Warren try to find out what is wrong with their hormones. Raw humor is not as effective as "Toxic Avenger" and exemplary performances are unforgiving amateur. Continue only if you are an avid Troma fanatic.
