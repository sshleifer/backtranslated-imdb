"Tapeheads", breakable, intermittently funny music video business, could have been a perfect comic short and the stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are meaningless chaos afflicted. They play two semi-automatic security guards in Los Angeles, starting their own company, Video Aces, which makes fun videos for groups, parties and one body star. It is too bad that the filmmakers had to lay the dark sides of the current time (shenanigans, with crooked politicians and his henchmen who did not do much, except for the primary strength of the film, sending up a musical culture. In the late 80s). Nonetheless, Cusack and Robbins create a few originals here: nerdy, but loose, street-based, without hipsters or posers, these men have the same wavelength of walnut and they will never miss each other. They're pretty comedy. * 1/2 from ****
