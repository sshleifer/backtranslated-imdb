It should definitely earn an "O" rating or even a negative ten. I looked at this example at the age and the sample jumped around the shark in series 7. However, this episode is proof that the show has jumped into shark. Writing this is lazy, absurd, self-conscious and not even worthy, like Beavis and Butthead. <br /> <br /> It is quite possible to be ridiculous and still fun - Pirates of the Caribbean, Count Mommy, Monte Cristo - all "fun" movies that are not taken seriously. However, it is so ridiculous as "it's the worst I've ever seen." And really, this is Stargate's worst episode I've ever seen. It is absolutely terrible, and it comes from someone with a star gate in their basement. <br /> <br /> I like to sell all of my Stargate props, most seriously.
