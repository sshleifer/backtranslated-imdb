This review also includes the first movie spoiler - so if you haven't seen a movie or want to, but don't want a spoiler, please don't read this review! While this movie should be about Christian and Kathryn's meeting for the first time, the film is a bad copy of the first cruel intentions. The actors they represented, Christian Phillippe Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellari Kathryn are really very poor. Also, the dirty, filthy rich boy attitude that the original actors did was not able to repel. It is absolutely terrible that some dialogues were literally - not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen attentively enough, recognize it. The plot also has contradictions - if it were the first Christian and Kathryn meeting, why is a Christian in love with a girl at the end of the film? Probably he had to be in love with the original film for the first time (with the character of Reese Witherspoon). <br /> <br /> The commentary on photography / "You Could Be a Model" comment end was completely flat and didn't add anything. In general, it was a waste of time. I can't believe they did cruel intentions 3.
