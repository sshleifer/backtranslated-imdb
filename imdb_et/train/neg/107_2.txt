If the "Zombie Chronicles" team ever reads this, here are some tips: <br /> <br /> 1. In a "Twist Ending" -type movie, it is not a good idea to open a credit card ALL BIRTHDAY in FILM. It tends to violate the violations, you know ...? <br /> <br /> 2. I know that you did it on a racing session and - in order to be fair - you worked wonders with your budget, but please hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at once. Joe Haggerty, I look at you ... <br /> <br /> 3. If you intend to make a part of your movie in the past, do it only if you have time and costumes. <br /> <br /> 4. Twist ends should be a surprise. Of course, we don't want twists that don't make sense, but denote "revelation" as soon as you enter a character? This is not a great idea. <br /> <br /> Tissue for boys who are trying, but frankly, I wouldn't have them ... <br /> <br /> Only for zombie graduates.
