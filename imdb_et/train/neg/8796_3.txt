Medium viewers looking for some internal coherence in a movie should probably give this one. This creates the same feeling as the curious array of individual images that seem to be interlinked but never compatible. <br /> <br /> Although this isolating approach to creating a certain cinematographic assembly can turn to a student or critic who is in the inner language of contemporary filmmaking, it is completely irritating and has forced us into ordinary citizens who simply fell off from their companion. Avoiding availability may be a deliberate badge of Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but it comes to me when Andy Warhol warms up. The only redeeming property I find is in production values ​​and they just don't intend to cut it all. <br /> <br /> This is one of those productions where you watch and listen, and look forward to developing some thoughtful and meaningful ideas in order to preserve all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes. Sorry. Calligraphic loans start to roll unexpectedly as your interests begin to blend. I get the same amount of awakening and reading that I think are very aware and thorough about the film that never gives anything really clear. Ideas and pictures without an external context are not my idea for fun. <br /> <br /> Call me a phillist who travels through Hong Kong's streets, looking for a sliced ​​sushi in a bowl. <br /> <br />
