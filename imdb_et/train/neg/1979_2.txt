Hmm, Hip Hop music for the west. Modern phrases like "cool" and too many others to follow. "Sistahs Are In The House"! Microphone packs CLEARLY are visible on Li'l Kim's back. I can't just continue with the mistakes made by the director and editors. <br /> <br /> Actress is not as bad as I've ever seen. Women did well with the poor script. <br /> <br /> There was a strange hearing in Louis Mandylor's mother tongue. <br /> <br /> Girls are beautiful. Costumes are fabulous, though completely wrong. I just can't believe they would drag what might have been a great story. I feel like I think this movie is full of tricks that it would play well inland. <br /> <br />
