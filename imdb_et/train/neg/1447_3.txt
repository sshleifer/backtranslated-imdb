The year 1934 was when the Shirley temple played three big films and really started to make the name itself. Unfortunately, the studios had to experiment to see what the public liked the most. Two of these things sang and danced. The second was a short, interesting film that kept people out and depressed. You know other keys to Shirley's successful films. <br /> <br /> This movie did not achieve any of the above, despite Gary Cooper's and Carole Lombard's stars, and despite Henry Hathaway's very good director. In addition, there are too many parts of the speech that just become boring and too many arguments between Lombard and Cooper. Besides, you did not get the normal feeling-good end that the public wants. I think they learned after this movie.
