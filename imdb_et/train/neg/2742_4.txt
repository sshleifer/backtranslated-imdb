I just happened to surf this movie channel. my first reaction was, "Oh God not again!". It is so pure play retard these days that has become pretentious and honestly despicable. for some reason i missed it ending. maybe it was my confidence in the actors, hoping they would give me some joy. <br /> <br /> and certainly Ken and Helen can work. It also moves to the right to the end and actually makes a point. <br /> <br /> Helena bonham carter also surprised me by its character. it is the central side he uses to keep distance and regret. then again he has a soft side that just looks for love. the only thing that surprised me further was the character of branaghi ... it was the triumph of the show, the film itself is not unique. <br /> <br /> See if you are an actress student ... if you are looking for pure entertainment you can skip it. it's sean penn serious! oh my, it was a little rough it didn't include a couple of jokes ... not for escapists.
