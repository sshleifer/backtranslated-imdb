As for HEIST films, it is quite weak. Consistency is pretty bad, there is not enough character continuity to really feel that you understand some characters. Peter Falk is great, and he's one of the reasons he deserves to look. Falk has some great features, like "he's back, it's going to buy some deposit" or something like that ... there are some nice scenes, though they're entirely due to the efforts of the participants. Direction, script, and editing are pretty bad.
