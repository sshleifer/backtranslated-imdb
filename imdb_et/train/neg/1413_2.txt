I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is an attractive, attractive and talented actor. I'm sure it would have been a good movie if something happened. Nothing. It's short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes too long. After an hour of frustration, I scanned the other 20 odd minutes. Exceptional. <br /> <br /> Freeman plays an actor who has not worked for a while - exploring what he could play as a cashier in the shop. He visits the supermarket where he works. Nothing will happen. He decides to go home and go to Arby's, Target, car wash. Nothing will happen. They talk about their lives. Nothing will happen. Never. <br /> <br /> I don't get it. But I also can't Bill Murray's "Lost in Translation" and "Broken Flowers" flaps. If you like these movies, maybe you like it. Many people find films such as bright, charming, or - for reasons that flee to me - find the dialogue exciting. A common setting in the films of this movie is the long silence / silence after the actor brings out a line that should be meaningful. We know that makes sense, because it takes two minutes on the screen. Sorry, I have to be a Philistine. I can't get it. For me, such films are neither funny nor charming or thought-provoking. They're just bored. Why? Because there is no comedy. No drama. There is no tension. Don't laugh. No intercourse. No action. Something to watch. In short, there is nothing I go to the movies. I can be bored for free. I see oddball / quirky characters in real life. I'm going to Target and fast food restaurants and car washes. These elements don't make the movie even if the stars do it. I pay to be entertaining. <br /> <br /> If you're crazy about Morgan Freeman and just want to hear him, have fun. If you want to skip Paz Vega, you can watch and listen to it. But nothing happens, I promise. The whole snoozefest.
