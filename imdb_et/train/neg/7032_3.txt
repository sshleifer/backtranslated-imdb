When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) begins his brother's death, he starts to suspect something more than "natural causes". The closer he reaches the truth, the greater the risk of his sister, Fiona (Helga line) and other local Satanists. They do everything they need to stop her nervous ways. The film is full of nudity and ritual soft heart sex. One scene, especially a young woman and a goat, must be seen as believable. Unfortunately, the gloss of the whole world cannot save the Black Candles. Most of the movie is a complete hole. Apart from the one scene I have already mentioned, numerous sexual scenes are not shocking and certainly not sexy. Action is best. Even the favorite of the genre Helga Line is disappointing. The plot really doesn't matter. Its main function seems to be to keep scenes of twin sex together. I only know one other movie directed by Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared to the daughters of darkness who masterly interfere with eroticism and horror, black candles come to be amateurish. 3/10 is about the best I can do.
