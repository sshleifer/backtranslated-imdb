It seems to me that I have had it turned on, it doesn't belong to it. After reading the glowing surveys (the director was a filmmaker in the sky for years, so he must have many spouses in the press ready to approve him by writing favorable comments). Look forward to solid action, atmosphere, tension, strong characterization, intriguing plot development and poetic moments. Unfortunately, "sixteen years of alcohol" does not give critics promises that mostly sacrifice these qualities instead of the special effects of cheese on a low budget (what was the cliché grid?), Unrealistic choreography and meaningless spiritual narration, cliché edits and camera corners. <br /> <br /> "Sixteen-year-old alcohol" starts interestingly with some beautiful locations in Scotland, but it's downhill. Unfortunately, instead of spending the time to build the atmosphere, create signs that we could take care of, or build tension - the manager decides to start driving with crazy self-evident heavy hands in double voice. Lead characters are so insecure and so badly behaved - the audience doesn't care what happens to them, desperate actors do desperate things ... like this movie! Even worse is "respect" (which is typical for a director who tries to pay his former masters) either completely cliché or convincing. Music is the only thing that raised and kept me in the cinema, but even that it didn't support a dramatic narrative that combines time with action. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the film became more and more buggy and honestly annoying. I was still looking at the whole fucking thing! <br /> <br /> I think I liked a realistic experiment in the movie, but even it was destroyed when they were often strange and abstract, sometimes with meaningless scenes. You don't need a big budget to make a really moving movie, so much has been said about how little money you need to make this movie, half a million is not a bit of money ... so nothing! Sometimes I mean what actors ... Or their agents think! <br /> <br /> Leave this turkey if you are not so much masochistic or pointless ... NOT MY THAT <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
