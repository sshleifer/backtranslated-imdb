The action was terrible and they got both sports injuries ....... not only did they get the skating rules wrong, but also the GIRLS hockey rules. You can't control GIRLS in ice hockey. You're also not someone BLOCK. Not everyone they have girls are grossly gross and big. I play hockey and I'm only 4'11 and I have been asked to go to schools like film. All hockey players also hate indicators. Many of the current girls' hockey players were once skateboarders themselves. Also skate A LOT faster than in the movie. I was embarrassed by the film, which gave people the idea that we were sucking ....... although I have to mention that it is difficult to move between sports because the competition is on rolls ..... some of these double movements made on the ice that you couldn't do in a regular hockey game. He mainly fired a man who is ill. It is also unrealistic for him to receive a HOCKEY scholarship during the show. It made me angry that the scholarship is usually used by someone who could benefit the team.
