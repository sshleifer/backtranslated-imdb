I've also suffered from hundreds of children's movies in the past, and I think it's one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1) I am angry that day and age that I have to explain to my children that Russia is not "bad guys". Also, Russian names like "Poopchev" are inappropriate. <br /> <br /> 2) The grandfather's birthday party contained an almost sexist joke in which he thought men would drink beer and women on the phone. Two other flies also use the word "crap" twice. <br /> <br /> 3) The whole movie is largely about the stereotypes and propaganda of the 1950s, which I thought we as a nation are proud to have risen. br /> <br /> All of this is just crude, badly animated, even worse written and not worth the time to watch.
