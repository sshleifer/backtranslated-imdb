This movie was one of the biggest films ever made ,,, it was all about making the movie great. Incredible action, awesome special effects ..... o wait wait, I have to think about a good movie. Well it wasn't one of them, it just sucked. <br /> <br /> What I want to know is what bone head should think this movie was 10. When I voted there was 206, God knows what's going on with their head. Now, as with every other vote, 8 or 9 was too high, but 10? Come on, what made this movie so good to give it 10? I know they are the same 206, who thought that Jean Claude Van Damme is a great dramatic actor.
