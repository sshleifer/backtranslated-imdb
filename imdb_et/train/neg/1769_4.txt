View 1 of 4/29/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mick Garris): A movie like Campy's vampire, Stephen King's film, has so many strange and funny elements that he's been watching for about 3/4 of the movie, and you don't know if this movie would have the King cult following the fans. This is the story of a mother and a son who are dreaming (a shape-changing cat-like, meat-eating, life-long, dead humanoid breed) moving from city to city looking for a virgin who feeds to keep her alive. They come in contact with a fairly ordinary upper-class people unless they are secret lovers and cats hanging out at home, night and night. Cats are dead to them, so they tried to keep traps in their yard. We see that they are attacking a couple of their necks (which is also my first film experience) --- hopefully making real cats will not harm the film. The boy is after a sweet girl that she has the impression until she becomes a "dreamer" and then she just wants her body. The uniqueness of this film is so much that it could have been better than any satirical comedy in suburban life, but the director is trying to scare you every few minutes until you want him to just get over and bring out. Ultimately, this happens and the film falls until it is a typical Stephen King final. The film is interesting because the king's humor is more than usual, but his strangeness is also very high, and what you have is the film that his fans will probably like and should collect, but a worthwhile movie experience doesn't cut it.
