The fans of Goremeister Herschell Gordon Lewis should look elsewhere for taking this film on their usual blood necks because there is little bleeding in this movie. Instead, Lewis decides to try and talk about a strange story, based on the favorable basements with special effects on the budget, which would probably have doubled if the pockets of their pockets were to change one day. Oddly enough, though cheap and very badly acted (especially McCabe as Mitchell), the whole plot's extremity keeps an eye on. Imagine what this film would have been with a decent budget! In general, this beer has a champagne flavor.
