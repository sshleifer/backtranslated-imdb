For film fans who have never heard of the book ("The Hill of House" by Shirley Jackson) and have never seen Robert Wise's production with Julie Harris in 1963, this remake seems to be bad. <br /> <br /> For those of us who have, it's just terrible. <br /> <br /> Poor action (what was Nezon's thinking?), Hessian computer accessories, and further away from Jackson's story, failed to recycle. > <br /> Take advantage of your original movie and rent it. It still scares the extraordinary effects. It is professional and plausible. <br /> <br /> Since 1963, readers of the book are much closer.
