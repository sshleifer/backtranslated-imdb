I have to admit I don't have a lot of New Age mumbo jumbos. When people exchange energy, I always think of how much kJ actually changes and how it can help solve the problem of global warming. When energy "reaches", I always wonder how they were able to break the laws of entropy and still have Nobel prizes. When people know how well instinct allows them to move in the complexity of their lives, they do not know how they do a simple thing like finding a train station. <br /> <br /> But this is not the first film with holes in the plot and most of them are perfectly acceptable and fun. If that were the case with "The Celestine Prophecy", I wouldn't burn this movie, but unfortunately it isn't. Every actor seems to be bored and unable to understand what he should actually do. This results in a lot of "Ah" and "Oh", as I tend to do with quantum physics to someone who really knows what he is talking about and pretends he understands. <br /> <br /> The direction is also empty. You can expect something from a man who did "What dreams can come up with" but hey, I thought he was well paid for the job and accepted the New York taxi driver: "It's your money, friend ..." only who seems to be fun, all the time bad guy JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. He is not only in the workplace, but one of the few participants in this film who may have some kind of cracks in this eternal and terribly boring era. <br /> <br /> This movie is similar to those dinner dates when you find that your date is actually a terrible cage that seems to be able to shut down. At one point, the words seem to turn into small ping-pong balls that are thrown incessantly in your head until it hurts. <br /> <br /> If you want time and choose this movie and attach the needles to your eyelids, take my suggestion: choose the last one.
