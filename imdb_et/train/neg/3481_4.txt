May contain spoiler. <br /> <br /> I say that anyone who is reading is likely to think that every plot will change right from the start. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie I liked. I didn't hate it against some of the films that offend your intelligence, but it all seemed too predictable when he came to the end of the happy end. Definitely funny bits, but few were original. At least it didn't go into the gutter. <br /> <br /> Christina Applegate looks fresh and Ben Affleck is working hard. Their scenes are actually the only redemption function. All others are cardboard clippings, including, surprisingly, James Gandolfin, who must do it for someone's benefit. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's harmless, but not inspiring, 90 minutes.
