It's actually a pretty bad movie. Idology is not as perverse as the movies Collins later did. But my main doubts about the film are that it is incredible and for a long time honestly boring. The whole concept of ex-SAS man who joins terrorists for any particular reason is not very convincing and you cannot help thinking about why this group falls from highly organized terrorists (who later become rather helpless). The film starts with a pretty powerful scene, but then tends to build a big final for a long time. In general, I think that a winner could have been an interesting 45-minute Professional Episode, but this story does not contain a feature film. Although this film was quite successful when this film started collapsing Collins's career, in the eighties it was mostly cheap and dubious gambling or army film. It is a pity, because he is actually quite a versatile actor, but at the end of the day Martin Shaw chose his roles more carefully and he still has a successful career.
