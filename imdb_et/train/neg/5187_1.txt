I'm not going to approach and criticize RAW theories. This means that it is a movie and movie site, whether the film is well done or not, and not the discussion philosophy of the website. <br /> <br /> This video really blows. This is one RAW talks about the head after another. Some of this is an archive video, so you see how it is getting older over the years, and it's pretty cool. Otherwise, the viewing experience is monotonous monotonous. <br /> <br /> This is a strange comparison, but I was thinking on Sunday afternoon when I looked at some Barbra Streisand starred * Funny Lady * (another really bad movie). After a while I was in Barbras, I wanted there to be one scene that he wouldn't appear: you know, "in the meantime, the other characters in the movie were something else ..." at the moment. But it was Barbra. Well this video is RAW * Funny Lady *. <br /> <br /> So, if your idea of ​​a good time is to look at the face of RAW several times, and at the corner when it attacks your theories, a flat structure that does not add any interest or understanding, then be my guest. For me, I couldn't take it in 20 minutes.
