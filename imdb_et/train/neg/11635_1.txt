Okay, this is a brief and lovely review of the gona ... Something that the film should have practiced made its life shorter and sweeter than it was. <br /> <br /> This movie is $ ^ @%. There's a good reason why the petition was over 40,000+ signatures. Everything demanded that Uwe Boll stop making franchise films. Blood Rayne is there in a great way. <br /> <br /> Jokes are good ... if you've never heard of them before. Action is descent, but u can really only blame the script. I don't even know for a moment if they even use the script. <br /> <br /> The film has little to do with original games. HELLO, if you have been playing games u know that the main branch has no real motivation outside murders like mass destruction because he slipped his toe or simulated. There is too much story for such a stupid movie. like I said. I can't even steal this movie. A person who says this is a more fun movie in 2007 .......... must look around, the news is better.
