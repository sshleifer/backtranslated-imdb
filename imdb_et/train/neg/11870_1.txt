This is the most depressing film I've ever seen. I first saw it as a child and even thought about it now really disturbed me. I know it was set at a time when life was difficult and I know these people were poor and cultures were vital. Yes, I get it all. I find it difficult to take, because I don't remember any light moments in the film. Maybe it was alive, I don't know. I'm pretty sure the action was the upper limit, and the direction and quality of filming, etc., was wonderful and I know that every movie doesn't have a happy ending, but as a family movie, it's terrible in my opinion. <br /> I do not recommend it to anyone who wants to entertain the movie. I cannot emphasize enough how this film influenced me as a child. I talked about it recently and all the sad memories came back. I think it would be heartless for Prozac.
