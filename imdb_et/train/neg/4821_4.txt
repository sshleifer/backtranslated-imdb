A fiction film (it reads from the story, though it has a "documented" credit) for a group of Canadian scientists trying to find big feet. (They want to capture one and then add a tracking device). Its a lot of scientific mumbo jumbo mixed, which is really a boring film for a bunch of people wandering around in the desert. Some attempts to create tension and intimidation, but to be absolutely honest, are not worth anything here that does not need to be seen outside of great nature. This is the perfect definition of the exploitation film, it allows you so much, look at Bigfoot, but in fact it gives very little. Recommended for insomniacs only
