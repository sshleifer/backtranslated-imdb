I saw it in an artistic cinema that also had "The Last Days" and some Charlie Chaplin films. Based on the quality of other features, I decided to give Immortel a chance. I almost went out of this movie and I LIKE the scientific literature! The story is placed in a futuristic city of New York, where Blade Runner-style sky ads and some similar discussions about cloning / synthetic people are met. Unfortunately, the scenario was not a short enough hour and a forty-five minute film. There are three groups in this world: people, artificial people, and Egyptian gods. Artificial people seem to have the upper hand and they control the city's politics. People are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation. Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid (designed on the large pyramid of Khufu and with a deteriorated exterior, leaving the pyramid with a smooth "cap". The pyramid is above the city and nobody on the spot understands what it is or why it is there. I didn't wear you with the plot, but there There are many unnecessary holes and many extracts. As I said, the film is influenced by Blade Runner and possibly Fifth Element and The Matrix. At the end of the movie, the UK, France and Italy were captured. The film is FRENCH but uses British actors who don't Speak French, so it's obvious that their French dialogue is duplicated, it's disturbing, and I also thought that switching back and forth between real people and animations is annoying. - Leave it out.
