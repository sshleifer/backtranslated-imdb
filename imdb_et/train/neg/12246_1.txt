*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** If a movie is reviewed only on the basis of a presumption, one might think that you are looking at an average animal-oriented horror shock. The plot is as follows. The documentary filmmakers group is heading to the island to film a movie with sharks or surfing the blood. (I live in South Africa, so it appeared in "Blood Surf." But this is not the case because the film surfing section is minimal, as their documentary has been broken with a rather large salt water crocodile. <br /> <br /> The script is a very terrible example: A good example of this is when a crocodile eats someone who is frequent in this film, no one seems to be a devil. because this movie had a very dubious character, the second thing that is very irritating about this movie is the fact that they introduce movies that are totally superfluous for the film. br /> <br /> It seems that the actor is mediocre. It would probably have been much more impressive if they did not have such a terrible script. a person seemed to be a hardened caricature and in this way none of these actors made any effect. <br /> <br /> The crocodile itself is big, over 31 feet exactly, and this magnificence is well represented by the obvious fake crocodile they've given us in the film. The death of the crocodile at the end of the film has been so ridiculously fake and has caused it to turn on the stomach. In the great cry of magic, the hero of the film announces that he has a plan that turns down from the hill and that the crocodile is lucky enough to be placed at the bottom of this hill. <Br / In conclusion, I would say that this movie is what you have to see so you can believe how bad it might be. What seemed like a good idea at this time was the terrible script and the overwhelming feeling of a low budget that all helped to create a really terrible movie.
