Who is Bettie Page? I certainly did not find out when watching this movie. What I have gathered from other sources was pr. Page was very demanding in the post-World War II period as a queen of "naughty" images, and that is the film. I never knew Bettie, a woman. His childhood in Tennessee was a combination of evangelical Christian upbringing and gentle home life, which is only hinted at. The film's gloss over his personal life and he gets instantly out of the movie, naughty pictures. Characters are introduced and abandoned within a few frames, but after Bettie's frame, there is a bra on her frame, Bettie's belt and stockings, Bettie's slavery ... etc. Film slides in black and white every time you pr. Page visits Miami Beach. Then we go back to our gray life tone in New York. Gretchen Mol represents Bettie as one of the darkest young women you could ever meet. When Bettie trusts a friend who remained a high school false student, getting A instead of A, one can only assume that there were only two students in her senior class. The most interesting part of this movie is how strange Mrs Naughty's photos appear in 2007. It is really sad that a woman's rabbit like a pig does not even get my room or You Tube hit. I'm not sure if this movie is badly written or if some crazy crazy editor created it as a crust. I recommend it only as a source for those who learn the history of odd underwear.
