Some other comments show that this film can scare you as a little child. (And this is probably all that is good.) <br /> <br /> But if you are a parent, this movie only does one thing: suck greatly - and so I don't mean it works, cutting or s.th. like this one. I'm just talking about a "plot" (if you call it). <br /> <br /> SPOILERS Before ------------------------ <br /> <br /> I don't want to give more spoilers than need (if you want to read it afterwards, you want to watch this movie), but once you've finished some school, it's just an insult to your intelligence. Looking at it, I was stunned most of the time because what happened was just that stupid. <br /> <br /> This includes: <br /> <br /> - UNITE formation (evil UN association) <br /> <br /> -> We just have to believe it is evil. is it even bad? if so, why is it evil? <br /> <br /> - An evil character in the form of a tattoo. <br /> <br /> - Calling Christ into your heart simply as a lip care <br /> <br /> -> because there is no one who reads the "true Christian" in this film, ever saying that silly prayer. so ... just say prayer before shaking and you're saved - no matter what? <br /> <br /> So, rating 1/10
