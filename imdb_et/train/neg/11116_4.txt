The woman who works as a photographer's practitioner goes home and takes a bath where she finds the ceiling in the ceiling. So she goes to find out that her neighbor is her photographer. This film might have had a large plot of land, but then a plot of drainage. The problem with this movie was that every ten seconds somebody heroin strikes. If they took scenes where someone heroin strikes, it would be a pretty good movie. Every time I thought the scene was somewhere, someone inhaled a white powder. It was really nice that this movie had a lot of drugs. It drew attention to the main plot and the great story of the photographer. Lesbian stuff didn't bother me. I was looking for a movie from art. I found a movie about drug use.
