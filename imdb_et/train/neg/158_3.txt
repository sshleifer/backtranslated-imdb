Warning Spoilers follow. An excellent holiday in the Antarctic base, where the actual events of the film took place. Other than that, libelous!, Scandalous! Filmed in Canada; probably a largely Canadian team and cast. I recently caught on the last half of this movie in Canada on global television. Nothing else to say, how profoundly terrible I was, the blatant piece of American historical revolutionary propaganda; and starring Susan Sarandon of all people! I can only assume that the Canadian-born director Roger Spottiswoode was forced to make the USAF film heroes as a real rescuer, as a small private company based in Calgary; Kenn Borek Air.
