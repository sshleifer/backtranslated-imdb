One, if not the worst, film that came out of Britain in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This medieval lecher story, who "seduces" two teenage cleaners, who is a babysitter with his babysitter and his wife's husband, has nothing to redeem. <br /> <br /> For cage, uncomfortable, and unrealistic, this movie will film the depth as it is unhappy with its funny, provocative, intellectual and controversial attempts. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst thing about this movie is how George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finner's strong cast of such a flat script is completely sewn. Not surprisingly, this was the late Andrea Dunbar's only work on the screen. Fill and say garbage at each level.
