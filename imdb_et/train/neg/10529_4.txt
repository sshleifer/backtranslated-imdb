1 review 12/6/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Walter Lang): Disappointing music for character development, in my opinion, from this very famous Rodgers and Hammerstein piece. There are a few good songs and a good comic imagination by King Siam Yul Brynner - but the movie doesn't really do a good job of presenting the situation and settings. I can only blame the scenario and some actions on why we do not fully understand the characters and their situations. I know there may be a bit too much to ask for music that is meant to enjoy songs and dancing, but even this part doesn't differ much for me. The main story is an English-speaking woman who arrives in Siam to teach children European things. Later we explain that the king is actually the biggest student. Rita Moreno (Arabic - Latino) has a language that is forbidden romance, and a former lover who causes some complications, but nothing really pleasing. Deborah Kerr, the main female character of Annie, is OK, but not so convincing. The king learns a few things because of his presence and then the movie disappears as he does. It's really a small story with some songs and dancing, but not so much for the viewer.
