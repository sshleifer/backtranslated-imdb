(There are spoilers) Homicidal nymphomaniac whore Miya, Kari Wuhrer, takes over 18 years of birthday life and car, although she is too embarrassed to admit, collage fresh Trent Colbert, Kristoffer Ryan. At the end of the movie, Myia not only breaks down, but also gives the poor innocent and na√Øve Trent a lesson to get dangerous nuts samples and keep them so long that he doesn't become one. <br /> <br /> Roy, Burt Young, for some hot and heavy deeds, is hanging around the rider's seat at Miya's rear seat. Roy is either too drunk or stupid to realize that Miya is nothing but his stranger daughter! Outraged that Miya does not want to take her with her Roy almost worships her only to interrupt her first year colleague Trent Colbert, who plunges into the recreation area, wiping one of the drivers. <br /> <br /> Seeing that Miya jumps into the Trend car and two are off, which turns out to be the strangest car experience ever put in the movie. Getting all the cars to the Northeastern United States into the car will end the murder and shootout with the country's soldiers, which will then lead Trent's parents home, where they will be held hostage. It is there that there is another wild shootout between the crazy Miya's entire SWAT team reinforced by local police and state soldiers. <br /> <br /> You expect a movie like "Hit and Run" to be deliberately or unintentionally funny, but that's not the case. In fact, the film is very worrying how Miya treats everyone in the film that she is even touching her perverted and childish father Roy. Driving the trend all over Northeastern Mijas to get the poor slippers in the motel with whips, handcuffs and an illuminated candle. Miya also gets to the owner of the motel with horny Mr Foster, trying to give him his weapon because it is part of some strange game. After Foster keeps up, he's gonna take off with Trent, who's cold in his motel room, in a wallet of about $ 400.00, but he doesn't bother to drive his car. <br /> <br /> You need money to pay for gas to get your parents home for a night out of your mobile phone, from Miyna, to take his money back to his local canteen. As he draws on being Trent, Miya, who is now fleeing his law, is rising, and later joins his father Roy on the open road as he tries to move both Trent and Mija. <br /> <br /> Chase comes to the abandoned wear chamber Roy speaks of Miya running on a high, muddy road, getting him to know where his shotgun is hit. Roy was so busy that he threw off the pants that he forgot that he was unarmed. <br /> <br /> With both accusation and murder, as well as hit and run, they are accused of two desperado S&M / Tattoo boutiques where Trent gets pierced by his ear and nose and is dressed. leather and chains, by Myri with a matching collar and a dog collar. It is designed to meet with its straightforward and conservative parents at a Thanksgiving dinner. <br /> <br /> Having a running shootout with national soldiers, one of whom was badly injured, two law-based refugees arrive at Trent's senior Mr. & Mr Colbet, David Keith, and Elaine Martyn. all the local police forces with the SWAT team waiting for them there. <br /> <br /> An awkward movie that has a really annoying final ending that made you think about what the film is trying to tell the audience, if any. You felt a lot of sympathy for Miya at first, but when the film rolled over this infinite end that was evaporated as fast as the Death Valley ice cubes. Even when Roy was the most unlikely person in the movie, when the film ended with Miya, he was completely shut.
