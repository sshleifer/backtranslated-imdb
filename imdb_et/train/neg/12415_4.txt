I do not remember that "Barnaby Jones" is no more than a very sharp, standard detective exhibition, where, like every Quinn Martin exhibition, the law was murder, Act II was the leading character of the murder, Law III was the twist of the plot (the second murder) ), Law IV was a resolution and Epilogue was Betty (Lee Meriwether) who asked his father Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen) how he found out the crime and then someone who says something at the end of the show. <br /> <br /> One thing I remember was a late, great song by Jerry Goldsmith, composer. Strangely enough, the credit sequence that opened up made me see at the show and for seven seasons when the show was in the air. I also admit that it was nice to see Ebsen in a role other than Jed Clampett, despite the fact that Ebsen failed. I just wanted the show to be more fun than I remembered it for the first time. <br /> <br /> Update (1/11/2009): I was watching an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube through his American TV channel archive. Let's just say that I was more than Goldsmith at "Barnaby Jones".
