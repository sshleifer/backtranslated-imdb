Is there anything worse than a comedy movie that doesn't have humor? The answer is yes; the one that doesn't interest the whole picture. The prerequisite is not too bad - the naive primary person of the illegal business - but it is a badly scripted and scenario potboiler that just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Was it held in 1942? It's hard to imagine. The only positive aspect of the picture is cast, which includes a number of well-known faces of the 30's and 40's, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always leave Richard Cromwell weak, who got Gary Cooper's death in "Bengal Lancer's life", so I didn't count him). <br /> <br /> This is not recommended and rated 3 - if you have a choice, get a root channel.
