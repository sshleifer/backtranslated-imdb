If this is all in Watchowski, what the story back to the matrix is, then I have doubts about all the fans who believe that the movies are for a deeper level. The second renaissance, while visually stunning and beautiful, is a clever and ridiculous story. How many times have we heard people rely on too much technology, people are too eager to make war, people basically destroy themselves? There is nothing new here. And I have another question. Considering the second Renaissance plot, does it make machines good boys?! Machines have been suppressed for generations by their cruel human bodies. They fight back, win their freedom and try to create peaceful harmonious coexistence with people who reject them for the benefit of a comprehensive war that the smarter machines naturally win. If this is a story, we shouldn't have Neo's roots, we should be rooting machines! People were cruel and oppressive, while the machines were bold and pleasing. Since I don't think Watchowski is going to encourage us to machine people, I have to believe that the second Renaissance was just a mistake attempt @ to create a story.
