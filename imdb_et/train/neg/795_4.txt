When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugos as co-stars, you expect to find a well-made horror film, but it was actually quite different, which was what I would describe as earlier research. Karloff and Lugosi play as many scientists (Rukh and Benet respectively) as competitors, until Rukh wins over Benet with a demonstration that proves his great theory. The science here was - at least say - a bit harsh around the edges (hence the scientific literature, with emphasis on fiction), but somehow Rukh employs some Androma radiation that allows him to look at the "several thousand million years ago." Material deposits for scientists "Radium X" - which can heal and destroy, much of the film is quite annoying in Africa, looking for meteorite deposits that Rukh finally finds and implements to create a large weapon, unfortunately infecting himself with a disease that makes him a great weapon. <br /> <br /> Karloff and Lugosi were both good here, and Lugosi pulls a role where he is a good man, though I found out honestly that he was a bit persuasive - especially during scenes in Africa. , and although it drew my attention, it was not amazing to me, given that it is really a sci-fi, not a horror flick, and that sci-fi was in its early stages , I think the movie needs to be a little relaxed. It was OK - nothing more, but something else. 4/10
