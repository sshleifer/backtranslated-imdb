I bought this DVD without a prior reference, but on its cover were John Huston, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett. I found the Brazilian title very strange, but I decided to look forward to comedy, like "Switch". But the non-mind story is terrible and difficult to describe. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) is presented as an operation to change his sex in Copenhagen and returns to Hollywood, saying he must be Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) and demanding half of his uncle Buck Loner (John Huston) property. In the days of Myra and her alter-ego, Myron attacked her uncle's academy with young kinky sex. At some point, the dirty scenario is so confused that I believe the whole story was just Myron's mood for an accident. Unfortunately, the beauty of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett is not enough to keep this flick. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Homem & Mulher At√© Certo Ponto" ("Man and Woman to the Point")
