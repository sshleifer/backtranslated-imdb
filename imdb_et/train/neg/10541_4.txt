I went here for some first power, Lou Lambada Diamond Phillips' 1990 satanic serum killer yuppie hell festival ... <br /> <br /> 1) Lou Diamond Phillips was recently accused of his wife and may be in jail. I only hope that he finds that Armani's prison is a style: One of the jealous delights of this film is to see his police detective covered in a $ 4,500 design cab, a $ 7,300 designer silk suit and seen his $ 3,500 a month. Man Van Der Roehi's interior design. 2) Leading Lady Tracey Phillips has a gorgeous porcelain skin flowing from red hair, which always looks like a stunning breasts and amazing breasts. on the second half of the film, a pullover from designer silk, sadly sad to the saddle, even when he was ready to sacrifice to Satan. At least back in the 1970s, our demonic killers cut off their victims before they left, although there is something to say to leave a little imagination. After the last 10 minutes of the movie, I can think of her breasts probably. <br /> <br /> 3) Los Angeles-based professional psychologists can afford $ 4 million in accommodation at Mullholland Drive, overlooking Los Angeles that Brad Pitt would decide he would harden. In fact, the apartment unit used in this film is exactly what David Lynch's MULLHOLLAND DR. The only professional psychology I've been exposed to outside of this movie is everyone's imprisonment for wire fraud. <br /> <br /> 4) I forget my name, but the villain of this movie is wonderful and "How's it going", Buddy Boy? " the line could be the best forgotten movie, because "THANK YOU RIDE, LADY !!" CREEPSHOW 2. <br /> <br /> 5) Large metropolitan cities have large vacuum acids that explode into huge fireballs when somebody casts light on their lighted Zippo, so everyone has big public waterworks. no smoking sign has been plastered all over them, although the idea that smoking around hazardous water is, of course, pointless. And because Zippo lighters have to be filled manually with a lighter liquid that can often leak and the clothing gets stuck, my 7300 $ Gucci silk bag pocketed the idea that it is much more dangerous. <Br / 6) The tricks of this movie are impressive impressive and one of the fun things to look at is that you are not looking at computer-specific effects, but the real stuntpeople is risking life and limbs to contribute to a film that has earned almost universal BOMB ratings when it comes to the release of critics . <br /> <br /> 7) The film's Satanists always amaze me: there is a man who has used some luciferous power supply and instead of doing something useful, making himself rich or creating fashion models with free sex with him, he owns a bag of ladies and lets them spread outside of people's flats. Speaking of being a man who is indestructible, he can fly and be able to put himself in the body of others - and yet, in the final conclusion of the film, he commits to constellation Lou Diamond Phillips, but he does not have a sense to live with Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo Creed to make sure he wins. <br /> <br /> And on and on ... Tracking the beer with the company of smart cracking friends. You will have fun as long as you firmly refuse it seriously. <br /> <br /> 4/10
