This "film" is everything that is bad with modern film. unnecessary slow movement, unnecessary flipping / jumping / confusion, unnecessary signs, unnecessary dialogue. (Is that a word? Well, it's just invented I, Robot.) <br /> <br /> What happened to practicality? (i.e., car garage, skin spray) the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is card sweeping in a cafe. <br /> <br /> What happened to respecting women? (ie the blacksmith does nothing but worsens the doctor for the better part of the film, but he still wants him. WHERE IS TENSION? I tell you where, good looks and not admiration or common ground) <br /> <br /> What happened to a detective who identifies? Smith did nothing but sat around and feels for himself, complaining to other people and when they said something that caused thought, he was down. it is so a lame way to get a story from b-c-d etc ... it was OK once but not several times in a row. (Speaking several times, what was "I snore and don't listen to you joking? Twice in a scene?) <br /> <br /> What happened to the small parts of the film, which is somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to promote life-saving appliances? Shia LaBeouf (child) is in the film for two scenarios, we know that A-worsens women and B-knows Smith ....... so COURSE we should take care of her and whether she gets harm or not. /> <br /> What happened to the hero? Let's not forget that there are people, women, and children everywhere where robots attack and save a person who has my opinion that I am familiar, and why he had to ride his bike through the air, showing off, while the doctor had somehow been able to reach the same distance within a few seconds. <br /> Don't get me wrong, I'm in for a spectacle, but I'm all breaking realism and meaning. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I've never really laughed so hard on the movie l i n for a long time, so thanks to Alex. <br /> <br /> I pray for the swing of the social pendulum for simpler techniques, simpler stories and simpler movies ...... but mostly with simpler techniques. <br /> <br /> Great Budget Action Movies: "You Must Die"
