I'd give it 2/10. <br /> <br /> I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> The story has been badly developed, for example, the cases were too short and short, so the morale was not clear. I thought Brenda Song did a good job, but Shin Koyamada seemed to have played a difficult role. I saw the need to show western elements, but there are also parts where Chinese elements are also needed! An example of a fraudster. His physical appearance was like a robot, rather than leaving something out of Chinese culture. The final and worst mistake was the false and distorted facts that were placed in the exhibitions. <br /> <br /> Others may point out that this is a "Kid-show" and therefore no such high standards are required. However, there are other Disney exhibitions, such as Mu Lan, which are much better in terms of development and presentation. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think Disney movies should be better explored and better planned. A good exhibition is not enough to just a series of martial arts movements.
