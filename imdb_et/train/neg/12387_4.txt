Lipstick is another glossy film failure. I'm trying to think of one good thing I could say about the film, and I have trouble getting out. I think the red dress that Margaux Hemingway was wearing at the end of the film was the best part. Writing and scripting was not the worst thing I've ever encountered, but it could have been much better. The lipstick was very pleasing to the eye. Sets were very shiny and nice to look at. The cast was okay. I felt that Anne Bancroft's character was the only feasible character in the film. It was sad to see Chris Sarandon wasting his time.
