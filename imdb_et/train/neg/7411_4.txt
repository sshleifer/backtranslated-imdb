An interesting idea that involves an alternative dimension in a hospital. He reminded me - Stephen Kings "Langoliers", "Kingdom Hospital" and old twilight zones. Atmospheric strength was great. There were also some very smart moments that always have this melting complaint. The story was full of vague references, which prompted me to believe that all the subsequent worship / ghosts / strange bat demons and a rather stupid heavy metal ghoul thing would be explained. And it was that the dark floors gave me serious. Based on my viewing, the film does not give NO EXPLANATION, which is behind the events. Although there is always some ambiguity in such films, you can expect. Dark floors brought them to new uncertainties. I don't expect things to come from a real tape, but I shouldn't leave the feeling "Huh? .. is that? ... Did I give up? Maybe I'll miss the chapter?" Dark Floors left me with deeply unsatisfactory suspicion that "It was all a dream", which is a shame, because until the last roll I was very much on board and enjoyed the movie.
