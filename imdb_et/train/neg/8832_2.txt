I had a very difficult time through this move. It was slowly slow and sometimes thought of when the film plot would actually come to life. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to flow slowly and thought when it ended. I am usually the person who likes the indie file from time to time, but it didn't match what I was looking for. <br /> <br /> They seemed to be trying to get out of this movie a lot. At one point, it seemed to make it political, which I am not a big fan of films. If you are looking for a slow moving film or not at all, then this is the right movie. As for me, I felt like I was wasting 2 hours when I could do something else.
