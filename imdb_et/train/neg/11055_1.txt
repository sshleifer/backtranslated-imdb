I watched this movie on high definition television. I'm in a wheelchair due to neuromuscular disorder and want to watch a couple of movies about people with physical disabilities. <br /> <br /> First of all, I found the main owner somewhat noble and exciting. His message about people with disabilities and the life he used to fight for people with disabilities to recognize and integrate into the labor market of society is great. And my problem is not with the real person who did these things. He was a big man. But this film is totally hypocritical and contradicting the message it preaches that I found it offensive. <br /> <br /> First of all, they didn't let anyone in the title role have a physical disability. Of course, they were competent actors, but it seems totally unfair to preach hiring people with disabilities and then not really to repel the film. Additionally, in one scene in the middle of a movie, a man sees walking on a crowded podium with only one leg. However, this scene CGI is so obvious that it is disgraceful. What? Didn't they find any real amputee for the movie? In 5 seconds, the CGI effect was much more financial than just AMUTING ACTIVITY? At the moment of this movie, I found it so fraudulent and completely against the message he was trying to convey, so I came here with the bitch and warped around it like pathetic blasting. <br /> <br /> Draw it out.
