The film is actually too slow. There are some nice pictures, but it can't go beyond the fact that the movie is actually boring. You see a lot of watermelons and sexual intercourse when you eat melon and maybe a little more. It may seem like someone interesting, but believe that I look at it for two hours is not fun at all. Although you laugh several times, but it's not really enough and it can be more desperate and unbelievable than fun. To disturb the boredom, the director tries to put some videos into the film. They are really colorful clips of absurd songs from the 1950s, but it's hard to say and they're trying to be so hard that it's really sad. How many times do you feel that the plot could develop into something that creates a powerful scene, but in the end it just somehow evaporates and that is. There are almost no dialogues besides clips to talk about. In any case, the director tries to be original and artistic. Personally, I can't recommend a movie. I believe that art should not be boring. During the forecast, the cinema was worshiping, which confirms my brief overview.
