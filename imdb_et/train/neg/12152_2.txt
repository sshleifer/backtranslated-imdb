Some news reporters and their military escorts are trying to tell the truth about the zombie epidemic, despite the "media control government". When making a movie, he does not realize that George Romero's zombie films only worked because he kept his politics delicately against most of his films ("dead land"). This satire is about as fine as a brick or a face that is overhead for this scenario. What is subversive or subtle to see a soldier who masturbates and destroys death? Was something nuanced about ads related to different movies? No. Moreover, the operation is evenly terrible, the characters are unlikely and primitive. Add it all and you have the worst, most incompetent zombie movie because "C.H.U.D. 2" will grow this ugly head. <br /> <br />
