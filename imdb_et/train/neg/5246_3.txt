The worst thing about this episode was the price of a 40 year old house. I'm going to introduce myself, saying I'm not a fan of episodes. If the story / participants / etc. is worth their salt, they should be able to convey most of the narrative without reading it, reminded me of a person who cannot think of the cuff but rely on the teleprompters. Psychobabel was tedious and boring, but some enjoy such a thing, it's not just my cup of O tea. They should have weaved, but at least made it much more plausible and interesting when it came from a psychiatrist or perhaps a newspaper reporter or something. Small things like Peugeot are at the house with a single semicircle on the carriageway, but it seems that he has parked his car in the tree under him, because it is not visible anywhere on the roads or real estate. Sloppy editing when he pulls exactly what is the 2 men you see on the driveway (which seems 100 times) walking around the car in the 30s and 30s when he pulls down the driveway of an abandoned house? Dolly close-ups were also overestimated, as some Jr. high drama student who first discovered the zoom function of their camera. I can still differentiate, but it can be almost as boring as it was. It pulled on and the real goal seemed to be to use absolutely all of Elaine's Newport convertible images. I assumed I could see the Chrysler logo and nice play when the voice told us everything about 8 players, the automatic top, and so on. The only good thing I can say about my place is that it ends sharply. There are no open ends, nothing explained or finished. Not that many would have noticed that I suspected that most had already changed or ended the channel.
