Returning by Cabin by the lake does not in any way rise to the original. For only one main character (Stanley) who returns to the queue, the movie is not even worth 2 hours of your time. I'm a big fan of the first movie, the story and action was really good, but that's one movie I never look at. This is basically the same as the results of the Urban Legends and Blair Witch follow-up, but with much worse action. I have personally seen better action in soap operas, it's so pathetic that you just laugh. I don't recommend this movie to anyone, just looking at it first.
