I had Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2 very impressive, but it's probably worse than both titles. First of all, I didn't like animation, very Saturday-morning-comic, but in some scenes worse. I liked some characters, namely Thunderbolt and Patch, but other characters like Cruella were mediocre. Cruella was truly outrageous in the original, but she continued the quality of the result. What he said was nothing to write home and his animation was kind of ugly. His artist Lars was also kidding to be honest with you, and Roger seemed to be smoking overnight. The talents of the voices were very good, especially Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt, with the exception of Jodi Benson, emphasized this accent for me. There were good moments, but the whole plot seemed to me shining and a surprisingly expanded TV episode. All in all, the 60s Disney movies and Jungle Book are the most memorable yet disappointing. Sorry, I only get this 3/10, it wasn't just my cup of tea. Bethany Cox
