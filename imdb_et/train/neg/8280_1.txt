Looking at this, I noticed mainly ad placements. DHL, Aquawhite Strips, Rockstar et al. This is one product placement after another. It is quite obvious how this film got money. Jessica Simpson's "acting" is ridiculous. Every Dick should never work because he plays the same flat character. "Story" is just the background for this very long commercial background. I can't believe this movie was considered a theatrical performance. The longer you watch this movie, the more embarrassing you are for all participants. The only small rescue statement is Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook, who don't get nearly any screen time for Jessica's cousin. I'm embarrassed when I looked at the whole thing. I recommend avoiding this.
