I found myself in this movie, at least in the beginning, and the credit given to me for this movie is Lacey Chabert, she was fantastic !! But that's where it ends. It seems to me to be very good to figure out who the killer is, and I like it when the film can disturb me completely, but I felt out and lied that they were always leading you in one direction and then maybe they decided to go to another they didn't hit him at all, it didn't mislead this very bad writing and planning, no one thought at all! <br /> <br /> I felt the film would have been a lot better if they were stuck on the plot you were leading for, nor did they seem to answer why the house of Professor Jane (maria) burned. <br /> <br /> This big loss as I felt it started as a relatively good movie.
