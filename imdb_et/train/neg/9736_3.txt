It is often said that Tobe Hooper was just lucky with his 1977 horror movie "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" and every time I see another Hooper movie - this view is only strengthened. Hooper seems to have wanted to make his version of 1990s such as scanners and Firestarter in 1990, so we're getting spontaneous. a film that has a couple of good ideas and the whole load that is borrowed from other films. Put it all together and you get a filthy, boring movie that most people would miss out on! The film brings the audience to believe that it may initially be a semi-decent intrigue, focusing on some of the twentieth youth experiments. The couple has a child and will soon be burned as a result of the experiments made on them. A few years ahead and the child is now an adult named Sam; but, of course, he is not a normal person and soon he finds that when he finds that he has the ability to put things on things. <br /> <br /> The star of the movie, Brad Dourif, who had seemed to be a good choice for her success in playing the child two years earlier; but in fact it was an indecisive decision because central performance is really terrible; and it is not helped by appalling supportive performances. Likewise, the inclined direction and dull script do not make the film's many preferences and the lack of trends continues with special effects that are very unrealistic and have nothing for movies that hang on it; all these were done a few years earlier. The plot is very slow and it's almost an hour before something happens, and I don't care about it even then. Soon it will be clear what direction the movie is going into, and it all comes from the annoying end you expect. The final confrontation is a great disappointment and there is really nothing explained during the movie. Not that any revelation would be interesting anyway. All in all, this is a waste film and another reason why Tobe Hooper is far from being a big horror director. Instead, look again at Firestarter.
