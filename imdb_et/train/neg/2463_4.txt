I don't know how to describe this movie. This is definitely one of the strange films I've seen for a long time. Sometimes it is very disturbing, but also boring in other places. Teeth torture scenes are very complex and can attract someone who is gore & splatter. I found myself holding teeth during some of the above-mentioned scenes. The smart thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and that's why the dentist is quite amazing. But if you are strange and strange entertainment and drilled with dust, this is the movie you were looking for. try it! <br /> <br /> My Rating: 4/10 (maybe a little too weird for my taste)
