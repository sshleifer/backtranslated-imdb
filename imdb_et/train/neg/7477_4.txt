A high-density tea film with a superb comic relief offered by the magnificent John Cleese (although he really sends his performance to Fawlty Towers). It seems that the shimmering sentimentality and the worst part of the movie that can be lifted during the nightmare is that Martin and Hawn have to "find" who they are and so on. See it at your own risk.
