I enjoyed Bilali's graphic novel when he came out, and I was surprised when I saw the trailer of this film and even more so when I found that Bilal had managed it himself. The film, however, was a big lag. The visuals are not close to the rich and sharp texture of the original art, and the story is badly said. It seems that Bilal has decided to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel and does not do it in very good works. <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was the relationship between friends and hatred between Nicopol and Horus. They were both in their right time and place, forced together. Mostly, they were funny and pleasant. Not so here. Nicopol has no noticeable personality, and Horus is a pompous twit who just wants to put it. Although the film is French, Horus doesn't have to be! <br /> <br /> We've all seen movies we enjoyed, but not recommended for everyone, for some reason or for other reasons. I would not recommend Immortel to anyone except perhaps a warning not to overcome their talents and resources. Bilal's master artist, but obviously not the master of any visual media.
