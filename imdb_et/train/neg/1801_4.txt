Istanbul is another of those expelled films that Errol Flynn made in his life in the last decade, trying to support his family and stay with the IRS. This is a remake of Fred MacMurray-Ava Gardner's film from Singapore a decade ago. <br /> <br /> Unlike studio products, Istanbul has the advantage of being an excellent golden horn right in cinematography. But Errol Flynn, who was exponentially old before each film camera, was too old to play this action / adventure. His scenes with Cornell Borchers are not really convinced. <br /> <br /> About Cornell, he is playing Errol's former sweetheart, who has amnesia because of a fire-rescue trauma. He both doesn't remember Errol and is now married to Torin Thatcher. <br /> <br /> But Errol has some nasty people, led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer, who are after some of the diamonds he's got. You have to deal with them. <br /> <br /> The best reason to see Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole sing and play the piano. Most people today do not understand that Cole was a jazz pianist, they only think of him as a singer. In fact, he was first a pianist, singing was a follow-up. <br /> <br /> Istanbul is a routine action / adventure movie for fans of this movie.
