The dubbing / translation of this movie is completely fun and offers unique entertainment in this otherwise boring and derived zombie swing. I'm not so hard in my life as I just look at Zombie 3 (and I've seen a very bad duplication, believe me). Seriously, filmmakers would be able to edit this movie again and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars. It's just so funny. <br /> <br /> But ... If falling on your couch smiles at the Fulci zombie movie duplication, it's not your cup of tea, then OUT ALL COSTS.
