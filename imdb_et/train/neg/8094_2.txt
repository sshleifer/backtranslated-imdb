Like someone who has read the novel and seen the movie, I have another idea why the film was such a flop. First, comparing the novel and the film is purely superficial. These are two different animals. <br /> <br /> The novel is probably meant to be satire, but it comes as a cross between tragedy and polemic. All comedy elements such as those that later formed the stylish foundation of the film version are coincidental to the author's cynical thrust. And that the author's whimsical white suits didn't mean that it's another Mark Twain, think again. A more appropriate literary precedent would be the surface and tails of Ambrose Bierce. Tom Wolfe is a clown of equal parts and a cage, more famous than the author, always looking for a new grist for his own absorbed mill. It is no wonder, therefore, that the excellent production skills and directions of film production were executed from the beginning. Unlike the true satire, which translates the film very well, the controversy is not based in any way or otherwise on generally accepted observations of human behavior, but on a consensual attack on certain people - be they real or fancy straw men - who have somehow earned the writer's anger. Any effort to create a successful filmed story or narrative from such a beginning must be a pure beginning without the influence or disturbance of the writer. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I also find pain in casting. It's not just that incompetent like Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith can't measure, but true talents like Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham and Morgan Freeman are either completely wasted or given roles that are just cartoons. There is enough up-to-date material for really great movie satire, but it doesn't even come close.
