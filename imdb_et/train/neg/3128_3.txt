... from this terrible movie! There are so many things wrong with this movie, exhibition, writing, directing, editing, etc. that it is amazing that something goes up and proves to be the absolute worst. Music! I note that the film has two composers. This must be the reason why every frame has music, the absolute worst D-movie style. They've never heard of "less is more". It was so painful to listen, I silenced the sound every time there was no dialogue, not that dialogue was so good. You have to give a damn to Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I am sure they didn't see such a role in their twilight career. See it at your own risk.
