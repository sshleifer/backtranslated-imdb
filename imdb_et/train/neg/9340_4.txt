What is wasted cast. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most disappointing films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Roger Ebert usually doesn't let me down, but I feel it after I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> The only excitement is to see Elizabeth's banks in her bra. This is a pity on this movie. It made so many promises, but it was like a dry transmission. <br /> <br /> It is self-absorbing. <br /> <br /> I can't express my bitterness deep enough while sitting on this movie and I hope I can warn you about the same disappointment.
