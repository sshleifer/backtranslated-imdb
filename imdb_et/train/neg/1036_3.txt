Ho-hum. The deadly biological weapon of the inventor (Horst Buchholz) is the risk of falling into the wrong hands. Unknowingly, his son (Luke Perry) has been working all the time. Enter the CIA agent Olivia d'Abo and begin the cat and mouse car and fire. It is also cast: Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and Aging Roger Moore. Moore seems to be confident that this confusion will not go with his better efforts. Perry fans agree. d'Abo is wrong for his role, but nice to watch.
