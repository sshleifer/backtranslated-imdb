Can the saints keep us, because this film does not help. <br /> <br /> Someone with access must tell Mel Gibson by email and say we need Beowulf's faithful production. Something that is actually something of an ethical poem that is the basis of all contemporary Western literature. <br /> <br /> Recent (since 2000) Beowulch versions make us two things. First, why is the story so much interested. Secondly, why are all these filmmakers crowded in the crowds. <br /> <br /> The only reason for this is that Lambert with this version (Beowulf 2000) was worse and needed 1. <br /> <br /> What's worse, some people look at it and get a false impression of the poem. How can an industry where Peter Jackson gets the literary transformation film so correctly get it so wrong. I really mean, the Roman Forum, when the Heorot model is too much. <br /> <br /> And please, horns on helmets? Save me. It's offensive. <br /> <br /> / hjm
