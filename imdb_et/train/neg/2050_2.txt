Not that "Ulli Lommel's film" filled me with hope, but I must admit that ZODIAC KILLER managed to sink under my lowest expectations. Recently, there has been a trend among young filmmakers to use digital video for their early projects that are good and good to give these children the opportunity to create a job without spending all the money in an expensive movie store. But many of these young filmmakers are also ready for the concept of film filtering to appear qualitatively as a celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video really works only in the "mockumentary" style because it never sees anything other than video. Here's the main problem with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching a movie looks like watching a soap opera with a murderer. It doesn't recognize watching a movie. And even more unforgivable is that Lommel is not a young filmmaker. He should know better. He should know that the video has horror (or even tension!) Almost impossible to create. Because of God's love, this man has been leading since the sixties! He may be the only director who has not been able to improve his career in forty years in business. And fortunately he also wrote the script! So you can expect complicated activities that do not mean anything, unreasonable behavior, and at least one truly pretentious plot element that leaves you completely dissatisfied. Please, please leave this movie. You thank me later.
