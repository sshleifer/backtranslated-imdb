It acts as a satire of the era of women's rights. Of course, this does not mean that COACH is a great experience. It runs the same way as FASTBREAK (which was better but still tame), and is basically a standard price. What I mean by the uninteresting nature of this film is easy to recognize. Anyone who earns time away from the usual job by training a number of ransomers who make their way to a sudden victory makes the waste. This is the same feeling you get when you look at it. A nice attempt to take the opposite man for an obligation, but I waited for better things.
