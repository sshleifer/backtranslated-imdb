Please, for God's love, don't look at it. Now, saying that I know what you mean, it can't be so bad? If everyone says so bad as they say, I have to look at it! Don't do it! It's like a terrible accident with a small infant and gasoline tanker. You have a frightening life ... the picture will never leave you! I only looked at it half an hour before I got really sick. Action is the worst I've ever seen, and I've seen Barbwire !!! If you risk taking your eyes off and renting this movie ... don't tell me I haven't warned you! Kate and the storyline is a trap! Zombies? Satire? Shaun of the Dead was great! This movie must be the same .... right? NO! Writing = fucking control = garbage operation = not working. Still not convinced? Then your soul will remain forever!
