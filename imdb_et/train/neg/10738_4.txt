It was purchased from a used DVD. It killed a very nice buzz that I had when I was playing. <br /> <br /> This is a bubble-controlled comedy, but it's um. filthy. The plot is ZANY !, but the characters are doing things that are so small and distracted and comfortably designed. I finally found that I watched it to look. <br /> <br /> Maybe the box is waiting for me more than the uneven, nervous caper film. (I know I know that the nominations for the box and the academic award do not mean anything.)
