Well, I rented this movie and discovered it was sucking. This is the family where the stepmother is and the same fools are fighting in the family, the cool son comes with her stupid camera and she likes to take pictures of the injured building and the strange things and the strange film, and then asks her dad to take her to the next trip and just agree etc etc etc etc. They go to a city where no one knows that it exists (blah blah blah) And the most annoying thing is that the movie ends and still understands what this FILM !!!! I've seen many mystery films, but it was the worst, frankly, it has no description at all and I wish I didn't see it.
