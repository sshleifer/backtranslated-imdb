It never knew this movie until I found a copy of that old VHS hidden deep in my dusty nightmare. The title of the box said that "insects" and illustrations in the back explained that it was just one insignificant and badly produced 80's horror film. Of course, they can certainly be fun if you don't expect an intelligent scenario and as long as you are not upset when you see the tremendous effect of a lot of cheese. Almost every important aspect that makes a horror film look worthy here is a "blue monkey" inferior! The plot is ridiculous and extremely irregular, exemplary performances are painful to observe and lack full intercourse. After the always popular trend of "popular" movies, Blue Monkey is beginning to deal with a new and unknown insect species that sweeps away remote doctors and patients. The creators could not circumvent the real origin of this gigantic excess critic! We all know that it doesn't come from space and it originally started out of the tropical plant. Moreover, there is no explanation of where this new type of insect comes from! As I said, don't get your hopes for an intelligent scenario. The first part of the movie is fun enough, with some nice looks and a pair of cool characters (80-year-old blind and alcoholic lady!), But the other half (if the entire hospital is quarantined) is terribly boring. Finally, the "blue monkey" is beginning to overpower the older (and better) films. As the climax approaches, they probably also lost their budget because the lighting becomes very poor and the boy of the monster game is no longer hidden. The "blue monkey" deserves a glimpse if you are really bored or if you really want to see that every 80-year horror movie has ever been made. B-cinema fans can recognize John Vernon ("Killer Klowns from Space Space") Roger, who is responsible for the clinic, in a small and pointless role.
