This is the worst documentary coming out of Canada !! I'm glad to see the guys haven't made the movie yet. All they want to do is get the movie and it doesn't have to be what they wrote. They change the script to suit the person they play. I couldn't get out of the theater fast enough when I saw it at this year's Toronto Film Festival. Please watch this movie ever.
