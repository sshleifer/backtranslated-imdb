Well ... in general, this movie was pretty much worthless and it is basically a horror movie that ended up with more comedy. I just rented this movie last night when I and my friends went scary to look for a scary movie. It was certainly not what we were looking for, but it satisfied us with humor. The participants of this film (especially Brandon) are so fake that it is funny. And especially that Tracy girl when she's been sitting in the room, saying to the clown. They show almost no emotion, and it's just so obvious they're acting. And when the clown looks at this black box of paper and grabs Mark, he doesn't even look like he's afraid, though the clown seized him and started attacking him. And seriously, would you just be JOGGING if you were subordinated? I would be sprinting for my life! (Even if somebody can probably cross this clown because it's like 300 pounds.) Not to mention that the effects aren't as big as every time a clown starts off Susan's head in the forest, when he throws his head on the table, Denise i and Tracy room when Denise throws her head back. Like the previous man's comment, the beginning doesn't make any sense and I don't even see why it was even included in the movie. So what was this movie in 2003? The music gave it to hear as it was done in the 1980s and the camera (?) Doesn't even see the professional. Half the time it seems the camera can't even stay steady when it is. In general, I have to say that I enjoyed the movie. I wouldn't want it if you are trying to scare me, but if you are looking for something that might be fun or laugh, I would definitely recommend it.
