I was accidentally watching this movie. I'm still not sure if I regret it or not. I felt like I was watching this film made by a group of film students who didn't make that paragraph. It plays every imaginable Hollywood clich√©, while dragging us into "corporations" is the ultimate evil message. The skill of this movie doesn't know. As far as it goes, he manages to offer his own spoiler. <br /> <br /> The story seems to be a fantasy world of computer jokes. Lead's character is an attractive teenage boyfriend with a girlfriend, but it's a programming genius and a visible hacker (guess), among the many other nerd-fantasy-fire-real elements you need to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I should also have known that this would be a z-movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... he tends to be a good tip. <br /> <br /> It can't be recommended by one, I'm afraid.
