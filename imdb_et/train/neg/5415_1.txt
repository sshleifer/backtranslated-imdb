Dil had a memorable film that brought a big director to celluloid, such as Indra Kumar. The film was followed by Beta, Ishq, Raja & Masti, all of whom were excellent. <br /> <br /> But every successful director gives some terrible movies with some hits. Pyare Mohan is one such movie. <br /> <br /> Although comedies have been said nicely, then the viewer can't laugh. Compared to the comedy films made today, it is stupid. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a movie and laugh, don't look at it. Because pathetic comedy only makes you cry. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is worth it.
