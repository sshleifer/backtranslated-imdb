I'm going to another person who, after years of using IMDb to search for films, has been motivated by Nacho, The Abandoned to create an account and comment. It was down to the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The plot was on the edge of non-existence, and no "puzzle piece" added in any way. Working was ridiculous and writing was embarrassing. The way this film supported and came is entirely behind me. The only thing I find was the insidious and repeated use of Anastasia Hille. (and brilliant sound design) When I was faced with the possibility of seeing this movie again or landing on wild cages, I would be difficult to make a decision. I'm disappointed that I can't give this 0 stars.
