I really have no idea why some people find that the power show is even far from interesting. Costumes are completely ridiculous, and they are also stupid at the same time. It is far from interesting about power allocators. It's just a higher-priced teleshopping that aims to sell very cheesy plastic garbage to the world's unsuspecting children. The remarks show that this is forbidden in New Zealand and what I have seen, I agree with their decision. Avoid this display at all costs, it is terrible and ridiculous.
