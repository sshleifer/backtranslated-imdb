As a child, the first part ("Little Mermaid") was my favorite film. It was full of great characters, songs and a fun family movie. A week or so ago I watched this movie for the first time. I believe this film was like most of the descendants and did not exceed their original. I think I know it because I have great expectations and I have grown up. However, this is not a bad film. <br /> <br /> It begins when Ariel has just given birth to a beautiful child, Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgana (sister of Eurailas), so they build a large wall around their house, located at sea. When Melody grows, she starts to wonder outside the walls where she is forbidden to go. The problem arises when Morgana tries to control seven seas. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give away a movie so you have to see it. I liked the voices being the same and again a wonderful song. I think this is generally a good family movie!
