Think about the ending of Grudge 2 as follows: <br /> <br /> - a man who repeatedly says the word Sunshine - a cowboy - a love story - Sarah Michelle Gellar cuts herself - and a horrible mirror <br /> <br /> OH AND THE BASIC SEAWATER. yay ... <br /> <br /> Not a good movie ... I didn't really enjoy it. The movie poster is very misleading and I found that it was just watching people watch it ... I can't believe I went. <br /> <br /> Save your time and money ... see Saw III ... a movie where writing makes you feel there was an effort ... <br /> <br /> Im Mike and Im
