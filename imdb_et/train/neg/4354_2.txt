this exhibition is terrible. no comedy, no plot. America is blind to give prizes to real exhibitions. I hate this show with 30 rocks. to be honest, I am so glad that they canceled this exhibition. Thank you CBS. hold two and a half men, hold Christine, keep the rules of engagement, how do I meet my mother who is not really funny but much more fun. this exhibition is hanging out with friends. with the same director, so it's fine. but keep this example and never bring it back. never ever. the only reason I didn't give it 1 rating is that it keeps my awake sleep. these are the types of films or TV programs I give. the only reason I was awake was because of the audience's laughter and I was waiting for the next show. I really want this show to be funny, but my opinion is stupid. very stupid. I don't understand why everyone loves it. my opinion again. but i also find the big hit theory sure. my bad wise. class bye bye now i have a smile and it is not to watch your show.
