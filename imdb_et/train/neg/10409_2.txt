Just when the story was not depressing enough, this film shows the cows that were slaughtered from the slaughterhouse graphically in all five minutes, while the protagonist tells his early life as a butcher. Strange stuff. Then the main prerequisite is that the hero / hero who goes and cuts his egg, because he has said at work with ten that he would have gone with him if he were a girl. Is this person a psycho, a masochist, just a condemned queen who takes things too far? And what kind of traumatic childhood did he have? Just that he didn't receive it and had to live with the nuns who initially loved him and later hated him because he was restless. He tries to give us reasons to justify what he did, but it's really that difficult to understand. Such sad and unusual self-destruction. Was it supposed to be funny? What was that really?
