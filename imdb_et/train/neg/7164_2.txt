This movie is more of a scam than ever by using such spam as Walken to play in this spam so it looks like it did nothing better than playing such a boring role! And the fact that the film was supposed to be about a witch and you don't see it almost until the end of the movie, but in the meantime you have to sit and watch this boring movie when it gets or tries to reach meaning, and you have to go through all of this boring actor and actor's journey, who think all the time about how you gave the second movie and decided on it, and how you just relaxed your money, make the whole time unnecessary there. I'd rather look at cartoons for goodness. Leave it alone, please!
