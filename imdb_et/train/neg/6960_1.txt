After seeing Blanche for the first 20s (sorry that I couldn't take it any more), I have now confirmed that he will not. In principle, this "film" is offensive to the actual French participants who participate in this spam. It begins with the concept that was successfully used in French comedies ("Deux heures moins le quart avant Jesus Christ", "La Folie des Grandeurs", ...): a historical film with anachronic tone / dialogues. This can bring great results if supported by excellent actors and a trend that avoids the appalling stigma of "hard comedy". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the horsey-shaped Lou Doillon destroys everything and Blanche, not comedy, just becomes a horror movie. Dreadful to cinephile who want to be overwhelmed and shocked by looking at fine actors such as Decaune, Zem or Rochefort who are fighting in the midst of this terrible kitchy-prissy farce.
