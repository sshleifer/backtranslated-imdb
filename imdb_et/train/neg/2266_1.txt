Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's pathetic apology for wasting movies that should be recycled as toilet paper has recently destroyed my trust in cinema. First, it was done. Second, people went to see it. Third, some people voted for the best movie they've ever seen. If the monkey could make a movie, I'm 100% sure it would be 1 billion times as good. Most funny movies are in their moments (even Godzilla had some cool special effects). The moment of this movie was when I left the theater. The only thing that could make this movie even worse would be if Jerry Springer were a star. If I want to watch for an hour and a half, I'll take it to the trash. If anyone does not despise this film completely, sorry, you and your children and the children of the children of your children; contrary to Springer, I believe that I do not explicitly allow a sexual child.
