I think shots and lighting were very bad. When I first looked at it, I thought it was an old version (1956). When I really found the movie a real year, I was shocked. I didn't know that this is a bad movie so recently. It's really all I wanted to say. This film had a good plot, not something you couldn't miss when you read this novel written by George Orwell. All I really want to say has already been said, except for this: I can't believe that this film could have got so many awards and candidates. I gave this movie one (terrible) because I felt it was very badly done. That is all. So long
