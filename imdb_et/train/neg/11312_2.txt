This film deserves recognition for its original approach. It combines elements of theater, film and epic storytelling. Unfortunately, it falls on all levels. The biggest weakness of films is the unwillingness to do something; it has camp, moral, and epic elements without ever being committed to one of them. As for yourself, Chretien de Troyes is turning his grave into this terrible adaptation that makes the loving, unbearably innocent Perciva the most unpleasant and rude. it, francophiles or Arthurophiles. Speaking of the latter, I found that film is a secret and amazingly dirty, disrespectful and disrespectful treatment.
