OK - I ADORE this movie ... I credit this movie - alone - for getting a fanatic of such a deadly horror. I could never watch this movie. I have also heard many stories about the impact this has on its viewers in its theaters. The incredible masterpiece .... The scary, psychological stuff scares the pants off me. Bless the hearts of those who made this awesome movie. I love it. I thought the whole movie was decent and interesting. This movie is so scary - it's a terrifying film I've ever seen in my life! Not that what's going on in the movie and the idea of ​​the movie is not scary enough, but what always got me was Brendan's fabulous actor. Best horror movie EVER. Nothing can ever be intimidating. Watching Halloween for your evil.
