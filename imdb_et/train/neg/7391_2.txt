Okay, like most of Steven Seagal's fans, I know I'm not going to wait for a masterpiece every time he makes a movie, but I assume the film has at least some sort of budget for the sorter. The main problem with the copy I watched was terrible over-copying. I know it has to be done in some movies and I agree with it, but when they move with the voice of a completely different participant and do it through the film, it takes magical overcoloring. It also seems that the kits have been built unscrupulously, because in one scene the sliding glass of the top secret lab has a huge crack. I was really disappointed with this movie and only the hope that Stevens's next project will finish before buying / renting a movie. The story of this movie was that I was looking at a sci-fi movie or some parts didn't seem strange, but they never fully explained what was going on.
