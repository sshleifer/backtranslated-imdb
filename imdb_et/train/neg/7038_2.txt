Ah yes in the 1980s, Reaganomics and Sly, Chuck and many other action stars that hide away in the jungle. At that time I couldn't believe how movies like RAMBO, MISSING IN ACTION, and UNCOMMON VALOR (And who can't forget the ridiculous RED DAWN?) Made money in the office, they are market-resistant activities that are unfairly right on the wings agenda and are dated very bad. TROMA `S WAR is the language that takes on this type of movie, but you have to ask yourself if they need spam first? Of course not . TROMA`S WAR has no complexity - although it suggests there is no real difference between right-wing tyrants and left-wingers - and sometimes it seems more than a grade z movie than sending. Maybe it is?
