You think the first landing of the Moon would be dramatic enough without having to do it. However, it seems that this documentary needs everything for the most frightening light. It talks about the risks associated with the monthly module and mentions Armstrong's almost fatal accident with a training vehicle, as if the trainer and the spacecraft had something to do with each other. This changes the problem of computer overload (1202 and 1201 alarms) that occurred during the final landing frequency, such as almost a disaster, when it was just an annoyance and not a threat to the crew at all. And that means a "thirty second" call means 30 seconds of fuel left before the end of it if it is actually thirty seconds before the interruption is mandatory. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary or Apollo dramatizing 11, go to "From the Earth to Moon" or one of the PBS documentaries, but skip it.
