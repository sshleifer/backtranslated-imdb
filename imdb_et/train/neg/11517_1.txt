I really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been uncomfortable <br /> <br /> (at least say) ... but it was terrible. Really terrible. Badly <br /> <br /> acted, meaningless script, delivery direction ... Watching this movie was <br /> <br /> like watching a car accident you want to look at, but you're still watching /> <br /> you want to see how dirty it gets. Well, the car is broken and there are no survivors. On the plus side was cinematography <br /> <br /> nice, I wanted to go on holiday if I only clean myself of this imperfect <br /> <br />
