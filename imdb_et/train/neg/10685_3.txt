Predictable, hackneyed and poorly written. I foolishly argued that such a prominent lie would not be involved unless it had it. I think the actors' competition is so intense (and it only gets worse) that you can no longer choose and choose. We were given an early murder that was effective in the murder and we had fallen out of our throat ever since. The film lacked intrigue, which gave us little information about the victim and only one motive for a possible murder. Part of the discourse was, frankly, embarrassing! It is hard to believe that anyone could even speak, not to mention, to spend tens of millions of dollars.
