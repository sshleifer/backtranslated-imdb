I just saw this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is in it) and I have to say I wasn't happy. <br /> <br /> Computer graphics were, of course, amazing, but the story needs some touch. I also think that this movie would have done much better with passions and blood than it would with PG-13. <br /> <br /> It would definitely attract more people to see -> teens. What would attract more teenagers (especially teenage girls) would be Brady Corbett's big part of Thunderbirds poster! <br /> <br /> Even though the film had this point, I still saw it and thought it was okay!
