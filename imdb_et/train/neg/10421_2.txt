I saw this movie as a very young girl (I'm now 27 years old) and it frightened me for years to be useless. I had a nightmare from every aspect of this film about how this (probably) violence was brought to music. My parents still say who allowed me to look at it and both say they won't let me watch such a movie. I think they just say that knowing that I have such strong feelings, 0) I read the book (curious curiosity and the fact that it's classic) and it's a really great story. But I don't think it should have been a comic. Never. Well, suddenly the kids find it nice today, but it gave me weeks and weeks of nightmares and I still find it difficult to see rabbits in a similar way. Give me some heartbeat every time. Yes, I'm amazing, but I strongly recommend that any parent who wants to show this film to their children read the book or see it first to make sure they accept it. Not everyone thinks it annoying when I did, but we are there; 0)
