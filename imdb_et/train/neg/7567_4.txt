Story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a mental disorder. He comes to psychology after he thinks he is actually a cyber. In an institution where he meets with park Il-sun, a young man who develops ties with him. <br /> <br /> If you read this, you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park is. But "I am Cyborg ..." is a big deviation from a familiar and (unfortunately) stronger territory. I'm a big fan of every movie or story that tries to do something else. God knows we're all fucking fucking local cinemas. The main point of the film that I have to say is that he does not say anything about mental illness and does not create signs that you care about. <br /> <br /> This story must be one of the strangest things I've seen for years ... but it's not strange enough. The film has no heart ... just surrealism and confusion. Confusion seems to be the main theme of the film. The characters try to understand their problems, but this is Chan-wook Park, which turns out to be the most confusing.
