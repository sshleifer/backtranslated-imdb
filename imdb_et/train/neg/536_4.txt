The story of a woman (Ann) from her deathbed, her two daughters (Nina and Constance) and her thoughts about the past. Feedback is related to the weekend where the young Ann is at her friend Lila's wedding. At the wedding he meets Harris, who influences him for the rest of his life. All his ups and downs in his work and family life remember him as true love. Her daughter Constance is older, "more responsible", mother of two, and she has things together. The nose jumps on the boy-boy-boy and works to work and is not sure about his life. <br /> <br /> First, it's good. The movie's periodic detail is great. Dresses, hair, cars, houses, etc. will put you in another place and place. And the movie is very high quality. Vanessa Redgrave is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state when her life ends. Claire Danes is beautiful and does a good job as the main character when she was young (and she is an outstanding singer). Hugh Dancy brought a lot of life to Lila's brother Buddy's character. <br /> <br /> Now for the bad, which unfortunately is everything else. Things are constantly disturbing the story as it opens to us. Young Anni and Buddy chemistry is great. They are fun and dancing. Then ... you should believe that he doesn't like him more than a friend and that his pining only disturbs him. And I thought the whole, "he may be gay", was out of blue and didn't serve the purpose. <br /> <br /> Then we have Harris. The character is wooden and scary. If it were another genre, you would have known that Harris was a gear changer. It is an incredible stretch to believe that all these girls love her (but they portray other guys as pretty flat to help and help her). <br /> <br /> And the biggest problem for everyone. Why don't Ann and Harris come together? They fall against each other. They have this big sex night in an old dirty gardening booth, come home to find out the tragic end of Buddy and then ... <br /> <br /> something. <br /> <br /> They meet a few years later and get all the blurry eyes of each other and I couldn't possibly think why. WHY? The film won't let you know why they were forced to marry other people and so I was very sorry about them. <br /> <br /> The current story is quite boring. Cliché good daughter and cliché bad daughter. The nose changes during the film, but I'm not sure why. I'm not sure what convinces her to change her life. There is a "touching" scene where the daughters join together, matching the old Anni's dreams with a butterfly butterfly. It's really flat and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "There are no bugs," Ann advises us. The report doesn't talk about the story. And after seeing the film, it doesn't tell the truth and wants them not to give such good players.
