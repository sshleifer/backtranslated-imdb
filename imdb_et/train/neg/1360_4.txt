The summary of this movie is reasonable. Good film of the sixties, but there is no achievement. Maggie Smith gave a decent result that was credible, but not as good as she could have given, the other participants were just terrible! Terrible imagination. It wasn't very funny, and so he didn't get his genres because it wasn't very funny or dramatic. The only genre that reached a satisfactory level was romance. Target audiences were not captured and the film sent messy messages. A very simple plot and a very basic story were not pulled out and did not work well and people were confused about why the film was not so good and who were the target groups, and so on. However, Maggie was pretty good and the story was about to succeed in moments. <br /> <br /> 4.
