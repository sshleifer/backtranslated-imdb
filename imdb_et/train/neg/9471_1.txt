Don't do me wrong, I assumed that this movie would be stupid, frankly, I gave him an incredibly low standard. The only reason I even saw it was that there were a lot of girls (a different story for a different time). When I started watching, I noticed that this movie was terrible. Now there are two types of terrible, Freddy vs Jason is terrible, where you and your friends are sitting and laughing and joking about how terrible it is, and then there's such a movie. Cat Hat could not even create a momentary interest in me. As I watched I didn't forget, I missed the meaningless, but I felt like I would have somewhat violated the horror of this movie. Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I love most of his work, but he didn't click anything in this movie. One of the things that the director / producers / writers / experts changed was that they refused to use any original book (red, black, white) with any color on any mark, but on the cat. Randomly or not, they also refused to take the original (and I do not want to use it, but not fit) the original. The book was like Ice Cream Sunday, colorful and tasty, and the film was as sweet and hard to swallow as sawdust. <br /> <br /> Avoid this as a reptile prostitute.
