The city girl Meg Tilly gets her mother's terrifying phone call and shakes her reasonably, returns home to her family's countryside to cope with the mystery: why are all homeless people strange and amazing? The high-speed thriller barely has the inhabitant of a small town bothered by the ecological side, who (ridiculously) contains two women who are in a public place, and Tim Matheson, who gets an oral attention from a girl at the head of the office. The picture is too silly for words, wasting Tilly's enthusiasm and quiet intensity in the trash, forcing itself into a corner that can't be counted. Part of Thomas Del Ruth's cinematography is good (especially the order of the fire inside the garage), although he has broken down with editing - and with a pretty outdated finale. A simple scenario is a surprise or a sleeve of originality on your sleeve. * 1/2 from ****
