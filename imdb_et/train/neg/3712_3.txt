When I first heard "Down the Earth", I was quite excited. I'm a pretty big fan of Chris Rock, he was especially fun with Dogmas. But this film was disappointing. Chris Rock's performance was not nearly as good as his previous performances, and the film was very badly directed at all. <br /> <br /> First of all, Chris Rock. She plays the whole movie as a standup comedy routine. Obviously, it works well in scenes if it should make a standup, but it is not in the rest of the movie. Even when he talks to another character, he thinks he's trying to laugh at people. He has some funny moments, but they come mostly during standup scenes (no wonder they decided to make their character comic). As far as the rest is concerned, they are quite a lot to give Rock to talk to someone, none of them is different. <br /> <br /> The film was also poorly targeted. There is basically one plot in the film: an old white man who acts as a young black comedian. Although I prefer movies with more than one joke, it would still have worked and been pretty funny. The problem was that we saw Rock too much and old white man enough. It should be funny because it is a white guy talking about Chris Rock jokes, but most of the time we just see Chris Rock so it's not nearly that funny. Few scenes where they decide to show us, as we say white, are fun. If she had been shown more, the film would have been a lot of fun. poorly targeted. It was quite a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10
