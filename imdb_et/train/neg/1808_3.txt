In his 1966 movie "Blow Up", Antonion had his hero against the British young protesters. Against such issues against hippie youth movement, Antonion deliberately or not questioned the effectiveness of these organizations. How can you fight for the cause if what you think is true can actually be wrong? On the flip side, the film said we had to fight and actively challenge the challenge because others could mislead us with false images and false truths. Although the hippie aspects were the most sticky parts of "Blow Up", they created a nice texture and made the film more meaningful than it would otherwise have been. It was a very cautious and mature little movie. <br /> <br /> "Zabriskie Point" Antonioni throws away all "Blow Up" ambiguities and nuances and goes into full blown hippie. The result is a movie with bad metaphors, stupid ideas, and heavy storytelling. How could someone who showed such restraint and intelligence throughout their careers make something so stupid? <br /> <br /> The film opens with a nice series of close-ups when we look at the group's radicals discussing the meaning of the revolution. Suddenly one man (Mark) rises and leaves. He hates the rigid and ordered character of the revolution. He recognizes that while revolutionaries are fighting for freedom, they are able to lose their freedom. And like Jack Nicholson's "The Passenger," Mark just wants to be free. <br /> <br /> Mark buys a weapon and goes alone. He doesn't take orders from anyone. When the police attack Mark Mark, his campus, he runs away. He then flees to a nearby airport, steals a small private vehicle and travels to the desert. Antonioni treats the desert as a peaceful utopia and confronts it ruthlessly with capitalist cities, their stands and hollow modern devices. He sees the desert as the Garden of Eden. <br /> <br /> In the desert, Mark Dariale replies and falls in love quickly. Then Antonion gives us a ridiculous sex where hundreds of hippies are having sex in the sand. By getting rid of the constraints of modern life, these fruit hugs and student radicals can now celebrate their individuality with sunset. rich capitalist homes that killed him. This is Antonion's challenge to his audience. He talks about weapons, pickets and explosives. Drop the walls before they drill you! <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie didn't affect your audience. They admitted that "Zabriskie Point" is just another independent commercial attempt to be radical. A sort of commodified radicalism. It seemed wrong and tedious. <br /> <br /> Thematically, the movie is pretty stupid. In principle, Antonion says that if you are not satisfied with the modern world, and the fat cats that take advantage of you, you must either flee to the desert (Mark) or actively fight against the system (Daria). It's all well and good. But while artists are constantly warning us of such dystopian nightmares, they are usually unable to show us how to effectively manage change. Like the end of the fighting club, Nihilism and violence do not achieve anything. In the real world, social changes are offered by humble inventors at the beginning, facilitated by small technological advances. I mean, what more did women release than contraception? <br /> <br /> 3/10 - A very bad movie. The problem is that Antonion doesn't believe in rebellion. He is a quiet and contemplative man. Introvert, who seems to have made an extrovert film just to gain more respect from the counter-culture, who owns his earlier film "Blow Up". As such, "Zabrinskie Point" is a very clever and stupid film. It's essentially a 50-year-old man who says, "Look at me, I'm a brave rebel!" <br /> <br /> There are many movies where the audience is encouraged to fight the "system", but they all fall into one of four categories. In the first category there are films like "Network", "Cool Hand Luke", "Cuckoo Slot" and "Spartacus". All of these show that the life of freedom fighters ends with everything, even though the "spirit of revolution" remains in any case. The message is that you cannot change the changes, but if you die or fail, the optimistic change in the concept will survive through martyrdom. In essence, we have to keep rather than give up hope. <br /> <br /> Then you have movies like "Fight Club", "Zabriskie Point" and "Falling Down" that just encourage you to explode. Throw it all down. Blow it all up. Everything is wrong, so you can also relax with weapons. These films are rather angry, reactive, rather than common sense. <br /> <br /> Then you have the category "Flight rather than fight". Masters of this genre are Terrence Malick and Antonioni. Movies such as "Passenger", "Red Desert" and "Badlands" show people who run from worlds who don't like them and forge island or peaceful threats. Both leaders are pessimistic because Malick has destroyed its islands and Antonion has its own islands that do not offer happiness or solution. <br /> <br /> Then you have the fourth category. Movies like Donnersmarck's "Other Life", Ashby's "Limited Glory" and Kubrick's "Clock Orange" treat artists as a force for change and rebellion. In those dystopian worlds where everyone is happy to be a slave to the state, the artist / criminality has unlimited creativity and freedom of will, who keeps the system under control. Just outside the herd, you create waves. Your comments, actions, and critical eyes are facing the current situation. As such, Donnersmarck's film is about novels and artists that undermine Nazi Germany, while Kubrick has Alex's artist / criminal struggle with Nazi fields, painting the city with blood and sperm.
