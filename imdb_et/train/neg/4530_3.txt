SPLIT SECOND can be a good movie. The story of killing the "road of rage" is very young Clive Owen, who gives a pretty good result; HOW ... but .... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the filmmakers created their film with idiotic camera work and really terrible editing. The camera jumps all over the creation in an unsuccessful attempt (I think) to reflect Owen's stress on business, family and traffic. This is actually giving the viewer a headache. <br /> <br /> Since filmmakers were not interested in making a good movie, but only impressing each other's impressive photography, this travesty should not waste time.
