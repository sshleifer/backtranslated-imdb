Well, writing was very sloppy, management was sloppy, and editing made it worse (at least I hope it was editing). it wasn't bad, but it wasn't so good. pretty much no characters liked. at least 45 minutes of this movie was wasted and the second hour was not used near its full potential. it was a great idea, but another good idea goes. it could have ended 3 different places, but it was mostly the end of the predicted Hollywood end. and what was not predictable was done so badly that it was not important. the end was not worth it at all. Sandra's bull was excluded from his element and should be left out of such films. the film was also hurried. the movie wasn't really worth it and I would have paid for it, I would have been very crazy. maybe i was more frustrated because i was really looking for a good movie and got bad. the film was not terribly bad, but I do not recommend it. I gave it to 2 out of 10 b / c that liked the idea so much and I liked one character (justin I believe, super smart). and he also had very cheap ways of covering parcels. it was like trying to cover the volcano with a cheap ribbon tape, it wasn't pretty. anyway, when you see it, wait $ 1.50 for a theater or video if you don't really like every movie you see, I think you like it.
