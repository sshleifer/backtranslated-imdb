Back (again) in Scotland, Lassie is (again) for the court life. Because a loyal dog sleeps in his master's grave, he must die according to the law. Strangely enough, it is also explained that Lassie did not have a "legal" owner, which is probably against the old Scottish law. If there is no owner after three days, the dogs must be destroyed. Edmund Gwenn (John Traill) talks about Lassie's case, which leads to a longer setback, showing that Donald Crisp (John "Jock" Gray) has been accepted by Lassie. <br /> <br /> Although it is based on an interesting, original reading ("Greyfriars Bobby"), "Challenge to Lassie" is reviewing several previous Lassie situations; and it doesn't heal them. In comparison, it is sloppy and erroneous; and this is the frustrating step "The Sun Comes Up" (1949) *******. Geraldine Brooks (Susan Brown) and several other performers can be charming but can't raise it. Little Jimmy Hawkins ("It's Wonderful Life") is one of the remarkable kids who support Lassie; much later, he grows up to marry "Dark Shadows", "fools" of Angelique (Lara Parker).
