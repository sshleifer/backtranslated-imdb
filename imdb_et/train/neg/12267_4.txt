speaking only as a movie, it didn't really like it. not because there was no FX, or because we had one salon as a whole movie scenario, this was what I watched. <br /> <br /> I didn't like it because the actor was shady, his "friends" are all happy and then they are crazy, but you have no idea why; Then they take on different roles, one is a believer, the other is an antagonist, but they never make that point! also the lighting was terrible and I just mention technical issues. <br /> <br /> A few words, I just might have been "okay, what am I here!" some characters. like a lady who doesn't want to hear her Bible format. <br /> <br /> The story itself, everyone has the freedom to write what they want, and the story is proof of some good writing and imagination. I credit the author of this book, so my 4/10. <br /> <br /> To finally hear the man's story I believe it or not, just spend all the time as you believe him is shocked by what he says and at the same time moving and joking as you don't believe him. <br /> <br /> Consistency. <br /> <br /> thanks for reading;)
