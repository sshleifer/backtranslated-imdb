The female singer with the nickname "Big T" - that is what they call her - risks her promising musical career and her life, getting into a sloppy drunk (Busey) who wants to be her leader. Her mother committed suicide, her father is also an alcoholic, and has a violent mood. You can imagine where it leads. In the meantime, there is a lot of music like Parton with his liquid vocal talents, singing the song after the song (at least half a dozen in Texas). Follow this confusion and check him in the ninth or eighth instead.
