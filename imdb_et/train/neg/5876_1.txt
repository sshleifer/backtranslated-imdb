I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and unfortunately I chose this version. All of the actions (actors delivering most of their lines directly to the camera) into camera shots (all medium or near shots ... without scenes and very little inverted shots) were absolutely terrible. I watched it over my spring break and it is very safe to say that I feel like I was out during a 114-minute vacation. In no way is imagination recommended.
