one of the worst films I've ever seen in the theater. I saw this movie at the Austin Film Festival in 2004, and it meant that the film was accepted for the festival. it was an interesting assumption and it seemed that it could go somewhere, but it just fell apart every time he tried to do something. First, if you are going to make a musical, find someone with musical talents. the music consisted of a cheesy piano game that sounded like they played in the stereo they were recording. The lyrics were terribly written and if they weren't obvious rhymes, they were encouraging rhymes that showed how far they stretched to make this movie. and you think you could find people who could sing in music, right? not in this case. fortunately, most of the time they were half-talking / semi-singing, but when they sang it, it went away. especially when they tried to sing harmoniously. and it just deals with music. some of the actors were pretty good, but a lot of dialogue was both terrible and most of the scenes. obviously they did not have enough coverage of scenes or just had a bad editor because they consistently jumped in the movie and used awful choices. at least the director was ready to admit that no one wanted the script until they added a music making hook. I hope investors will ensure that someone can write music before making the same mistake again.
