I think I laughed twice. The line where the protagonist talks about being on the streets. And then I forget the second time I laughed. That was probably the beginning. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the slimmest movies. Does Hollywood not realize that such humor is humiliating and sad. You can offend yourself so many times. <br /> <br /> 2/10
