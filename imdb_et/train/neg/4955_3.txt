In the light of the current and fairly bold and bold light of Batman, now is the time to fall into a deadly blow to this mistake in Batman's life. Being a huge fan of Tim Burton's first revival 20 years ago, I have been able to accept various symbols, dark or campy. It's not just plausible: too many effects, bad intrigue, and so few questions. What's great for Batman is the diversity of his skills and personality: Detective, Crime Destroyer, Playboy, Philanthropist, etc. Batman shows him only his karate day. And by the way, how is the penguin able to look at such virtuosity without jumping into the air, regardless of its overflowing embodiment? And look at Joker, Blankan's mix of Street Fighter 2 and a stereotypical reggae man whom Batman's fan could accept such treason? Not anyway. Batman is much better without the "The" article in front of his name.
