The rich Harvard guy gets into the poor Radcliffe chick, which is a fierce father (Ray Milland). <br /> <br /> Syrupy, the sugary and most importantly, lovely story of the “class” battle as the rich boy Ryan O'Neal brings home the librarian to ridicule his snobbish parents. Ali MacGraw is a social abandoned dirty mouth while John Marley plays his dedicated-Catholic father, but no one in the movie is more annoying than O'Neal himself, who with his amazing imagination is Harvard Master Yuppie. <br /> <br /> Eight (!) years later "Oliver's Story" followed.
