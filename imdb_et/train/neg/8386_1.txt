Hanging this movie is like a fish shooting barrel. It's too simple. So I'm trying to admit the positive aspects of Little Man. First, I have been impressed by the special effects. In fact, it seemed like the head of Marlon Wayans was tied to the body of a small person. I never doubt it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I loved some unexpected lights. David Alan Grier played a tedious restaurant singer and his renditions of "Havin 'My Baby" and "Movin' On Up" were invaluable. John Witherspoon, who accidentally played Grier's father in Boomerang in 1992 (if you remember he "co-ordinated" the mushroom belt with a mushroom sauce), now plays Vanessa's father Little Man. So it was fun. <br /> <br /> Moreover, this film is as plausible as white chicks. How stupid is it if even a doctor can say that this is a 40-year-old man and not a child? She has a complete set of teeth !!! How can someone not see that this is not a child? The Little Man is so bad that there is a fireman from Rob Schneider. And please, if you are stupid enough to spend $ 8 on this film, please do at least for me and DO NOT bring your children. This film is too sexual for many young children (lots of fun and excitement about sex, decline, eating, etc.), and I felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their children to screening, which I was forced to endure. If you insist on seeing an idiotic movie, at least your children will save pain and suffering.
