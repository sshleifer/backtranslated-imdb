Perhaps not my genre, but the plot was terrible, as Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino acted. C. Thomas also seemed uncomfortable here when he was lured here (during marijuana? Why did it have to be added? This weakened plot significantly). Also a Farentino symbol. it would have been better if he had more relationships. Would the movie try to say? not much.
