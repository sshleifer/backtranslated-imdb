They do not really become a stupider as a film that deals with three losers trying to capture the college spirit during the annual Spring Day celebrations in many of our universities. The problem is that these losers try to do it 15 years after their college years, when they have been appointed to follow the wife of a senator who has been taken care of as the next vice president. <br /> <br /> The problem is that her daughter is something other than popular, but of course she comes out of it. Girls go through drunk, exotic dances and other absolute nonsense. <br /> <br /> It really doesn't get much worse than this terrible movie.
