Maladolescenza has a dark fairy-tale air where the child's protagonists, forest areas and castle ruins. Yet the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study of adolescents. Opening to a dream that uses Fabrizio's wrestling with his menacing hound, the film does not describe the psychological persecution of her loving girl Laura and her possible romance with equally malicious Sylvia. The psychological complexities of the film make the film worthy, but there is no doubt that the unnecessary exploitation of the film is a depiction of nudity and sex. The film's appearance depends more on its beautiful places than on specific cinematographic skills, and there is no doubt that the biggest asset of the film is the creepy children's choir. With its strange dreamlike quality, the film is the most interesting, but at the same time it is the surreal and brilliant "Black Moon" next to Louis Malle. Certainly art and pornography are worthy of discussion, because unlike many of the forbidden films, such as Pasolini 'Salo' or Larry Clark 'Ken Park', the film is quite noticeable from an artistic point of view. Cinema seems to be gradually losing its shocking ability, so maybe "Maladolescenza" will admire the maintenance of this power thirty years after its release. But the value of shock is the only reason the film is memorable. <br /> <br /> The film has its own defenders. However, there is also Nazism.
