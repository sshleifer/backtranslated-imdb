Yes, AWA wrestling, how can anyone forget this unreal show. First they had a very short interviewer named Marty O'Neil, who made "Rock n Roll" Buck Zumhofe like a nose. Then it was Gene Okerland who, as a wrestler "crazy", said that either "Expired Time" or "Well Be Back" as he was crazy, but actually sounds forced. After he went to WWF, Ken Resneck took over, though his mustache looked like a week old soup that had been stuck to it. After he had jumped the ship, Larry Nelson came on board, which he was so bad that Phyllis George would have healed! Then Doug McLeod is the best wrestler who made every game exciting with his shock description! He was then offered more salary in the Minnesota North Stars hockey team. Who has forgotten that Roger Kent, who has misrepresented words and sentences, was a historic As the wrestler was a big "Hes big!" nailed or nailed into the "right place" or when "he punished him" or "piledriver should be banned" after Nick Bockwink against this helpless opponent. (Better Roger as you care!) After leaving for greener money (WWF), they were Rod Trongard, who said the style was great but different. is in trouble "Hes bad bad road". He would also say that AWA is the worst, the toughest, the worst, most scientific wrestlers right here in AWA! (No extra money Verne Gagne!) After leaving (WWF) Larry (Wels, Phyllis?!) Nelson took over and I talked to someone else or ignored him. (WWE wisely did not take her!) Greg Gagne also had the toughest wrestling shoes I ever saw, which I did not want to say. Also, when she searches for a tag she looks like she wants to get over it could run to the nearest toilet! Jumpin J im Brunzell was such a big dirty artist that you didn't know why Greg was once his partner. Jerry Blackwell (RIP) was also a superstar wrestler, but you don't know why Verne won against him. Then, when Vince McMahon hired Gagnes, he earned most of these wrestling races. I like to see the Gagne family that wrestling is real now!
