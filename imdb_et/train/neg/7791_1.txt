I've seen the original, not duplicated German version, and I was surprised how bad this movie really is. Thinking I had seen my share of bad movies like Ghoulies 2, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake and so on, I wouldn't have prepared anything for me! It was really painful to sit through this flick because there is no plot, no good action, and even special effects are not convincing, especially the so-called zombies who wear more than white make-up and old clothes so their good set won't be destroyed ketchup and marmalade blemishes. <br /> <br /> If you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, look at it for everyone else, don't do it because you regret it!
