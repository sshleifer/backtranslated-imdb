I agree with everything Calamine has said! And I don't always agree with people, but what Calamine has said is very true, it's time for girls to move on to better roles. I would like them to be very successful because they were a very inspiring couple that is growing and I would like to see them grow in people, actors and their career and personal lives. So producers, please give the girls the opportunity to develop something that touches a little, moving them into a new direction that knows them individually and their talents in many aspects. This film, which is commented on, is not too bad, but as I have seen in my films, their films remain the same in the usual plot and typography. If it's good for a young generation in Rome, but adults who were kids when the twins were kids, they want to follow the twins and so I think we adults would like to see them make different movies, maybe some movies. is like the sixth sense, the hour, the chocolat, such a film - not telling them that they only have serious movies, too humorous, but rather see them in the different roles they have played in their latest films like this and the New York protocol. (Note: I come from Australia, so I apologize for my strange spell, like condemnation instead of z)
