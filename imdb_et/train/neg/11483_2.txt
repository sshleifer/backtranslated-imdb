I was full of this movie. I had waited a year to delete it here in New Zealand. I shouldn't have built so much because it was both disappointing and undoubtedly Clark's worst film. There's so much wrong with this movie. First of all, some actors are great, especially Nick Stahl as "The Bully", and a girl with curly brown hair (I can't remember her name), but most of it was so imperfect and incredibly incredible, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is now a veteran of Clark's films and he was so brilliant in "Kids", but in "Bully" he puts his lines on such a solemnity to make his scenes a parody practically. The scenario seemed to have been written by a first-year film student. Sorry, high school student ... who's never seen a movie before. And I didn't understand Clark's intentions. Did he try to point out the existence of these children meaningless? It's sure that hell didn't stop her from damn good pervert. I'm not a bride, but I didn't have to see the teens' breasts and buttocks every five minutes. I still say that Clark's best film is "The Second Day in Paradise". It's fantastic and I don't think he's ever up.
