For a small town that collides with the track (but looks suspiciously near the motorway), the female reporter goes to each other for a strange hiker who agrees to direct her to her destination. The strange man then speaks a few terrifying stories related to the region: first story, adulterous couple plots to kill a woman's wife, but ultimately suffers from a much worse situation when the zombie attacks them; and at second reading, group campers have shortened their vacation when the undead outlaw takes their tombs. <br /> <br /> The Zombie Chronicle is a writer Garrett Clancy's attempt by Brad Sykes to create a Zombie diamond ecology is a nice idea, but with just two stories, it shrinks shamelessly. And this is not the only way this gore flick with a small budget can fail: the actor is weak (with Joe Haggerty, as Ebenezer Jackson tells the story, one of the strangest performances I've ever seen); locations are unnecessary; the script is harsh; there is a sex scene with nudity; and it ends .... well, it spurs faith. <br /> <br /> To be fair, some of Sykes' creative camera work is effective (though the unpleasant technique used as characters passes through the forest). surplus) and Joe Castro's gateway is enthusiastic: the ear is bitten, the eyes are removed, the face is removed, the brain is broken and is dirty decapitation. These positive almost become tolerated by the film, but warned the Zombie chronicle is not a walk in the park, even for z-grade garbage experienced viewers. <br /> <br /> I give Zombie Chronicle 2/10 but generously raise your rating to 3 because I couldn't watch the movie with 3D (although I have a nice suspicion that the extra dimension wouldn't have changed that much ).
