Probably the worst film I've ever seen. I was ready to step out in ten minutes. The only ones who smiled at the theater were tweeners. Don't make me wrong, I love stupid, stupid movies as much as the next gal, but the whole assumption, writing and humor. It seemed to me that they went to "Napoleon's dynamite" - a strange and casual scene that would lead to a cult audience. Instead, it was forced, uncomfortable and strange. The only bright light was Isla Fisher and I just felt terribly terrible that she (and Sissy Spacek) had logged in to this terrible thing. /> <br /> Thank you for not paying for it.
