This is the story of two men who found a copy of "Funky Monkey". Finding it seemed strange at the time when it was thought that there were still posters for the film for the local Cineplex Odeon. After seeing such classics as "Every Way, but Open" and "Project X", these two men in the monkeys were thinking of fantastic films. <br /> <br /> These men had been traveling for a long time watching this movie. There was a monkey that was replaced with Stunt MAN when the sequence of operations was necessary. It was obvious that the monkey was not trained at Shakespeare school. Perhaps replacing the monkeys with Ben Affleck would probably have helped the guys guess. <br /> <br /> Maybe a strong sidekick like Jackie Chan or heck might even help Hulk Hogan. Luckily, this film was an amazing martial artist and Jet Liine-like Matthew Modine. While some may argue that Matthew Modine is not close to Jet Li, the camera proves tricks that he is so good. When it turns out that an untrained chimp can't handle the film, the film relies on Matthew Modine's real star. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there is a guy who develops links and a monkey with Modine? Is there a chance that the child will learn to trust and even collect the girl from this movie? Even Matthew Modine should be jealous of this one (because the pick-up line "I'm the second monkey for the monkey" doesn't seem to have worked with the ladies.) <br /> <br /> Two men soon got a phone call from Matthew Modine saying, "Seven days."
