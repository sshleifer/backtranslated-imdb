The ultimate goal of Big Brother, which we know before we think, is realized. Is it a miracle or a bad joke that people do not want their straight straight jackets, wrestle into racing shapes and laugh like monkeys? Movies, art, no longer unknown risks, but there are lost conclusions that have lost their lives. <br /> <br /> "Notorious Bettie Page" is a boring case that fits a college feminism course. Its lesson is schematic, rectangular and linear: "See how women are objectively identified, exploited, abused, thrown into the trash, men's dominant society." <br /> <br /> Bettie Page, probably "Queen of the 1950s", millions of men who ejaculated. (All reviewers repeat this phrase, "Queen of the 1950s", like the bark of monkeys.) His history of American genealogy is familiar: the southern part, his father's abused, rape, etc. naif, innocent who is unaware of the interests he serves and shamelessly profit. Although he believes in Jesus, he enjoys a funny smile in front of the camera lens - a healthy girl-female-sex-slave-American man is supposed to fantasize. <br /> <br /> Writer-director Mary Harron out of her mouth, Oxford's educated and former bunker (are you smelling a combination of privileges and "hippies"?): "I feel that without feminism, I won't. I'm not doing feminist movies in the sense that I'm not doing anything ideological, but I find that women get my movies better. "What a cozy click. The film only passes through the story of human life, its theme and purpose are eulogized and covered even before the film begins. Ms has a boyfriend, but we don't show anything about their relationship. In fact, there is no intimate or detailed relationship in the film. <br /> <br /> You can't ignore its smooth simplicity. New York where pr. Page strives to fit and satisfy the mood of the world by letting itself bond with slavery and tightly attaching it to S & M black leather boots and movies, the film is black and white. But in Miami, where she goes to get away from it, she takes off her clothes and takes a "released" woman, the film changes color. <br /> <br /> Like Harron's hell, "make feminist movies," "does nothing ideological." Ideology has become so internal, so assumed, so programmed that it is almost invisible. The big brother must smile.
