Set aside Dr. House's repetition I missed, and Desperate Housewives (new) look at it. I don't know exactly what this film is bothering about. I've never thought I'd say it, but I want my 15-minute fame back. <br /> <br /> Script, Direction, I can't say. I appreciated the stability of the actors (conventional suspects), but I thought Herbert Marshall was adding a class and sat with a good cheese flickima. Boy, I was wrong. Dullsville. <br /> <br /> My favorite items: where the "office girl" makes 029 with the keychain and puts the cards in the 087 sorter. LOL @ "computer". I would like someone to detect the next device - 477? This is the time of the dinosaur before that. <br /> <br /> And we don't have to waste so much time on dinosaurs.
