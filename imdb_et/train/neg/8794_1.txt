I'm completely confused about why this movie has even loved it, not to mention that it is held so high, especially by so many critics who are otherwise quite reasonable. <br /> <br /> There is one key word that describes it on the core of the movie - irritating. <br /> <br /> The easiest way to explain this is to use music - or more precisely - abuse. In the first half, about three times the really dull reggae setup is played (if it is too often). But the other side is played at least seven times, usually at the top. Gods, whether you loved the song before, would end up being seriously ill eventually. Think of some people saying they saw this movie four or five times. That means they've heard California Dreamin 28 or 35 times ..... <br /> <br /> All this unnecessary hyper-repetition (it doesn't help anything) can be excusable if the rest of the movie had no tedious value or when the story was in some way connected. <br /> <br /> But that's not the case. <br /> <br /> The only aspect I found was reloading Bridgette Lin and still playing Asia The Invincible is a raincoat and sunnies. Even it wore quite quickly. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the high reputation of this movie convinces many poor mammals to watch it. <br /> <br /> I can only warn you - if you have never seen a HK movie before, don't start it. <br /> <br /> If you feel you are forced to watch it, avoid it at all costs at the cinema. The fast forward and mute buttons are important tools for survival here. <br /> <br /> You have been warned!
