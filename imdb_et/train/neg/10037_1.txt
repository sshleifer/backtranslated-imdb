I had never thought that the level of Yashraj's films would ever have deteriorated to such an extent! The film has a nonsense storyline that doesn't interest you. <br /> <br /> Saif has overstepped. Kareena has improved her figure but is still not a good actor. Akshay is good. Anil is also good. Let me say that the role was not good. <br /> <br /> A great deal of cheapness has been met. I was wondering if it should be a "comedy" movie. Just because the latest movies were flop, does that mean Yashraj's movies should make such garbage? It has so many good movies. Overall, I was completely disappointed with the movie.
