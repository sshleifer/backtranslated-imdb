Vijay Krishna Acharya 'Tashan' is a superfluous, stylized product. Surely this is one of the most stylish films, but when it comes to content, even the masses reject it. Why? The movie script is the same as a 2 year old child. The script is king, without a good script, even the biggest director of all time can't do anything. Tashan is produced by the most successful product images of Yash Raj Films and Mega Stars. But nothing on earth will save you if the script is happier. Thumbs down! Performances: Anil Kapoor, veteran actor. But how could he justify such a role? Akshay Kumar is a great actor, in fact he is the only salvation grace. Kareena Kapoor is never so hot. She sees stunning and leaves you all up. Saif Ali Khan doesn't get paid for her. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted. <br /> <br /> 'Tashan' is a boring film. Movies will fail at the ticket office if you stay away.
