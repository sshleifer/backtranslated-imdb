Thank God! I didn't waste my money on renting, but I downloaded it! It happens to be the worst movie I've seen throughout my life, f ***** g visual effects, unnecessary gore and nudity! Away from other Zombie movies, like the Night of the Living Dead and others. There are many loops and bugs in the movie. OK, if you have time to read the comment, see the profile of the director (Ulli Lommel). After seeing that I got a self explanation of why the film is like this, I think every Ulli Lommel-directed film is rated between 1 and 2. Stop all this by saying one strong sentence. Don't even look at this movie for fun or for time or even for an extremely boring situation.
