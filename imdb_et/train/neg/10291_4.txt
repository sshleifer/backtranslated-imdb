80 minutes and it seemed twice as long! Short overrun is not short enough. Indeed, the first 50 minutes consist almost entirely of the dialogue between a woman approaching the Middle Ages (indeed a monologue), worshiping "men", frustration, sex, aging and her recent break in French. a teenager with whom he met at the ship's cafe. <br /> <br /> The sensitive monologue continues to the duty-free shop and bar, where eventually his own bead will push him away. The "story", of course, cannot end there, so he persuades him to listen to his drone more than he takes to his cabin. <br /> <br /> What little romance, gender, or anything that this film has about this issue is quite inadequate to justify the cost of renting if you are not one of those who love dramas where something interesting is not things happen. Yes, the end is very nicely done, but it is of little use if you do it, which means your living room is turned into a virtual therapy with narcissistic. <br /> <br /> That's it. I may be wrong.
