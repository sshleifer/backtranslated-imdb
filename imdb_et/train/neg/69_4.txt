I thought it was a very clumsy and gripping version of the famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their duties and gave some character to their characters; but the whole thing seemed forced and mechanical. <br /> <br /> At first it could have been much more involved; maybe starting with a shootout and then blinking back on how they got there or something like that. And I felt that each scene was conventionally predictable and marked like a very bad TV soap. <br /> <br /> I was really looking forward to this movie and hoped for a lot better. The only thing I say in my favor is that it wins the version of Mick Jagger, but not much.
