Who? What? Where? When? Why? Action was terrible. Very robotic, tried. I've seen all the actors in the movie with better roles. The scenario was very elementary. At the end of this movie, the story was associated. And Jeane Claude LaMarre should also be involved. So he never tries to write / direct another movie.
