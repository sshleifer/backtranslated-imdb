One of the demands of science fiction, at least before it becomes a satire, is that it is somewhat plausible. I think the subjective bomb would do much more harm than it was intended. But I will leave it to the physicists who would have seen solar energy. <br /> <br /> This is a crisis that the earth is facing because the solar energy is completely out of hand. They go so close to the Earth that it has become unreasonably warm, as if it were all the organs of the Earth's death. The answer is the anti-thing bomb that the spacecraft needs to take on the sun and explode there. This directs the incandescent colors out, as Mercury says, provided it is not in direct correspondence with Earth. <br /> <br /> Who does it, but Captain Tim Matheson and his team. This is when he is able to keep his business going, not the kidnapped son, Corin Nemec. Admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson's father and Nemec's grandfather take care of the personal side of family problems. this crisis is trying to control the food supply of survivors around the world. The idea he can't survive doesn't go to his mind. He does his best to sabotage Matheson's mission. <br /> <br /> The solar crisis seems to be a bad mix from 2001, the Space Odyssey and the seabed trip. Boyle seems to be taking his cue from Gene Hackman like Lex Luthor Superman, apparently he is the only one who understands that he is a turkey and moves accordingly. real blue and boring. Except for the probably wilderness rat Jack Palance, who finds Nemec and cares for him. <br /> <br /> What matters is that the film was directed by Allen Smithee, a Hollywood flop provider. The film receives as many as four stars for the participants involved, and it was a good time for caring for Thanksgiving.
