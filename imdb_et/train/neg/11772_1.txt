I'm short ... This movie is embarrassing to everyone except his operator. The fact that this is a criticism of the sex tourism industry seems to be valid until we are "treated" with a constant dance image. The plot is ridiculous if someone except the most terrifying fear of BAD gets it. And, for God's love, stop saying that this movie is a lost or even a story of empowering women because it's not quite clear (childish nervous lesbians, what the hell?). it was by far the worst movie at the Edinburgh Festival (which I saw anyway), even someone was probably crashed halfway probably because they couldn't take it anymore. it may seem too critical a bead, but I really can't find the redeeming feature of this movie, except maybe when you take it for pure comedy. In short, this film is best viewed on a Class A drug cocktail.
