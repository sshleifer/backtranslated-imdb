I'm honest, it's one of the worst movies. If not, it is very close. Never seen a bad teen soap opera. Well that's like one of them. Except worse. For example: (POSSIBLY SPOILER) girl: I want to go elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Boy: All we need is here. br /> <br /> man: I'll take you somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Continue this line and have sex. Music is bad pop and bad punk rock. If you've ever read a book, beware of this movie like a plague. They completely change the personalities of characters and events. In addition, they just get rid of things. The movie also ends before the end of the book. This is the AWFUL movie. So, if you haven't read the book, don't look at it. When you read the book, burn it (film). If you like a stupid teenage soap opera that is of lower quality than your average low-grade tea soap opera, go to it. And should we wait for something other than MTV?
