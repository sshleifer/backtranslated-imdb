Let me tell you something about this movie. I've seen it twice. For the first time I was a child and the film was quite fun for me. I really liked it. I thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was kind. <br /> <br /> I saw it a few days ago. It was terrible. Really. I don't know why I thought it was funny before, but now ... I didn't laugh at all. There wasn't even a little fun. It was just stupid. The story was weak. Operation was nothing special. There are big actors in this movie, but still the actor is at best mediocre. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that this movie is racist. Really. Don't do me wrong, usually I'm not talking about racism in movies. But I've seen people complaining about the lack of black men in movies like "Shaolin Temple" or the fact that the only black guy "The Street Fighter" is one of the bad guys or ... Whatever you get. There are people who see racism everywhere. I don't know how they would respond to a movie like "Meteor Man". Why? I'll tell you why. There are no Asians in this movie. There are no white people among the good boys. In fact, there is only one white boy in the film and he is the leader of the bad guys. All good guys are African Americans. Don't get me wrong, I don't care that a good man is black or white or yellow or pink or green ... What I care about is that we can't barely see a white person in this movie. This is the only movie I've ever seen. It's not just realistic. If there is only one black guy in the Japanese film, who is a street fighter, there is no problem - most people in Japan are Asian. But if there is only one white man in the American film, there is a problem - in the USA, most people are white. It's like shooting a Japanese movie with totally white pain and just one Asian as a bad guy. Just not real. <br /> <br /> That's it. I'll give the movie rate 4/10. It would be 1/10 if I had no fun with this child.
