This movie is weird. Better, it's "weird". I can give you a plot summary or some frightening analysis, but I consider it a waste of your time. Everyone must know about this movie from two young sisters, one incragous relationship, killing, post-mortem distortion, and one really distracting affection. At the end of the movie you feel like you need to go to the shower to wash the smoke yourself, but not as after "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club". It's like you are a teenager (or college, I'm still a teenager) and I've just done something for you A: I wish you didn't do it, and B: Hope for the Lord of Heaven and Earth that your parents will never know. And no one likes it. My advice is to attack your mind rather than in a tangible movie, just look at the time that is a little less terrible and look at "Kazama" (yes, I'd rather look at "Kazama" than "Murderous Maids", read what you did want).
