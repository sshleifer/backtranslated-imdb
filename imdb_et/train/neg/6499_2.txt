What a messy mess. I saw it a while ago with a friend and we both think we are open to many cinematic wonders, but this is definitely not one of them. <br /> <br /> Although very good ideas / concepts can be good and there are definitely good results (in this situation), everything is buried under accidental nonsense. Sir Anthony drives too much from the same gene fund as natural born killers, U Turn and similar movies to editing, or maybe he looked at Nixon for inspiration. Say what you want about David Lynch, but at least he has more madness. <br /> <br /> His quote that he made a movie joke says it all. It is not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
