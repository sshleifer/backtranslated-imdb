Really, I can't believe I spent 5 dollars on this film. I'm a big zombie fanatic and thought the film wasn't that bad. He had zombies in it? I was wrong! To be honest, the film had moments ... I thought it was cool when a man got his head head ripped, but that was it. In general, I think it would be more enjoyable to slip the shaving valve off your bare nuts into vinegar and watch this movie again. The film could have been better if we saw a little bobby, but I had to look at the trailers of this company's other films to see it. Buyer warn ... if you're not masochism.
