I think Jason Lee has tremendous potential, but it was a WRONG vehicle where he tried to break out as an asterisk. The plot is terrible, comedy is terrible. I laughed twice, I think the relief, because afterwards they were quite flat jokes. I found myself afraid of the future of Fletch and I had to check myself that it was a film that was faulty, not Lee. photos of this website instead of this movie. Save time. 1 star
