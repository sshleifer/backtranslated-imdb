One of the weaker Carry On adventures sees Sid James as a criminal who steals birth control pills. The fourth series is hospital care, probably the least genre. There's a curiously flat feeling, all seemingly destroyed below the better material. It is far from the late 70s, but Williams, James, Bresslaw, Maynard et al. are all class speakers who have not yet been able to support a script equivalent to their script. <br /> <br /> Most gags are running rather than episodic because they are usually carriers. So if you are funny about the usual stroke-to-draw ratio, you will stick to most movies. Will these continuous plots contain Williams? without good reason? worrying that he is changing sex, and Kenneth Cope pulls. As the static physical mind falls, it seems that the whole thing seems more viable than in other films and there is no interest. Continuing this theme, Matron does not have the usual red and innuendo format that largely chooses characterization and consequences to provide humor. In fact, Terry and June ... are somewhat reminiscent of the laborious misunderstandings and forced circumstances of the workers ... so it is appropriate that Terry Scott is there, striking forever. <br /> <br /> Some dialogue exchanges are a bit of an old magic, like this between Scott and Cope: "But a little drink?" "Oh, no, no, I never touch it." "Then a cigarette?" "No, I never touch them." "It leaves you with only one thing to offer." "I never touch it." This means that while the funny guy himself (luring Randall and Hopkirki's (dead) dullest episodes) doesn't feel that Cope is not really paralyzed to Carry On idealology and that Bernard's dressed as Bresslaw would be more fun. It actually happens in part, though only in the last fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> Williams is trying to attract Hattie Jacques, while Charles Hawtrey hides in a cabinet in a clean drawer farce, but he doesn't iron it off. This means that the description of Williams' above-mentioned relationships is invaluable: "You don't just go to the store and buy enough space to tear yourself into a small strip and try it first!" "It may be," says Jacques, "but you won't hold me against my wall." Williams really lives in his scenes with Hattie and you can never get bored by listening to the tin whistle when someone accidentally flashes his knives. <br /> <br /> Wear Matron is not a bad film, but a breakable bog standard.
