From the opening dialog and the scenes I knew I knew I was a train wreck. He didn't want to look, but couldn't turn. If it wasn't for the eyeballs of this movie, I would have given one star. The fact that the interactions between characters and attitudes have been pulled up so far, which is accompanied by a bad direction and a terrible story, makes this film more than a low-budget disaster. Money is definitely not necessary for making a good movie. But this movie is not so terrible that there was no chance of a setback. the place you would do? <br /> <br /> A.) Drive all and try your luck yourself. B.) Having sex with a friend of your friends. C.) Take a hot bath to relax your worries to cover your feet. D.) Relationship with your childhood best friend and lifelong crush shovel. E.) All the above-mentioned issues. <br /> <br /> According to Eli Roth, none of these answers has been drawn so far. In fact, all the cabin fever is believable and well represented. The complete absence of reality and the illogical attempt to explain what people would do in traumatic situations cast this film on the bonehead bin of their local rental store. Stay away. Stay away.
