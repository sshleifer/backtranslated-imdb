This is one of the worst films I've seen for a long time. Not only the story, but acting is shockingly bad. The dialogue sounds like someone reading the news. <br /> <br /> It's a comedy / drama / romance, not these things! This is a small activity. There's no comedy or drama at all. <br /> <br /> If you saw this cinema, I feel sorry for you. I don't recommend it at all. Pretty much the other thing you decide is better. This is pretty much an act / crime movie. Action scenes are sucked and the story of the crime was very predictable. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in a good story or good acting. And you just want to watch a "foreign" movie that is alien to be a stranger. Then it may be for you.
