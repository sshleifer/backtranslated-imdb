This film represents some imagination in this premise or in its execution, but these are just two things that come to mind after watching the so-called comedy that has no energy to speak. The story tells Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller), head of analytical insurance risk, who finds his new wife, Lisa (Debra Messing), scammer with a scuba instructor (Hank Azaria) only one day after her honeymoon. After returning home, Reuben and his best friend Sandy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) go to the party and run Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston) whom they attended school years ago. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Polly is forgetful and sloppy and lives negligently, which is the opposite of whom Reuben is a person, but they are still going to go and Reuben will change as a person when he starts trying new things like salsa dance and eating spicy food. But one day, Lisa goes back and wants to stay with Reuben, but he doesn't really want to, but Polly decides to leave because he doesn't believe in marriage. <br /> <br /> This movie is John Hamburg's second redirector who wrote "Zoolander" and "Meet the Parents" in two largely unsuccessful scenarios, but these two films seem to be classic compared to its hidden piece. It is very easy to say that nothing is funny, but I think it is even easier to find out with this film. This film is completely and completely predictable from the beginning to the end of each scene, as if it were just a ridiculous script. Hamburg, who also wrote the script, seems to have written it without having to try anything else and sometimes he seems to be trying to create the same energy as "There's something about Mary," but the events seem incredibly forced. Did anyone really think the blind ferret was funny? If you do, it's easy! Few times, the emotional speeches that should all come together would be inexplicable, but everything they achieve is obvious. Stiller works a lot, but maybe he should work less and just wait for better scripts because this movie doesn't work as a comedy or a romance.
