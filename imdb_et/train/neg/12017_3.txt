I am a big fan of Ludlum's work and Covert-one's books, and I often thought how incredible they were to film. Imagine my excitement to learn that such a movie actually existed! The first in the series "Hades Factor" seemed an obvious place to start. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the film was disappointing. The simple elements of the film, such as Griffin's first encounter with Smith, are unnecessarily different from the book and much less inspiring. Several signs are also poorly cast. For starters Dorff is weird as Smith. Not a bad actor but an incredibly bad choice because he is too soft and unable to show many of John Smith's final qualities. <br /> <br /> Renaming, redistributing and even acting for a few characters will further damage this movie. For example, the removal of Victor Tremont and the feedback of the entire virus, including the involvement of VAXHAM, makes the whole film a bit blurry. Marty Zellerbach is a very large part of the book and the seat he takes varies a lot in the back seat (not to mention that the film's mark does not share something in the book's character) is another big mistake. <br /> Rachel Russel should probably be from Randi Russel. He should not only be Sophie Amsden's sister (it should be called Sophia Russel), but she should also work from the CIA, not the Covert-one. That brings me to my last point and I think one of the most important. There is currently no COVERT-ONE! Not until the second book of the series has been developed by Covert-One as a preventive measure by the President against further biological terrorism. In short - if you like books and want to see good adaptation, I'm afraid you're frustrated. Even though it is a feature film, it is thoroughly average, mainly due to shiny editing and bad effects. The ultimate nails of this very cheap coffin in this movie are the worshiped story and the boring-ditch-water.
