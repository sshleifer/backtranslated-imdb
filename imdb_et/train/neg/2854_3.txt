Dreyfuss plays his lost mobboss, but now he is "fixed." Lane is her daughter who is confused with her number unit (Goldblum) who should go with Lane's sister (Barkin). <br /> <br /> What one could consider casting a full-length cast (Burt Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan and even Richard Pryor's appearance can't help this plot, because Dreyfuss proves he's not "fixed" almost everything is outstanding. <br /> <br /> It's not like you didn't know what came in. The first ten minutes were nothing but boys trying to tell Goldblum what was in his store when Dreyfuss was out, but I save all the problems: skip this movie. <br /> <br /> The real reason I chose this movie is because I have recently been hit by Diane Lane and tried to see all of my movies. true hope is just a terrible plot, but also the fact that it doesn't show up in the last fifteen minutes (even though we hear him through the whole movie.) Even if more than half of the cast fan can't enjoy this movie. to smile what actually going. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars.
