Impression is put on Teen Ape sugercoma. When he wakes up, he is much hotter (the parts Debbie Rochon played at this stage) and revenge on those who did it wrong. Since the title and the box art indicate that it is really "Kill Bill" movies start, but this is Chris Seaver's movie, it is wildly incompetent satire (and I use this last term very loosely). say it's better than the first movie, but the truth is, I was so drunk in my ass when I saw a previous movie that I can't even count on comparing them now. But I had to enjoy it because I bought a sequel (see when I am drunk, no better word, no full and complete crappy movie) There are some laugh out loud (very few), but I remember Bonejack is funny. Well for at least just over an hour, it's powerful fast, which is worth it. <br /> <br /> My Class: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Accessories: Audio Commentary by Chris Seaver, actor Debbie Rochon and Lbp gang; Seaver's second comment; 31 minutes; Lloyd Kaufman's 6-minute respect for low budget images; Fake 2-minute syrup; photo gallery; Promo trailer; and Trailers: Mulva "," Make Egg Salad "," Fiilthy McNasty "1, 2 and 3;" Feral Man "," Bonesetter "," Midnight Skater "," Demon Summer ", and" Splatter Rampage Wrestling "
