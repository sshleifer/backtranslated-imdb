I have to say that many people have argued that some of us need time to make the new "Dukes" movie a modernized version. Oh PLEASE. If you think it is modernized, Hollywood can keep it. Many people on the MSN site have said that (and I quote): "You have to overcome the old fog and except what it is." Let me tell you something, I'm 24, so I'm far from being and OLD FOGIE, and I can't get it over, it was DISGRACE for anyone who is a dangerous country. The only thing in the movie's title was "DANGER". Whether all the embarrassment, smoking and drinking were really necessary. The cast was terrible. Jessica has shown the film for several hours and honestly I believe it's all gone on her head. He is in no way a Daisy Duke, perhaps a fluke, but certainly not a Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not Bo. They should have included the original as at least tails, but even Hollywood knew they would not approve the script. I mean, people who come today, even today's actors and actors, have a negative opinion, so why do some of you give positive comments.
