Do you like beautiful girls? Yes, I too. What's bad about pretty girls / women? Nothing imo, so why should I give this movie only five stars out of five, even though he got the "talents" of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? <br /> <br /> If I really wanted to see beautiful people, I would watch MTV or something. However, this is a movie, a so-called action movie. So does it really need the plot? I disagree with 100% but say yes. What is that? 20 minutes of footage from Part 1 (I can overdo it, but it seemed more than 20 minutes ...)?! That would be "no". But then again, you never know, people who looked at some of them may not know what they ate for breakfast this morning, so remember them ... hey, maybe I'll even remember them twice? Just be sure they don't forget ... at least until the credits are rolled out! <br /> <br /> So forget the story, the character, the real emotions, the "acting" (and not, I don't think the skirts are walking and / or fighting the women who are acting!) ... what does it leave? Yes, scenes. Action scenes aren't bad and that's why I gave the movie 2 instead of 1 star! I gave this film a chance, but it was a waste of time ... You have better things to do / watch, believe me ...
