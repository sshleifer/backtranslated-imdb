Having suffered this inaccurate movie, I admit that this is a more contemporary story than previous versions. But it is so inaccurate and it has been made so politically correct that after that I looked crazy. Davy Crockett was very poorly represented by Billy Bob, whom I thought would probably be better cast than Sam Houston, given the love of both men. I think Dennis Quaid (actual Texan), which is absorbed by itself, would have been the perfect Crockett and would certainly have brought its hunger for self-esteem. As a Texas and a true believer in Texas, I feel that Davy Crockett was the most important Texan, although he wasn't born here. Our unofficial motto is that Crocketti is not "if it is a fact". And this last scene of Alamo, where Crockett is the last survivor, must ever be the greatest offense to Davy Crockett. To even assume that this man and the flavored fighter giant promises to be alive is ridiculous. Three different reports of eye witnesses make him dead for the body of twelve or more dead Mexican soldiers, undoubtedly fighting tough hands. Finally, this flat ending movie allegedly depicts the battle of San Jacinto as a reciprocal battle with 600 Texicans vs 700 Mexican soldiers, when there was actually a closer look at 1,500 well-trained Mexican regulars. Every Texas school student who draws attention to his first Texas history class knows that the battle took the Mexican army to surprise during the siesta, and the Mexican army was so confused that they could not build ranks and fled because they had not been trained to fight cross-border hand.
