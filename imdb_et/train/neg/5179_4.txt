Without the effective care of the supernatural or poetic motives of mankind, this creative team must hope that its medium, unoriginal elements are effectively usable. The five-party party has gone manic, then genetically unavoidable, there is little rooted interest, because the only non-murdering element is the second-level dreadful and terrible acting "Wes Bentley" moped. In fact, everything is working deep on the skin. Although women complain about dark doors, secrecy is kept to a minimum. There is no nudity here. Also, there are not enough blood tips. All the sensations are kept in temptation, at a safe distance ... the regrettable fact, given the name of the directors, is the "butcher". Only the soundtrack, droning angsty alt-state, and the tense fluctuating score give any sensitive tension. Sometimes some static compositions in the scenario add an attractive low angle that adds a bad feeling ... but for a movie that calls itself a horror, I could never even slip. Perhaps more emphasis on social rejuvenation through blood consumption, scenes that target a different geometric shape outside the square, and a constant focus on playfulness through family malice or traps that are sympathetic characters, must avoid their dilemma escaping, would have improved my opinion. but it wasn't a good start at the beginning of my horror record.
