I can't believe people thought the smelly pile was funny. Rejecting the sense of humor between cruelty, disgust and stupidity, "There's something about Mary" leaves little reason to stay. Of course, Cameron Diaz is very beautiful, but it is never enough to record a movie. Ben Stiller is trying hard to work and is obviously very talented, but the film is loser. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, no scene was credible. The frames were poorly timed and poorly framed. Farreley brothers should be kept away from making movies at all costs. I check IMDB to see what they are working on so I know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; The bonus is once I smiled. It's not like I'm immune to humor or, in my opinion, alone. My wife hated it too. The next day we saw "Rush Hour" and laughed foolishly. This movie hit easily.
