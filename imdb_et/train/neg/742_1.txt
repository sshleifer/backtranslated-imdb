If this film had a budget of 20 million, I would just like to know where the money went from. The monkey can make the better CGI effects that this terrifying trash can take 3 hours, although I have to admit that machines and martians would have seen really, really cool original playhouse 1 game and early computer games. From the mid-90s, when the game was ever made. What are the riddles to where the money went? Pendragon films could have made a good film with the good old-fashioned models and computer-controlled cameras that were in 1975-1983. A. George Lucas, and actors who look like they care about what they do (or destroy in this case) about the same 20 million euros. This is probably the worst movie EVER! I'd rather sit through the 24-hour Ishtar screening to watch this movie again. I hated it completely! I retreat. I say it is a WORST movie EVER, because unlike other bad movies like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes, or Santa Claus captures the Marques, these movies are so bad that you have a special place in their hearts, you love them. There is no love for this movie, and there's no place on my DVD library. I sold it for one dollar. I contribute to the money spent on the film for the boat and other cast and crew members. Shame on you Pendragon movies! I want my money back!
