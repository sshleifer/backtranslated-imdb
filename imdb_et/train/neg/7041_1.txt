What else could you say about this movie except that it is just terrible. China Louise and Adam West have reasons to see it, but that is, but their talents are wasted in this jealousy. some Adam's scenes, like when she runs because you can't see her face. When Adam was embarrassed when he was in Zombie Nightmare, just think about what he needs to know about it? If it was before or after, I'm not sure, but the Zombie Nightmare is classic (see Mystery Science Theater 3000 version first and last) compared to it. Displacing The Wild One starring Marlon Brando starring. Tina sees stunning, though I hope she and Adam got a good salary! Hand over!
