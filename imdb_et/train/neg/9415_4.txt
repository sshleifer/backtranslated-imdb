Man On Fire's original screen version was heavily redesigned and often confusing when it was done for at least ten years and the past few years have not done better. This is a film that producers get too much money and little experience to get attention and everyone else is just paying their outstanding alimony or their drug dealer, because Scott Glenn's bodyguard goes to the limb to save his 12-year-old reward, abducted daughter of a rich Italian family. Interesting performance - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Pryce - all have done better, the action is slow and sparse, and only John Scot's exceptionally fine score (which is part of Die Hard's last roll) makes a positive impression. One case where remake (made by Tony Scott's original director's choice for this version) is an improvement.
