Zombie Nation 2004 R <br /> <br /> Hey, I was bored. I watched my Comcastic in small boxes to find the movie. Zombie Nation? Hey, I love zombie movies. Says the filmmaker follows a culture in the description. Funny, how does it keep me from watching this movie? I could have used this advice. <br /> <br /> Zombie Nation is like Troll 2 in that it is completely misunderstood. It has little (depending on your point of view) dealing with zombies and it is all in one city. This film revolves around a crooked police who acts as badly as possible (she has to try to suck it a lot) while she arrests women in a trivial mess and then kills them. Yeah, he's a serial killer cop. Not only is this movie a mistake in thinking that it is a zombie flick, but it also gets the facts of this serum killer completely wrong. Serial killers can kill, they live for it and they get down and personally with it. This man knocks out the women and injects them into a poison. He is not even a dead bodyed sex nor split it. Talk about boring! Finally, one of the five women he kills is protected by Voodoo and obviously all the way back to life and head down to kill this guy. They were all buried or thrown into the ocean, but you don't know to buy the sharp, clean clothes they all wear. Women act very badly and take revenge. Oh yay. <br /> <br /> This movie was nonsense in all categories. Crap action, crap writing, crappier sets and crappier make-up effects. Women do not look like a zombie if you do not think of a truly dark mind around your eyes so that it is the actual definition of a zombie. They can talk, behave, think and act in a completely human way. Gore is weak compared to many PG-13 movies and nudity is short. You'll see the breasts in the opening order ... Then exactly the same breasts later! Get your finger off. I think only one actor was ready to go topless to this trick. The police station is so poorly constructed that you can see where they finished painting the warehouse they're probably filming. You'll see pipes and bad lighting and a too thin structure, and even if you're not blind, you'll see the driver's failure. Clearly, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> 1/10
