A nonsense short about half of the nude men who hit and hit each other. That's it. About 5 minutes we see it. It's black and white, with half the naked men running into each other in terrible music. It 's interesting, but there' s no plot and really - the resulting violence disrupted. Here, too, gay eroticism is played, but mixing it with violence was not a good idea. Some people who like avant-garde material might like it, but I found it to be incomprehensible, boring, silly and (partially) distracting. Really - what is it all about? I saw it as a gay-short short film festival and the audience sat there in a silent silence. I really wish I could go down 1.
