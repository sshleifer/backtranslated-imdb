Geisha's memories are a nicely filmed film, no doubt. And action is generally excellent, at least as it depicts symbols as they are scripted. <br /> <br /> But so many small and big details are just _wrong_ that it just disturbs me too much to be enjoying it. The little detail that characterizes this type of sensitivity is one scene (not that it breaks something) where Mameha rings in the winter, where Sayuri lives at the house door, on a snowy winter day. The time he's calling is a fury or a wind game - it's just rusting out of Japanese houses in the summer! People in traditional Japanese homes had no doorbells - they opened the doors and announced themselves. (It may be thought that this is such a trivial detail, but I would equate it with a film made in America, where Christmas Day hangs on the door in July and no one thinks about it.) for geisha, which is vague in Asia / china / kung-fu-ish, and something like the real thing. I think that this relatively cavalier attitude to the culture they are trying to portray really manifests in the attitudes and images of people and situations. So, I think the less you know about Japanese culture and the world of geishas and maiko in Kyoto (which is what "Miyako" is), I think the more you enjoy it. I honestly believe that this movie could have been so much better ... as it is, it's another "exotic Japanese" version of Hollywood.
