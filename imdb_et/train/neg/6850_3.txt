As a girl, Hinako moved from her small village to Tokyo, leaving two of her best friends, Fumiya and Sayori. She returns as a young woman, surprised that Sayor died when she was a teenager. He connects himself with Fumiya and is scared to find out that Sayor's resurrection is sent through Shikoku Island. Oh boy. I rented it because I like Asian horror and I think Chiaki Kuriyama is a great actor. Unfortunately, if I had to describe Shikoku in one word, it would be "fruity". This film is silly, boring, poorly filmed, unimaginable and above all dishonest. Kuriyama has a minimum screen time for the resurrected Sayor and little work is given to his character.
