Spoilers Too often, Hollywood Shakespeare adjustments are entertaining in the cinema. Beautifully shot they are well done and faithful to the text. Movies, including Branaghi's "Henry V" and 1993's "Muhu's Many" are powerful works. By looking at the "work of love lost", it is such a disappointment that they are expected to be discouraged so concealed. Unfortunately, the "work of love lost" is terrible! The Navarre King (Alessandro Nivola) and his friends have been drinking and women for three years to focus on their studies. However, the plans will come to a halt when France's mysterious princess (Alicia Silverstone) and her entourage arrive. Soon love in the air and philosophy is out of Prince's mind. <br /> <br /> From the beginning you realize that this movie is not really Shakespeare. Smart relocation to the music of the 1930s by Ken Branagh, the plot is still there and the script remains, but now it is sacrificed to the dreadful musical taste. Classics like "The Look You Tonight", "Music and Dance", "I'm in Heaven" are destroying all the weak songs and the strong feeling that they just don't belong here. <br /> <br /> Despite the weak songs, we also treat a growing number of uncomfortable performances with regular letters. Ken Branagh and friends can enjoy this movie, but they offer us a staggering role in the stomach. <br /> <br /> The main eight players (four men and four women) are all equally terrible and the only positive on their behalf is the tremendous advancement of a truly terrible Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> In fact, only one person deserves a movie and is consistently a great Nathan Lane. Over the years, Lane has proven to be a comedy genius and, in this function, she adds Costor once again. <br /> <br /> There is little to say. The "lost work of love" deserves a slight praise of Branaghi's original old stories. Unfortunately, it is still positive. The "Lost Work of Love", which has been poorly acted, performed, sang and built, is perhaps the weakest adaptation of Shakespeare for the past 40 years. This should be avoided like a plague and should never be done. Poor, disappointing choice from Branagh and here's hope that his next effort is better.
