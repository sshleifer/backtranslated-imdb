Really amazing bunch of board! <br /> <br /> Predictable, slow-moving, soul-destroying, mind-blowing film that your wrists cutting rusty bread knife seems ... well, almost necessary. <br /> <br /> The action is over for a thin dialogue, every scene is at least twice as long as it is needed, the complicated details of how this career is collapsing or that the career grows is just too harsh for words. and everyday. Music would be good if you hadn't had to sit through the movie, but really, three good songs aren't a good reward for the effort to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie I asked God for narcolepsy or someone who was shooting me. <br /> <br /> Never, ever.
