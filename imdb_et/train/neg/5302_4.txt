Dewaana's film goes through the usual clich√©s. A man and a woman fall in love and get married, a husband is allegedly a dead family friend who wants his family's happiness, a woman marries again and a surprise surprise man No. 1 again appears. The film reminds Yash Chopra Chandni and countless others. Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan give good results. Amrish Puri, as a villain, passes through the movements and nothing more than the usual Bollywood villain, Nadeem Shravani's music is great, all the songs were great. My favorites are Sochenge dark pyar or Koyi na koyi chahiyye. Dewanna is an ordinary film that moves through the movements.
