This movie was a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I watched movie movie enthusiasts who have a varied taste in movies, but always a sharp "genius" (if one of them) in my colleagues' comments on this site was the steaming label?); one of them did not find any quality of redemption. We finished the movie in a stroke that I don't repeat here. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the positive comments here are written by Sir Anthony Hopkins. After one of these reviewers tells you, did he finance the movie himself? because no one else in Hollywood or the rest of the world is threatening one cent or a good name for this movie. Don't let the semi-actresses appear in the movie attract you to your clutches? as Christian Slater acknowledges the signing of "making" in special attributes, he wrote the film without reading the script or knowing no details (stupidity, which I am sure he will never repeat). <br /> <br /> I want an unhappy individual who stumbles upon this self-expression church that is written, directed, produced and financed by a man who is too famous to admit that not everything he creates is a masterpiece (and if you don't believe me, please google "Anthony Hopkins" AND ART ".
