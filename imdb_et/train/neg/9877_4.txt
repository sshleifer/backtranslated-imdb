Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic Roald Dahl book. Wes Anderson leads and respects the same name as a short book in full screen full screen. Although I respect Anderson, an incredibly talented person, it seemed that the film had lost its smart spirit. Anderson seems to be behind the story knowing that he is a talented man, and if that happened to be a bad film, it would be his first bad film. Just like going to school and on the first bad day, it's Anderson's first bad day in making a movie, so I'll let him out. I admit that he has this mind and a nice spirit, and the animation is great, but the film gets harder, leaving the story behind and taking random things at random. The characters are also good. Jason Schwartzman voices Mr Fox's (George Clooney) smart ass, Ash and especially interesting. The film is not really terrible, but it will definitely go closer and closer. I'm sure Wes Anderson will be back with another amazing movie when he decides to make another movie, but now I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, this movie was a big disappointment.
