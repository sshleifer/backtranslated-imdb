The film did what he did to show how a young girl is exposed to poverty and grows into maturity. However, most of us have studied this issue sufficiently and in most cases more complex than here. The film fixed the breasts, which quickly became boring and I lost interest. If it were on television, I would have included the latest news from the Starr report. It's so boring when I found this movie.
