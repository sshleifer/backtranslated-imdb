(Some possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> I am not sure what Dreamworks was thinking when they decided it was extremely tired and the flat animated film would fall below $ 80 million. They probably thought that impressive animation would be more than enough to bring the audience (mostly families) to see droves. Well it seemed that it was open at the weekend, it made about $ 26 million, about $ 38.1 million. total (estimate for this weekend). But I think that the viewers who came at the weekend saw the same thing I did when I saw and spread the word. This is one of the main flat films, apart from animation everything else, most of the script seems to have been done for three years. <br /> <br /> The movie is only about 80 minutes. long, but it seems to be a three-hour epic. For me, there are some seeming points, well irritating narration is one of them and it's so obviously written. At one point he escapes some of the prisoners, and while you see that the horse is obviously frightened, a narrator (talented Matt Damon's voice) appears to find out any misconceptions (which would only happen in the simplest ways of thinking. Br /> <br /> Bryan The constant pop-up of Adams songs, now I'm a fan of his music, I think he's good, but come on, does Dreamworks really think that viewers have the chance to behave 8-9 on his songs for such a short film, finally, and here is the spoiler, the horse gets a point of impact from the caliber, not less, then he (the horse) then falls on the river The spirit (the focus of the film) tries to save him, but they both move over a waterfall of at least 50 below the foot, at the end of the film we see that this horse is alive and well. I know it's a child's film, but even this little reality is unacceptable. <br /> <br /> ie, i'm not saying kids don't enjoy it, but no one else is watching their watches just wait for this race to end. Definitely my top 10 worst list ever. - ** 4 stars. <br /> <br />
