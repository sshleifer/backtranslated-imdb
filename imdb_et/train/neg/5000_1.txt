This is probably the worst excuse for television programs, because, I don't know what it is now? Nothing has ever happened to this ridiculous "series". Although it is mostly photographed by Britney and Kevin himself, you will not get any good for your personal life. It is mostly those that make fools, jokes, and act like a white trash. Look, I love Britney's music as much as the next child, but this show is just a clean filler for the people that are so addicted to Britney that they look at her clip on her toenails (yes, this may be a real episode). God thanked those two for breaking because they were ATTENTION. This show is TOXIC!
