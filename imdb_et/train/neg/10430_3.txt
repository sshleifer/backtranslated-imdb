The new BSG has many good things. For example, model 8 and 6 have several Cylon roles played by two actors. Galactica has an old school industrial design ("My ship is not connected to my body!"). <br /> <br /> It makes it even more bitter that the end was so childish. <br /> <br /> Yes, the first part, the scenes in space, the attack on Cylons and everything that was very good. But is it over? I always watch movies and show the days when the timer is hidden, so I never know how much time it will last. So it was a special torture for me to see if the end is over and over again. Every time I thought it was the last scene, the last shot, I got another one. Every funny character got its end! It wasn't really necessary. <br /> <br /> What really highlighted this school student amateurship: Young Roslin Scenes. Why is it important to know that she lost her sisters and father in a terrible accident and that she has one nightmare with a former student / student? What does this story bring? Where was the connection? Now, for the whole of Europe-ish-style approach and casual acts in films and exhibitions, all this, but it was just ridiculous. It didn't bring anything important to the story. <br /> <br /> I have also seen "the last extraordinary" and the fact that Ron revealed his lack of wisdom: he couldn't come up with a good story, so .... he just didn't! It is never as many of the characters as they did in the last episode. The whole "it was in the past thousands of years" idea, the thing of the mitochondrial Eve, was also used in the Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy and I believe there are many BSG observers who know this particular H2G2 story. And speaking of Hero, there is now a story that WAS didn't work well for. Instead, we get Roslin's former student who is 20 years younger. Don't get me wrong, I'm all the older younger women. The more power they have. But that ... just didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> In summary (this writing), this series is so bad as they intended their characters. This is true even for the last episode. I hope that the lost and 24 make their series better.
