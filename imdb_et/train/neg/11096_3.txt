I had great hopes for this movie because I thought CLEAN, SHAVEN (Kerrigan's first feature) was an absolutely terrible, most definitely low-budget film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> But much of CLAIRE DOLAN is totally useless and flat. The scene after the scene seems to be mixed randomly, without storytelling or characterizing a lot of thinking. <br /> <br /> Is Claire trying to escape as a prostitute or not? Hard to say. Why does he pick up an airport trick if he wants to get out of this life? Why doesn't he get tricks when he needs money in Seattle? Why do we need to see her hair color that is almost the same color? Why does Claire accept some and not others? The filmmaker doesn't seem to be aware. <br /> <br /> It seems that everything has been improvised (although I understand it was not) and the filmmakers kept the camera as if they were a documentary by Verite. <br /> <br /> After seeing the screening, Kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by politically conserving the narrative of the film. It sounded like learned rhetoric. I think it was a challenge. <br /> <br /> I'm sad that the filmmaker is as exciting as CLEAN, SHAVEN will continue to make such a flat film and then protect it from the tired old "political" clich√©s.
