"Trigger Man" is definitely the most boring and clever film I've ever seen in my life. My aunt's vacation videos are more exciting. <br /> <br /> It seems the actors are recruited at uglypeople.com. They have no talent to act convincingly. <br /> <br /> They walk and walk and walk through the woods. There's more walking than all three "Lord of the Rings" together. After the first hour I started to read the Porsche brochure by following the "Trigger Man" journey. Calm. <br /> <br /> A waste of time and money. I'd give this movie out of 10 out of 10 because it's not possible, I have to give 1 star.
