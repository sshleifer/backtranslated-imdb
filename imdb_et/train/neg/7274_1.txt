The "National Lamp Goes to Movies" (1981) is just the worst film ever made, far from the camera as even the "Outside Plan 9". <br /> <br /> The Lampon movie is spoken in three segments, each of which is said to have been damaged by the usual film genre, but everyone lands on our feet with sick fog. There is no rhyme or reason for the vignettes to be filled and no noticeable story. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer on this site has written that the only good points about the movie are naked scenes. True, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry flash a little flesh and are very nice. But the directors do not realize that even R&D needs a good story around it. There is no such thing here. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst of the three segments is Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here we see that Benson is a young, eager beaver policeman associated with a cynical old man played by Widmark. And for a moment, those of us who are still watching this unpleasant cinematography have rejoiced at the idea that we are seeing a redeeming story of how a young, idealistic policeman brings about a cleansing change in an old-fashioned approach to police work. But there is no such happiness. As we said, this film has no redemption values. It's all the time up to the final fade-out - which is perversely stretched longer than it should last on the screen. Apparently, the filmmakers knew they had a bad thing and wanted as little as possible.
