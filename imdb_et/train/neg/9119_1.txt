I saw it in the movie theater in my original edition. It was painful to see how Peter Sellers were so badly disturbed. The story was incredibly flat and difficult to follow, and the end was ridiculous. It was just sad to see how mighty had fallen. I'm not saying I'm a big fan of Peter Sellers, but I enjoyed the Pink Panther series and felt that he gave a strong result. But this movie should never have been done. What I have read, he was working on creating this movie with the advice of the people around him. Well, but it doesn't release the studio actually release the movie.
