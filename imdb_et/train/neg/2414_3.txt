I found this flick on the "new release" on the shelf and found that the hip-hop zombie flick is too interesting to go on. That was the case in every case, and I thought to myself, "What a great idea!" Also on the cover is "Welcome to Oakland". How did I resist? Unfortunately, the hip-hop part only lasted as long as the issue of opening. Neither hip-hop nor hip-hop culture played a major role in the film. Having lived in Oakland myself, I know there are many aspiring hip-hop artists so that the low budget of this flick was not an excuse for an inappropriate soundtrack. Any number of distressed artists would have jumped to the opportunity to contribute to this flick. Why Quiroz Brothers didn't use it is mine. <br /> <br /> When the film was rolled out, it was a completely typical zombie film that was just black and Latino. One might think that this would make the film an unusual inclination, but it wasn't. Somehow, Quiroz Brothers' vision of "urban culture" falls below the ride and drops the F bomb in every row of the movie. The quick use of the word "devil" is probably the most distinctive feature of this movie; there were single lines that contained the word three or four times and no lines contained it at least once. I am not talking about capturing the film at all, but it was felt that it was the result of the lack of ideas by writers (including Quiroz Brothers) and the script was generally very bad. br /> <br /> The film was generally disappointing. It would have been interesting to see a truly "urban culture" zombie flick, but "Dead Life" does not support this hope. Movie characters can just be white or Eskimo, or something else. The film had no special taste. It's just one small, low-budget, low-budget flick with a bad actor, bad writing, an amateur direction, empty cinematography, a cheap soundtrack, and something that is not recommended.
