Creep - "Your trip ends here." Some very graphic scenes and ... well, that's all for this movie. <br /> <br /> No real plot, no story. No pleasant characters, so-called characters are not right, because you have no idea who anyone really is. I mean, they are drained by the sewer (what is this thing? Why is it there) we are looking for a "thing", it's pretty scary, but I really care? No, I don't. Why don't I? Because I have no idea who these people are and I don't know if I want them to live or die. It's one-dimensional and relies on gore and sound effects to scare you into what it rarely does. <br /> <br /> This film has no meaning, any purpose. I seem to have fallen asleep and missed a 45-minute cancellation. It jumps to the right. In principle, some women and their friends are locked into the London Underground, sending them to a strange creature, then finally escaping. <br /> <br /> Scrap has moments that jump you, art is good, location is great and sound is fine, but it doesn't make a good horror movie, so unfortunately everything that is wasting. <br /> <br /> It's nothing new. Another predictable modern "horror", where Kate (leader "character") consistently foolish "hey, I know you sit a lot at home, I think I should do a reasonable thing in this situation, but I'm not going to do the opposite because I I am a stupid blonde, I wish they did not, it has been done so many times, it is boring and predictable. In fact, I am quite annoyed that a foolish woman did not get, erm, gray, alien-looking creature. > <br /> "Your trip is over here" is the tagline for the movies. Well, the Creeps trip ends in the movie in just a short time. If you have had some beer, I got a couple of companions to you, so be sure to check it out by any means. if you want something original and smart, don't do it.
