Not as bad as some make it out, though obviously pathetic compared to the original. In my opinion, Amitabh was great as a villain Babban Singh - try not to compare with Gabbar in the original because they were obviously not the same effect. Other than some mediocre scenes, but the rest of the movie is broken. The characters were bad and the story was hopeless, with many gaps and missing data, which I wouldn't have known if I hadn't read the back of the DVD case. The worst part of the film was the roles supporting Nisha Kothar and especially the new guy Prashant Raj. Nisha is just annoyed since her lips opened. Like Prashant Raj - seriously who is this man? where did he come from and why was he on the ground in the movie news other than serving drinks? His ability to act is zero and he has the same tone, dialogue and definite expression in every scene, be it a comedy or even a scene if someone is dead. Ajay Devgan was average, at least his expressions changed, which is more than I can say my mistake after companion. In general, RGV Aag is worthy of taking care of the performance of Amitabh and also very sexy Urmilla Matondkar.
