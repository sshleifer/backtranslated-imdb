This movie is another in my movie list that doesn't speak. I saw it 40 years ago as a young man who was late to do this was very annoyed that it was about 95% romance, 4% everything else, 1% history. That's what I call bait and change, an interesting title, the real film is a scam. This is a topic that deserves a good film, this film is almost offensive to those who served. The actual members of Lafayette Escadrille were not out of the law and they were not products of abusive homes, they were actually idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I think many of them came from a higher class background than the character of Tab Hunter. The flying school is not meant for intelligent alcoms, and all that is, the individual, as the person depicted here, would not have lasted two days, it would have been a shelter or infantry. The French army's discipline was often quite acute. In short, another Hollywierd version of the historical episode that deserves proper treatment.
