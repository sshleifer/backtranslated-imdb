It's not a horror movie, it's a boring sex movie. A very bad movie to be avoided by a serious spooky fan. No plot, terribly acting and tedious music. If you only look at the trailer you know enough, it is a shame that such a thing is available on VHS or video, if there are so many good movies. If you like vampires, try Hammer Productions or Italian Gothic instead of Mario Bava and Antonio Margherit instead. These are masterpieces when compared to a trash can. Rating = even "1" is too much! And believe me, I'm not the only one with that opinion.
