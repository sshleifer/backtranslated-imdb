The film itself is so pathetic. It was the hearing of the deaf as cynical people. True, some deaf are cautious about hearing people, but they may not be angry, as Marlee Matlin's character was the whole story. Kurt people don't go to the bar and dance as Matlin did. All in all, the film itself is boring as pathetic. It is so boring that I would like to believe that this is a cure for insomnia. If I have a sleeping question, I can just go and watch a little God. It makes me sleep. <br /> <br /> Remember that this is the deaf who speaks.
