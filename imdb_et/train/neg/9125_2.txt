This is one of the fun things to do with young people. I've been talking about some other film before, where the commercial comedy of a (comedy) film seems more fun than it is. Seeing this ad in 1981 made me think it's a wildly funny movie. What I and my brother saw with me didn't know that the television scene was the last scene in the movie! <br /> <br /> Because this scene is the end result of all the movie's results, I can only guess that nothing else was funny to use! The last scene is thanks to the young boy Dr. Fu Manchu turns from a long bearded old man to a bright young Asian / Elvis, like a rock star! (Not less with the singers!) <br /> <br /> For no reason, in the 1930s, Peter Sellers makes the best of his material, but he does not give any real reason for his "comedy". a moment. The rest of the participants were just ordinary and my brother and I sat all this hardly laughing. It was only natural that we waited for a pink panther-type comedy, Peter Sellers was so big. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that it was his last movie before he died. His appearance on the Muppet Show was more fun than this ill-prepared flop. However, I do not blame him. I'm guilty of anyone else who didn't try to make a better movie about it. 2 stars are generous!
