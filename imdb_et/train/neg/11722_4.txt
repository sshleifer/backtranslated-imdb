The CONTRACTER problem is a summary of the scene. The CIA wants the international terrorist to die so that it can contact the Black Ops assassin. The Terrorist appears in London's Old Bailey Court, which raises the question of why they want to kill a terrorist when he plans to spend the rest of his life in prison? He's out of both circles. Was the CIA unable to arrest before? If he doesn't get guilty at random, kill him. There is no logical reason to kill someone who spends his life in maximum security <br /> <br /> As the assumption creates a story, the audience can choose to ignore the plot hole, but the expertise itself heats the fuel fire. Dial's colleague kills the police bullet and the taxi they are riding on, but Dial can escape. So the police were close enough to shoot anyone, but too far to catch someone in a car accident? This type of parcel film. The police later selects a police inspector to see him, saying, "This airport is surrounded by armed caps," but Dial can easily escape without explanation. The whole movie deceives its audience, based on things that have never been explained. This includes an important supporting character called Emily Day. Why does he help to call, even though he has wanted to escape? Your guess is as good as mine <br /> <br /> This is a pretty bad thriller and is not taken by the "big name". Wesley Snipes qualified as a movie star but killed her career with more and more recent films. Charles Dance also appeared in big budget Hollywood productions, such as LAST ACTION HERO and ALIEN 3, but again he is best known for appearing today in DVD ticket prices, and he still plays a playful role. Lena Headey-like can become big players in the cinema, but definitely can't continue with the player
