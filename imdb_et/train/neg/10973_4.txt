If you love Pulp Fiction and like hand held cameras, you should love this movie. I liked the peculiar story (though I feel "Pulp Fiction" was the film most appreciated by The English Patient) and found the characters unrealistic but interesting. It is neither a "waterfront" nor a "Citizen Kane" and is burdened by a European claim. But the worst part is a hand-held camera. It's so annoying and annoying when I found myself unexpectedly to stop the movie. I don't know why the new leaders think that this method of filming is so great. If you have a tendency to get sick, stay away from it, the camera has nausea for about 10 minutes.
