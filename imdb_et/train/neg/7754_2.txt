Spoilers are in it. The film could have been better if they had just another script, director and CGI provider. Not much? In the movie, there is a man who starts his own theme park ... err ... in an abandoned island where people see dinosaurs ... err ... Sabretooths and it's called Jurra ... oops ... Primal Park. I don't mind rip-offs because there are no original ideas for these movies, but it just hits you with the face, it's even a "creature-hidden head design". Sabretooths, which are not prime parks (Just ancient killing cats), are not sabretooths, are rather junky, but crowning is what I call "Sloggy". Because after removing one big cat, the hero is a little relaxing because there is only one. Enter a strange nutritionist who says: Nah, we did three, the third is a monster who pulls himself around the forefeet. Great, great. The College's Student Group is also on an island that tries to hunt for a trap, there is a test to get into their clicks or sort (always thought it needed a short nickname). Only one of the people has done their job, so I got out of it. Oh yes, the mandatory "Evil Capitalist Must Die" Clique is in force not one, but two of them! The death of Mr Primal Park is the most ridiculous thing you see in one of these films as Sabretooth's shape tooth cans (Sloggy's liking), some size shrinking and sucking through a person's throat. If I could have been so easy. I like "Sabretooth" better than this spin-off.
