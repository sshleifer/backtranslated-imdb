Originally, I was interested in this film after reading a review that said this film reminded Silent Hill of the reviewer. <br /> <br /> Being a huge fan of Silent Hill and disappointed with the debut of this movie, I thought I'd give it one chance. Me, Fearnet lists this movie only as "dark floors", not its full name. So when I saw the name "Mr Lord" on the credit that I immediately thought of the band (I had some friends in the college who like them), but didn't think it was important and quickly put aside the thought. <Br /> <br /> The film begins strongly. Despite the fact that DEATH has been given a "horrible little girl", the feeling of sound and isolation began to make good use of the story. The fast atmosphere was quickly built and every indication that the film is great. Because the monsters are the real stars of horror, I couldn't wait to see what was in the hospital halls, and the main characters were up to date ... <br /> <br /> And then the first monster showed me and I found myself very underconscious. By the time the second appeared, I beat that it seemed that it had just come from a Megadeth concert, and stupidity turned me off completely. <br /> <br /> During the film, the atmosphere remained intact, and the story continued to reflect on what was happening, but the fears were pretty much non-existent. However, I found the hope that the end will make it all worthwhile. Unfortunately, this was not the case. By the time the movie was reached, it is at its peak, I was incredibly unbelievable and I immediately felt my bad lie in my final revelation ... Lord's singer? Seriously? <br /> <br /> Is what the movie all boiled for? The members of Lord's band hospitalized around bad breath? A stupid monster is suddenly meaningful. If you want to be such a crown, it can also be through Marilyn Manson members or even KISS. Not to mention that I'm pretty sure I saw the end of one of Lord's music videos a few years ago. They had to go out and make a whole movie of it? Worst of all, when I found out what was actually going on, everything I could manage was awake. I'm not going to "destroy" it for you, but I can say for sure that this is probably the plot device you've seen before. Probably more than once. <br /> <br /> So if you're not a big Lord fan then stay away from it. It is not scary, it does not bring anything new to the table (although it does a decent job on other horror films, mainly Silent Hill). And I can't stress it enough, LORD is an antagonist. LORD. Talk about buzz. <br /> <br /> Really, you would be better off trying to scare yourself when watching Slipknot music videos. In other words, it's not just possible.
