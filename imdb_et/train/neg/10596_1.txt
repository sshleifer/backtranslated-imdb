Van Damme. What else to say? Bill Goldberg. WE ARE. Now we know that this movie is really terrible. <br /> <br /> I saw the first five minutes of this movie at TBS, knowing it would be bad. But not even I thought it was bad. The plot is terrible, Van Damme is getting old (eventually), but unlike Arnold, he has films. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie. Don't look at it. Never. I wouldn't even be watching this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 Stars - Your heart has a wonderful, exciting exciting journey. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe not, but marketers would like us to think we're not? <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
