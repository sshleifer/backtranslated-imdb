Well, it's 90 minutes of my life. This movie makes teenage television show "California Dreams" look like "Almost Famous". Action was terrible and the story was unreal. Don't even let me start from the actual band at the forefront of this story, lame songs, watch, etc. You had to believe they were one of the hottest countries in the country, and there is not enough irony in it. against the world. A guitarist is considered to be a heroin consumer, not to blame him when I was in a bunch of band with hidden songs and a wooden action that I also injected into a horse. <br /> <br /> If you take music seriously, avoid it at all costs.
