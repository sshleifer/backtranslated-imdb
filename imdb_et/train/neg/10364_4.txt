The book is so good that at least the opening of a film made on television moves you, but when it becomes more and more different from the book, it takes all the religion and love and the clich√©s of mathematics and cotton candy, it becomes boring. However, I have heard that people who have not read a book tend to like it, and even if it leads a child to read A Wrinkle in Time, it has accomplished its purpose. The most embarrassing change is to turn Happy Medium Mary Poppins' uncle into an Albert clone (I love to laugh). Nothing is so harsh that makes characters on the screen ridiculously laugh at things that are completely uncomfortable.
