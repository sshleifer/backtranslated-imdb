I'm a fan of the series and I've read all 7 books. I wanted to see it to see how it was done. I can say that the only people who should watch it are those who have already read the series and are curious. It's pretty bad and turns you off from reading them. Not to be average, but Lucy is so ugly that it reduces the film. Was he the daughter of the leaders? Seriously, I'm sure the bunches in the movie were jealous. She had a surprise that put every beaver in shame. The film loses so much in translation. CS books don't interpret as easily as Tolke's LOTR books or even Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> One thing they did right! Aslan! very well done. Although other people with painted faces (bunches, wolf) look stupid, Aslan was really well done because it was not just a person walking around. (I think it's like an old horse custume? 2 people inside?) I'd also be curious about what kids think about this movie. Maybe they would enjoy it? But as with adults, it's a safe bet, even as a CS fan.
