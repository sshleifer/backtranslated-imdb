I've already seen fantastic stories, but its rooms are so incredible that it's ridiculous. The rich and young man passes the heart on the day of transplantation after the marriage, and he is somehow witnessing his surgery and the plot of his surgeons to kill him. Even if there is a medical explanation for such a phenomenon, what happens next is the dialogue between the dialogue ... say ... souls? ... maybe and real life, where a committed mother does everything to save her son's life. There is no intercourse or excitement, but a combination of a bad and a simplified plot that includes many coincidences that can never happen in life. <br /> <br /> This doesn't mean the movie is completely missing - in fact, the first-time director Joby Harold is doing a good job of leading a good team of actors who include Hayden Christensen in his first important role after Anakin Skywalker's costume, the fabulous Jessica Alba and taking super-talented Lena Olin. Everything would have deserved a better story.
