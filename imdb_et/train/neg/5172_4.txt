This is the second film I saw for Horrorfest last weekend, The Gravedancers is the first. Gravedancers was better. I can only think that it must be quite limited. I admit that the story started to be interesting, but finally it really hit me. We didn't really have time to understand or understand any symbol that made each of its insecure qualities even more annoying. I have to mention that a 12-year-old boy, who was a sheriff, also had a bit of misinterpretation. The only reason I sat across the film was to find out what was a great secret that wasn't so interesting. A few more backgrounds of the family would have helped, but they didn't even know the family at all. <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is so amateur that I didn't even see it on a DVD. Four ratings are for the initial potential that the story could have. It was one to skip.
