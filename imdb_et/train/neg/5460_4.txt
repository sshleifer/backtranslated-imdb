Oddly enough, only three episodes were included in the Columbo Series 6 season, and at least two scripts contain very little evidence of quality based on this "man-in-the-mac" and "Fade into Murder" addition. Feibleman wore both of the above-mentioned scripts (he randomly plays part of the murdered guard here). <br /> <br /> This adventure is very rare and many performers just look at the material. The story is rather weak, somewhat boring for a long time. <br /> <br /> Columbo is also shaded by a colleague (similar to "Last Salute to Commodore"), but the value of entertainment is minimal. In addition, Celeste Holm's traits for comedy are more embarrassing than laughing. <br /> <br /> The script sounds like a family history and a murderer to give Columbo a gift. , although there is never a reliable discussion about the motives of his crime. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Columbo's worst adventure brings a series of fun moments. He quizzes men's hairdressers and simultaneously has a haircut / manicure. The next 5 minutes are fun - it's just that Columbo's hair is so well-groomed, he can't pay his bill and when he makes inquiries with jewelers, he's looking into the mirror to admire his hairstyle! <Br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only decent moment in the script that looks like it has been put together in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Only for Columbo graduates.
