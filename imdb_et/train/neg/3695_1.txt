Not the best actor movies. The director is focused on the chosen actor's stardom, not a good entertainer. May be a hero himself, his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it. But it certainly isn't worth the neutral audience. Sequencing sequences are a complete comedy. Dances move in pathetic songs. Music is average. This film was the greatest flop of the actor. Despite the film created for the film, the film failed to succeed. Don't even think about watching this move, even if you want to kill time. You can watch some comics. A good movie buff can't digest that crap for 2 1/2 hours.
