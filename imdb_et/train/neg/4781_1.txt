It may have been a poor example of amateur propaganda. Writers and producers should study German films of the thirties and forties. They knew how to sell. Even the Soviet-style silly leader like the godly father-figure was better. Disappointment. The disappearance of the faith, which recently came back to church again at the time, when the father was rescued by Hoover / God, was not too bad. Unfortunately, it seemed rushed and not nearly melodramatic enough. Some hostile celestial images of an angelic hoover that would be in the corner of the screen beam and nodding would have added a lot. The best aspect is Hoover, who saves only the deserving family and the children that the WHO had proved its worth. Unfortunately, other poor homeless people were presented as pleasant and even good, but Hoover-God does not help them. A better approach would have been to take these techniques to drink alcoholic beverages to show their justice. Finally, the bright and joyful recovery scenes (after Hoover's rescue from depression) should have been at the end. Then we could see how Hoover-God has not saved not only the family that deserves it, but also what everyone deserves. Amateur at best.
