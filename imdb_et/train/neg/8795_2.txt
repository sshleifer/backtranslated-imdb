I saw almost no redemption qualities in this movie. The only thing I saw was Quentin Tarantino's seemingly crazy obsession with this ... There were some attractive women in this movie and maybe it's one of the decent quality. In general, however, I found this film surreal and ridiculous. Hand-held film making with slow motion and other cinematic tricks I found clumsy and dizzy, even sick. In general, all the music was terrible and repetitive, as well as reminded me of the US military's psychological war against various malicious people. <br /> <br /> The different vignettes that make up the movie are random when they are placed and missed. their content and "conclusions" unresolved. This is a depressing film (not true _film_, a concept that I reserve for true art) that left me in a bad mood. Do not believe different people who try this "romantic comedy", although the individual elements of both films are definitely in terms of content, form and summary in relation to this genre. <br /> <br /> I recommend staying far apart from the seemingly redundant positive views of IMDb and other rating sources.
