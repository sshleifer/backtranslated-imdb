I have not read any IMDb comments about this movie, which mentions how the Jewish character of this movie jumped up and down like a little baby, because the gun is a racist nerve head on his face, while black characters from the movie's cord were not strictly shot off the gun. <br /> <br /> I don't know how anyone could perceive it as a balanced account of university life. I agree that universities are not bastions of tolerance, as they should be, and the title would be appropriate if Singleton did not make its mark on such a wide range of cartoons. <br /> <br /> On the surface, he tries to portray the character of an ice cube as a bad man, provoking Remy as a racial skinhead. But who ends the movie at the end of the redemptive epilogue? Singleton seems to be in control of the white because he cannot with empathy (I did not speak sympathy) with his black student OR ONLY on the racial skinhead. Many people who have been harassed by other racial people do not turn to the extreme test. <br /> <br /> Women have also not raped against lesbianism, which is more than a culture of lifestyle. Frankly, what was the point?
