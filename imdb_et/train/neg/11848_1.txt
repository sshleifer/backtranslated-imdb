What should be a simple general mystery that includes a dead philanthropist is actually a headache story of a bunch of characters (the only big actor is Ginger Rogers in a very early role) who are all trying to find a murderer among a small population in an elegant apartment house. These characters go straight from foolish to straight. With cheap and low budget output, most of the activities turn to Rogers and his chief (some guys, I don't care about who he is because he actually sucks) talking about his different ways of dealing with crime, constantly breaking the absurd detective with his head in his back. Frankly, I've never had a worse time watching this type of b-speed movie and I've seen some real head-to-head strikes. <br /> <br /> Oh, and butler didn't do it because there was no butler. But pay attention to the man who is the nearest butcher. It goes there. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
