I read comments on this movie and decided to do it. After all, I'm open minded and I've given some pretty good clips to some bad clips. As the final credits rolled over, I was looking for meaning and saying something nice. Here goes: "This movie was mercilessly short." That's all I got. <br /> <br /> Okay, okay. Sets and images were well done and the music helped to borrow the mood of the asylum, but the film was painful to look at and the endless dialogue took off the good bits. I found myself laughing at this film, but how do you laugh at your best friend who just tortured himself against a large crowd. <br /> <br /> "Chicken Dance" for the finals that I had just decided to tilt and roll and let the bodies fall where they fall. I don't know what could have saved this movie. The action was not bad and it seemed to have a budget, but it was simply not possible to look at it; not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts. Maybe I should have created a doobie or a lot of beer to get the film's full experience. Either way, I won't watch this movie again if I'm not really depressed. Then I can say, "At least I wasn't" dr. Tarri torture into the cave. â€œI'm better than these guys.
