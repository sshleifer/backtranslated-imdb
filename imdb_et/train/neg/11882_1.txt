I went on the shelf a few times, looking at the huge number of positive quotes (with small names) and wondering if I was missing something. The second night was on one movie channel and I tuned. I didn't miss anything. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I only looked at the first 30 minutes. Perhaps the film becomes a comedy for film. Considering the slow, bustling pace and full of laughter in the first 30, I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> The wizard will start the movie in the classic "I don't know how to start my movie", with a long, tiring monologue about how he doesn't want to complain. That's not funny. It is not even far from funny. Others have commented on "San Franclisco" bits; ok, small stabbing for the first time it says it. Then he grinds the ground, smiling at the camera as it is the most fun thing ever written. Go on yourself. In fact, I think talking to the camera was the reason why I didn't like the movie right away. Don't look at your audience. Known as _earned_, much like respect. <br /> <br /> From there you have a basically fat-free man who speaks in a very funny way about his dull life as a temp. I didn't know he was a Jew; It is uncertain for Jewish comedians to call it "Jewish humor". It's just strange humor. Just because you are a Jew does not mean that you have the skill for comedy. WASP, Spalding Gray, does a better job with self-analytical humor than this man, so obviously it is not ethnic. <br /> <br /> If one of the bits I had seen had worked, I could have beaten. But some schlub, who talks about how much he loves the names of his working women, lists them in five minutes, doesn't make a big movie. <br /> <br /> This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of "Office Space". Don't get yourself into target marketing. Just say "to the Haiku tunnel".
