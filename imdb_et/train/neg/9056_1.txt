I've seen some dirty movies in my life, but it has to be one of the worst. Certainly the bottom 100 material (imo, it is). <br /> <br /> We follow two pairs, Doddys (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy) in a car in Reno. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Lonnie is not too happy with her sex life, so she cheats with her wife Candy, who is trying to get a child. In the meantime, Roy is not sure whether his sperm is OK, so he checks it by a doctor. <br /> <br /> Now I had read the back of the DVD, but my girlfriend wasn't, and she blurted out after about 20 minutes: "oh yeah she's pregnant, but her husband can't be a baby". Turning on because this movie is so predictable. Also boring. And annoying. Meaningless. Solvent. Terrible. <br /> <br /> An example of the smell of this movie. Two pairs put Nevada in their big car when they were stopped by two police officers because they did not stop with a stop sign. The boys know each other and eventually take the beer to two officers. This scene is not only pointless and not important (or even relevant) for the movie, it takes about 5 minutes! It's just talking and talking and talking, never going anywhere. Apparently, Roy has no problem there as he is the father of a child. How many times does it happen in movies ... try something new! A disappointed woman will finally forgive her husband and best friend and they will all live happily. The best scene on the film is at the end, a few shots from the Grand Canyon. Why couldn't they keep the camera for 90 minutes? <br /> <br /> This pain could be expected more (though Thornton is actually trying), but you can't really blame them. Writers, shame on you! <br /> <br /> 1/10.
