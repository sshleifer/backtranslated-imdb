Given that John Doe has probably inspired Kyle XY's creator, I expected his pilot to be quite interesting. However, I had probably too high expectations because I was very disappointed with it. First of all, the main character turned to a freak, who had a crazy idea to show his amazing knowledge to the public in a public place. So after this scene I started to worry that it was just entertainment. But the problem is that it worsened because no other characters were properly embedded. They focused too much on John Doe, which made the story much less interesting. I was also a little disappointed with Dominic Purcell's performance because I found that he didn't make incredible John Doe. Another problem was the police story. It really seemed like déjà vu and it was not a pleasant feeling. This leads us to the worst problem, the episodic form. I can already see the successive fillers. Given how bad it was, I can now better understand why this show has been canceled. In some way, I have the impression that he did not fulfill his purpose by developing characters to help the protagonist find his identity. It is sad because there was potential, like the people he met in the club. The quality of the production was also quite good and the casting was right. But I never know if it's better, probably not, because I'm not going to look at the next episode.
