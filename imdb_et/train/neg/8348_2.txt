I just finished watching "El Otro". I've always taken my hat for Julio Chavez because he's a great actor, but this movie is really frustrating and slow. I think it would have been even worse if it hadn't been for Julio. Anyway, this is definitely a movie you will never understand if you are not from Argentina and even if you are, I would advise you to rent this movie so you can have a nice time with your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friends ... it's really frustrating and incredibly slow and the lot doesn't make much sense. The director probably wanted to show the weakness of human life, but what he does is impresses and impresses the public that has been a little shocked. It gives you something to think about, but not in a good way. In general, I didn't like this movie.
