had to see it because it seemed like a big scary presumption - the prisoners who found the magic book, oo err! there is claustrophobic fear etc. <br /> <br /> but the beautiful idea didn't seem like a story. not chilling / physical horror, he relied on an open and OTT body horror that didn't scare you at all, if you were over 12 years old. <br /> <br /> Finally, the logic is ridiculous when characters are killed by means other than body numbers. a waste of good signs - the best for this movie. <br /> <br /> An obviously low budget that doesn't break it, the movie really doesn't go anywhere, and believe it says it - Hollywood needs a remake. you just lose interest in this version. certainly not in the same league as the other French films that have emerged in recent years, such as the harsh rivers, which were at least traceable / entertaining, do not end up being malefique. and I can bet you can guess the end is before watching the movie. really very disappointing - not recommended.
