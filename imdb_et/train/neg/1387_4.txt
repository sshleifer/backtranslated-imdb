It is hard to believe that the "action" packed Jet Li movie could be so boring, but it was a transcendental trash. The plot is the amalgam of other Hong Kong chopsocky rails. Martial arts activities are all special effects and human talent. <br /> <br /> This is a comic book that tells about a group of supernatural soldiers who have to be killed because they are mentally unstable, one of them (Li) who keeps these incompetent armies to save them and restore life as a pacifist librarian. The recorded killers come up again with the Austin Powers quality piece to take over the world, and Li casts his new life to save the world. <br /> <br /> I saw what I saw, duplicated, and it may have highlighted a waffle line and a comic book with 25 cents of special effects. But I suspect that even 8-year-olds watching Ninja-Turtle would have found this minor and hollow.
