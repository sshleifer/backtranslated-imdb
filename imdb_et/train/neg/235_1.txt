Fine pain cannot raise the routine story of a secretary who has been murdered by her couple. In fact, there are more questions than answers in this one-sided issue of novel and murder; and because we are only given a prosecutor's office, one of these questions is not answered.

Could it be that if he wasn't two boyfriend's timing and communicating with a married man, could he have avoided the all-nasty murderous, fucking incident? If you look at it, don't worry about going to the refrigerator.
