I would like to say that unlike many people who did not like this film and found it impossible to understand, I fully understood what it is. Very inconsistent with the plot plot line. <br /> <br /> I do not like to override this word, but in this case it fits very well. In the first place, the director presents the material extremely "arrogant" and, worse, extremely inconsistent. It is inconsistent that it presents the material in a deliberately rearranged order, so we think the director was too drunk to remember which scenes will come first and arrogant in the 2 hours when they wait for us, the viewer CARE will finally respect this . <br /> <br /> I respect the surreal cinema that it is. (Create a story more than a real world that is not related to real life) But it is not unrealistic if the story is placed in the traditional modern times and in today's terrestrial setting, most importantly not being able to involve the audience but just a series of simply relocated events. The most accurate way to describe a movie viewing experience is as if watching the story; maybe even a very good story because it was based on a book, but is disappointed by the fact that the camera does not show the necessary moments and connects all the coherence tools. <br /> <br /> We compare the stylistic cinema. Compare Gaspar Noe's "Seul contre tous" with it. He gave us a single, extremely interesting and intellectually deep story. This film does not provide an intellectual study, and although it is very stylistic in a highly fragmented presentation, the director has finally given up good narrative of the important arts and everything we have left is a confusion of events that hardly associates. <br /> Yes, it is really possible to understand things .... POINT. But as I said before, the viewer reaches a stage where they just say, "Who cares." It plays like watching a dreary daily story of a person who goes to a supermarket and buys food without queuing. Even with murders, it's totally uninteresting and unrelenting. Too many people these days give high marks to what they cannot understand or just understand for horrible views and in any way this film TRIES to make the viewer stupid. <br /> <br /> You have too much time to watch this movie, considering what I've been talking about. This is a story based on a book that could have been presented in a much more effective way and that is my bottom line.
