When they came back from the video, Jim Ross talked about everything we had, the crowd's picture. said Owen Hart when the blue blazer has fallen and doesn't look good. Lawler came back from the circle where his face was when he told Jim that the situation was very critical for paramedics working hard to revive him. there was a private room where another judge came and told them that Owen was the first to know that Owen Harts was a constant prankster, but thought it was not real. when he fell, as he mentioned in another post, he shouted to move the judge and the journalist.
