If you have not seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, then there is no. A competition, such as "making your horror movie one day," could not come in when it was an insult to any viewer's intelligence. Mr. Sheets forgot some story, plot, right dialogue, the fact that people need some BASIC talent and the credited lighting designer forgot to show up. It seems to have been stored on handycams and copied to an even worse device. The make-up effect consists of a black mascara, so that zombies and yoghurt are poured into people's heads to simulate the melting of their skin. It is more than a home-made film and also very bad. Only fun to see friends, family and neighbors who were ready to film. I can't figure out for my life why this mockery of the product is listed in any serious movie magazine or website - I have a wedding party home video that's better and more interesting. Time, money and energy. Continuing ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is just the same garbage.
