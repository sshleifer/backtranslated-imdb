I admired Rob Marshall in Chicago, but Geisha's memories turn out to be another failure in fighting Western and Asian art. In general, the scene is beautiful, but after a restless emphasis on exotic-oriented scenes, some may simply find that they are exhausted. Excess cherry blossom was, frankly, superfluous. This is probably the perception of cultural difference here: the ultimate beauty is not an obvious type, because a truly beautiful geisha would not be a western pumpkin. Some other comments have rightly mentioned the biggest mistakes. Like Taiwan, I have no doubt that the actor is great. An actor / actor can play any role if he looks like it. Gong Li is great, but the power of the emotions shown in this film was not translated into Japanese. All I saw was a bitter and jealous Chinese WOMAN. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favorite actors, didn't even see Japan. Some of the comments have mentioned the special, delicate, feminine qualities of Japanese women that I can no longer accept. They are so gentle that I assume that not all modern Japanese actors can play the role of Geisha, not to mention two Chinese and one Malaysian actor who grew up in different cultures and probably didn't know Japanese culture so much. <br /> Geisha is a good story to arouse the curiosity of American audiences. But for the film itself and for art, it would be offensive if the film wins the Oscar for the best costume, best director or best picture.
