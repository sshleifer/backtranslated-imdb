When you see this movie, you hold on to the movie, director, producer, actors and person who told you to see it! Shame on you, Sarah Michelle Geller, for her name and face for the apology of this poor movie. It may have been more frightening if Japanese actors had just spoken Japanese instead of trying to "act" in English. I wanted the movie to end ... with real disappointment when television and movie elevators have promoted this flat money maker. Sarah Michelle didn't have to do this movie at all ... she practiced her frowning skills. Don't waste your time or money on this movie.
