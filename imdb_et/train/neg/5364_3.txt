The complaints are right, the biggest problem for me is that this soap opera is too targeted at women. I am well with those night soaps, such as Gray Anatomy or Ugly Betty, or West Wing, because there are stories that are interesting even when they never stop. However, if the idea is equal to day-to-day soaps designed to simply put hunky men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly, and Chris Lowell) into sexual tension and rhythms, and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called small hospital, it seems like a general hospital ... or Baywatch's female partner. It was what the men wanted and had, so if that is what the women want to do, the idea that it is a big eyebrow show (or something that men look at) is unrealistic.
