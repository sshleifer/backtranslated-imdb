It's a movie that wants to be good, but sucks. The first thing the hell are they trying at school? I don't think children understand the difficulty. The Deker boy tells the girl that they are responsible to him when he asks why he wants to go back to them, but right after that he gives a gun to the wheel chair and wants him to fix the phone line alone. Where's the responsibility there? I understand that poor participants have to pay for their food, but why not just give them the money they need to make a stupid movie or that money for charity. Oh yes, and none of them know how to do it. The stupid punk-boy cries out in the cafe somewhere like crazy. They all want a professional look, but they all suck. One more thing I do not think is that there is no emergency exit in the school, the kids are trying several doors, but they are all locked. What happens when there is a fire and the Dumas security guard is dead? It is illegal for the school to have no emergency exit. Anyway, there is much more to say, but it would be too long. I spent some time looking at my life's mess.
