Much of "over his dead body" is so painfully strange that I was actually embarrassed in my seat. <br /> <br /> Eva Longoria proves she can't wear this terrible romantic movie. comedy and even more so that he doesn't even have comic timing. He is furious and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a mature psychologist acquainted with his widow-groom. The team is played by Paul Rudd, drippy and charming, while the Bell Bell plays psychic, bringing the film from any anemic energy. I was most sorry for Bell because he seems to have a comic ability and worked overtime to do material work. Unfortunately, he is inconsistent with the insurmountable task of making any film that is acceptable to Jason Biggs, and he is dragged with the rest as at the end of Leo DiCaprio's Titanic. <br /> <br /> "Over his dead body" brought me out due to lack of laziness and total effort. I began to think of all the interesting projects that cannot be funded, because the big sums of money are so blissful. Does Hollywood think that such films are good enough? How stupid do they really think the film is public? Rating: F
