This is the least scary film I've ever seen. The biggest mystery of the film is how someone can eat the bubble. The stain moves so slowly that o.a.p zimmerframes can escape it. The blemish has a great deal of happiness that comes up to a typical horror film woman who, instead of escaping, stands half an hour to eat. If you don't see this movie, I suggest you do it too funny to take it seriously.
