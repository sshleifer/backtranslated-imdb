Recording is taking place. Susannah Yorke is a bright young Jane Eyre and her performance is impeccable. But Edward Rochester should be 35. White hair George C. Scott looks and behaves like arthritis 80. Jane's dead uncle is in better shape! He strikes and punishes, unpleasant and gloomy. He looks like an ax-murderer who has sent his ax sharpened; we are not surprised that he keeps his wife in the attic! A great love story looks like a sado-masochistic nightmare. There is enough darkness in the novel, but Bronte's Rochester is relatively young, sporty, powerful and charming when he decides to be. He has a good voice and a singing voice, a joy and a conscience he can break.
