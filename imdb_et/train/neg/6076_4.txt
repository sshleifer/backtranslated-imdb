FANis Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard. Or is it Travis Bickle? or Rupert Pupkin? Or Max Cady? With this role you will see the problem that De Niro has played very similar characters to the king of TAXI DRIVER, COMEDY and CAPE FEAR and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scripts. I found it a little hard to believe that Renard would have become a frustrated obsessive sports fan to become a psychological challenge <br /> <br /> Character is not the only problem with this script - it also lacks focus (a problem I had with UNTOUCHABLES where De Niro would had to be great, but ended up a bit flat), at several stages of the movie I thought Bobby Rayburn was the main character, then the story goes back to Renard. It also seems to be disappointed by a lot of sports friends who think it should have focused more on baseball. I'm not sure if it had to go to baseball fans first, but again there are elements that suggest that if producers had put their thoughts together, who and what story should focus on. that FAN entertainment (especially through the soundtrack), but it is a very bad film and it should be remembered that by the mid-1990s, the nutters characters, like a single white woman who was not a secure entry, etc. steam for a long time
