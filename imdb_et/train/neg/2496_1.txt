I would read this movie under the horror genre. I did this because I am not aware of the genre called scary. Since the horror of the genre is terrible, I have decided to put it in this category. Action was amateurish. You know who's the bad guy on the first scene. The heroine is as ugly as the movie. The film-making students should show this film to not learn in the film. It's so bad. Man's word bad is an understatement. Cabiners hijack the ocean liner and want $ 10 million. They want the money to be delivered to the inhabited island of Rome in the middle of the Pacific. After receiving the money, they sit on the ducks. There is no holiday plan. How stupid. Female Cruise Director is a former policeman, a naval seal, kung fu, whom I fear. The fun part is how to defomb the time bomb. He says he knows what he's doing and he pulls all the wires one by one. He then puts all the connected connections in his pocket and film. Is he crazy? Like mad, who was watching this RIDICULOUS. If you have M-I you don't like. To disturb her, rent this movie and pretend you enjoy it. I assure you that she will definitely tell her husband that you have such a bad taste and that her son / daughter is married to a person below the standard of his family.
