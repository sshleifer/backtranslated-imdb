The Cobweb is an example of many examples of films that have strong, sometimes remarkable performances and high scores but, unfortunately, will break down and drastically slow down the plot and very little audience. He marks Richard Widmark as a physician who works for a mental institution whose life becomes unstable due to family problems and a rather ridiculous and superfluous conflict, which at all seems not at all great. . The institution has time to get new windows to the library windows. An old woman wants her drapes to be placed on them, but many patients want to do their own. And somehow, this ridiculous and involuntarily lunar conflict breaks down in a place where life is in danger and families are beginning to break down. It sounds more like a conflict between very young children. <br /> <br /> Ploting the plot's logic and whether it could really happen is so massive that it nurses whether only a real similar madman could buy. Don't do me wrong, there's nothing wrong with the actors. The next Widmark is made up of other major actors, many of whom are nominees and winners of the Academy Award. And sometimes the movie is a nice moment that works great, but it always leaves a silly graph on the window curtain. Unfortunately, the dog's curtain is too much and so the film slows down. Many keys are long and made from a single camera perspective, following a slow pace and lack of viewing interests. <br /> <br /> In a short analysis, The Cobweb is an unfamiliar film, and it becomes clear why viewers are basically as soon as the plot's focus is what it does rather quickly. It just doesn't sound like a fun look and I'll tell you it's not nice to watch.
