As a tooth finisher, I was scared of the time I should take the courage to watch this movie, followed by Holiday on the Buses. I saw the movie "One Buses" and thought it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. It was filled with all the terrible comedies that plagued the British TV screens in the early 70s. <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to say that parts of this movie were actually laughing. I don't know if it was because I knew those characters and enjoyed some situations knowing how they responded. I found that Blakey is especially funny, although I can swear at some point in the trilogy whether he says his vocabulary: "I'll give you Butler". Wear thin and these three films can be compared to the early Hammer trilogy, Dick Barton, that the second film is the best (although this is probably the only way to compare them). <br /> <br /> Only those who want to watch this movie are probably fans of the TV series who will undoubtedly enjoy it and Hammer graduates like me. I would say to the graduates that this movie is not so bad and I can definitely think of the worst Hammer comedies.
