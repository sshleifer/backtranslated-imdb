VILLA RIDES (1968) is a great disappointment! And while Sam Peckinpah was in handwriting with Robert Towne, it still appears as a randomly written film headed by the famous Buzz Kulik. First, the top settlement for Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa is wrong for this part! He's not charismatic enough to play a big Mexican revolution! One of his arrows has no fire, and Mr Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could have brought that role. Brynner just looks like a Russian aristocrat dressed like a Mexican bandit who is in the middle of the Mexican Revolution instead of Russia. The second ticketed Robert Mitchum is completely wasted in the picture! His role as a biplan flying ace, which captures the air of a home made bomb due to the revolution, is a poorly written little role that could have been played by any minor star. Mitch does not have a proper line in the film, and he recalls his second Mexican revolution, which is a much higher "Bandidot" (1956), which unfortunately no one seems interested in being released from the DVD. Apart from the lack of any style, "Villa Rides" also suffers badly from a female star! Grazia Buccella is an adult Mexican girl who gives Mitchum a joyful eye, but her casting is just strange. Someone, such as Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters, could have added a few badly needed dotted slick lines. <br /> <br /> There are a few good action pictures in the movie, but not a few good things to do with the movie and less than the perfect Panavision picture quality plus repeat Maurice Jarre theme game doesn't help. <br /> <br /> Like Paramount's habit, there are no extra options - not even a trailer! Yes, a disappointing movie and DVD presentation that might have been and should have been much better.
