If you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics, spend your $ 9 on a used textbook, not on that film. I'm a little worried that the money I spent is used to buy Kool-Aid in Guyana. <br /> <br /> I don't think directors really got a point, but they seem to be trying to do several things: 1) Science can explain everything we do, meaning our lives are deterministic; 2) Science cannot be used for everything we do, which means we have free will; 3) Science is like cool, brother; 4) We are God; 5) the world exists only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman is hard to follow and 7) put it in a tiny piece of paper and you can see some really horrible things.
