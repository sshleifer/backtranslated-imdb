Not because Caligula has turned the movie halfway off ... but then I was just 15 minutes when I was considering it. Unfortunately, I did it. Make sure you don't. <br /> <br /> It is not that scarecrow is shocking or gory or scary or scary or sexual. This is that it is not one of these things, but he wants to be so desperately so. Instead, it is boring, tricky, plain, predictable and unusually poorly executed (video clip, high school special effects, no attention to visual storytelling, barely audible dialogue ... not that it's worth listening to). <Br /> <br /> This film proves the argument that even direct-to-video distributors need to draw sand in some places.
