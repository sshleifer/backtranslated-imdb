I saw this movie in my premiere week in 1975. I was 13 years old and at that time I was enough and somewhat fun. Then I came to discover Doc Savage's world, the stories of the old pulp magazine through Bantam. I had no idea before any of the Doc areas belonged, but I quickly became one of the most enthusiastic Doc Savage fans you ever met. I read (and still do) all Bantam's books, started in the comic book (with Star Trek and Doctor Who and all kinds of dirty fatty events) and enjoyed the adventure I took with Doc and ORIGINAL Fab 5 perfectly. Savage's apocalyptic life got a bit of a Bible for me, and to date, I have very fond of the stage of my dock. So I have to admit that it is now years later that this movie really went off the boat. This is a movie that didn't know what he wanted to be when he grew up. The scenario was infantile and there was little similarity to the cellulose story. These 30-story stories were short, and when they looked at Lester Dent's (AKA Kenneth Robeson's) writing pattern, they broke into the drama of PERFECT 3 exhibitions that shouted to treat the screen. It would have been better for George Pal and Michael Anderson to have a better steering wheel. The junk elements lie between the target and the more serious moments are almost there, but then they remain short. However, it is interesting to see that they hired other actors of a string character (boys who had only played a few players and extras before the movie), who were all very promising. Of course, Paul Gleason has gone to the entertainment side where Bill Lucking is a multi-year entertainment. All others have unfortunately failed the card. I want to have a copy of this movie because it's my only film version of my hero, but I'm afraid I won't see that much because it's too painful. I'd say 0, but I'll give it to 2 out of 10 over a period of time (there was a nice touch at the end of Doc's autoresponder) and pouring 3rd sprays in the sun.
