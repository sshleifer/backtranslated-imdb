Blank Check is one of the worst films of the nineties. The plot is completely pointless; his record of loneliness is pathetic. Do you really believe that a 12-year-old who acts as a personal assistant to a millionaire would be able to do everything in this film, for example, to buy a mansion for just $ 300. Not to mention the price of commodity prices, only the lightest viewers believe. Please respect your intelligence and don't watch this terrible, horrible movie.
