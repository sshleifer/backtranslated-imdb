I loved this movie, I admit it. It must be the best (direct?) Video I've seen. Well ... I and my friend decided the sisters were letting us rent this movie. We knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected, plus more. When this red collar attacked the trees by Sasquatch, we literally looked at that part about three to four times, so amazing (of course, hysterically). And why? Why does the main character have to roll so much? As frankly, we know you're in danger of rolling so much does not help. But really, if this movie is in your local video store RENT IT. It is worth the money and it is not as bad as it is bad, but not incredibly bad. In general, this is amazing when you rent a movie.
