"Salaam-e-Ishq" is an endless three-hour and twenty-minute complex but superficial comic soap opera from India that revives us with six intertwined romantic love (which I think is at least four spoken). ). <br /> <br /> Film filmed between MTV music video and Super Bowl beer commercial, exotic settings, dazzling colors, sexy showgirls, high-profile songs and dances, mishmash numbers, dreams and fantasy stories, outstanding character, funny dialogue and cross-border comics - all pretty much standard questions when it comes to Bollywood events these days. It's a debilitating chore that tries to keep all the characters straight, because they dance, dance and go through an incomprehensible story. <br /> <br /> The viewer has many opportunities here to keep an eye on - at least not all of them fall as dead proud women - but he needs Job's patience to do all this.
