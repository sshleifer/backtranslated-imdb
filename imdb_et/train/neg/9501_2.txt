This is the page for "Exorcism House", but most people have mixed this movie with Mario Bava's masterpiece "Add and Devil", which explains its ridiculously high rating, "The House of Exorcism". When "Lisa & Devil" was shown at film festivals in the early 70s, it was a critical success. Audiences responded well to this gorgeous, Gothic horror movie. Unfortunately, it was a little bit older than time, and it was considered too unusual and not enough for massive consumption. No distributor will buy it. So Alfredo Leone decided to edit "Lisa", seemingly with a chainsaw, removing only half of the original movie and adding new scenes that he filmed two years after the original product! It is important to note that Baval had little to do with these new, terrible additions, so it is not technically a "exorcism house" Bava film. The original product is slow, dreamy and stylish production. Watching the movie for a few minutes, the viewer looks out of this dream world because maybe we see Lisa (two years older and with a very different hairstyle), starting to write on the ground, making guttural sounds and curved epitafe. "ime my co @ k" etc. Fine, huh? And the film continues like this, jumping back and forth between the beautiful, visual film and the grade Z "exorcist" rip-off. Leone tried to include these shocking scenes while keeping a somewhat similar story. He failed. When it was decided to destroy "Lisa and the devil" in principle, Bava himself refused to say that his film was too beautiful to cut. He was right, and this artist had to be quite sad to see that his entire work was destroyed and the toilet was pressed down. Many years before we saw the original "Add and Devil" again, the floor was re-floored on television late in the evening. I had seen "add" long before this new version, and it was a completely annoying witness that one of my favorite films "vandalized" this way. It's worth seeing only for curiosity. Otherwise, avoid this cunning disaster like plague.
