Remarque's novel. Cast that looks good on paper. Left refugee fighting between wars in Paris. Gestapo officer secretly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no synergy here. Bits and pieces never stop. <br /> <br /> Talking about left-wing refugees in France doesn't have to be boring. Learn about Arthur Koestler's memory of "Earth's Rash" (if possible). Or his chilling "Dialogue with Death" (ditto). <br /> <br /> For me, the only interest in this movie is the details that come with it. <br /> <br /> Links spend a lot of time drinking calvados, Norman's apple park. I welcome all calls to have my own calvados. It certainly made this movie faster. But according to the film, it is sold only in low-cost, low-class salons. Vive le tabac for couples! That's what I say. Here are references to intoxicating fluids; this seems to be the concern of the scriptwriters. I was not disappointed. This time it was a very unusual choice for Byrri. This film would appreciate 10 if we only decided to improve our lawn meadows. <br /> <br /> The film's indifferent result is Louis Gruenberg. Gruenberg is the best known - if you can name it - for his opera "Emperor Jones" based on O'Neill's game. This premiere about the same time as Paul Robeson starring. The opera nowadays lives in Lawrence Tibbett's recording or in two. Soon, however, it should remain on the surface again; they live in potentially marketable operas to revive. Two of them are "Wozzeck" and "Gunther", both with outstanding roles in German opera. Is it just a coincidence? <br /> <br /> The name-falling seems to be part of this movie. Note that they call Himmelstoss. Himmelstoss is one of Remarque's earlier "All Quiet's Western Front" characters. <br /> <br /> Jokes are all in place; I think there was no time for drama development.
