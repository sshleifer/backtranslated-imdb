I'm sorry, but I didn't really like this document. I can think of a million options that could have been better. People who did this probably don't have much imagination. Interviews are not very interesting and there is no real understanding. Also, video materials are not compiled in a very informative way. It is too bad because it is a film that really deserves special qualities. One thing I say is that Isabella Rosselin becomes more beautiful the older she gets. Everything is counted, it only gets "4".
