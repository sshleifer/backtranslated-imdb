Published in 1965, but clearly shot years ago, it is a little criminal melodrama with some intuitive sex mediation. As with conventional flooring cuts, for some reason, there is no widespread dress and clothing, complemented by weak music, tedious narration and uncomfortable editing. The coffee boss provides torture bases, because we organize the characters back and forth to avoid their real vision. All we get is the reaction images to the external character of the screen! The 50s-Misty Ayers strikes a couple of times in their French-cut panties before they start. She is constantly involved with what is probably the romantic West of the music of the song, up to the mother-su-dishes that are randomly mixed to produce, among other things, the most exciting cigarette lights ever captured on film. See how he touches it! See if he hits the game! Does he breathe in or does he catch up with Apache? Shows Only Time !! The film tells us how Sally strikes the whore, goes down the sling and can't escape. For some reason, some of the most boring and boring scams that are ever devoted to the film are being treated, literally making their nails or knitting, rather than attracting customers. Some amazingly flat comedy (boozy dame randomly drinking milk! Har dee har!) And silent movie acting doesn't help. This is one of the worst feature films I've ever seen, even a strange video video. It's really more of a movie curiosity for those interested in cinema history - a very bad cinema.
