Hmm, IMDb rating 7.5, good comments, bla, bla ... okay, two of my friends and me, we order pizza, we sat down and wanted to see something as cool as Ichi or at least something useless but funny with Versus. But Naked Blood was admiring. It's a complete waste. Okay, the scene where the woman who loves to eat is quite prominent. But that's it. Something more, not less. I don't want to plot the plot, other people already did, but I wanted to stop the hype. But look at it and rate it yourself. Maybe we can push the rating where it should be. Another thing I think is: Sound is even worse than Carpenter ever - okay, John's cool ... :) 2/10
