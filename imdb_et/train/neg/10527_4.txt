I discovered this movie with an OOP retailer. And that's definitely OOP. One year after the exorcist had been in business with this film, but what we all did was that Blair's career never ends, he never became a mega star. This is one of the reasons why many of his films are OOP. He gives a good result in this film. This is about rejection, which his parents do not recognize and who have no friends. Played at the age of 15, playing a 14-year-old girl, it's funny. The film is also known for the rape scene in showers when they left their innocence. In most of the publications, it is cut out, why, I don't know, there is no blood involved, okay, Blair is the butt naked, but nothing is shown, there is no R&D so that people do not offend anything. But the film is slow, very slow. I don't usually like it, but I almost felt asleep. It's almost that the 14-year-old becomes a rebel in society, but no blood flow. Why it's classified as a horror, however, is a miracle for me. If you're a fan of Blair, buy it if you find that it will otherwise leave it as it is.
