OK, when I saw the previews of this movie, I thought it seemed really scary and was quite excited when I saw it as that group was. Now, in America, especially at the time of choosing, I see some very misleading things, but I have to say that these previews were top of the list. I don't see how many people scare this movie. I only noticed two real jumps and only jumped to one. The whole movie was extremely predictable and maybe it confused some jump lines for me. As for sound effects, I thought they were the best comic. Oh and uhh catboy where did it come from and why? The worst noise in the entire movie was supposed to be a strange sink. How does it frighten anyone? I can just do this noise. Now, don't get me wrong, I've always loved all those really frightening movies that you just laughed all over, but I didn't even think it was that it was just bad.
