I thought the whole movie joke would be seen by some rich white guy acting like Chris Rock, and then see Chris Rock react to people's reactions. Instead, you see Chris Rock himself and the people who don't understand him. There may be 2 scenes in the whole movie where they use their tricks. It should have been much better.
