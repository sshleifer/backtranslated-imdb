The IMDb guidelines state that you must declare whether there are "spoilers" in your comments. well, this whole movie is something about a spoiler ... a deterrent story that boasts what it warns, a story about missing youngsters who doesn't know where it goes. > <br /> I just saw it at tribeca film festival. this movie wasn't just bad, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> The actor is inconsistent, the characters are mostly clich√© offers with low depth, and farnsworth's acting was particularly bad. <br /> <br /> From patronizing accents to the pointless plot line to the "graphic" elements of repetitive dialogue and scenarios ... it sucked a lot. I think he was looking for a sharper, renewed pharmacy cowboy with some "natural births", but that's not how sensitive the characters are and not where the shocking (outside of some frat-level gore) ladder. <br /> <br /> More than anything, no one really had to A) change the scenario <br /> <br /> (there are some things that can be built and clearly <br /> <br /> deal with a worthy subject. .. if it's under the test.) B) Change the movie. if it is cut to the core, it may be satisfactory. <br /> <br /> I'd go down 1 if I could ... like maybe a zero kelvin.
