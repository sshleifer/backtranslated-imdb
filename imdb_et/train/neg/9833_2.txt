Incorrectly accused, John Johnne (John Scott) and Eddy Chandler (like Kansas Charlie) change identities to get "Alias ​​Smith and Jones". Mr. Wayne gets "John Jones". Mr Chandler should be "Rev. Smith", but Wayne calls him "Dr. Smith". In no time will either be as fun as Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris or Ben Murphy; Although Wayne can be considered endlessly successful than any of them, the career is smart. Pretty blonde Mary Kornman (Anne), an adult of her day "Our Gang", is a great interest in Wayne. He and Chandler have a couple of cute scenes with Wayne. If you are not a fan of John Wayne's low budget of the 1930s, this movie won't do you.
