In my book "Basic Instinct" there was a perfect film. It was remarkable for Stone, Douglas, and all the supporters. It had a wonderful photography, music, and noir script. All this adds a movie that is as good as ever! <br /> <br /> This sequel is exactly the opposite, it is unlikely to worsen, bad behavior and a flat script that is combined in a totally failed direction, it's really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that somehow keeps you concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene, which is the exact redesigned copy of the original. These copies are so bad that they laugh and I smiled, even though it was like watching a glossy demolition. The only thing this terrible mess is good about is the excerpts from Jerry Goldsmith's BI1 score. Michael Caton-Jones and the half-wit in charge of the script also contained a "No room for smoking in this room" dialog in the interrogation scene, and yes he sends his lawyer (who is now a lawyer)! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I've seen this terrible movie that I should never have done! It damages the original, so bad. The only redemption value is the realization that cosmetic surgery (and I'm sure Mrs Stone got the best surgeon to buy money) can do a good job, but obviously cannot restore the perfection of the original. And with regard to the human body, it also applies to making films. Should Have a Law: Never Make a Perfect Movie Sequence!
