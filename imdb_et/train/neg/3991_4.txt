I'm not sure why Spike Lee made this train trip from the movie and united the poor Stevie Wonder for eternal bonding with his beautiful music in the confusion of this theater. I also am concerned about how he uses profanity as part of a normal black prose of professional black. The abuse of his property by visitors to an ethnic film is a shame. Scenes that stand out from the blue and have nothing to do with the subject or sub-topics are played as if any college child wrote it. I particularly detest a ridiculous scene where two interfaces playfully sparring at all without reason, and the police come and sneak out. The overload of drivers makes it feel that Spike doesn't respect his viewers or has no idea what the film is. The final scene seems to have been thrown to justify the use of the sledge area to grab a point. This film also supports the myth that all cultures use the F word in random conversation. I hope he understands that the rest of his films are in the same pool as he has not grown as a filmmaker. I think his connection with Scorcesee at Clockers was a wise move. She should stick to documentaries like four little colored girls. Shock movies don't make Oscar.
