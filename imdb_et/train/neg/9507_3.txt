I am always disappointed with films that are obviously written by one sex. Especially if they obviously do not do enough research to find out if something is not only true, but rings foolishly wrong. <br /> <br /> The scene I remember is a bathroom where Jack tells his football teams he's got Diane pregnant. In no way does the shape or shape of a single guy make a girl to a girl. They may be delighted by the boy having sex with a hot cheerleader, but I can also make sure that the first football team has not heard of it on the urinal. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that this movie wasn't so serious and it wasn't terribly bad, but come on!
