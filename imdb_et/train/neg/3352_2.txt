I don't even know where to start it. "It's all about the family." It must have heard the worst line of dialogue in the horror movie, even though it couldn't be a fear film, even if it was trying !!! Ugh !!! And I know Owen Wilson is a better actor. He must finish a feature film that dies in every film (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, he wrote "a bottle of rocket" and "Rushmore". He has talent. Also, Lily Taylor would stick to indie movies. He doesn't have a place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a porn star. There is no room for maneuver for him. I'm serious. One of the worst films I've ever seen is EVER.
