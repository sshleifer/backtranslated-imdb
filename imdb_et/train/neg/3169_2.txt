This film is one year worse. The main characters have no chemistry and the action is terrible. Paul Rudd is the only one with talent and the only one who is not annoying. I've never watched Desparte's housewives, so I don't know how Eva Longoria is in this show, but she was terrible in this movie. It's like he doesn't know anything about action. His whole character is whim of the whole movie and he can't take off b **** and still have fun. And another girl, Bell Bell, shows little emotion and it's like you look at the smart cards when she reads them. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's a cookie cutter. It goes from A to B with little surprise. So much could have been used by Kate as a ghost. The plot should be around him and the things he does in the spirit. <br /> <br /> END OF VERDIKT: It's not worth it.
