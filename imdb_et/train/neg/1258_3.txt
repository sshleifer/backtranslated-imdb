Warning: Spoilers Are Successful! <br /> <br /> Tim Burton, who plays this sui generis movie, is just as reasonable as Psycho Restoration - oh, that's right, some idiots already did - I rest in my case. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a simulated glowing chimp, which shows that it is not so smart from the start. Marky Mark appears on the stroke without his characteristic panties, then the normal woman who prefers to touch the chimpanzees is rejected. <br /> <br /> A spatial facility from a space station that comes up around Saturn without any apparent reason to be tempted by genetic testing of non-human primates. Should we experiment with 1300 million kilometers to Saturn? The Special Effects Team decides this. Marky demonstrates the peace of mind of a space station when he steals the shop without being noticed, while showing his foolish stupidity when he installed a deep space in a rescue mission to a wormhole with an expensive test impulse. limited fuel and oxygen consumption. <br /> <br /> Before anyone can say that "meaningless remake" Marky has surfed in a wormhole that fell on a strange planet, he removed his helmet without thinking about the death of the atmosphere and is shouting through a ring that almost resembles lush rainforests, if it were not backlight with plastic trees. <br /> <br /> Surprise! This is APES who is chasing - or at least * would have been a surprise if no one saw the thirty-three year period of the awards planet. <br /> <br /> As Marky Mark couldn't show his pants, take his pants off or hit his flat whiteboy rap, he was characteristic. Michael Clarke Duncan's gorilla's teeth, which have been convexly shaped, contributed enormously to * his lack of character. Helena Bonham-Carter (aka irritating chimp) lost without Mark Shakespeare's script to both Marky and Clarke's outstanding work. Paul Giamatti, a slave trader of Orangutan, secured the role of a cluster of weapons and species with a symbolic comic. Although I have grown to hear the celebrities of this film, one of the titles of the review has taken it to "portray" the nature of the monkey planet: "Roth's monkeys". While everyone else started to look like the years BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth, like the chimpanzee, Thade, looks enormous landscapes and throws the cock splendiferously. Because his psychotic Thade portrayal was entertaining, he had no characteristic behavior: Thade is crazy when we meet him for the first time ... and at the end of the movie he is quite crazy. Beautiful turn. <br /> <br /> Initial POTA (1968) was a leading character, Charlton Heston Taylor, who was so embarrassed for humanity that he left space without regret - although this film rose, Taylor involuntarily found himself locked in battle to prove the value of humanity - their only winner! The original film was ultimately a story of humiliation, not salvation: when Taylor discovers the Degree of Liberty, he is forced to realize that his species had not been ruled. Is there something such a brain or irony about Marky Mark's leo? Or Roth's Thade? No, but there's plenty of running. <br /> <br /> The slogans are crying: Take back the planet. In this film, people and monkeys hit people here, people were getting worse, allowing monkeys to get speech and sensual body warning; monkeys to be inherited! Alongside Marky Mark is truly anthropocentric arrogance, it goes without saying that people have to be predators, just because they are there. "Repossession" is just as ridiculous as monkeys land here in 2001, complaining, "A planet where men develop from APES?" Heston was cast in the 1968 POTA because he had inherited his reputation: he was Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses! In order to throw her away in silence, displaced as a stranger in foreign societies, it was an astonishment of the audience's expectations: how crazy is the world in which our man Charlton cannot respect? Marky Mark has just confirmed that he has narrow panties. <br /> <br /> Although Heston had to be constantly abused by the Apee Council, he dominated the screen with his charisma and amazing overflow. When Marky Mark tries to attract Mongoloids to people, this school is an unpopular guy who has suddenly made a classroom monitor who tells you to stop pulling the penis on the board and throw it in the shoe. Burton tries to raise Marky's humanity icon, but he comes out like a chittering deviant. In the original film, the monkeys see Taylor aside, but he was both an audience and a monkey, an icon of humanity. This irony was again. <br /> <br /> It was a good thing that the person who raised the scene with chewing technique - Heston - should play the primo-scene-chew of this movie, father of Thaddeus Roth. Like Roth's father-father, Charlton tells his immortal lines, this time he turned to HUMANS. Fuck them all in hell! "<br /> <br /> The movie becomes stupid and ends. When Thaddeus gives Marky a lesson with the assembly, the pod will fall high if Marky is his champion. Apes show their hebrews, worshiping this unknown creature, while Marky proves his hebrews, distorting: "We teach them about the evolution of the monkey." First, they're not monkeys, you monkey! Secondly, it was a genetic manipulation and a leisurely plot preparation that brought the monkeys to this point, not evolution. And what you are going to throw away with the hidden lasergun is called misanthropy, not evolution. <br /> <br /> Ending the turn would only disturb viewers to believe that the semi-negligible role of Estella Warren was in fact an integral part of the plot (always be in my pants.). <br /> <br /> Whatever it was, humanity was the last foundation for hope; Finally, the police take monkeys with Marky in jail, where he last heard an ulcer: "It's a madman! MADHOUSE !! ... '
