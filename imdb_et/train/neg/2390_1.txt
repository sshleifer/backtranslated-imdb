I love all of Tom Robbins' books, so I was very excited and interested to see a movie made after one of his books. I knew there would be no chance that the film would remain half the magic of Robbins, but after seeing the film, I never wanted to read the book again. Cowgirls Get the Blues does not contain the eighth content of the book, and it seems to focus more on the connection of love between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Along with the incredibly weak plot line of the film, I guess I could have chosen better actors when playing characters. The only actors in the movie I thought they were playing their roles that fit in with Robbins' descriptions in the book were Juliet's friends, their five-minute clip at the beginning of the movie. Those who haven't read the book could enjoy the movie, but as a huge Tom Robbins fan, this movie was just a disappointment.
