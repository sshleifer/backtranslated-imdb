Woody Allen did "September", which proved that even the genius could be screwed. That's Mel Brook's "September". Monumentally silly, boring and ununny, I have to admit that I didn't see it to the end. Flick is one of the few failed (eg "The Money Pit", "Out to Sea", "Spitfire Grill") that made me sleep or forced me to reach the "rewind" button. And, unfortunately, I say it like a dedicated Mel Brooks fan. He should stay on straight comedy and leave social commentary alone. How the same man who made "Young Frankenstein" and "Spaceballs" could pull such a dog out of me. Must be avoided at all costs.
