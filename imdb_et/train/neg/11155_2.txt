The only reason I even looked at it was because I found it in my local library (and I blame them for wasting public funds) and, despite the abundance of tits and ass, did not realize for a long time that Quick and Back Button was my friend . The terrible direction, the work of the pedestrian camera, the occasionally badly slipping action, the brilliant effect and one of the worst scenarios I have had in dissatisfaction with seeing life (as it was terribly spoiled and corrupted). long, long time. The best laughs come from the featurette featuring "featured ...", where poor slippers associated with this HDV confusion are trying to justify their flat efforts as if they were working something special, not something that is not completely forgotten next week. Wait! Except for the fact that somebody attracted Tippi to "All People" Hedren, doing a little bit, with Kane "Friday 13". Hodder! How it happened, I never know, and honestly I don't really care. Look at your own risk and don't say you're not warned. This is filmmaking in its pretentious and cunning worst. It only gets 2 if I have good looking naked women and even hardly.
