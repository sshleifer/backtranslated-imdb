I'm a black man living in a predominantly black city. That said, I have some great doubts about Tyler Perry's work. I realize that some people feel they should be praised because he is black and tries to portray a positive image of culture. But honestly, if it were Perry White, this film would have had NAACP, Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson all over the ass. <br /> <br /> I've been forced to watch this movie for one whole hell. a lot recently and every repeated viewing makes my blood boil. Characters are poorly written and acted. The jokes are so bad, I really have to say something should be funny. I just break this big pile sh-t. <br /> <br /> Madea = Suck. There may be attention, but it is no longer. If the only thing he ever seems to have done is to beat children and threaten adults with violence, he is less than useless. He's unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The situation at the time of beating the husband was horsesh. If a woman died when she died, why would she fall asleep in bed. Wouldn't it make sense for him to leave at work. In any case, the characters in this arc were so annoying and surprising that I hoped he would throw him out of the balcony and be marked royally if he didn't. <br /> <br /> Then there are two love. The bus driver asks the woman to harass her when she does her round. I couldn't believe it. I really couldn't believe if he agreed to go further with him. But the thing that takes the cake is that the adult man was reduced to windows and spent notes like a ten-year-old castrating mega bitch. I do not use this concept lightly, but this woman had only two modes. Morose victim and psycho momma. Whatever these two faces, there was one constant. The bus driver didn't get anything. She married her even without trying the goods - WTF! <br /> <br /> Then the family reunion. Here's a mother's load, which includes indirect taboos, grinding, grinding, odd, over-muscled, b-ball and Maya Angelou's great taste. When these babes pulled out their pants and called for a meeting, I was wrong that a heart attack claims the parents were. All this mess takes place during the reunion, in ridiculously easily separable groups, and then they ring. If they do, everyone will do what they do and will lead too far to speak alone, like the Pavlov dogs package - WTF !! <br /> <br /> Then the film has the last five minutes. In this we see that the abusive groom runs his long-time victim and the whole bad actor. There is an impromptu wedding where black people are dressed like angels and hanging from the ceiling - WTF !!! The only reason to look so far after testing the threshold for pain is the hope that the other villain of this story will get him in his ass. Guess, it won't happen. Instead, Perry takes the testicular way out and plays it safely, ending with a movie of forgiveness - WTF !! <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure if I give a day, I would probably write a doctoral thesis on all the ways this film sucks. Don't let me start with Tyler Perry's other movies. I'll just say that. I think black man, D.W. Griffith's heritage lives. The irony is that it is done by a black man who is praised for doing what was born of nationality by selling us by the river. I just want Perry's movies to be a guy so I can beat them in nuts. Thank you, dude! What do you intend to follow in 2009, a comedy about slavery slavery and wild beating in colonial America?
