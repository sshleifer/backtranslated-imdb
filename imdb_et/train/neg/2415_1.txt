... you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, DO NOT INVITE THIS MOVIE. If you want to watch a documentary about "the life of a hood," you are also in the wrong place. If you are looking for a ridiculous movie, this is the real winner! Action is the same as paper. The best example of this is definitely the officer who examines the car. I can say that he made the voice of 911 operators with his voice in a certain tone. If I could hear the cardboard box, it would seem like this guy. Oh yes, and the "zombies" made their best snake impression, parallel to their FANTASTIC, acting in general (note the sarcasm ... HOW DOES NOT HAVE THE BEST FOR SALE OF THE OSAR) Quiroz ...... doesn't do any management. I felt like I was looking at a piece of improvisational period (the period is more like LA in the 1990s). However, the direction is one of the worst scripts I think I will ever love. I haven't heard such cute features as the epic one that started with "F ** k!" As the Ice Grill, which was the second "city" thriller. It only works with the epic hip-hop soundtrack! All 3 songs from it! All in all, what the hell have you been waiting for in the movie "The Dead Hoods of the Living"? I rented this movie with the full intention of laughing at each of his scenes and the boy he gave and MORE! I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a bunch of invitation and laugh at a low budget horror (yes right ...) movie. Definitely a memorable experience!
