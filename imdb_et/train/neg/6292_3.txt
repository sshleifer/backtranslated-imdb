I don't know how much this movie actually is in the 1984 movie "Bachelor Party", starring Tom Hanks. Is this film an official sequel? This movie is missing in all departments and you're probably better off watching it. <br /> <br /> For comedy, this movie is not good enough or funny. It is mostly based on the stereotypical assessments of the characters, but the film actually has some good, original and funny moments. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is very little story and movie naked in the chest as script pages. You expect things to end. There's a striking line somewhere in it, but it's so terribly unigraphic and so badly executed in the movie that it seems to be nothing. I think there is even a message and a moral story somewhere, but it is again so terribly unnatural and badly made in the movie that it just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> This is basically a typical teen comedy with lots of sex jokes and nudity, only without teenagers, which makes the story even more sad and tasty. There are some really wrong jokes in the movie that are suitable for any type of film. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to ever see it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
