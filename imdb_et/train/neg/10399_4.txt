One of the main flaws of this film is that while mockery of pretentious jokes is not satisfactory, it does not understand that filmmakers are guilty of one of those who deserve mockery. One of the hallmarks of these yuppie types is the conceivable misunderstanding that they (yuppies) are the only ones who are experienced enough to understand art. While the film ignores this feature and focuses instead on its misunderstandings in meal management, I find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie will appreciate the same imaginative taste in movies as the characters at dinner. If the amazing characters on this film have a video library at home, I would like American Psycho to be one of those films.
