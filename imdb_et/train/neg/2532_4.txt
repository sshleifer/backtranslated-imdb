The cult of personality has raised the status of Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman, etc. as kings of B. Because Crown International's people were so key, they're not elevated to the situation they deserve. Such a film like VAN might now seem like a disposable Drive-in esoteric, but it was a big blow when it appeared (not to talk about later new releases with other Crown hits). <br /> <br /> VAN was the perfect example of Crown's strategy of capturing the mood of filmmakers during the release of the movie. Here was the sex, the drugs, the rock 'n role and the short' Custom Van 'fad. As others have pointed out, it is ironic that the song "hit" refers to Chevy when the title is Dodge. I had a city in Selectman, where at that time I even told them that these vans were "wheel dead". The perfect promotional line for the movie! <br /> <br /> There's an ordinary assortment of "good" and "bad" girls, muscle heads and low eyebrows (including Danny DeVito support). In many ways, it's no different for the 60's old Beach Party movies, but now it's Spicy Nudity and Drug. Obviously done with a limited budget and a limited schedule, the film tends to flatter and with a strange charm that will certainly compensate some of today's standards for women's PC views. <br /> <br /> The classic touch is the toaster Bobby's fault on the wheels. Yes, toaster! Hey, you have to have something like munchika hot! <br /> <br /> Grindhouse Fest.
