This documentary is a reenactment of the Betty Page (Paige Richards) career in recent years. Tennessee tease was the most famous pin-up queen in history. His most memorable work came in the 1950s and was a fetish photo, a serf and a girly flicks. Irving Klaw (Dukey Flyswatter) in his news star news, Betty knew what to do in front of the camera. There were no nudity in famous photographs or "films", but Klaw was convicted of distributing inconvenient materials and was ordered to destroy them to avoid prosecution. Not surprisingly, Betty had a cult at the height of his career. The girl's door with black hair, blue eyes and a glass-covered hour with fetish gear has mesmerized for decades. After all, it has been said that she was photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and second in the world's most photographed picture, Elvis Presley. Betty Page disappears and devotes her last years to religion. This film could have been much better; but good enough to keep interest. <br /> <br /> Miss Richards is a stunning self. Bra, panties, garter belt and hose do not damage her image the least. Also in production: Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone. We recommend changing this movie to your heart rate.
