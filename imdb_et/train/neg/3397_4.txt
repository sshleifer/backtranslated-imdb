The trailer of this movie was enough for me to justify renting a DVD. However, the film is terribly terrible! Indeed, this is not the worst movie or the worst film this year, but it came close to fucking! <br /> <br /> The main question is a movie that doesn't know what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen porn? The story is interesting because it deals with the pitfalls of the mail order bride, but the film is a mess. What starts with a slightly interesting "comedy" (the word I use in the most freest conditions), goes in the opposite direction and degenerates into a very dark and exhausting misogynist thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better and Ben Chaplin is wasted! Like Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, whom I can only expect for money. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie that is in almost every aspect. It's not funny, it's almost so sexist that you could almost give Benny Hill everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just totally disgusting. The movie to be avoided unless you have to watch Kidman or Chaplin in your movies!
