Completely evil movie! Nothing happens. There are no ghosts, hardly a train, no secret, no interest. Continuous and BRUTAL experiments in comedy are painful. Everything else is pathetic. The prerequisite is an idiotic: a number of people who are tempted in the middle because their train was kept for less than 3 minutes. What? And does the railway leave room for them to stay on a holy storm? I don't think so. Oh, they can walk the black miles along 4 miles. umm, yeah. Of course. Or they may force themselves to be railroad hospitality and stay at a "haunted" train station. A station that was nothing more than DEADLY BORING, completely without ghosts, interests or plot. <br /> <br /> So it's very terrible that it seems impossible. <br /> <br /> This should be added to LOST FILMS! aargh !!
