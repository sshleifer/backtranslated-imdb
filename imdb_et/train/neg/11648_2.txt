As if there was not enough floating there, then we have another LAM GODFATHER clone from the IL CONSIGLIORI director (1973), which I had followed this year. The value of the tents that were ripped at this time is called Telly Savala, who is late in processing and is seen first in the back, rather gently for her flowers and French-style beret. Apart from the fact that Sicily does not see minimal, he has no other emphasis than pulling his acquaintance. Antonio Sabato then becomes an unlikely gangster, besides being a man of resistance; it is also not convincing his relationship with Savala, which is becoming a father when the eye is thrown away (especially because he later becomes romantic with his spiritual teenage brother)! Moreover, there is very little to talk about gangsters and none of them is memorable in any way (although the clinic's finale is well handled); in addition, Francesco De Mas's score is useful, but nothing else. By the way, the started basement DVD that I rented starts in the middle of credits, so none of the cast members - or even the movie title - ever listed!
