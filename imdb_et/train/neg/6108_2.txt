Tarzan Ape Man is a remake of a one-off 1932 film and, like this earlier film, is little like Burrough's literary character. But when Tarzan in 1932 spoke of "Tarzan-Jane," it doesn't speak or point to Tarzan, played by Miles O'Keeffe. He makes Tarzan's smash a few times, which seems to have been chosen with a previous film. <br /> <br /> No, Tarzan plays the second banana as Jane in Bo Derek. Or rather, the third banana for Bo Derek's left breast and his right breast. This film has no point in showing Derek naked. <br /> <br /> Two movie scenes are being played slowly and are really bad. More evidence that no one cared. <br /> <br /> Tarzan has a pretty orangutan kick in this movie. Maybe he will connect a car from Sumatra to Indian elephants that are also displayed.
