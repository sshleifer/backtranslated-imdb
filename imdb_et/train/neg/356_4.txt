The shape of the film is a temporary shock. There are surprises, turns, turns and excitement. Sometimes it's really a "movie" movie. But it disappears and seriously destroys. <br /> <br /> A piece of a villain is not believable; his character is not together. I refuse to "ruin" the film, but I just say that the character that just met at first could not be the one we see at the end. <br /> <br /> The other big disappointment of the movie is that - Finally, it becomes a little more than a bloody slip film. On this and one on "Friday the 13th" there is little qualitative difference between the film. Not that every movie must always be completely tasteful, but this film drips from time to time. <br /> <br /> Although the film has an excellent Sean Connery, it doesn't even measure its usual standard and often just looks out for a walk.
