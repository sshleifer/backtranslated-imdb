Exactly what to expect from a B movie. Derivative, free nudity, boring parts, ridiculous clean and cheesy special effects. Of course it could have been better, better worked (defintly) better written, targeted, etc. But then I think it wouldn't have been a B movie. The actors marched a lot, in fact it seemed like a lot of vampire cutter or something more than blood, embarrassment and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiffany Shepis must be brought out. She is the queen of a completely new millennium. Not that these movies really work, but it was better than any other participant. She is also warm in this plastic jump pattern she wore for the whole movie - wow! Her butt is completely stunning in this dress, I mean it every time she turns around, you can help but control her. At the end of the film, the viewer, without seeing him, is completely ignored. <br /> <br /> So if your looser b-movie horror buff (like me), look at it. If not, you should probably avoid it at all costs.
