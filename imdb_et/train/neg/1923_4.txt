Chronic that Dr. Seuss's Christmas, which underscores Christmas, should be one of the fastest, most marketed and most successful holiday seasons. The general content of Ron Howard's adaptation is that Grinch's Christmas Eve comes from an early childhood event, and that those who have themselves fallen into the materialism of the season, except Cindy Lou Who (played very well by Taylor Momsen). This film makes an exciting and ambitious attempt to capture the sense of Seuss' resentment and feelings, but the end result is a movie that never captures and emotionally strikes the animated version of Chuck Jones. Jim Carrey is remarkable when he is a fucking Grinch, but whether it is dialogue, tempo, or stranger stories on the original plot, transformation into a bitter harshly clever benefactor just doesn't come convincingly. There are some wonderful visions and make-up work is amazing, but there are one or two other elements alongside the technical triumphs. <br /> <br /> Succtness? <br /> <br /> Seoul? Or maybe Jones made his original 25-minute comic book adjustment too well that Howard can't make a movie that looks three hours long. Howard, Carey and the team are all very capable and talented, but what seems to be a fighting combination is only weak and its final product. If you need to see a full-length version, rent it with the Jones animated version of the video and see how big and brighter it is not always better. I'll give this film three cans that lead out of five.
