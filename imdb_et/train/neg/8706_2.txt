If this is your first cinematic admiration, if you have never seen a "moving picture" then you think this movie is a child of gods. But if you've seen a movie, TV shows, even a Barney dinosaur, this movie doesn't really affect you. Heck Barney, a dinosaur, was even more realistic about the flick dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Now I like B-movies. I just looked at "Giant Gila Monster" just before I watched this color, and I liked the film a lot better. It works as a B movie. This is a lamer dialogue, hokier acting, cheesier effect and honest that gosh real gila monster like monster! Carno 3 just doesn't offer much of a B-movie punch. It has some gore, and Polchek's boy is a few times funny, but this film is almost fluctuating. It's a small engine that couldn't make Dinosaur movies. I'm not saying you shouldn't watch the movie. Some people can walk on the sidewalk for rubber drying and feel entertainment. If you are one of these people, give this movie to the movie.
