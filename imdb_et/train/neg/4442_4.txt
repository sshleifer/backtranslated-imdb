I don't know ... maybe it's because I'm in Brazil, but all this was too much. Too much love for music, too much for parties, too much contrast between the nice life of the main characters (come, it's not so sad) and the aspect of the city that the director shows. Everything seems to me to be too fake: families, relationships, music, "happiness". It just sells a bit of a counterfeit latinameric taste. I have to be honest: he attracted me a little bit, but who wouldn't have attracted this cunning music, sex and party made fake lives? I'm not so stupid: what is the world where people do not suffer from diarrhea, deep sorrow and STDs? I liked the scene of Caridad's mother's phone call and discussion with all the musicians and Spanish people.
