my wife is a fan of this show. In this case, I bought one to three seasons and four seasons have an order. Personally, I think the show is one big farce. Alyssa Milano should have adhered to other garbage bins made by her, such as the adoption of Poison Ivy, Vampire, and some other female support cast members are equally intuitive in their imagination. I've seen better special effects in the old Republic's picture series I saw as a child. I understand why male leaders stayed in the exhibition in this short period of time, although I don't know if it was their own choice or not. Please. please don't upgrade for another season if enough, Bob
