Move your favorite chair down and turn on the playground when you throw it into the waste disposal unit. Spend useful 90 minutes. living your favorite game. Disassembled - poorly filmed - directional junk. It takes a bit of a number of other "science fiction" films and tries to hit parts badly. There is nothing new here, filmmakers do not seem to understand that offering a simple entertainment experience would be a monetary policy game, but a little bit of skill and elegance are needed to change a good movie. Looking at any money, it's waste, and personally, I would like to have my 90-minute life back.
