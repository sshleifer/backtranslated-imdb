What was the worst film of 2003? "Cat in a hat?" "Gigli?" Not! I suggest that this movie be a hidden film a year ago. Poorly written, poorly edited, and (when I am so brave) badly acted, The Order is a black hole in the film - a movie that is so tight that even the smallest entertainment can't get sucked from its scene. It's not even accidentally funny, like "Showgirls". <br /> <br /> You know manufacturers expect their audience not to be very smart. They renamed the film, originally entitled "Blue Eaters", because they thought the Americans were too stupid to understand what the sin-eater was, even though they go very far to find out what the sin-eater is. Instead, they represent a completely generic title and the image of Heath Ledger, which sees Sullen, is more than enough to get there. <br /> <br /> And what you know was right! My former girlfriend saw Heath's picture and pulled me in. Congratulations, manufacturers, you've met your target market. She also liked "Grease II" so you're in a good company. <br /> <br /> Back to the topic, Heath plays a Catholic monk from a specific (supposed) order that tries to investigate the murder of his mentor. He has celibacy issues, perhaps because someone in their right sense does not believe that he knew the least thing about religion, the less selibate monk. The only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic greasy man. As far as I wanted to see the funny alcoholic alcohol back on the big screen, his humorous actions reminded me of all of my high school dorks that imitated Monty Python, thinking that if they just say such features as Pythons, they automatically made funny things. You know what people I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If I talk anymore, I would be at risk of creating spoilers. To be honest, the thing that was rich in my movie was that it was created.
