I don't know who is to blame, Miss Leigh, or her director, but her performance Catherine is almost impossible to watch. Ben Chaplin, on the other hand, does a good job - compared to any odds. His character is all too charming and tempting. but it did not seem as greedy as Leigh's character was stupid. Chaplin seems to be confused with what cannot be understood as Leigh's misery and lack of grace, but rather his orthopedic uncertainty. In his interest, there must be a certain element of credibility, but if it is played, it is incomprehensible. Performances do not jibe. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are of course wonderful, despite all their efforts on their tracks. Supporting cast is also a pleasure to watch. It is also a pity that drivers are not working together because production is cute to look at.
