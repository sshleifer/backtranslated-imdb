Garson Kanin wrote and directed this picture for "modern" Las Vegas and the intergenerational gap, his first guiding efforts since the 1940s! David Janssen is somewhat overwhelmed as a large-scale casino owner who joins his son (Robert Drivas, who looks amazingly like Elder Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches every scene the same way: defensively, with a chip on the shoulder. Playing this role is cool and unpretentious, asking Janssen too much to grab everyone like a brutal husband (he even looks at Don Rickle and makes him cry!). His son, who is looking for his identity, makes hip hints about how young people are throwing down from Vegas (give them another ten years), and his resentment about his father's lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is lovely when the self-conscious secretary and Edy Willaims have an amusement picture to attend. Unfortunately, "Where is" in the other half is nothing more than modern ruminations about the ethics of adults and their children, some fast R & D shots and amusingly satirical bits in a high level of gambling in the world. most of them are now covered, ad nauseum. ** from ****
