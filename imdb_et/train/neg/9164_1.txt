I have to say this, saying I'm a great romantic. So I wanted to like this movie. So I am writing my thoughts to save the rest of you from the frustration I felt. The leap years speak of a story filled with the fate of Li-Anni, which is blamed on Jeremy and they commit themselves to every year of leap. A very romantic premise based on a great story and pain that doesn't feel like you look at another Jack Neot. So why is it so bad? First, I feel that filmmakers thought they were taking music video because they decided to replace storytelling and any real emotions with cheesy editing, predictable activities, and clich√©s. I am so upset and embarrassed that I have been one of the first in Singapore to watch The Leap Years, but those of us in the cinema would agree that our afflicted storms of fair value performances talked about volumes. My hope was to watch a romantic movie that would cross Forever Fever, which is so far the best Singapore romantic comedy, and Leap Years is not even close. Some blogs have called it "The Crap Years", which is tough, but ultimately true. Don't waste your money or emotions as I did. With the help of the film, you give love forever.
