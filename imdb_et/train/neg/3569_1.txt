Wow! Only the film that is ridiculously terrible can inspire similar "Showgirls". I mean where to start? Unimaginably terrible theme song? Pia Zadora's non-expressions throughout the film? The fact that, despite being placed in Los Angeles, also called "The Land of the Sufferer", all single man (and woman!) Is bored to sleep with Pia Zador. Or is it that every person in the film is completely atypical because they are either Pia (fools) or obviously despicable sleazeballs (everyone else)? And given that this flick was written by actual "screenwriters (sorta)", it shows a shocking lack of understanding of the film making industry (who would marvel and be able to SCREENWRITER?) <br /> <br /> But it's (inadvertently) funny if hell, but the "cracking" scene is in your hands, and after the weather "i'm not the only one who was supposed to get my way to the top." "Awards" (everything is done at a normal discount rate that we expect from high quality patrons like Pia ), I sincerely hope our dear Pia once again used this speech when she "won" her Golden Globe. My day. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you're a bad Tashy camp fan, try it otherwise sticky movie.
