I bought this movie for 1 euro without knowing what it was. I thought "hmmm, a movie called distortion, must be at least funny with gore". It wasn't funny. It was annoying. Very disturbing. And I don't mind disturbing the movie, but it just didn't mean anything except that child abuse is not good. hmmm ... The quality of the pictures was terrible. Working ... did not work. Just some fcked-up fcker will distort itself for over 90 minutes. This is probably a material that helps to cope with extreme gore. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it. It's not worth your time. It's just terrible. I wish I never bought it. <br /> <br /> They should distort the man who did it
