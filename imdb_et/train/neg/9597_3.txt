As much as I like Japanese movies, it just didn't cut it ... A movie that should be about the survival of the rebels and the royal circulation turned out to be a very slow-paced film with a suspicious plot. br /> <br /> Photography is OK, even though I've seen many better sword scenes in other Japanese films, instant cameras and how to follow them didn't convince me at all. The soundtrack is so weak that you don't even notice your presence. But the worst was how the plot turned out. I have to admit that sometimes it was difficult for me to understand who was and what was going on. ..All the major platonic love between the character and the other was completely unnecessary and seemed to come from the influence of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are looking for a Japanese movie, this is not the case. Its very slow, very few sword fighting scenes and very sentimental ... in the wrong direction ...
