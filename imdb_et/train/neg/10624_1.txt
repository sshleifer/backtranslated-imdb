Otherwise, according to a good review, loleralacartelort7890 says: "The truth is that Americans use a secret alloy of aluminum-anti-radiation. Not so well known. And the exact descriptions are a secret. And why is it a secret. Why should they then reveal? If they racing with the Russians on the spacecraft, it would be very stupid to reveal that they have a new technology that can protect the team from radiation. "That's totally wrong. Apollos is not (and was) "secret" to radiation protection. The design and construction of the Apollo control unit has long been public. It uses a lightweight aluminum and stainless steel honeycomb. The entire outer surface (except of course the windows) is covered with a phenol resin heat shield that is thicker at the bottom, facing forward at the entrance. These materials are actually * better * by stopping radiation in the room (charged particles) than lead, which is better suited for stopping ionizing photons such as X-rays and gamma rays. <br /> <br /> Spatial radiation is a long-term problem of space flight due to the risk of large sunburns. But it just wasn't a serious threat to Apollo astronauts. The control module gave them a Van Allen belt during a rather short (1/2 hour) passage. They all did dosimeters, so we know exactly how much radiation they each received: no more than 1.5 and usually much less. Of the 24 men who flew to the Moon (of whom 12 in the castle), 18 are still alive. Only two are dead cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest died from a heart attack, pancreatitis (Pink) and a motorcycle accident (Conrad). These are actually pretty good statistics for the group of men now in the late 70s (Shepard would be 86).
