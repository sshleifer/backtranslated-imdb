First, I'm not an American or a Middle East. Secondly, I have no religion. The closest thing to the religion I have is sports and movies. By now, I believe that it would be best to give an opinion on neutrality and bias. <br /> <br /> Most of these short films are completely shameful. This terrible event should be used to commemorate all innocent people who were murdered by "some" barbaric and non-civilian mores. Instead, most of these short films had seen attempts to collect different political points. Examples: <br /> <br /> 1) Ken Loachi segment. Of course, we are all sad that this guy was difficult in his country, but what about the 2001 innocent victims? Two wrong do not do the right thing! What ever! This movie should have subtitles for those who have problems with a partially inconsistent Chilea-English accent. <br /> <br /> 2) The most disturbing is the Youssef Chahine segment. It is obvious that he has logic problems. He justified the murders because - America is a democracy, and since some Americans voted in power, all Americans are ultimately responsible for the actions and decisions taken by their leaders in the Middle East. Helloooo! Is this man real? Some Americans don't even vote! Some Americans don't even know where the Middle East is; some do not even know what faith is practiced there; and the majority do not know the real political issues behind the scenes. Mr Chahine, the reason we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your logic. The innocent victims of the twin towers came all over the world. Killed firefighters, rescuers, office workers, bystanders and air travelers are not politically involved. And yet, we are not allowed to live our lives because "some" people think everyone has to choose a side or a religion. We are considered to be an extreme policy for a fair game. <br /> <br /> 3) The Israeli segment showed its bombing victims. The second filmmaker uses this event to capture his political agenda. Sometimes it's not about you. Some people always think of me, me, me. Sometimes they are other people. <br /> <br /> 4) The Idrissa Ouedraogo segment is the result of a joke and another political point. They obviously want money from the international community, stressing their poverty. Blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> This film depicts the memory of the "September 11, 2001" victims. <br /> <br /> The best thing is TRASH CAN.
