Good movies are original, some leave a message or touch you in a certain way, but sometimes you don't have that mood. <br /> <br /> I wanted something simple, just not thinking when I watched it. It started out good and was quite fun, then why a bad review. Finally, the film's credibility was lost. The story was not a cheese at all, the activity was not too special, but generally good, it was OK, so more was enough to meet my needs. But all went to ruin, for things happened that were up, and that left me feeling bad. They should have made a little more effort to make everything credible and would have received the category "don't just think of simple action" 7. To sum up, if you know you get upset, because things happen that seem totally illogical: don't look! else would i say further ...
