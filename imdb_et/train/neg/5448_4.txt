Doris Day will never let a bad script down her. Even in the most difficult circumstances, the day gives 100% and usually appears intact. This comedy, which may be inspired by the real New York 1965 blackout, but which was actually adapted to Claude Magnier's French game at the end of the 1950s, gives Doris a little work, but robs his good benefits and, on the other side, be comic soothing (which is entertaining because it gives time). Here are some funny features, but the friction of the material is probably over the game ... and instead of putting out some amusing incidents at Big Apple, we get stuck in the suburbs. Doris co-stars (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse, and Terry-Thomas) are not well suited to her, nor are the hairless shapes they wear. However, it is not terrible, it has a few big laughs and it is a must-have for Day-buffs. ** from ****
