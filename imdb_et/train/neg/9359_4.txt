This film is probably pro-muslimism. <br /> <br /> Why am I writing this? The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lives in his first 20 years in a Christian village. At the end of the film, he appears to be a Muslim, because he has kept his amulet and his overall dress. He has a six-year-old child who is wearing the same head-wear and is therefore probably a Muslim, although his mother is a Christian. So the main character decides to be a Muslim and his child becomes a Muslim. No other male main character, who is a Christian, does not seem to have children. There are more Muslims at the end of this film world, so it seems to be.
