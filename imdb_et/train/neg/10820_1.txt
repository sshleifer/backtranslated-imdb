What was Franco Zeffirell's thinking? Was Hollywood responsible for this travesty, or can I comfortably think that someone who does not speak English has completely missed Charlotte Bronte's classic? I don't think I can refine the comment below, so I just paraphrase it: "Jane Eyre is a great great book, the scriptwriter should sometimes read it." It is true that the two leaders of this film were unfortunately wrong. But sorry for the actors, because the screenwriter left out all the best scenes. The dialogue that makes you understand Jane and Rochester is a way of thinking and shared entertainment ... from a deleted script. Marriage proposal, lucky ... went. Words, half jokes, half sincerely felt that Jane, as a fairy tale from old England, would come to rescue Rochester in his despair ... eliminated. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the novel and Jane's relationship with the Rivers family ended. But it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed love from one of the best love stories. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and find the 1983 (?) Mini series with Timothy Dalton.
