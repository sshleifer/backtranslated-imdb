Throw this flat dog bones. Sooo bad. Kol (Ross Hagen) is an intergalactic bad boy who flees over the head of an avid spaceship (Jan-Michael Vincent). As long as you manage to steal the earthquake. An unstoppable android killer is sent back to death or alive. John Phillip Law plays a forest / park ranger, which requires caution when dealing with these two visitors from afar and far. Costumes are outrageous and the script lacks intelligence. Vincent certainly took the money and ran. The law only shows a sign of effort. So bad is almost comic. Also in production: Dyana Ortelli, P.J. Soles and Dawn Wildsmith.
