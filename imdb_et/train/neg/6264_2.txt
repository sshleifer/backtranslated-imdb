Nightmare Weekend is a proof that some people are so desperate that they are ready to do almost everything in "movies". <br /> <br /> I am not referring to countless women who seem to be completely happy to appear completely in this terrible trash (after that the naked female is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of). No ... I'm talking about those who are more than ready with an important hand doll called George. Now it's embarrassing !!! <br /> <br /> Biological electronics created by brilliant scientist Edward Brake (Wellington Meffert), George (who looks like a demented felt with a green wool) is an artificially intelligent interface for an advanced computer system that uses a revolutionary device (a silver sphere) which is a golf ball), which can change the character of the sign if swallowed. <br /> <br /> Experiments on Edward's personality modification have been successful in laboratory animals, but a cautious scientist does not want to carry out tests on humans, fearing that side effects may still occur. His evil assistant Julie (Debbie Laster) has no such harshness and uses three beautiful young women as a guinea pig. Inevitably, they all become terrifying mutants. <br /> <br /> Discounts on basement special effects, which are totally out of the question, and a plot of land that is almost impossible to follow (I took notes when I watched the movie, and even then I am not entirely convinced that my summary is accurate) , Nightmare Weekend is a complete and complete disaster that can not be saved even by a number of soft core scenarios and touches. <br /> <br /> This movie is also one of the most irritating characters I've ever seen in a horror movie: Tony (Bruce Morton), Walkman, who carries an idiot who bops away to hit 80's in a way that makes to see me Justin Timberlake.
