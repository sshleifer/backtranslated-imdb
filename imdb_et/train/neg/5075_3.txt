The animation was good, the images were good, though not completely original, but the story was too long, too confusing and extremely dramatic. After about an hour I couldn't wait to get over it. With so many characters that have not brought along and primed elements that come from somewhere or not going anywhere, this film was not a single movie and would have been better than a short or two films. If you like this typical story, maybe you like it, but frankly, I have many more creative stories that actually say something. Go to rent a Miyazaki movie and watch it twice.
