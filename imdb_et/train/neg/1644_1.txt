Hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. I thought nothing was breaking the last action of the hero, but it wasn't easy. There are about 3 single men in the movie that meet on Sundays to discuss their sexual escapades over the weekend. The fourth man who is married and - which was previously part of the group, shows and talks about what he and his wife are doing. There's nothing in this movie. The jokes are not funny, but they are repeated throughout the movie. The big kicker at the end of the movie is ridiculous. Avoid at all costs.
