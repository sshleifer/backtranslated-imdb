I didn't like the first "Cube" movie. It was a good idea, but tedious behavior and characters always kept me too much. Did not feel the need to see his sequel, but when I heard they made a third film that would work for the original more prequelina. I was intrigued, thinking that maybe they would fix some original problems and give us a memorable sign. I thought it was wrong. <br /> <br /> "Cube Zero" starts well enough to introduce us to the two characters who are responsible for tracing the endless labyrinth of tracing and preserving that carries Cube people. The filmmakers manage to give the mystery of the two men in their daily routine. This has raised a number of questions about the reasons why people are sent there, as well as the actual nature of the operations that lead the entire operation. All of them remain entirely in the viewer. The action was a bit weak, but the first half of the movie was moving quite well. <br /> <br /> When the story moves, one of the two "observers" will seriously question what it is doing. And later decide to go and help the group of people trapped. There is a place where everything starts to dissolve quickly into faded cheese. <br /> <br /> For the Cube program, we will introduce the word "Jax". Along with its two bedrock, there is an important reason why this film has failed. "Jaxi" looks and speaks more than a third offender directly taken from James Bond's film with an increasingly popular glass eye, which alone destroys the first half's relatively nice tempo. What's more, it starts to feel comedy rather than a serious movie. With some incredibly brilliant lines, perhaps the script is boring and does not care. The functioning itself will be even smaller if the former "observer" meets the Cube group. The whole interaction is painful to look at as everything else that monitors it. <br /> <br /> Again, not only impresses, but dialogue and "Cube Zero" can impress, but spend a long time on those looking for a good horror movie.
