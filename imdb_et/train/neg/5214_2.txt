METAMORPHOSIS I work my way through the Chilling Classics 50 movie collection and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh film. In 1990, METAMORPHOSIS appears to be a remake of The Atom Age Vampire, which also included a scientist trying to achieve similar results. Modern time, METAMORPHS is not my horror movie. <br /> <br /> A university scientist tries to break down the human genome to create a serum to prevent aging. Administration's pressure to publish its documents; and produce some results (or risk losing funding), the researcher decides to be a guinea pig! He first thought he had no adverse side effects, and finally he discovered that the serum had really changed him unexpectedly! <br /> <br /> Action is stylish; and the performances left me much less interested in the film. The result persists. The science behind the experiments and their results are not only wrong; it is absurd; is it ridiculous ?? in best case. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, the end will turn into a 30-minute gag that is seemingly endless. Without giving up too much, I would say, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde will meet a creature from the Black Lagoon who meets the home."
