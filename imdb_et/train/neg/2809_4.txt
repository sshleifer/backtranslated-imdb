When I look back at my college days at the University of Ohio, there is always one event that I remember with pleasant memories. Kanal 23 is OU's local access channel, and in recent years he played something they sent. It included many DIY movies, from bagging in the microwave to peep and then image scanning online, to the Macbeth version, which played the 8th grade, probably just learning how to make squibs. <br /> <br /> But the king, in my opinion, was the 23 lineup of Midnight Skater. For the first time I watched it was about 2AM. I should have learned. Or sleeping. Or watch a regular TV. But no, it's all pussies. My roommate and I looked at Midnight Skater and when it was over, I don't think any of us believed that no film had just happened. But definitely, it was a couple of nights later, and we had to grab that movie actually. <br /> <br /> I could go on and how terrible it is, but it is such a terrible thing that makes life alive. The plot is divorced, terrible terrible, all-scary, but God, if there are others who look at you, its impossible not to watch this time. Its sort of like the first time you hear Chuck Pahalniuki "Guts". You hear it, you are disgusting and shaken, but five minutes later, all you want and want someone else to experience is that terrible horror you just suffered. <br /> <br /> A short story, midnight skater, all of its epic bugs make for a very late night. Plus, I want a desperate Theme to Midnight Skater. Kudos, who wrote it and sang. Sweet God I love this song.
