Have you ever noticed how Burt Reynolds laughs in later films like bouncing brakes? <br /> <br /> There must be too much hanging at Hal Needham. <br /> <br /> Stroker Ace, WAY Too Much. <br /> <br /> Do you think it was based on a book? I couldn't, but it was. And probably not the best seller. Burt is another old-age boy in the NASCAR circle, who grabs Beatty as a fried chicken-magnate with his own team designs. Anderson offers what they love, and Nabors makes his tenth Gomer Pyle a loyal mechanic / best friend. Many people are Burt's or Hal's friends here. Others need work. And even the actual NASCAR drivers will get to the act and look for more talent than SAG cards. <br /> <br /> When you laugh, Bubba Smith (before the "Police Academy") gets them as a Beatty driver. And Petersen, in full Elvira mode, gets a lot of commendable letters like a lady who wants to get to know Lugs really well. REAL WELL. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that Burt kicked off as much time and effort in a movie as "Stroker Ace", where it doesn't matter whether he's working hard or not. They didn't bother to write to him, why did they? <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mostly Petersen and the final results. Now they're funny.
