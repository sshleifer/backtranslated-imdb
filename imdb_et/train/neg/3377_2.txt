Broadway's musical "A Chorus Line" is probably the best theater. It is related to the experience of people living in dance; the joys they experience and the sacrifices they make. Each dancer audits parts of the Broadway choral line, but each of them is a story of how their lives led them to discover dance. <br /> <br /> The film version does not let any passion or beauty of the show, and is arguably the worst film-making adaptation of Broadway music because it is inanimate and lacks dance affection. at all. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake was made by directing the director to Sir Richard Attenborough, whose direction gave the right touch and temple for "Gandhi". Why should somebody in his right mind ask the epic director to lead the music that takes place in rather narrow spaces? <br /> <br /> What brings us to the next problem. "Chorus Line" takes place in the theater on stage without any change in the real sets and limited costumes. This is the least flash of the musicals of Broadway, and its simplicity was its glory. However, this does not reflect well on the film, and no one really thought about it. For this reason, the film should have led us to the lives of these dancers and should have left the theater and listening process. Singers could also offer their songs in other environments and even offered their first ballet, jazz or tap class. Heck, they could have danced on Broadway in their lively imaginations. But no imagination went into making this film, because Attenborough's complete indifference to dance and exhibition is evident in his inadequate direction. <br /> <br /> Many scenes are totally inconvenient because dancers tell their story to the director (Michael Douglas) whether he wants to listen to them or not. The character of Douglas is terrible to choose to whom he extends his sympathetic ear and to whom he has no patience. <br /> <br /> Though filmmakers made beliefs about the nature of the game, some heretic changes were made. Very beautiful "Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love" - ​​smashing stage number that took the dancers back to their adolescence - was removed and replaced by a terrible "Surprise" that was so bad that it was assigned to the Oscar. Insulting the Injury, "Surprise" simply repeats the same story as "Hello, Love," but without wisdom or pathos. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to see this movie if you do not want a lesson to be broadcast on Broadway. If you want to see the film version of this show, the next closest thing is Bob Fosse's brilliant "All That Jazz". Although Fosse's daughter is on "A Chorus Line," she is a Fosse who should have been a director. He would have known what to do with the material that deserved much greater respect than this sad effort.
