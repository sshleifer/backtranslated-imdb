This is a bad movie, it seems that there are only 5 police in HK, they didn't use a gun there and it makes me feel like Jacky Chani's movie. All the time they used their weapon only to address the suspect. When they finally use their weapon, they kill each other, which is a funny film. In the film, it's like all good guys died without reason. <br /> <br /> They also create a line of films for sucking, the story jumps here and there, and bored people. But if you want to see a bloody movie, I think it's just an OK-type movie, I think the US-made zombie movie is more bloody than this
