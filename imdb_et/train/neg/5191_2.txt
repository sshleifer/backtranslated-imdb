Ahh, boring t.v. exhibitions and pilots that came together in the 70s to make equally boring t.v. movies! Some examples might be Riding with Death (the most hysterical cheese in the lot), Sanitation (confusing and uninteresting), San Francisco International (terribly boring and incredibly confusing) and this tour a bit of Quinn Martin's glamor. <br /> <br /> Shot in Hawaii (although you don't know it from outside), it's probably a failed spy show pilot. The real problem is that you do not like most of the characters, including drab's main character Diamond Head, who seemed toward a movie for a sleep; her boss "Aunt Mary", who had a truly strange delivery of her line and peeled white hair and a tan that looked like it was plastered; Diamnd Head's girlfriend / fellow (hell, I can't even remember my name) skinny, woody woman with a sure way to talk, not just sexy or interesting; and the song sidekick Zulu (again, I don't remember my character's name) who wasn't in low doses bad. The most interesting person in the whole production was Ian McShane, who sucks as a bad guy, but still proved he was acting. Nice make-up jobs are the so-called "chameleon" used to hide themselves, just ridiculous. I have absolutely no idea what he is doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab, which made him dress up as American American dictator. I also don't care. The plot was just not interesting enough to keep your attention even ten minutes at a time, not to mention the hour and a half or so that it continues. Just call it - Hawaiian Way No!
