I have given the "Kôhî jikô" a low score not because it was a bad film, but because it does nothing worthy of praise. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen any of the work of Hsiao-hsien Hou before, but for the immortal (involving me), I pay tribute to "Kôhî jikô" Yasujiro Ozu. (The Japanese director, whose last film was five, came in 1962) The film is a very small piece of work that contains very little dialogue, story, music or emotion. <br /> <br /> Yo Hitoto plays "Yoko" a unemployed, misleading character who spends his time in a local café or deliberately explores a Taiwanese composer he likes. Tadanobu Asano plays his friend who works in a cd shop and from time to time induces his otaku interest in trains. And that's all that. <br /> <br /> We look at Yoko's coffee drinking alone ... walking ... waiting for the train ... trying to train ... on the train. Such a daily reality that everyone in Japan sees every day. Hou captures those ordinary moments of the life of the characters, but without these meanings it is totally useless to make or watch the movie.
