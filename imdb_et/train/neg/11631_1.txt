Today I wrote this review of anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has created films based on one of the darkest days of our country. 911 changed everything. It changed our sense of security. It changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity. The most important and devastating thing is that it changed our world. death and destruction. This film and similar films are bound to cause controversy both verbally and among critics; it must certainly be mentioned in the mainstream press. Hollywood has sunk to a new low. Even lower than the lower bastards who made the most barbaric manifestations and indomitable cruelty. Behind it is Uwe Boll. I'm very angry with this movie. How dare they dare to remember the memories of lost families? How dare they mock the lives of those brave men and women who risked their lives to save those infamous days trapped in the dead towers?!?!? How dare they try to satirize and at the same time exploit the national tragedy of grief and tired post-911 in the world?!?!? How ... daring ... are they? <br /> <br /> For those who have a gall to even think of seeing this morally terrible travest, I say it hard with heart and all my strength: Remember. Think back to this day and ask yourself whether you are a reasonable and moral person. Think back to this day, ask yourself if this film is shameful and dishonest to the lost lives of that day. Think back to the day the loved ones attacked. Think back to the two days of lost life on this plane. Think back to the next killings caused by the attacks. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself if you have a soul. <br /> <br /> Think about it. Remember. Observe the memories of lost lives in 911 if you don't see this movie at all.
