If I could give it ZERO stars, but unfortunately I have to give one ... <br /> <br /> There is no scene I could laugh at ... but the game didn't make me laugh either. So if you are a poorly slow nation, go to your local cinema, watch this movie and give it 10 stars, as some people have already done. <br /> <br /> but for me ... in a movie where children are shot dead to achieve humor ... good taste goes over the edge ... this was the third time I wasted my time to see the Boll movie and it was definitely my last! <br /> <br /> 0/10 ... I'm ashamed that I come from the same country as Uwe Boll! <br /> <br /> PLEASE ATTENTION, HOW TO ATTENTION!
