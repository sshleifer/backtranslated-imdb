At one point, if it seemed interesting, he never got there. <br /> <br /> People go from one point to another, really make no sense (if there was one, it was very boring). There were no measures, intercourse, and horrors, and the characters were pretty hearts, so they didn't care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> All movies were pretty boring. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 3/10. <br /> <br /> I like that it wasn't a shaky camera work and when the music was, it didn't bother me, as some very bad movies and acting were not terrible.
