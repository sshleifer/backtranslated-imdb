For those of you who have little time in their hands, I will quickly give one word ... pathetic. There are many good examples of why this film fits perfectly into this description. So much that you can barely pass the 2 minutes of screen time without seeing anything completely stupid and meaningless. Want a naked woman for the first 10 minutes? You got hit! The reason he appears is so pointless that it really brings a tone to the rest of this juvenile mess. You could almost glimpse into the disappointed minds of 12-year-old boys who wrote it in the trash simply by looking at the mess they were waiting for the public to actually pay !! <br /> <br /> Over the years, I've been watching a lot of movie franchise, but American Pie, Beta House must be one of the worst offenders when you think it's still a thousand times more fun than the dreck, despite the average character of the original movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable and sometimes you feel like you're watching a school game. Things in this movie are so unrealistic that you really need to stop this incredible thing (we're talking about the level of stopping Star Wars, like what you have to convince yourself Jar Jar is real) <br /> <br /> Plot is thin paper and most often occurring events are just to show another pair or to create another pathetic joke. There is no acting talent to talk about, all you get is a bunch of real guys trying to make us laugh. And how they can't !!!! Every gag falls flat and the only thing I laughed at was the lack of social knowledge of screenwriters. How else would you explain the bulls ** when they try to hit the story? <br /> <br /> They give every opportunity to do something worthwhile and entertain for the poorly written, lowest common denominator. Characters need to perform a certain number of tasks before being approved as members of Beta House, but it is mostly handled by very short assemblies indicating that they are performing tasks, but we don't see that much. in fact. This is a very lazy way to tell a story. It also misses the possibilities of funny things. (Imagine Oz's wizard, where all the important events took place instead of the screen, and everything we see is Dorothy, who gives away the scarecrow every time and says, "Gee et Certainly this was the great adventure we have had been.) Lazy. Lazy. LAZY !!!! <br /> <br /> There is little or no female characters at all. All they do is naked for no apparent reason and used as visual props through most of the film. You who are just looking for R & D are not disappointed, but for that reason only shame you. When you buy it on a DVD, you contribute to the disintegration of society in your special way. Congratulations.
