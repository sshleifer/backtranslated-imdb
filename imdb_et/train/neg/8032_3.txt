It was a big cast of big characters like Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey, and a number of lesser-known names with shorter roles. It also had Technicolor, one of the few films made with it in 1939. <br /> <br /> Now this bad news ....... sadly, I can't say much about the story. It depicted James's boys in a completely positive light .... and Hollywood has already done so. Why these criminals have always shown "good boys" are over me. This film glamorizes them and made their enemies - the people of the railway - cruel people. The latter was exaggerated so much that it was superfluous. Well, this is the film world for you: evil is good; good is bad. <br /> <br /> Hi Hollywood: Here's the news - James guys were criminals! Really - look at it!
