Disney, Unclear, Bad Scenario, Bad Photography, and Direction ... Generally, the first effort is obviously wrong in making TBN's good commercials. <br /> <br /> TBN Pictures has been a great success in the past, helping to bring "China Cry", the story of Nora Lam, to the big screen. But "Omega Code" is an unfortunate rescue. As a Christian who supports TBN and much of its programming, and who loved "China Cry", I still can't suggest this movie to anyone. They do a lot of good with their service, but this is not an example. Don't waste your money ... then rent "China Cry".
