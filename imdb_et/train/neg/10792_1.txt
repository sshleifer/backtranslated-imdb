this movie does nothing more than you can. In fact, I probably couldn't imagine how meaningful the film was, how synthetic dialogues might be up to an hour ago, but then again I saw this video. in a movie that does not depend on a powerful script, we expect at least a good actor and delicious conversation and maybe even humor, but this film lacks everything. you heard me they didn't have them all. there is no point I like about this movie, no one. I hate it. I'm sure someone will do it. The name is meant to give the target audience some nudity and things, but it is even nudity. I don't know how, but I suffered to watch for that hour, and I would definitely recommend that. the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. if someone offers to watch it, ruuun awaaaaayaaave your own liiiiiiiiife
