Well well. As good as John Carpenter's 1st season was "Horror Masters", it was the opposite. He proved he was still the champion of horror "Cigarette burns", but "Pro-Life" is probably the worst thing I saw from him. <br /> <br /> It is a stupid, completely clean atmosphere and tension, and it is more than welcome, less than one hour of work. The script is meaningless, the characters are irritated and tempting, and the conclusion is absurd. <br /> <br /> And for those mammals that actually bought the DVD (one of them is me); did you see how Carpenter describes the movie? She is proud of it and she talks about her for a long time for her best work and she praises the script. And on the commentary, where he sees the obvious screw that made it the final passage, he just says he does not consider it necessary to fix the mistake and just let him be there. I'm afraid the old captain has completely lost his touch. I sincerely hope that I've been wrong. <br /> <br /> I want to leave a positive comment and mention that the creature's influence is still fantastic. Technically speaking, this film is the upper limit, with effective lighting systems and an effect.
