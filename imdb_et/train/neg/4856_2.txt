For my life, I can't understand the dark jump and the commitment to this absolutely unbelievable movie ...... and I think I have to say that .... I am a former special-purpose soldier who is 14 years of "Lifestyle" .. This film was completely unrealistic and was probably written by someone who did very little research on army life, combat or team or team level. <br /> <br /> Three EOD men around Baghdad independently ????? Get Real ... No chain of command ????? Get Real ... EOD Clearing Houses ?? Get Real .... EOD / military intelligence / sniper qualified buck sergeant ?? Get Real .... Wait ... I shot and killed the bad boy and then let the two men take me without firing or injuring me ???? Get Real .... I'm grazing an Iraqi civilian while I'm only armed under 9 meters of immigration, breaking into another civilian house, getting bored by a woman, and doing it at night in the middle of Baghdad walking camp without night without it as much as scratching confrontation ???? Get Real ... <br /> <br /> There is no military record keeping {army} and no similarity to any army I have even experienced. A totally unbelievable and disrespectful EOD for men and women who, unlike this poor film, are not natural adrenaline seekers looking for yahoos but highly skilled professionals who do incredibly hard work.
