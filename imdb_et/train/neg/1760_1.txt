This film makes a number of mistakes. some American actresses in Spain and Spanish actors who speak English. "The spanish English is OK, but how it works is completely annoying. Dialogue across the script is very weak; it may be a Spanish script, but translated wrong, who knows and cares. I can only assume they are famous Spanish actors forced into English, they may be good, but not on this flop. You will find the movie in the first 5 minutes, this is how pathetic it is, then the rest is just bad. Oh, did I mention one of Baldwins' in it.
