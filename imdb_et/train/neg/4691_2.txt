The real blow of the film literally. This British film is boring. <br /> <br /> What an exciting plot! Terrorist puts bombs on the train. How could this smoker's writers and producers make such a dumb story? <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, an expert called to break the bomb, is terrible to write. Of course, as he is called, his wife, Anne Vernon, leaves. No wonder we've never heard of Miss Vernon ever. After such a movie would be enough to finish his career. <br /> <br /> This older man who loved trains and intervened is our 1953 version of senile dementia. I thought this man was very offensive even at the end.
