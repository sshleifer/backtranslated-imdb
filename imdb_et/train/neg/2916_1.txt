This is the worst film I've ever seen in my life. The plot and the message are terrible. There are too many mistakes in this movie that are impossible to keep up with. I don't even understand how this film can become a candidate, not to mention 2. Here's why: 1) Sam Lee represents an angry / irrational detective caused by his father's disappointment. Pros: He's angry. Cons: When it comes to explanation, he cannot pass on his father's sadness / disappointment. The joke was too fake and it seems to be literally pushing the tears out of the eye. <br /> <br /> 2) The piano or choral music sounds appeared to be the title of the movie. fight the scene and the rape scene, which is totally irrelevant and confusing for the viewer. I understand it should be a metaphor or not ... but it's just stupid! 3) WHY DOES THE HECK DO NOT VEHICLES TO KILLER? What's wrong with this movie. When the killer began to seize the officer, SHOOT him. He's already dead! What the hell? There were many ways that the killer was killed, but I don't know why he was not! 4) During the scene when the girl had hurt her. It was very clear in the scene that the left foot of the girls was injured, so when hell in the next scene, did she borrow her entire weight on the left foot? And this is the best actor who is the best actor? WTF? 5) Movie sounds are not synchronized. <br /> <br /> 6) I think this film is trying to raise awareness of the brutality and violence of children in Southeast Asia, so why will the police win and then fight? 7) This film is too violent without purpose. The police beat CI in the pulp and when they work together, they give them marijuana and coke? In general, this is the worst film. I really feel that the person who wrote the film is sadistic and ill. I've never seen a more nasty movie all my life. MOVIE EVER!
