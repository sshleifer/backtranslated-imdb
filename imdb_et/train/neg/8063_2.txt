I was expecting a variety of Sci-fi and thriller films this summer, but I was so disappointed about this movie. While some people went out of the movie, I decided to stay, but to laugh with the other actors' movement, a temporary struggle, a ridiculous end, and difficult to follow the story. I found myself almost as confused as the film's main character. The only quality of redemption was the soundtrack. This is one of those who create star films that they later regret. Looking back, I wouldn't even have rented that rent, let alone $ 5.
