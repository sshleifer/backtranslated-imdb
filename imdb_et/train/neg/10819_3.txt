I agree with one other commentary writer about the good story and the good actors, but it doesn't fit, and I would say in a hurry. It has been around 24 years after reading the book as it was in school. But I felt that you should know Jane Eyre's story when it is viewed, because the bitts are not left out and therefore it makes no sense. For example, Jane & Rochester has barely talked and suddenly makes her marriage! The actor has no time to let the audience know how their character feels about every thing that happens inside the story. Participants are good, but they are not given enough time to make this story fair. I'm sorry to say, but I didn't enjoy this version. The 1970 version with Susanna York and George C Scott would be my favorite Jane Eyre movie, but you should look at the 1983 BBC mini-version with Zelah Clarke & Timothy Dalton in two main roles. I love it so much that I look at it regularly. There is a shortened version that goes to 225min or full version 330 min.
