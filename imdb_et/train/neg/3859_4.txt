Jason Lee is doing his best to bring a funny situation, but the film just doesn't get in touch. Perhaps because the character of Julia Stiles seems uncomfortable because it will be forced to be sexy and sexy soon. Perhaps this is because he and the characters of Selma Blair should have been the opposite. (Selma Blair seems to be more binding than Julia would). <br /> <br /> In both cases, this movie is another Hollywood trivialization that is likely to be in a real-world situation (that your pants will collide with your bachelor, not worshiping your cousin) that will not succeed in giving promise. <br /> <br /> There are some smiles to be sure, and the cast (even if it is unsuccessful) will do their best in subclass material that does not exceed their filthy topic. So instead of getting a successful raunch fest (ie Animal House or American Pie), we are left in the middle part of humor and part of stupidity (area of ​​meatballs 2 or something).
