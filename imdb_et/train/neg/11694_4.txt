So "Solvent" ... Yeah ... That Steven Bachman (read Steven King) yarn from a man who gets his only dessert from a Roma parent he just killed. I don't know why I didn't enjoy it more than I had. I think what really disturbed me was the actors. I mean, who's leading? Robert John Burke? Who is he? And cry out loud, can anyone stop renting Joseph Mantegna for every Italian mafioso role? And while we're at the point, should every mafioso have an Italian mother? The only good work here is under 10 pounds of makeup, Michael Constantine as a gypsy parent. He's pretty good. But the rest, I'll make you all, "better actors ..."
