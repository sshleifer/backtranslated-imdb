Ram Gopal Verma has proven to be a very innovative and competent director. He had recycled / recycled the godfather to Sarkar and had succeeded tremendously. Ditto for Lolita, what he did Nishaabd. <br /> <br /> Sholay has been the film he repeatedly says has inspired him the most. Unfortunately, he has managed to disappoint and finally get a dull remake. <br /> <br /> The actor was good until very good, as Amitabh Bachchan was appropriately threatening as a villain in Bab. <br /> <br /> The songs were terrible and forgotten. The Mehbooba Mehbooba song came from the second level of the music video. <br /> <br /> The worst part was the pace and the dialogues that were unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie in the theater, I found myself waiting for a break and then ending. Some viewers were clever not to wait and see them throughout the movie. After all, one of Ram Gopal Verma's worst movies.
