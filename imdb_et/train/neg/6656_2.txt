It will be two because I liked it as a child, but it became so superfluous that I just started to hate it ... I can't do this descriptive overview because it would be one thing one after the other, I probably wouldn't say something all the others Did not say. <br /> <br /> The only other thing about this show is that it is pretty nasty, where the boy boils down to this stubborn babysitter for the stupidity that runs around and in it. I have a cousin who loves this example and is the strangest and stupid person I met. This exhibition has to be pulled out of the air. It's the same thing over and over again ... They need better shows in Nick. I'm really very tired of such things.
