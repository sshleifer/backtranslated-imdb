A very low budget police process film about killing detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body is stolen in a car in Central Park and their only clue is a tattoo on her hand. Although it is issued by RKO, it is the appearance of independent production that the studio brought to the market. With both exceptions, including the young and non-configured Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner, they are cast and the team are completely unknown and show. The performances are broadly sub-parameters and do not move to the gathering in the upper secondary school film, the direction is hungry and filthy and, as mentioned earlier, there is no chemistry between the leaders. Despite the many drawbacks of the film, it still has some good points. Due to the very small budget in New York and the very low budget of the movie, it is much better than The Naked City, a somewhat authentic, shootout in the dark basement, and some research. is smart. Otherwise, there is not much to write at home. It's a glimpse that a glimpse of New York's sea cuttings in the early 1950s and old drivers is ecstatic to see the 30th and 40th streets of cars on the streets. > <br />.
