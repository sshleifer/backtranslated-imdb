I have to admit that I have ever tried it on the US network. There's just something about this flick, well, stupid, which makes me want to always look at it. Yes, you have the right to act on the right, a plot that only seven years old could like, etc. But I cannot help some participants with compassion. What's more, some of these participants registered a more frightening sequel.
