Can I give this minus rating? No? Well, let me tell you that this is the most terrible movie I've ever tried to watch. It was painful. Boring Maximus. Plot (?) Hiding is well hidden in many spray sublevels. I rented this movie with a friend and after about thirty minutes of hope that it would improve, we decided to move a little further to see if things were improving. It will never improve. This movie, which talks about a kid kidnapped by these two girls, sounds interesting, but actually it's just pure. Nothing is far from interesting. If you have the opportunity to view it, do it yourself, try "PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE" instead.
