Many months ago, when I was seven years old, I can vaguely remember to see the trailer of this movie. He turned to my naive curiosity and decided to ask my parents to bring me to this movie. Being clever adults that they are, they said to me, "Not at all! It's a bunch of trash." Of course I was very disappointed that I would not be the first block of my boyfriend to see the "Incredible alloy man". <br /> <br /> Little time passed - maybe a few days. I forgot the "Incredible Melting Man" and my disappointment disappears. Twenty-five years passed until he came again at the forefront of his thoughts. When I was browsing through the digital cable, I found the remains of this long lost movie. My curiosity was tortured and I finally decided to take part in the fruit banned by my parents. I should have listened to them. The "Incredible Melting Man" is perhaps the worst person known film. This makes films like "Def-Con 4", "Metalstorm" and "Freddie Got Fingered" look like Oscar candidates. I feel in violation for almost two hours when I look at this messy mess. crude oil even in 1977. How did someone convince the film company to produce this film over me. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistake I made. Listen to your parents if they deny you watching this movie. They were right.
