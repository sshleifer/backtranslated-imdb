A typical Lanza flick, limited to the audience with a weak story line that was assembled to justify the Lanza MGM contract at that time. <br /> <br /> As a member of Lastliberal (above), Grayson Lanzat couldn't stand because of his unfair progress towards his (and sometimes) camera. In addition, he had no tolerance to his rain forest and the constant smell of alcohol on his face at the time they did. After the second (and last) movie together, "New Orleans Toast", usually ran into a quiet Grayson Louie B. Mayer office and told him he would never work with Lanza again? period. Mayer found that Grayson was much more valuable to MGM than Lanza, so that Grayson's claim remained closed. Grayson went to star in a number of widely used (and much more profitable) musicians with Howard Keel and others. Later in life, when asked to compare Lanzat and Keel, his response was that there was no comparison between them and that the Language was good to work with and was much more pleasing to the audience "real people".
