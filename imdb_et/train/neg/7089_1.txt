Sexually obsessed chefs lead a double life: one happily married man with a ten-year-old child, the other sex. Most of the documentary film follows him for five consecutive days and is spoken as feedback from Nastassia Kinski as a clinical therapist, listening to his story and reasonably trying it. The role of Nastassja is very restrictive and she is the only major adult who does not take off clothes. If he had done that, I would have appreciated this movie as "F" of high fat. As it is, it evaluates F +, which means it's still a failure if you don't want to be bored. It is probably more interesting to spend 90 minutes cleaning the garage. "Sex Diary" belongs to this category of film that if someone has seen it, one wants one not to.
