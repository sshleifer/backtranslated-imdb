I didn't see this movie at the age, but I thought I'd comment on it anyway, mainly because the memory that I don't like is burned in my memory cells. The original THE GETAWAY was not a prize at first, but at least it was a difference 1) Sam Peckinpah's film, 2) Highlighted by Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens, 3) It was a relatively painless way to blow an hour For comparison, the 1994 version is so little more than an empty piece for the red hot Alec Baldwin and his soon-to-be divorced Kim Basinger. McQueen and her husband, Allie McBride, were also split shortly after the release of their film version, and one possible picture of Baldwins in his marriage council, who is talking about this foolish idea of ​​making this movie. <br /> <br /> We can just say and out of it - Alec Baldwin has never been and has never been close to Cooler's King, and one of the reasons why this remake was so disturbed is that Baldwin is an arrogance supposed to challenge our memory Leading to Steve McQueen. As someone else pointed out, Peckinpah's 1972 film vision was a piece of satire designed for parody, action, and adventure. In contrast, Baldwin, Bassinger & The Company try to highlight the more serious tone, only Michael Madsen and James Woods' slippery disproportionate criminals who come as real people. <br /> <br /> Film is also a decisive spiritual and unlikely basic level that is difficult to put into words. One view was more than enough, not just because it had nothing new to offer, but because it was artificially made. The Peckinpah movie was actually a stylish little entertainment with a pleasant mood where this version is a slogan that takes too long to be little or no. There is no artistic urgency to its existence, and some of the more uncomfortable scenes are so inconvenient that the movie is hard to enjoy. <br /> <br /> So I don't know, it was probably one of the films that helped to initiate a wave of meaningless, artistic coats of great budget transactions, built around an actor / actor showing the name of the name, which in itself is not really good thing. I would see that the filmmaker would try at least to try a new idea about the film and the fall with something original. This film made me look my eyebrows and reveals that, over the next 15 years, since its publication, Mr. Baldwin has been widely known as one of the greatest Hollywood jerks. Thank you God for "Team America" ​​for putting it in place. <br /> <br /> 3/10
