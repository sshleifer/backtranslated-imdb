First of all, I have to admit that both of the films I've seen by this director saw without headlines and maybe they didn't get points. My Czech is not bad, but after sitting through two of his films, I didn't even want to learn. Samotari is too cool. Too cool. It's about ten different stories that together knit in and out. It's not that deep in the unusual city of Prague (small, really.) The main characters are between 20 and 30. They have a job and only one study. The best character is a young Balkan girl. His feelings are repeated by immigrants here every day of the devil. That's it. The only great character. All others make their lives hell alone. How can I understand this obvious incompetence? Maybe there are interesting bits with Japanese tourists, but do I need another stereotype in the film? If you like the right music, watch this movie. If you want to laugh at the stupidity of others, watch this movie. If you like irony and dry humor, check out the original Jarmusch, not imitation. Under no circumstances see Ondricek's Septej (Whisper).
