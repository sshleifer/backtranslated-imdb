I don't see much reason to get into this movie thoroughly. Sylvester Stallone is again John Rambo, author and sponsor of A Hell in Hell, recruited from prison by his only friend, Major Richard Crenna, to return to Vietnam's secret, photographing American prisoners, who are still believed to be awfully camping and returning without involving an enemy. <br /> <br /> Fat Opportunity. What if he's nothing but hidden, pictures and sneakers? Who's coming to watch the movie? <br /> <br /> This is essentially a Stallone muscle marking. To prepare for his mission, we see his well-oiled muscles bulging. (They are oiled and burning.) There is a ritual of black leather, foolish weapons and even better knives. Black weapons are cleaned, mounted with a loose clamp and almost as oiled as the Stallone muscles. The belt has been tested and yes, it is enough poundage to drive the enemy through the bolt. The knife is sharpened using sliding screws. <br /> <br /> Stallone and one of his troops are betrayed by one or two Washington suit cynical politicians who can bet, never even a fist in the fight for a spelling school. No courage, you know? Just sit on your desk with your feet and drink a foreign beer. <br /> <br /> The film does what it did, but what it anticipated is meretricious. It deliberately puts in the popular myth of the mid-1980s that numerous MIAs were quietly held in the northern Vietnam camps. Bumpers were common. (Free our MIA.) Why would they hold them? It was never quite justified, but maybe the violence turned into slave labor - in a country where there is no resource other than labor. Or maybe their propaganda as a tool that lowers the United States - the propaganda requirement that the Vietnamese world kept secret. <br /> <br /> Rambo is a medieval medieval North Vietnamese language. Suffering from the pigs' excrement to his neck and then pulling out his wrists, his muscles still on the screen. Then, not a satisfied Vietnamese person, a Russian officer is taken to play the role of Gestapo Officer - "The water haff will remember." High-tech type, Russian uses psychology and electricity, not just pig mining. <br /> <br /> Rambo returns and declares that he is going to drift deliberately until "this country loves us as much as we love it," pointing out another myth that veterinarians returning from Vietnam were overlapping and cursed. I think we chose as many congresses and called others for senior positions. The last three losing presidential candidates were among this despised group. At least Rambo's purposeful drifting to the left of the room opened a queue that quickly reached. <br /> <br /> Action films with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others started grazing with wisecracks, but Rambo is humorless. He rides through this fantastic ideological sex, killing mercy, barely speaking, hardly able to speak. Speaking is a sign of weakness.
