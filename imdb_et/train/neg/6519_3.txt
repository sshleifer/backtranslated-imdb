Filmed in documentary style, but you can quite say that the participants were instructed. The recently divorced wannabe filmmaker (Myles Berkowitz) sees the opportunity to revive his love life and simultaneously enter the movie. He is going to make a documentary about finding love by filming twenty days, including the consequences. The best is the spotted comedy; the rest is a failure after an accident. Richard Arlook, Robert McKee and the attractive Elisabeth Wagner are also taking part. Tia Carrere is talking about trying to gain credibility. This is enough as a handbook on how not to get a satisfactory date.
