Although not as bad as it is done (I've seen much worse), it's still a very flat film. Basically, Siegel's "Coogan's Bluff" is a rehash, the main difference being that Clint Eastwood's hat has more charisma than the whole Joe Don Baker, who is an unpleasant actor when it was. <br /> <br /> Venantino Venantini is great (and very fun) as a bad guy, a kind of budget for Vittorio Gassman. She's the main reason to sit through this steam pile because the rest of the cast is mostly terrible, especially for the girl. Poor old Rossano Brazzi, hard to believe he was once a romantic leader (see "Mondo Cane" to see women women flee). Looking here at Ben Gazzara of the second degree, he is given something to do. Unfortunately, this is all Joe Don's show. And all this achieved the music of the 80s generic "action films" that couldn't be bored. <br /> <br /> Greydon Clark can make B movies ("No Warning"), but here he travels, falls, breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, at least Malta's places were great and Venantini is trying to save the day. 3/10.
