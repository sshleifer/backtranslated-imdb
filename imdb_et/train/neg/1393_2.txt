I thought it was annoying to watch videos about the company video. This movie didn't go anywhere fast. What could have been a somewhat cheesy, half-hour dusky episode that turned into seemingly endless film waste for people who park their cars, a picture of a guy from the pool (he really has to answer his phone anyway), doing a dot matrix printer, and Heuy and Louey sit in a yellow illuminated control room repeating "T minus 10 and counting" as something exciting would happen. It's not that you don't get your hopes. The best goal of this film is to see James Best and Gerald McC, which is something other than the famous TV personalities, and it stretches to find something good. Don't start with music that consisted entirely of Tympan, some great marine mammals and microphone feedback. This movie is as close as I gave, but it gets 2 because I really could stop this insomnia and not have to leave the middle. OUT OF ALL EXPENSES.
