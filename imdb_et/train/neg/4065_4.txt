... Eric Stanze with similar minds. Not a particularly talented director has directed a particularly good movie, but I still found myself closing it with credit, if nothing more than seeing what happens next. <br /> <br /> The attacker escapes from the prison and calls his old flame. After he (even if he wanted to) seize and threaten to have sex (another event he was prepared to do), he shows that he has kidnapped three men who had wronged him in the past. He then decides to kill (huh?), But he's dead. The girl's mind clicks (or something like that) and she takes her rage to unhappy generations in the basement. <br /> <br /> Okay, writing sucks: it's wrapped long, loaded with ten cents and there's too much of it. <br /> <br /> Effective sucking: what's the minute that works? <br /> <br /> Filming sucks: Home video is bad enough, but for 20 minutes, the cinematic film material is just a fucking offense. <br /> <br /> And the budget is a joke: get it ... "Budget", it was a punchline. <br /> <br /> But there was more to it. In the 1970s, such films appeared in theaters where they had real budgets and talent, not that day and age. If you want to see such a violent, sexually exploited trash bin (don't lie, some of us), it's all yours today. <br /> <br /> Some short hardcore photos of sex years, the menu has better torture with excrement, fun axes, anal rail flooring and long mad chick masturbating with the same bones. <br /> <br /> It's not good and you can't remember it, but not from the flowering of Joe D'amato, people have made such movies. <br /> <br /> 4/10
