In general, I like dinosaur movies, but it's a nonsense. No script, no dialogue, no action. And the brave Colonel Rance, who is trying to show that he is tough and curves his mouth, resembles a twin brother, the police stupid Proctor. So it was a complete waste of time (luckily I don't waste money when I saw the movie on TV). And I really do not understand 7 people who classified this t * t 10. My advice when you see this title!
