I don't know what that other man was thinking. The fact that this film was made independently makes it no less terrible. You can be as big a believer as you want ... most of this movie is meaningless. I feel offended when I had to watch it for the first 40 minutes. And that alone wasn't small. Functioning terrible not only, but the plot has never developed. The story contains countless holes where you can't name the story any more. I have never read this book, so I can't criticize it, but this is the first review I wrote here, which only aims to save you and all your viewers for an hour and a half of your life. I don't remember the last time I couldn't even watch the movie. It's really a cake.
