It's pretty surreal what these flies can do ... well ... it's a comic, so it can happen. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must tell you that I love animated movies. Unfortunately, this year's repertoire is very weak. This comic is nothing but a list of errors: <br /> <br /> 1) I quoted the tagline. This shows that this film has big 3D effects. Well, I didn't see any, at least nothing special that I had never seen before. <br /> <br /> 2) "Movies" doesn't see anything real flies in this movie. At least they would be black. But is cyan flying seriously? With giant heads and thin torso? <br /> <br /> 3) Story. I think it was written for 6-year-olds. I can say that in two sentences, it is so simplified. <br /> <br /> 4) Excessive patriotism. For example: "These are American files!" Oh, give me a break.
