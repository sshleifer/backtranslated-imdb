I absolutely adore the "Toxic Avenger" series, but this weak offer for Troma people didn't make any sense, and it was awake all the time. <br /> <br /> Nuclear power plant leaking (and growing weed control next to it will make Tromaville High go nuts that cause them to join the gang, have sex, explode and whatever. Also in high school some monster breeding ... my God, this the movie is nasty. <br /> <br /> The participants stopped their efforts after that and they should do it. (The proposed) excessive effect started on my nerves in about 5 minutes ... <br /> <br /> Disappointment. 10.
