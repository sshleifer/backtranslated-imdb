In the 1930s, fashionable documentaries were seen from distant corners of the world, paying particular attention to wildlife, exotic landscapes and unusual cultures. Regardless of the distant and dangerous transport of the film crew to the logistics and then to the live film (film footage), such films were often much cheaper than conventional Hollywood features ... because there were no expensive costumes, costumes or expensive movie stars. <br /> <br /> The most successful players (artistic and financial) of such films were the team of Martin E. Johnson and his wife Part, who made several documentaries (sometimes with events) in Africa and Asia. Johnsons safari films were very popular, inspiring many parodies ... especially Wheeler & Woolsey "It's That Africa", where very sexy Esther Muir plays the name of Mr Johnson-Martin (instead of Martin E. Johnson). , geddit?). While many other filmmakers made documentaries on safari at that time, Johnson's films were the most popular in this genre because they were largely based on humor. Looking at our own enlightened (hope) perspective, this is a serious flaw in Johnsons documentary: too many scenes where funny brown or yellow people look for the perfect idiots clever white bwana Johnson and his wife. <br /> <br /> One particular asset of these films is the presence of Part Johnson. Ten years younger than his wife, he can seem young enough to be his daughter. Although Johnson was not as attractive as the shapely blonde Esther Muir, Part Johnson was a brunette who gave the camera all the excitement she had produced together with her husband. <br /> <br /> 'Congorilla' is probably the best Johnsons movie. Congo shots are interesting and have a historical value that proves that this environment seemed to be in 1930. The images of the Pygmies and other indigenous peoples are also interesting, although they suffer Johnson's desire to staged events in a way that makes natives "wild" and foreigners. <br /> <br /> Best (and more fun) scene "Congorillas" is an improvised sequence in which Part Johnson tries to teach jazz dance to some Pygmy women. (Dance is Black Bottom, no less ... same dance that Bob Hope taught to Daisy and Violet Hilton, united twins.) By wearing a jodhpurs, riding boots and a pith helmet, Part Johnson starts singing the song, he takes great steps and bounces on his knees. trying to teach this dance to African women. In the meantime, they just stand there looking at him, probably thinking about what this crazy white woman is trying to achieve. This is a very funny scene, but it's unpleasant. Part Johnson makes a dance invented by black Americans: it seems that black Africans should instinctively do this dance after a brief demonstration (using a natural rhythm, I think), because it is in their blood or something. <br /> <br /> I value "Congorilla" 4 out of 10 points. This film tells a little bit about the life of Africa in the 1930s and rather the American cultural sense of the time.
