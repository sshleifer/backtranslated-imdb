I found this film to be boring, monotonous, and rather uninteresting with fast, low-end, "hostile" endings that were not against the general story. Following these symbols on a weekend of terrible events, unfriendly attitudes and bad news, it's not just my idea to look at an interesting movie, and I got very tired of this "one note" topic and couldn't wait until it ended - I actually stopped almost halfway. The whole movie seemed just pointless and wandering and the characters were mostly frustrating and unpleasant, though the actor was good. A little movie with small ambitions and a little complaint - sorry, but it just didn't do it to me and I love good little movies! It just didn't last, though I watched it in hope and trusted it. I was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put this year's "best 10-year best" list. I strongly recommend watching "Sand House" - now it's a good, little movie!
