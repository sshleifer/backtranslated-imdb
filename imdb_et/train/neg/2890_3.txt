The past drops to the Rehab drug addict when he reconnects with his sick brother and his former girlfriend after he hopes he was the last attack. "Drama of Life", which is presented here in the simplest way as imagined (not even in writing is bite or common sense). The pain is made up of attractive, luminous actors, and music and photography are dim (a few visual effects are ridiculous, the indie clich√© touches the dirty budget trick). Although a man has written and directed, it is produced by a woman and I am not sure, but I think it can be a clear reason why this picture of about two men, foreign brothers, is getting closer, never real gels, never feeling natural or It seems to be alive. It's an attempt to get a male relationship, but cautious and sterile performance is cheating. No heart is in it, a living, breathing or bleeding material. "Perfect Son" spreads quickly by too many cooks in the kitchen.
