Okay. So there aren't many great movies out there. Recent gems like American Dream, The Straight Story and even Toy Story 2 usually don't come so close. But the boy (!) Balances the quality of this movie. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what these people thought they were doing. Are the financiers of this world so easily convinced that they are financing such ****? I see it right now ... <br /> <br /> Producer - "So we have Joe Fiennes. He's funny and was in Shakespeare. And we have Rhys Ifans who's not cute but was at Notting Hill cool, we mix a really mediocre score, a couple of unforgettable post-Britpop music, hemlock root and lizard brain and hey presto, which has the worst film of the new millennium. And believe me, it's hard work to do something as bad as it will in the next thousand years. " <br /> Bank - "I like it! Any unnecessary sex? Bad camera movement? And what about the worst accents on Devil's Own side?" <br /> <br /> Manufacturer - "Yes, we have a lot of them. "Bank -" Sounds good where we write? <br /> <br /> Please.
