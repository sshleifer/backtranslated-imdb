School smile Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a number of classmates and is then in a lab explosion (also by them) where her face is sour-frightened. Years later, everyone was called back to the high school (because they were closed) to meet. What they didn't know is that Marty calls them back to kill them. Then the storm begins, locked in school, and Marty starts revenge. <br /> <br /> Pretty foolish. The murderers are resourceful and nice and there are some creepy pictures of the abandoned school - but that's it. The humiliation caused to Scuddamore is more than cruel (he is looted, has a head dunked in the toilet and burns) and is just uncomfortable to look at. Given that Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after its release, it is almost impossible to watch them. This film also goes out of nakedness. Scuddamore is full of front (surprising for every movie), but one girl chooses a bath alone ... after they know, the killer will travel after them! And then there is a couple who has to have sex. It's a type of movie where the killer seems to know where everything is going to be and who can do it for themselves. It ends with a twist that silenced me and my eyes rolled. The actor is tolerated - not good, but tolerable. Caroline Munro is in it too. She is a very beautiful woman, but not a big part of the actors. <br /> <br /> It gives 3 some powerful murders and an atmosphere. Otherwise, it is the work of the mill and forgotten. The tragic suicide of Scuddamore has paid more attention to this film than it deserves.
