This, Tremors series direct-video-death, includes sixty-inspired seconds (saw blades: you know it when you see it) and more tedium and filler if you can shake. Tremors 4 was obviously hit with a bad budget. This means that they had enough special effects within the mojo for three or four minutes for valuable worm-like violence. Dirty, clich√©-challenging cast and hackneyed writing ensures that the rest of the lesson and half of the Tremors 4 experience will feel at least fifteen thousand years. Only hardcore Tremors fans can sit down, the less enjoyment of this movie. If you are not among them - don't worry.
