This is a strictly pilot-episode review as it appears on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Television went out of my life in 1981, so I didn't follow this series or part of it - that is, I'm immune to the nostalgic charm Moonlighting seems to most reviewers. <br /> <br /> (Possible spoiler warning) <br /> <br /> Moonlighting pilot is your main "caveman meets fluffball" with a "charming" red-blooded man manipulating a misleading woman to realize what he really wants and needs. The premises on which the "wit" script is based must be hidden until the 1950s. It also includes some honestly bad writings, such as the scene where Maddie demolishes the furniture instead of fooling the criminals strictly to prove himself a woman in need of masculine help. <br /> <br /> I often feel that Susan Faludi reacts to men's chauvinistic conspiracy for simple entertainment, but in this case I am all with him - Moonlighting has BACKLASH all over it. In some ways, however, it is a DVD for all serious Bruce Willis fans: in addition to the pilot episode, it includes a screen test that grounded Willis' work. Both features show how amazing Willis's ability to operate between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Country). Impressive! <br /> <br /> Rating (and I _m_ Bruce Willis fan): 2 out of 10
