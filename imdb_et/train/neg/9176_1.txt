You know you are in trouble when the narration comes mainly to you who lives. Everything goes down there. Unnecessary, "Matrix" affected ball-time camera works. Unnecessary cutting of video game material. Harsh captains and crazy sailors. Ravers, who are instantly qualified as qualified fighters. Even zombies are boring. <br /> <br /> I was hoping at least "so bad that it is a good" zombie movie, but it's "so bad that those who are involved in creating it should never make a movie again". <br /> <br />
