I thought I heard this dialogue in the movie, but it was so bad and inappropriate that I couldn't really believe it. I laughed so hard that has been the worst writing and action in human history. I was seriously worried that I might have a heart attack and die in a theater there. <br /> <br /> So this is the scene I am talking about, the "hero" just looked at his brother's crash and his brothers car just exploded there just feet away (hero). The "hero" threw the expected "fit" to see something so tragic and people tried to get him back to the burning car. <br /> <br /> In the middle of his suitability and his uncontrollable rage / emotional break, he says, "I'm so sad" - did he say it right? Am I crazy?
