I loved to look at the original manga of living with Azumi, convincing events, cool soundtracks, staging (rocks of Kitamura!), Editing and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who performed this part perfectly. So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but after finally seeing it, I felt that I had won the lotto and lost the ticket :( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi stayed, but these are totally 2 different films. is not so exciting and choreographic and character development is not much - it was probably led by the same man who was responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO monster franchise (if it is possible!) I agree with some other past figures who say it was a lost opportunity .If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued to make this contribution, there are some beautiful Japanese forest landscapes to look at the slow action and too short to introduce even the real bad guys are being killed too easily without too much fighting. The Spider boy (out of the monkey episode) in the bamboo forest was about y Azumi 1 Wheras had a climate fight scene with a barrel camera effect, Azumi 2 brought us Azumi cape cam !! was not convincing, but Aya still does a good job. He looks good ... but where did he get it? I don't think I'll look at it again and again! ...what a pity.
