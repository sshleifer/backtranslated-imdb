Age fires are a hidden film of flop sweat. I don't remember any film that has been so hard to be so cruel, provocative, and important, but it couldn't be so consistent everywhere. It's like a resurrecting comic who doesn't laugh, but can't leave the show. The harder the film is, the stronger the test will be to laugh in the direction that causes the dark. The despair that the film shows is so striking that it is damaging to almost everyone involved. <br /> <br /> Film only has a ridiculous status twice. Once in the eyes of Geraldo Rivera, he is playing an unpleasant, arrogant and immoral journalist on the TV tabloid - which is funny just because he probably doesn't understand that he is playing. The second scene that deserves to laugh is the last "big moment" of the movie, where the Morgan Freeman judge gives a holy pleasant lecture about the moral ("what your mother taught!"). The moment's pompos offends the absurdity. <br /> <br /> However, it has to be admitted that it is superb. It's a good thing as a group of badly cast actors who are trying to mark the cartoons on thin cartoons. The film looks professionally made and the little cinema thrives that director Brian DePalma just loves to be obvious, if not particularly effective. But a film that would probably be a commentary on contemporary morality and ethics never depicts a comic. Satire requires style. Farce needs energy. Even sitcom requires timing. But the best pitfalls can accumulate in despair. Finally, you don't want to laugh, just want to go away.
