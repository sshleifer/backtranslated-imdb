Why was this movie made? Even bearing in mind the generous tax incentives given to Australian film investors, there can be no reasonable explanation for the progress of this film. For the sake of prosperity, this film is attended by actors Aussie b-class celebrities (not actresses, people like John Michael 'Hollywood' Howson, original drummer from Hey Hey on Saturday and Voice Player in Countdown. But saying it is still very traceable if you give him the attention of the brain what it deserves: no, the script is bad (even self-acknowledged for b-class horror) and the quality of the actors and movies is worse, often it seems to be a home movie, but even at home the film has "realism." Anyone interested From an Australian film, please, for God's love, pretending that this film has never been made.
