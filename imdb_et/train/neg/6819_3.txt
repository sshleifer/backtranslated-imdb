in this movie joe pesci slams basketball. Joe pesci ... <br /> <br /> and consistent, the rest of the script is not as plausible. <br /> <br /> The Pesci is a funny guy who records this movie absolutely behind the basement, but the other roles were pretty bad. Dad was a greedy businessman who valued the money more than people who hadn't even played well. Instead of being an archetypal villain, he seemed to be an immoral android programmed to earn money at all costs. then there is a symbolic piece that is assigned to a nest as a girlfriend or something ... I don't even remember ... she was forgotten. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates this movie over 5 or 6 is a paid member of some kind of film studio that catches the reputation of this drowned movie or at least one million media artists who can't criticize effectively (you know, people who feel bad, if they give something please note below 6). <br /> <br /> away ... far away. and a shame in the comedy where I saw this movie. they usually choose better.
