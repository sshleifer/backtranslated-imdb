This movie can be a 2/3 journey of meaningless pleasure. Unfortunately, the film gets too confused. Although I know some of the plot contractions are conventional "buddy cop" movies, I got those characters who are superbly offering foils, but in the end the film is too much of a trace of crunch and loses interest. /> <br /> The filmmakers did a great job of getting the characters alone and doing their thing, and we could see who they are and who both police officers identify early. We formed our opinion instead of feeding this force by continuous beating. <br /> <br /> After all, too much is going on and it greatly reduces what could have been an enjoyable escapism. Here is what is about Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) at the end of the film: <br /> <br /> 1. His real estate transactions 2. His affair with psychological psychology 3. He explores internal affairs 4. Investigation of killing <br /> /> If you add Casey to worries, you want him to want to be an actor and revenge on his father's death. Now, some of these things come together and are good, but all the elements of the plot are gathering behind that scam that is so long and pathetic that I hardly have time to break and give what just happens. The impressive acrobatics of scriptwriting cannot overcome the bad film making. <br /> <br /> As a ridiculous pursuit sequence was not bad enough, one that has four separate compartments and can last for half an hour wasn't bad enough. Joe Gavilan's fields are calling their real estate deal, making the offender a weapon. All of these extra-curricular plots and jokes make it completely pointless for me to try to catch the offender. We have already forgotten or do not care about the plot of murder already, because several plot lines and eye candies have surely surpassed us. <br /> <br /> Although I could go ahead and how they destroy a decent story, I don't want to. It could have been a very enjoyable movie, but it was too big for it to be too big for the britches and it became redundant. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett actually did quite well and it is worth noting Gladys Knight's little look. Unfortunately, no actor can forget this hopelessly misleading movie. <br /> <br /> Although this is probably better than "The Hulk" and "Lara Croft II", the film does not do that well. I heard Harrison Ford said he was only making movies that would probably make money, I'm not sure if it's true or not. It is true that you don't need a big movie or a big actor to get a great ticket office, this film does not have a leading role. My advice to Harrison Ford would be to stay with Indiana Jones because you can at least continue.
