Bad done. The frightening action and end that the director looked out of, because the film was, frankly, empty. The fact that this film is considered the Gijon Film Festival is shocking. <br /> <br /> Everyone who came out of the theater had the same opinion as me - what was the idea of ​​even making a movie? The references to Iraq were either strange or simply thoughtful. I'm surprised that this movie has been published - very, very disappointing and a waste of my time. Sorry, terribly negative review, but hopefully some people will keep the same mistake. Sorry we didn't have Q and A at the end of the movie - now that might have been interesting.
