The Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal combination has been golden before I liked HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA, so I went to the film (Indian multiplex) with great hope, especially after the slick promo. Unfortunately, like HULCHUL before, this film was a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> Like others, the film's premise, which has already begun, has begun, just stretches and evolves without any development or additional stratification. After a while, you just want to finish the movie so you can go home (if I had seen it at home, my losses would be much easier to prevent). Akshay Kumar's performance is the best, and John Abraham should not do comedy again. The overall comedy aspects of the film were for weeks. I only remember the whole movie twice. Certainly no contiguous belly that consumed me in HERA PHERI or even to a lesser extent in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA will certainly not laugh. Paresh Rawal had some of his expected classical moments, but in general, as his role and character could not grow, he did not make a big impact on this film. <br /> <br /> Neha Dhupia, who only makes an appearance in the movie, had fun watching her on the screen. And some songs are fun. In particular, the opening and closing of ADA and KISS ME BABY respectively. Otherwise, you're better off just passing this movie.
