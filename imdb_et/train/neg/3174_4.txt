Jeff Lowell has written and directed badly over his dead body. The idea is the same as my jokes and filling is just a cake cherry. <br /> <br /> Minus Eva Longoria Parker has hardly any likes in this movie. Eva looks good than ever and offers pleasant performance. Bell Bell is a complete failure. She looks masculine and gives a strictly average result. Jason Biggs is wasted, so is Lindsay Sloane. <br /> <br /> I was more entertained by this movie. Unfortunately, I didn't get entertainment.
