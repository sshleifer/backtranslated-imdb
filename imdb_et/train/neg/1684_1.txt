This is Columbia Pictures' 'The Grudge'. This kinematic cruelty began when an otherwise well-intentioned American saw a Japanese made for a television film "Ju-on" and re-inspired the film in English. It started with a bad decision on a virtual tsunami that moved around the world until it was washed in Orlando on 21 October 2004. <br /> <br /> The premise is that I use the word loosely. skinny Momma ghost who looks like a cross between Margaret Choi and Alanis Morrisette, with her strange, chubby but evil grader. Is it something more frightening than a horrible 8-year-old Japanese boy? Of course there is! Count Chocula comes to mind. With this charming cluster we have to add a mysterious black cat, whom I have lovingly called Chim Chim. (Remember the Speed ​​Racer?) As you already thought, they were murdered at this place of death and now you want to kill everyone who enters it. You see, as the Japanese detective explains, when someone dies of rage, the ghost is looking for revenge on anyone who moves into a real estate line determined by a county commissioner or something like that, I forget. <br /> <br /> The story begins with innocently fairly acclaimed journalist Bill Pullman, who jumped from his balcony to death. I think Bill Pullman got this job because his children asked him in Disneyland Tokyo. Next, we wear the delicate sister of Yoko, "oh don't go there," shouts the audience, but unfortunately she doesn't take into account the terrible warnings and is predictably beaten like a magical lamp. About 30 minutes of the movie we finally see our American heroine Sarah Michelle Gellari Karenina. Sarah Michelle Gellar may be a competent actor, but I couldn't think of Buffy Vampire Slayer so much that it would distract me. This is equivalent to Jennifer Anniston's star in a movie about six friend's adventures in New York. Try as you can, you just can't stop thinking about another project that made her famous. But I land, Karen, a nurse hired as a substitute for the original caregiver who disappeared in ghosts. <br /> <br /> He swims around, meets ghosts, the coma lady dies and some other things happen. Looking at the fair-haired vixen who was looking for clues, wait for me to find that he finds a ghost and pulls that mask out to reveal that it was actually the old man Gower, who was the owner of the abandoned amusement park! "I would have taken it away if you had no children and your dog was mixing!" <br /> <br /> Director Takashi Shimizu, who wants to be Ed Wood in Asia, made two unfortunate decisions about sound. First, he only decides to use the soundtrack when someone is dying. This is a great example of deleting any arrest, as the audience gets a two-minute warning to prepare another miserably predictable murder. Secondly, he gave the ghosts a strange noise that sounds like gargling. After the movie, I heard several people leaving the theater, making a sound and laughing. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar is the only survivor. And, of course, we know that the fire he hit the house was erased for the next chapter. However, considering the humorous reactions of the audience, they did not want to continue but apologize. "The Grudge" could easily be re-edited for comedy, so it's valued for the value of this camp. Baring it, it goes as the biggest cinematic thriller from "Godzilla vs Megalon." I would recommend waiting until the film arrives at your local utility theater, where it can earn so much public ridicule.
