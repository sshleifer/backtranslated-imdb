Except people probably buy this garbage! As has been shown, as "Moral Orel" has shown, even if you were trying to make the most outrageous, general gospel parody, it might be thought that this show's fun would not be close. It's hard to say what happens when you look at it. Is this news? Speaking? Who knows!? They start with reading various international news, but at seemingly random points, the news is interrupted by this odd, troll-like little man whose forehead is bigger than his entire face, knocking and laughing and generally scary. <Br / Pat <br /> Pat Robertson does not seem like a halo at first glance. He just looks like a senile but harmless old coat that has been stuck in his archaic faith (like most of our grandparents). But this is a person who has called a murderer who has been friendly and has helped none but two dubious dictators who have used the donation money to illegally manage diamond mines, who have supported forced abortions in China and who regularly expect Caucasians (especially straight American males) Caucasians are better than all other competitions. <br /> <br /> However, it would all be funny, except that it probably has a big enough fan base to keep his little show up for 40 years (either it or enough money to bribe a TV driver who doesn't give the fuck they show). The idiot of the exhibition becomes worrying when you realize that some people have to look somewhere and hang on every word. Even if Robertson has repeatedly shown how he is corrupted, people still listen to him. I don't know if it's funny or scary. I think a healthy mix of both.
