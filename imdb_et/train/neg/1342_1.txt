This film is the innovation of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. Although it suffers from some problems, like any low-budget production, it is a good start for Mrs Beaton and her company. <br /> <br /> The story is not terribly new in movies like The Burning and every Friday part 13 after Part 2. But performances are cordial. So many great budget movies just show that the actors are moving through the movements, it is always nice to see that the actors really try to keep their handicrafts. <br /> <br /> The story is about the murder (and possible return) of a spoiled classmate. Others are sworn in secret, but the trauma of the event sends every person in different directions in their lives. Ten years later, friends are murdered one after the other with a merciless stalker known as The Bagman. Who will survive? You have to look. <br /> <br /> If you are Roger Ebert or a number of arrogant critics, you should probably not bother. But if your taste runs more to Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people who are hiding your craft, check out The Bagman.
