The IMDb review of this movie seems to have paid more attention than the source. <br /> <br /> Here's an overview without any pretensions: <br /> <br /> Just when you think it's not going to happen, that's not the case. <br /> <br /> Dress it up the way you want it, this is a boring movie that is full of unagaging characters that do very little interest. <br /> <br /> Put one if you want to convince an impressive emo chick that you are so deep, man. <br /> <br /> Don't look at yourself, though. <br /> <br /> If not. <br /> <br /> You are. <br /> <br /> Sensitive.
