"Don't bother to watch this movie," it would be better if you like Marilyn Monroe in your other roles. It was a great disappointment given the great lie, not just Marilyn. <br /> <br /> The story was just something, of course, something like that described in the VHS box. There was simply no relationship, precious little excitement and too many numb images, most of them trying to show why "Nellie" (Monroe) was so confused. It was not a good role for Monroe, though I didn't have to see this character to find out he could act. "Some like it is hot" alone was enough evidence for me. But this role just didn't fit her and it is not surprising that it was not one of her most popular films. Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jeanne Cagney, Donna Cocoran et al. <br /> <br /> Summary: It's not fun and entertainment is the name of the game.
