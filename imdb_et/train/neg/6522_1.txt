This is not a commentary on the actual film, but on the RUSCICO DVD in North America. I don't know if there have been different editions and updates, but the discs we rented had 2000 copyrights if that meant something. Anyway, mixing the sound of these DVDs was absolutely terrible. Levels are often up and down; if the scene was cut into a battlefield panorama, the orchestral track would be so loudly blurry that I didn't know what was going to happen first - my headphones or my speakers. When it was time for dialogue, the volume usually drops hard to hear. Sometimes the orchestra and the Foley work would be loud when the dialogue was much lower. My wife and I found that the only way we could watch these movies was when one of us held the hand on the remote control to change the volume continuously. And as the other user has already commented, we chose to re-dial between English and Russian when choosing English; and sometimes, when the characters speak French on the local track, dubbing was in Russian, so you're SOL if you don't understand. Ultimately, we stopped watching the first disc. Before you add $ 50 + to your DVD for your movie for my library, I would recommend that you rent my hands with your heart to see if you really enjoy this epic flick when such a bad sound is burdened, especially if you ever read a book and want to really understand.
