The film had some good exhibitions and good moments (though probably a small budget), but a bad rating due to bad development. The main point of the conflict between the two leaders is not at all realistic. There are some scenes where they disagree, but there is no great depth to explain how they can be together, seeing the world so differently, especially since Glenn's work is so complete that he is involved in this life. (And Adam is active enough to support it with time and money.) Also, Glenn has been depicted negatively several times as he is (apologizing for Adam for his past), while Adam has proved that he is supreme and traditional, " what the film declares "good" ways. I don't like being preached. I participated in the director's discussion after watching the LTR, and he said he had made this conflict between them because when he was in Glen's shoes (and he said he in real life is related to Glenn), he never got anyone's positions with Adam, well then I think he should have done a lot better by explaining how Glenn can do it in the film. The movie was only after reading (Dummies routing) .Directing was not so bad, but far from top level, I've seen worse, but I rarely leave movies because of this frustration.
