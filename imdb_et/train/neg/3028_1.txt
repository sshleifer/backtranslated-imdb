My apartment player rented this movie the other night so we looked at it together. <br /> <br /> The first impression is actually positive because the whole movie is a colorful, grainy, post-MTV texture. Fast sequences, cool corners, sweeping moves - at the moment it looks like you are still looking at some "Snatch" .... <br /> <br /> When the plot actually starts, one begins to feel like one of overdose amphetamine. things no longer make sense. I wouldn't want to spoil it when you look at this particular scenes, but then again, this movie is so bad that you're not really looking at it. <br /> <br /> First of all, you think this is a crime story in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu. ERROR. This conversation does not offer any narrative. On the contrary, Domino lesbian coming to Lucy Liu's character after the second part of the movie just throws the audience even more confused. <br /> <br /> Then I thought it might be a movie about affluent girls but a dysfunctional background that grew like a harsh honey. In any case, this is the message that is transmitted by open scenes. But after that, the criminal plot loses the Domino character. In short, NO, it's not a movie about Domino's character. <br /> <br /> Then I thought it was probably one robbery. Pretty bloody robbery. 10 million disappeared, bounty hunters doubt predators, mafia children are executed, hands are removed, Domino is trying to break why this time they don't get bounty certificates, etc. But soon this will be the second U-turn in the plot. <br /> <br /> This time we face a sad story of an obese African-American woman who is deceiving drivers at a local MVD, and the youngest grandmother at the age of 28. Lateesha stars at Jerry Springer's show are trying to disclose some new, unpleasant racial theories, and at the same time trying to find money for their sick grandchild. <br /> <br /> What does it do with the main matrix? No, nobody knows. Except that the director had to explain to the target groups where the hunters collect their collector's fee of 300,000 euros. <br /> <br /> Then you sometimes think, "Oh, this is our society and how the media distorts things". There's a reality TV team that rides with the hunters and makes violent material. The prize hunters are also captured by Hollywood actors who just whine all the time to break their nose and drag too many criminal scenes. But NO, it's not a movie from the media, they just appear randomly throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There are also many other sub-plots: crazy Afghan guy scattered to liberate Afghanistan, Domino's love story and Chocco, mescaline episode, FBI surveillance ... <br /> <br /> All of the above Things Are Packed In A 2 Hour Movie? Judge myself, but my conclusion is clear - it's a real mess!
