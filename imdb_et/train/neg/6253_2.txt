Not a very good film, but according to the information, it is quite accurate when depicting torture methods. The aim of the film was to show the brutality of NK POW camps and it is quite effective, surprising over time. Regardless of the technical faults (and there are many), looking at it, you will see the forgotten corner of the forgotten war and some pretty nasty things - again disgusting because it is done in the north of DMZ and not in Guantanamo Bay. <Br>> <br /> I don't think any Korean veterans brought their torture to office when you look at such movies and Pork Chop Hill as compared to Vietnamese films. I don't know if 54-year-olds were trapped in the concept of World War II (boys tend to bother) or war or what, but it's interesting to see the same system that would be 16 years later making films like "Go Tell The Spartans".
