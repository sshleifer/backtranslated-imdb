I remember watching this movie many times as a very young child and there were parts of it (many actually) that I don't understand. I think I've seen it as an adult once and I understood these parts. The only problem with watching an adult was that it wasn't entertaining at all. What movie is this? Is this a "children's movie"? Not hardly. It contains a language and substance that is inappropriate for children. Is this a hyperbole about what every parent knows about their children? Maybe, but why not focus on John Ritter's character instead of Junior? If the film has a 7-year-old character as its main character, it should be good for the audience that it would be for the film for seven and below the crowd; otherwise, people older than that will have no chance of associating (even 8-year-olds) I would like to see a child who is younger than a child all year round. I am quite sure that this film did not work well in the cash register and that the reason for this is that it was not possible to find a niche on the market.
