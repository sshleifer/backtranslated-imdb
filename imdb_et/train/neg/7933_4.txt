I'm a big fan of Randolph Scott, but it's a movie. The whole thing is a preserved, fake, sound, truly terrible backlit projection. It has the idea of ​​a good plot that the scriptwriter has been successfully buried in a zero-handbook, which makes it impossible for the audience to dive into action and care for any character. Management is a pedestrian, and only emphasizes how bad a script instead will help. I've seen lots of enjoyable "sound art productions", but that's not one of them. All this means you appreciate even more Scott / Boetticher movies. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is parked, beautified and shining a million dollar smile. She is always a joy ... even in the worst films. In addition to Scott, the other main reason I wanted to see this movie was how much I enjoyed Mrs Wymore's Errol Flynn's movie "Rocky Mountian". "Behind the man behind the weapon" he is just as beautiful, and you can say that he is a good actor, but he was forced to say some pretty empty lines and the obstacle he gave was really terrible. I saw Phil Carey only in the operation in the Pacific, and he plays exactly the same character here ... lofty pain-in-the-butt you want to perceive. I think it proves to be a good actor ... he made me hate. There are some flat attempts at comic relief, which in my opinion only damage the film. Although there are many elements to knock, I have to say that I really enjoyed two Spanish songs that were sung on a musical number ... but that's not why we look at Randolph Scott's movies, right? <br /> <br /> There are definitely even worse Scott movies and it is definitely not intolerable, but it can't be said to be beyond average.
