For a while, Disney is making one of those films that is all surprising. One that keeps you wondering until the end. In the Caribbean Pirates tradition, this film definitely turns into a ghost and kills and rapes your village. It's terrible. If you want a meaningless, pointless, predictable "action" movie, go straight ahead. I believe that young children can enjoy it because they like how good ALWAYS wins. But I, I like movies where it is hit, who wins. This movie doesn't let Bad Guys have any more hands. Finally, when the heroes are left in the "inevitable" hole, you know they can get out. Everything works perfectly for Cage and his friends, he doesn't have to think over a riddle or hint for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complicated it is. Watch this movie if you want to see some impressive designs, not when you want to see a good actor or a good movie. Go see the superman movie, it would be much shorter and the kids would like it more. For example, a scene where Cage escapes from armed forces, and the bullets have all escaped by the escape of fire. (And I'm not talking about the garden or anything but a little one) This film shows the breakdown of films and the film industry into cheap gags and dull, unrealistic activities that this film offers in large numbers.
