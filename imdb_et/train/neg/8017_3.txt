I haven't actually finished the movie. You can say that in this case I have no right to look at it, especially so negatively. But I only do it because I stopped because I couldn't look any more ... I got over half and I got there only, promising myself something good around the corner. This film is so tiring, so weak that I was really offended. I have not read many other comments, so I'm not sure if there are other homosexual teenagers who have suffered it, but I'm homosexual, and I went to similar appearances, daily dreams, questions, and so on. There were perhaps two moments where I actually felt that this film could go somewhere where I felt that it might have some meaning or relativity, but those hopes were struck at the moment when the next cliché-robbed narrative appeared. Just look at the IMDb page quotes. Unfortunately, you can't hear scratched gaming, nor do you echo your eyes when you just read quotes because they're just too painful / ridiculous / fools. I gave the movie to three stars and all these three stars go to a filmmaker who did a fantastic job of trying to make Archer's tired "concepts" something to watch. Think of you, I pray that he did not decide to include all the long shots in the neighborhood of the TV ... another unnecessary cliché that has already been made in films like Korine's Gummo ... I think it's very suitable for this movie premiere at Sundance (only because Archer had other links in the festival through volunteering) because Sundance seems to be one of the festivals where the heavy chopping of the clichés is still an "arthouse". No, it's not an art house, I'm afraid it's just plain. Don't look.
