Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can't stand Ben anymore. How can this man still not make movies. I do not understand how this happens when I was working as he did in the movie I fired, and I have a company ..... I have to come. GOD! This film was just a plain, steaming, smelly pile of POO that should be evaporated if possible. Something else that I have to say is that the commentary is about 10 lines of text idiotic. What's wrong with saying some things about some movies? I never understand why sites need a short novel when sometimes a short comment is needed.
