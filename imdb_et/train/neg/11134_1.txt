It's a very cheap werewolf. The video is dark and poorly lit. The sound is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed. The script is accustomed to spam with ordinary characters like a tough detective who shoots silver with his silver weapon! [filled with, of course, silver balls]. The actor is the same tree as the characters. There's no FX, a lot of extreme close-ups and biting of wolves and jaws. the only thing shown is a lot of soft core T&A. Instead of lowering $ 30 on this tripe, see a truly recent werewolf pic: "Dog Soldiers" with Sean Pertwee.
