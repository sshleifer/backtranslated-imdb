It's really a terrible movie and a 2-hour pace. It is simultaneously horrible and offensive, nudity and a lot of violence. But nudity is not so exciting and violence is repeated and boring. Also, the plot is at best weak, characters are unreal and undeveloped and the actor is the worst I've ever seen. I've heard that this movie must be funny, but it's not. I never laughed while watching it and I didn't even laugh at the smile. The authors of this film tried to combine a comedy film with a feature film and they failed at both readings. Some badly made movies are funny because they are so bad, but that's not one of them.
