The first question after that garbage is the one who on earth gave these idiots the right to use the name of Apple in this movie? It's a buggy, embarrassing and pathetic attempt to continue the Omen franchise. When the movie starts, this music sounds like Bugs Bunny Cartoon and since then the movie gets worse! I don't know who wrote the script, but I bet they got E - for taking it back to show their teacher! After a while it is hard to say whether it is a comedy, because what happens is so funny and so original to original people that it is a beginner's belief. Action is ridiculous, especially for the leading lady, Faye Grant. does he keep a stupid face or is it hard to laugh? It's hard to say. In the worst case I've ever witnessed an accident. 1 out of 10.
