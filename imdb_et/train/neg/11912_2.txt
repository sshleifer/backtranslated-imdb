The story of this movie is very interesting and generally the plot is not so bad ... but the details: writing, leadership, consistency, pace, sequences, tricks and using CG all the films are getting cheaper and breaking the film. br /> <br /> First of all, the sequences of action. They are all rather vague. Most are made up of someone who stands and lets shoot, without trying to run, fight, dodge or whatever, even if they are all the time in the world. Scenes seem to have made something strange in 2004. <br /> <br /> CG has very well rendered and animated effects, but they come out as they are used. <br /> <br /> Pacing: Everything happens too fast. For example, "Elle" is used to fight in a few hours, and from the beginning you can make back-ups, etc. Why is he so acrobatic? None of this has been explained in the film. Like Lilith, he shouldn't have been able to drag back - maybe he couldn't, because he had wings. <br /> <br /> We also have sequences like a woman who rides over a car and stands up and just travels in an abandoned room with a sink and mirror, and then in the throat of the nose, for no apparent reason and without any spectator really caring because he just hit the car (and then felt the secondary effect of another explosive car ... "Are you okay?" asks the driver "yes, I'm good", he says, bloody and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I looked at it all because the introduction promised me it would be interesting ... but finally, bad performance made me want something else: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, even this movie with vampires where Jackie Chan was a comic relief because they managed to stop my faith, but it just made me wake up and give the writer a good talk.
