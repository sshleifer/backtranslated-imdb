I wasn't sure if Andy Sidar could repeat his success with the "Malibu Express" cinematic blow. With her film Fit to Kill, she has proved that Sidari has a serious filmmaker and not just a one-time director. The graph written by Sidari, which the Academy surpassed, is a complex scenario involving many unseen twists. The main characters were working for a sexually explicit radio station known as KSXY. KSXY is actually their secret headquarters. In "Fit to Kill", they face their long-lived Kane, who is trying to steal one of Russia's most precious diamonds. A well-written scenario is not all, an excellent exhibition will help to make this film a cult classic. Critics and custody captured by the ticket office will be evaluated in the coming years. It now suffers with the same fate as the Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver, but will undoubtedly be recognized in the future. I am disappointed that Andy Sidaris has not recognized the filming of trademarks in critical circles. Costumes, special effects, contribute to this beautiful film making. At best, it can ignore the bad 3 ratings of this movie and go out and rent it yourself. My personal rating is 10/10. Drama is as thick as Runaway Bride, and the action is better or equal to the cinematic masterpiece Last Action Hero. Andy, keep up the good work.
