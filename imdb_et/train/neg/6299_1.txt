The alleged adaptation of the weaker novels by Martin Amis cannot even compare other drug studies, such as Requiem For A Dream or something that Irvine Walsh has written, because it is imperative to decide whether it is a slap-stick comic or hyperrealist hallucinations. <br /> <br /> In excessively saturated colors led by William Marshi, the group is leading public drop-out mansions, waiting for three American friends to appear on a decadent drug weekend. And that's it. With the exception of the ridiculous sub-block on the soon-to-be-head plot, it is pointless for an extremist cultural event to express itself in violent killings of world elite figures, be it political or pampered. During the first lap you know exactly where it goes. <br /> <br /> What is a talented actor like Paul Bettany in this tiring, poorly written cage? Made before fame and Jennifer Connelly, you can be sure that she would immediately change agents if she offered this garbage! Avoid.
