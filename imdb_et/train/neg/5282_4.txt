I have to admit that I am seriously disappointed. <br /> <br /> This version cannot compete in any way with the 1995 version. The reason I was watching was not completely satisfied with Ciaran Hinds as the captain of Wentworth and thought that Rupert Penry-Jones seemed much more like a captain, which I imagined reading the book. And he was too. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only redeeming quality of the movie. The rest is like Austen-like as possible. <br /> <br /> Miss Elliot would never have been on the streets of Bath. It was not his character and it was simply not done by the lady of those times. This book by Anne Elliot was a lady and had dignity. There are other painful anachrones, but it was the worst. <br /> <br /> Although there are three important price quotes in the book, they are totally inappropriate moments, warning those who know the book that another important part of the book is either lost or completely changed. <br /> <br /> And while this version is not much shorter than the second, it seems that everyone is in a hurry. Very little care was taken to show the characters, show their dispositions and motifs. Important scenes were left out. How could they put together the final scenes in this way? Disaster! And it wasn't nearly as beautifully photographed as the other. <br /> <br /> No, no, no. If you love Austen, don't waste your time with it.
