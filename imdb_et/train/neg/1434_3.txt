James Bond in the desert? Well, that's what he sees: Pierce Brosnan is the best known as Bond in "Tommorrow Never Dies" (1997) and "Golden Eye" (1995) - both were shot before release. Frankly speaking, the two leaders of the film have become so confused, turning Brosnan a little more convincing when Annie Galipeau (like Pony, Gray Owl's love of interest) has to fight negligently with a written dialogue. <br /> <br /> These two aunts are perfect. But the film is not aunt. This is the wild desert of Canada. And while photography can be beautiful, there is no fear of the harsh reality of living in the wild. Annie Galipeau, like Pony, is unfortunately not convincing because I wanted to believe her. He was a relatively inexperienced twenty-year-old in this film and it could have worked, but Richard Attenborough was perhaps just not harsh enough for him. She makes her sensitive, which of course she is ... but in the wrong place. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain he seems perfect. But mascara and eyebrow thickener in the desert? It just does not fit, especially since he seems to be in Bond with forest firing (sorry, Gray Owl) and when using photos, I can kiss close-ups. <br /> <br /> I have lived with the woodland people in the western Pacific and they just don't look at it beautiful and stay so sweet to fight for survival. What brings me to the second point: the film doesn't create a period when it's set: the 1930s. Here's the charge for a scarce glossy script that wants preaching at the expense of a dramatic arc, plot points, and those little details that can create a period of action. <br /> <br /> William Nicholson wrote the script and his last offer, "Elizabeth, the Golden Age" was opened three days ago, so I hope it will improve. <br /> <br /> Yes, I've read the comments others have posted, but I'm not sure m. A lot of potential, but wrong and even perhaps poorly prepared. If he had a religious film, it would have been put down, but because it preaches environmental protection, the film will remain somewhat above criticism because it is "politically correct." Sorry, I don't buy it for that. Amen.
