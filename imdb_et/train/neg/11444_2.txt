The SNL is pretty funny, but people who say it's like a short sketch of SNL are a little pointless. It's nothing like SNL, it's just a stupid piece. <br /> <br /> Andy Samberg tries to act as Jon Heder, but fails. Although Jon Heder is only funny in Napoleon, Dynamite Andy tries his hardest and people think he is funny. <br /> <br /> Only funny people in the movie were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was funny with Andy was part of the pool. <br /> <br /> They could have made the "quiet place" much better if they did not fall into the falling scene of 3 freaking minutes. > <br /> The part where he pronounces his H has slowed down. They try to feel it for too long and half a time, as Andy laughs when he acts ... he's a terrible actor and doesn't deserve to be in the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke and it is for people with simple thinking who have a 10-year-old comedy level brain. What is about half the United States.
