One More Die Hard Direct Video To Hang From Cardboard Villains? How many of these gods have been terribly (and badly) busted by the most popular films since the late 1980s and early 1990s, are they still hidden? Because the record (not that you really care) is another dirty dirty Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed ​​2 combination with complete clichés and predictability. <br /> <br /> The non-writable villains are the usual cardboard box cut out with weapons that are sent by various means as the movie progresses, the hero is naturally an ex policeman or something with family and attitude problems, and of course it also leads non-participant only ordinary emotional baggage, but also suitable eye candy and his annoying son. <br /> <br /> The alleged luxury cruise ship between Florida and Mexico has been carefully described between cruise and ship? is it somehow explaining how they look like a rusty cross train? New Zealand! The action is both wood and deck, the script is stubborn, one lining is predictable, the villain is completely intuitive and the plot has holes that you can ride on the boat. <br /> <br /> There seems to be never ending such a robbery directly on video slots that pollute the television's late night and DVD discount packages everywhere (even though this movie is so bad, there is no DVD yet, but it gives time!) Is there anything at least half done properly, half believable and most important in ORIGINAL?!? No, I didn't think ...
