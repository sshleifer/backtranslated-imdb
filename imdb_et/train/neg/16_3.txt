There are many very beautiful people in this movie. This is probably the best thing. Maybe it's even worth watching. <br /> <br /> "Loaded" talks about Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a young man who is starting to make his mark on the world. He is a son of a good family with a good reputation and is on the road to the Faculty of Law. But like so many such settings, things are not as perfect as they appear. The expectations of this family outweigh love. Except for school, Tristan's father rarely leaves him out of the house. It seems to be the result of some traumatic event in the past that shook the family, which has been partially manifested by setbacks but has not been specified to the end. Tristan's claustrophobic environment causes him to be released in very extreme ways as soon as his friends bring him to the butterfly club to celebrate his graduation. On Sunday, the beach holiday will soon follow, and Tristan will be in contact with Sebastian Cole (Corey Large), who pulls him into drug trafficking. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from a weak script and story that is not very interesting. Also counting on this movie are some of the constant camera tricks that seemed generally annoying and inappropriate, such as slow motion, fast movement, freezing frames, and echo. These are the types of effects that the director can usually use to show the person's perspective during the drug, unless in such a case they are randomly guided in points, in some cheap test style. > In spite of the presence of their relatively unknown characteristics, the occurrences were good, especially with the major antagonist (Corey Large). I suspect that in the future, we will see at least a couple of these larger and better projects. <br /> <br /> Of course, mentioning the appearance of the participants should be mentioned. The rating is based on heat, this film collects 11. The women of this movie are incredible in appearance and almost pull you away from what you look at. I'm sure that male characters are also quite attractive, but you have to ask someone to comment on it. <br /> <br /> In general, I cannot recommend, buy, rent, or even charge this movie. Unfortunately, it's just not worth the effort to sit down.
