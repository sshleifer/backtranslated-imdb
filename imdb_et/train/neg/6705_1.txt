This movie is just a shame. Orlando, Florida seems to be becoming a more recognized film-making area (like Vancouver's prestige). The brothers were shot in Central Florida and this short film is a bit of a backlash for the region (which made great progress with Indie's movie "Walking Through Africa and Big HBO Miniseries From Earth to Moon". <br /> <br /> I'm trying to be as honest as possible. was the perfect place for the movies to brothers, which had the potential to give the new boy's "Boy Band" madness. After all, both N'Sync and Backstreet Boys come from this area, but the brothers are probably due to a weak script. (some may be amateur artists, but some of this is definitely a way to write a script.) Many jokes are too repetitive (they were funny for the first time, but they grow a bit boring). Some "concert" scenes are staged badly (and many of these scenes don't seem to be too bad) I hope this result based on short results, but I think it is best to move to the filmmaker John Figg genres (fast). Comedy is not her strong suit. But it is indisputable that he is certainly one of the best-known filmmakers in the Orlando region (it is just a shame that he is now notorious, not famous). <br /> <br />
