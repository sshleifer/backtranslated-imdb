I think this movie was supposed to be shocking. But the only way it is really shocking is how bad it is shocking ... and just being. It is one and a half hours of torture. Even more for the viewer than movie characters (five girls). Movie. And I (usually) like horror movies. I have no problem with violence in such films. But all the violence in this film does not end there. It's nothing more than that it's just grotesque. It's so flat it even gets boring and really fast. A project for filming with cheap handheld cameras. But (again, it's not) any end. "Blair which", for sure, is an explanation, namely they are their camera looking for a blair witch. There's no other explanation in this movie: "Hey, we wanted it to look at Blair Whitch!" The sound of the film is also something depressing. The girls scream so hysterically that many times you can't say what they say. Also, no effort has been made to do anything better, more sound or more reasonable. House The Worst Ground Hard Stone ... <br /> <br /> My advice: Don't look at it under any circumstances.
