So the woman and I stopped it, despite the fact that both of us threatened to turn it off. Most often the worst part of the film was boredom, there was very little excitement. The act was cruel to the extent that we smiled for some time at worse scenes (such as a church boy). The dead sister used paranormal means to contact her living twin, although she rather sent useful information, trying to frighten her instead. Rather, involve this police - which I am sure his earplugs he found would be with DNA all over them - he rather plans a terrible plan to get the man to cover his sister's accidental death. I call it a terrible plan, because eventually he also allows him to kill what the film then goes black. Bad dialogue, bad performance, bad end.
