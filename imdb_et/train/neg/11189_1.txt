Always enjoy great movies that deal with the super-natural and deep thoughts of the spiritual world. Nonetheless, this film switched my production and direction. Nothing goes deep into what this story has to say; I can say that it was a waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen. Actors, namely: Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, gave a great result in their home country of England, and we have seen him in the Standing TV series. Heath Ledger, played a real evil dude and we looked at him recently in "Brokeback Mountain", '05, giving a great support. Shannyn Sossaman, (Mara Sinclair) did a good job of attracting a priest from a church that was not believed by any faith. Don't waste your time, you're sorry!
