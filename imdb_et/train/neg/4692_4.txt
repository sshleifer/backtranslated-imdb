When I first saw this movie, it was titled TERROR ON A TRAIN and it was the back of the double function. Glenn Ford, an armaments expert, is called to burst a hidden bomb on a train that has a high explosive. Tensions are slow and persistent; and this black and white film lasts only about an hour and twelve minutes. All these years later on television; tension and drama have lost their impact. This is still a good movie when the 50-year standards start. <br /> <br /> With Ford, there are Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham. Victor Maddern is on the map / saboteur.
