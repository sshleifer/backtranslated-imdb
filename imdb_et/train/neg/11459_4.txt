Whale-hunters choose the wrong freaking whale. <br /> <br /> A group of yahale whale exploiters hit the woman and string her up on her tail-fin. The whale's companion sees the whole thing, including the moment when a woman's unborn child slips out and slides on the deck. "Captain Nolan" (Richard Harris) could say that a big man was very crazy when he looked at him, as he said, "Get out of town before the tides." <br /> <br /> This story of revenge is Harris's presence and Bo's beauty, but not much else. It was Bo's first "liberated" film, although his first actor was four years earlier "And Once On Love", which appeared in 1981 in "Fantasies" (directed by John Derek). <br /> <br /> P.S. Today, the date of this review (November 20) is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a good time "whale" ..... get it? ..... whale? ..... hee-hee.
