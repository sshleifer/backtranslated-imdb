Rounding the 1929's "Our Gang" release schedule The "Tough Winter" includes two stories. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, who are alone on the winter day, decide to do some taffe. Little Wheezer sends directions to Mary Ann's radio cooking show. Problem: Wheezer transmits information from different exhibitions and Mary Ann gets to the soap mix! Funny moments appear when the rest of the Gang appears to pull the taffy - and finally get it all over the house. <br /> <br /> Another story about Gang's neighbor / master Stepin Fetchit, and his interaction with Gang. <br /> <br /> "Tough winter", to my knowledge, has never been shown on television, although it is available in home video. This is because of Stepin Fetchit's characterization, which shows a sparse, cunning and slow-moving character. "Our Gang" producer Hal Roach called Fetchit a "qualified comic" and used this "Our Gang" scrap as a pilot for Fetchit's comedy comedy, which never saw the light of day. Obviously, Fetchit's characterization is offensive to many people, explaining why the film has been put on the shelf. <br /> <br /> Although there are some funny moments with both Fetchit and taffy, "Strong Winter" is a tangled and prone tension. When one positive came out of this movie, Hal Roach's studios grew solid and experienced in making calls. The sound of the movie is good and some of the sound effects used are very funny. For this reason, this film partly paved the way for the great 1930-31 "Our Gang" films. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
