I read the back of the box and talked about Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought, "Wonderful! It's great!" I was so wrong. The story was all twisted. Actually, I can't get it yet. It seems to me that all the signs were drinks, smoke (opium?) And having sex. Not that they are not good film quality, but please! Where was the story? I finished the movie myself, and yes, it finally came to an end, but then the movie was almost over. Rent it if you really want to. Just do not trust the back of the box.
