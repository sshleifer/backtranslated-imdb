Wow, this was a very bad movie ... as in other comments, there is no plot on this film, no sign development, they can have some script, but it's hard to tell based on the actual end result. <br /> <br /> Editing this movie was really non-existent, it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or anything to help viewers identify what is really happening. <br /> <br /> All of this is just a low-budget zombie flag that you never thought was bad, bad dialogue, bad things. <br /> <br /> The only thing that stores this movie from 1 or 2 is the gore factor, I think it must be the place where they spent any money they had to justify it . <br /> <br /> If you are not (like me) committed to finding and viewing all zombie flames, don't look at it. Period.
