There's an explosives shop in the Food Mall and Zip somewhere in the movie mall. This is the only place where the title holder <br /> <br /> can buy a plant bomb in the dull finale. <br /> <br /> A fancy city has a new shopping mall built on some land that was <br /> <br /> condemned. A lovely girl (I didn't get her name) gets a job if it's a <br /> <br /> waitress. He lost his boy's fire at a shopping mall. The owner of the HÃ¤mar shopping center hires a fireman responsible for the fire after his first safety. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rob Estes, eons before "Silk Stalkings", is a <br /> <br /> photographer / reporter who is trying to find a story. He grabs himself with a cute girl, <br /> <br /> and their mutual funny friend Pauly Shore and try to find out if Eric is still alive. She lives in a shopping center cellar (?) And drives <br /> <br /> through air passages and attacking different people who annoyed her ex-girlfriend, including the instigator. Eventually, he robs him. <br /> <br /> and the final includes a bomb and all those running <br /> <br /> before the big caboose. Morgan Fairchild goes to the mayor <br /> <br /> ride ... yes, he's the mayor. <br /> <br /> Of course, you probably don't need the whole scheme sketch << br /> <br /> the story is in the title. Somebody named Eric takes revenge <br /> <br /> for people as a mall phantom. It also means that there is no break. We know that Eric is behind it, but we still have to see <br /> <br /> a good and cute girl on the initiative of foolish inquiries. <br /> <br /> See how Fairchild, whom we knew with the buyer <br /> <br /> all over the store, pull the weapon into our heroic dungeon in the middle of a crowded place, but no one says when he drives them and his possible death. The fictional city is huge, but the policeman has ever been called, everyone depends on ordering the security of the mall. <br /> <br /> Eric is hiding from building a mall, but I'm not sure <br /> <br /> where. He seems to be living in the basement, but you think some construction worker would have found him. He has also quite well furnished his love pillow and found some outlets because he has electricity. It may be more convenient than your own apartment! <br /> <br /> Pauly Shore fans, both, take note. He's gonna get out of the guard out of his cell when the camera accumulates. Yes, stop scanning <br /> <br /> Celebrity Skin and Playgirl, this is where you see the sharp <br /> <br /> Pauly's southern black-and-white picture, although there's no one like that. <Br /> <br /> It's just junk and proved positive that I've just rented <br /> <br /> something from a video store to stay in horror. The movie is not Eric's revenge, but the film maker's revenge is stupid enough for me to watch it. Here's my revenge: I don't recommend it. It shows' em! <br /> <br /> It is rated for physical violence, some weapons violence, gore, <br /> <br /> some embarrassment, female nudity, short men's nudity, and some <br /> <br /> sexual content.
