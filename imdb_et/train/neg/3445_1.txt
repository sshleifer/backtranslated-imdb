When a young Kevin gets his dead uncle's boat as a gift, he invites five friends to Catalina on the weekend. During the trip, they drink sweet, sexy and play games, each of which says their biggest fear. Later, Kevin drops offshore, the engine stops and worships and murdered by their greatest internal fear. <br /> <br /> Yesterday my wife, son, daughter, and three more friends on the "Haunted Boat" DVD. Less than 30 minutes of driving time, the group gave up to see this dirty and boring amateur game. Later, I decided to look at the rest of this fragment to see how bad it might be and would have been better to go to bed. The confusing story is terribly cinematic and camera work, showing how to act as an actor and actor, and this film seems to be a bad project for the cinema school. and the pretentious scenario finally shows a ridiculous twist, which is actually a complete confusion that didn't tell me what the story is. Was the girl crazy and drove alone on the boat, imagining the situation with imaginary friends? If that's true, is their friend again The end result of my madness? My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Viagem Para a Morte" ("The Death of the Trip")
