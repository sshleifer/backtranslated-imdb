Modesty is a strong comic. Alexandra Staden, who plays modesty Blaise looks more like an anorectic fashion model. He has neither the moral nor the personality Modesty has in the comic. Modesty would never give a woman advice on how to make more money for more skin. I don't see any similarities between my comics and Modesty and this movie. Its like a mission to an Impossible movie would be about Ethan Hunt locked in a locker high school talking to a janitor about when he went to junior high school and Hunt would have played DJ Qualls (in Road Trip). When you are a modest fan, you won't see a movie that you just get angry with. If you don't know much about renting Modesty comics, the second movie doesn't waste time with that time. I don't understand how Quentin Tarantino puts his name. I'll ask for your DVD rental store tomorrow.
