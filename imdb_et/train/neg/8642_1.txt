I have to say that this is a terrible movie, just because when you see it in the movie guide, it's a documentary. When I looked at it, I started laughing, thinking about myself, is this guy waiting for me to believe it is real? So I had to look at it and now I see it is a movie, but now that it's not a documentary, it's now a bad film. So, yes, it's pretty bad. I didn't really finish it. I had to turn it off. I am a NYC policeman and I felt that someone was trying to mislead people to think that it was a documentary, the purpose of which was to make money for me and my co-workers from a terrible day. So, I took it a little personal. Maybe I was blinded by it and it's not as bad as I personally think it is. Everyone has their own opinion.
