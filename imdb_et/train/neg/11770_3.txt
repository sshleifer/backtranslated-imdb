"P" (or Club-P) should really be called "L". Every festival is disappointing, and that's what can't live with its great mortgage: "Thai lesbians are fighting monsters." Rather, it is a story of a Khmer girl who has taught her a little sorceress with some odd (but specific) rules: "do not walk under the laundry area," "do not eat the flesh," and "Do not accept money for your power." Well, I guess what the people, the girl are going to Bangkok to raise money as a "bar-girl" and manage to break all the rules the grandmother taught, which later releases the evil spirit that comfortably kills the "foreign johns" who pay for her. can't even be released from Thailand because it's a controversial topic, most American audiences find this horror horror cross "Showgirls" and "Interview with Vampire" according to Walt Disney's instructions. <br /> <br /> If not for some scene in the case of a significant amount of blood, MPAA may be able to estimate it only for pre-teens, literally television for adult fare, although you should wait for at least sex, given that the film is brothel and one of the actors is a real life Thai porn star. <br /> <br /> As for the lesbian corner, there is one short smooch and a couple "I love you" to prove that the two main stars are a pair (brother) and the P-bar must be the only exotic dance club i on a planet where girls keep their sarongs and make carnival tricks (there is a sword player who cuts cucumbers out of the girls' mouths ... ooh, phalic pictures). br /> <br /> NO nudity, NOT a real monster (if you don't read the five-foot-height Thai spirit with yellow eyes), and under no circumstances should adults ever pay to see such foolishness as a DVD. You have been warned!
