When a writer / director reads it (and I think you are, because you should now be on the job), I have to tell you - I've seen some bad movies in my time, but it gets the difference with the worst assumption you've ever heard. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS - Nothing happens! <br /> <br /> A complete waste of time. Finally, I laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> NOTE - (if the whole movie was in his coma, this scene, where he sleeps with that man, means that someone rapes him when he was dropped?) <br /> <br / > Use garbage.
