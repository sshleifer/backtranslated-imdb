Just stopped watching, I can't say I was impressive. <br /> <br /> It starts with a pretty good, visual and atmospheric atmosphere that makes you feel like this type of movie. But it all ends when the first lord of the Lord appears. Not only do they know them from the band to the Lord, but they are seriously paralyzed in the film. Doomsday monsters with leather jackets and flights are both 80's. <br /> <br /> As far as the story is concerned, it begins with similar horror films, people in hell. But there is no clear story of why and what is happening. The viewer is thrown on some lines for possible reasons, but the lines will never match and will not reach anything other than confusion. <br /> <br /> All the money spent with this movie, an intriguing start and some good results, I thought someone would have taken care of the product. I don't know if the lord made this movie just to prove that their show costumes can be scary (except for them). <br /> <br /> So the film gets visual, I think the money had to go somewhere. The rest, however, is the rock band's embarrassing attempt to make their staged monster aliases more frightening.
