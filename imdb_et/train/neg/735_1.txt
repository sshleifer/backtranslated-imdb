Five-year-old Michael, with the death of his mother, sees his serial killer father "Highwayman", who later suicides. "20 Years Later" grew by Mike (Gordon Currie, PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5), inviting seven of his friends to his separated grandparents, who are "making their fears" for the Halloween night costume party. Morty, a life-sized wooden doll kept by an Indian handyman in the attic, becomes a dead father's spirit and kills them with his phobias. The characters are thrown out of the window, drowned in the toilet, fed by the rats, blown up, etc. Morty morphizes father and tree, walks around and makes foolish fists. After finding a girl that is crushed and stuffed with a cardboard box, the characters stay in the house, are joyful, joking and having sex. <br /> <br /> Morty's design is good and Betsy Palmer (Ms. Voorhees since the original Friday 13) is surprisingly admirable as grandmother, but this thing is even nonsensical and confusing than the original and is full of false fears, bad behavior, brain-dead signs, recurrent backlash and annoying distorted camera operation. Plus, there are only two minorities (Indian and semi-black girls) who die. BLAH!
