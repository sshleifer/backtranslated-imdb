First, it's not a movie "thriller". Nor is it "thrilling, tense". It may have been based on the script, but the slow pace of the direction makes it difficult to get in. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is very interesting and brilliant. Unfortunately, we only get the feeling of * being brilliant after the picture finishes. It leaves us with more than two hours long sequences where music is played over those chipped with some scenes that don't capture the viewer, and "cunning vixen" scenes that inject a little clearer intelligence. <br /> <br /> I wish it was a fast paced thriller that the cell promised. It would have been a great movie. Instead, Spike Lee made it through.
