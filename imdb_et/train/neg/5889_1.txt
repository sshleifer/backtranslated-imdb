First of all, I firmly believe that Norwegian films are constantly improving. The 70's and 80's annoying emotional films started off with some humor in the films of this place. Imagine ... Actual comedies were made! The movies had actually started to be entertaining and funny, as opposed to long, dark, depressing and boring. <br /> <br /> In the 90s and 00s, the new generation of filmmakers have made a number of really great movies. After the movie, the film was praised by critics and played a lot of money. It became the norm! <br /> <br /> Then United ... <br /> <br /> MINOR SPOILERS * It's not just funny. Not once. Never. But the thing is ... We think it's funny. Because we're used to being funny with Norwegian movies. Especially with some funny comedy that is really funny. But .. They don't say or do anything funny! Where is humor? Show me humor! Is it an uncomfortable secretary, played by Harald Eia? Is this a very ridiculously unrealistic football coach? Does Arne Scheie comment? The film is not just funny. <br /> <br /> But this is not my main concern for United. This is precisely the predictability. (And here I am afraid that Norwegian comedies have stopped because I have seen it in many other films.) All the time, if you just know it ends well. All the characters are exactly as they are presented at the beginning of the movie, and everyone finally gets what they deserve. No surprise at all! <br /> <br /> All in all, I can say that I was feeling bad after seeing the movie. It was one movie that made me realize that we probably need new blood in Norwegian film making ... again! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/6
