First of all, I have to say that I loved the Animal Breeding book. I read it with my 9th grade and it was great. We also decided that watching the movie would be helpful. The film was so disappointing to me. The movie cuts out some characters and leaves a lot of key points in the book. It goes a long way and does not explain anything in detail. If someone looked at this movie without first reading the book, they would be confused. The most disappointing film for me was the end. The book ended with the most powerful and movie change! It was supposed to be pigs and men in an ally and sort of "melting" together, but instead the feel of the film seemed to be animal rebels against the pigs. All in all, I do not believe that this film hit the real meaning that Orwell had in his book.
