And that's the only reason I have this DVD. Now, I haven't seen the first Nemesis movie, but I checked this and I'm saying here: What? Why? Because in the first movie Alex was a man. But then the first one was created, so maybe that Alex is brand new and the scientist happened to Alex's wife at that time. Who knows, at least it wasn't dealt with in the film in any way. <br /> <br /> Here's a quick plot summary: Alex, still a child (or how you'll ever want it to be, is fleeing your mother in the future, using a special time interval and reaching the 80s in Africa. Alex (Sue Price) grows up with African tribe, then kills the cyber in the future and Alex then runs and hides and eventually kills the cyber. So there is the acquaintance familiar, isn't it? <br /> <br /> The Terminator is not the only movie that is ripped here, Predator shares his fair share and I think the first Fly movie, Vincent Price one, will become a special candidate to provide a solid basis for building up the head of cyber-children. okay, the movie was a fairly common low-budget flick, but it had no bad special effects in the mid-1990s, it would have been forever for the 80's. The biggest problem is the plot. Things just happen and the viewer is hardly interested. 2 is not a crappiest cinema what I've had the pleasure (?) to watch, but it goes near the fuck. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying anything about the action, because let's face it here: Did anyone expect to see Oscar-worthy performances here? Oh well ... at least I found Sue Price from this amazing warrior heat. <br /> <br /> "Real" movie rating: 2/10 There are not many pros over what's quality. And, despite the very basic plot, the film that it does is very worthless. <br /> <br /> Camp movie rating: 4/10 I occasionally laughed at the movie's wretchedness, so it has little essence.
