Okay, so I went to that movie that didn't really expect me to think that friction is similar to Fast and Furious. Some nice cars with some nice girls from some decent plot. Unfortunately, I have to say that this was probably the worst film I saw this year. Don't do it wrong if the cars were nice and the girls were fine, but the way they put together the movie was just plain. The story has never been poured on you, and the film just seemed to be. So this movie wasn't the worst thing, but if you're looking for a movie to go this weekend, I'd pass it on now.
