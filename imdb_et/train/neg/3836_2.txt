One of the few comments that didn't see the first movie, I found it to be a very disappointing film. <br /> <br /> Yes, it has funny uncomfortable humor if you can (highly) bear morally suspicious assumptions. But it fails in important areas. <br /> <br /> Gordon Sinclair's generous friend is a thin and pointless line that may or may not have come into contact with a conspiracy to deliver dangerous electronics to third countries. free on computers ... or not. Unclear, prolonged and unclear. The absence of any significant end is so terrible and what is present is pompous and totally illogical. The movie is halfway through. <br /> <br /> Suspending belief is extremely difficult as a very attractive female teacher (Maria Doyle Kennedy) can pull out the unimpressive character of Gordon Sinclair, especially when she pulls out her prepayments. It's ridiculous. It worsens later in the film when it reaches its romantic ambitions, throws it away for some ideals, relying on very little evidence of ambiguous value. <br /> <br /> Not many movies leave me deceived, but I felt my time was stolen.
