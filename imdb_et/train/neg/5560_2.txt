It seems to work right, Dolph Lundgren is a bad guy in every movie! I don't know if this is the fact that the story is full of holes or that Dolph is such a bad actor. There's no spoiler here, it looks like he's stuck in the timing and timing of this movie. I think it is a miracle that some of these projects find venture capital to reach and reach the theater.
