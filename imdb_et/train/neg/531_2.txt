With such a cast list I expected better. Venessa Redgrave spent most of her movie in bed. The best actors in the world cannot do anything very interesting if their action is limited to lying down and falling asleep. The plot summary says that the daughters have a secret when their mother is nearer to death. The thing is that he doesn't say anything to his daughters except secret counseling to be happy. All film relationships are underdeveloped. I also thought it was unnecessary to reciprocate past and present. It seemed that the idea was stolen from the Da Vinci Code Book, which used the device to increase the distance, or from a laptop, where they used the device to create the endless romance of the main characters. In either case, it was a cheap device in the movie because it didn't work. It was a way to catch a movie that has nothing. I was wondering why good movies can't be written for women. It was really disappointing.
