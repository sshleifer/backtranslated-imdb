Watching it recently, I found it warm from the heart to see how they really tried to screen the book, even if the costume budget and hammer dogs were inevitable. By any objective measure, it was a disaster, but I found it easy to imagine how good the Lord of the Rings would be if someone had to do one sincerely - and with money to use the most talented artists and script writers. Unfortunately, Jackson cannot make it possible for a long time. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I got the impression that with some kind of budget, this story can't just be filled up. Fantasy offers just so many ways to make an interesting movie. There were many moments in this film that were potentially more interesting than the way Peter Jackson did it, although you must of course always use your imagination for poor performance. Just as they tried to show the world of wraith from Frodo's point of view. Or as Galadriel showed Sam to what is happening on the other side of the house. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really appreciated in this version - quiet moments. There were moments when the dialogue was spoken against falling back without background music. Compare this to Jackson's grandiose neck and intrusive score, which seemed to emphasize how each scene was the most terrible and powerful scene we ever watched. Jackson's films were full of importance, quieter and much more modest. <br /> <br /> Jackson put it at a cost of more than $ 270 million in production, at least $ 90 million more for marketing - a huge tax increase from the NZ government and huge savings on filming in NZ, not the US. Despite the marketing requirements, the willingness to be faithful was never there. It is well documented. Philippa Boyens said in the interview as much as he said he did not want to read the books deliberately before writing the script. Jackson also noted that they originally intended to make the fantasy film "ring" to the master of the rings, and that what he really wanted was a king's return because he had many battles, but not character. . <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this movie tried to be true. Of course, there were a lot of things wrong, the operation was terrible and pretty much sunk and the pace was too fast. Of course, they cut a lot and adapted other scenes and they deserve credit for that. Although Jackson added a lot of action plans that did not offer the plot's purpose, Bakshi's book scenes did nothing to develop the plot. In the beginning, there is a curious similarity between Jackson and Bakshi's film structure - both of which tend to circumvent the original books - although, of course, it may be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> It wasn't a good movie, but the potential was there. Bakshi said in an interview with the onion AV club that only animation could make the master of the circles in justice. His version was not working, but he may have been correct.
