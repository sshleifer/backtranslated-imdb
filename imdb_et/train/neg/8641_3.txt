Grand Central Murder (1942) Dir: S. Sylvan Simon Production: MGM <br /> <br /> This mediocre B-mystery was one of five films that appeared in 1942 as director with Simon. He would certainly have been able to match another Red Skelton movie or two with his schedule. Anyway, Grand Central Murder is the shameless breaking of Thin Man's films, subtracting the wisdom, charm and chemistry of the leaders. We are being processed on paper as a thin graph that can barely support your 73 minutes, poor performance and tired gags. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin and Virginia Gray play Nicki and Nora Charme, Rocky and Butch Custer. She is PI and she is her husband and sleeping partner. They engage in "humorous" torture with each other. Look? It is already completely different. Heflin is the only one who cites larger and better things, although he is real to be a jerk. Virginia Gray was in another Thin Man, but again let me emphasize that this film is not something that one, sir. And just when we start thinking that this movie is nothing more than another movie (say, THIN MAN), as we really want, Sam Levene opens up as a leading detective who is kind of dark and deliberately wants Van Heflin direct all important leaders. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Quickly, "murder" is a bitchy schemer What King, who loves to trade rich men, until he finds it even richer. He has been playing by Patricia Dane, like the C version of Hedy Lamarri, until she opens her mouth and becomes F. There's a social type, harsh talk by dames, a thug, a former lover and a shady theater (Tom Conway, with the unlikely character of Frankie Ciro here). Roman Bohnen plays a nervous, nervous type, which I believe he has done before. Millard Mitchell plays an idiot policeman who is unable to think about the ass he is waiting for him when the case goes together (this is right, Millard Mitchell, swordsman). Finally, in a totally attacking storytelling method that we have never seen before, all suspects are gathered in one place where they talk to the detective about their stories (as setbacks), as Rocky takes mental remarks until the ultimately convicted person is forced to dramatically destroy the confession. <br /> <br /> In addition to the real picture that is bad, I thought naively that there might be a few frames from the actual 1942s. Central, but unfortunately not. At first, there is only one very short picture. Thank you, Grand Central Murder. In conclusion, it is a bit stubborn, but Heflin was fine. <br /> <br /> * Â½ of four
