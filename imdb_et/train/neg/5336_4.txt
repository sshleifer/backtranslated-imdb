This movie is not very good. In fact, this is the worst Elvis movie I've ever seen. It's a very small plot, mostly partying, drinking beer and fighting. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are wasted. I don't know why they did this movie. You could say that Elvis is wasted, he's a lot, much better "Follow this dream."
