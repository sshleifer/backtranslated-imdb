The film was completely misleading and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was the heart of Joeseph Conrad's darkness, the river's replacement path, and the boat becomes Jeep, and Walter Kurtz is Osama. <br /> <br /> The statements on the outside of the DVD box were clearly fraudulent to put this journalist dead and to present it in fact <br /> <br /> while some Muslims are supporting the US September 11 attacks on Muslims treatment worldwide. <br /> <br /> I warned the video store that the movie should be removed from its documentary and placed in the war-drama area for almost fictitious accounts of real events.
