One page and newspaper campaigns were, as they often did, recommended a lot more courageous and violent pieces that appeared on the drives screen. Claude Brook is actually an American from Claudio Brook who worked for years in the film. It's hard to find it anymore; I would like to see it again to compare it with other international horrors of the day, but don't remember a particularly impressive road when. It may have been a chopped version that made it to US theaters and videos. But oh, this page is still a gem of my fear collection.
