I saw this movie as a whole in the 1960s and 70s, yes, it is tough and may be a precursor to the series "Faces of Death" in the 80s and 90s. Given the "driver training" situation these days, it must be seen as a preparation for driving every vehicle. If you see a violent death in all your gore & horror, you will definitely (if you have any sensitivity at all) become more confident about the responsibilities required for safe driving, which one moment can do with meaningless or inattentive wheel. I worked at Bell Telephone in the 1970s and 80s and at one point was assigned to a safety class. I found the library of this movie company, I showed it in the session, many people were physically sick and had to leave the room! Incredibly, most of them later said "I didn't know that a car accident could be so terrible!" This film and the second, "RED ASPHALT", is definitely the reality in the most graphical form. I will never forget it, I just wish I had found a copy when my kids went to the high school "leader"!
