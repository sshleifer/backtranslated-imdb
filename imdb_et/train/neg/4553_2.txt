I read the book Celestine Prophecy and waited to see the movie. Report that the movie is based on the book loosely. Many of the most interesting points in the book don't even come out in the movie. This is the best film B. Many events, characters, how the character interacts and meets in the book are simply changing or not. The flow of events, which is very smooth in the book, is inconvenient and viewed as a child. Character development is very bad. Character personalities are different from those in the book. The direction is similar to the "B" horror. I understand that it takes six hours for a movie to play everything in the book, but they play a base that has missed many points. The casting was very good.
