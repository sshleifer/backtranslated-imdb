I watch a lot of bad movies, a lot !!!!!! It's really a hobby. Almost every Saturday nite group of friends and I get together and watch the trash around the world. Turkish super hero movies, vampire pieces from Brazil, Italian gorilla transplant films, Kevin Costner movies, ANYTHING (except perhaps Raising Helen), but Ihave never seen a WORST movie as THEODORE REX. Never. And it's not even badly bad for Ed Wood in a certain way - it just sucks. Now this film was in Hollywood at the time it was made, because Whoopi took off his gloves and made it clear to the press and other listeners that he was looking for this country = he was trying to get out of his contract, whined, he moaned, but still his fat butt cast into it Leather futuristic futuristic police art that is terribly visible. And you see how he takes when he takes, - does everything, but looks for the camera for his agent so he can shout. There are about three facial expressions in the dinosaur and the script is so terrible that the third class can do a better job than promising cookies.
