It's a movie about animal cruelty. In the shadow of the Marathon race, we see how extreme animal abuses are depicted, including the death of a literally horse. The man who did this is his conscience by the spiritually purified flame of the burial / burning of the horse, which of course is dead, tortured. It's one of the sick and sickest movies I've ever seen. Like Gene Hackman and James Coburn on the finish line of their DYING animals, we should admire their spirit to end the race. I would like to put manufacturers and directors into the marathon competition; I decide when they are ready, probably about 20 minutes after breathing is complete.
