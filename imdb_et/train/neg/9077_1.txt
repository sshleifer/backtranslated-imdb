If you like movies like American Pie, Road Trip & Van Wilder; Avoid this cinematic refusal at all costs. It is a longing, wasteful waste of resources that should never be discussed aloud; much less actually saved and sold to unsuspecting consumers. Just the worst movie I've seen in the last 18 months; this is bad bad throughout the 86 minute period. Had it been much longer, I wouldn't have been able to write this review without using contempt. Think of Yourself Alert!
