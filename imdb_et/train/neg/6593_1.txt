Even if it were remotely funny, this form of film waxing would still be daunting. Just stop digging the pups and reactivating "Weekend Bernie's"? but just what? producer Larry Harmon and frickin '' Ernest '' film director use copyright as an excuse for all Stan and Ollie's heritage. Gailard Sartain makes a fair Ollie impersonation, but Bronson Pinchot is not ranked 10th in Stan's Locals competition; even if they were both on the scene, it wouldn't be so unlikely. The less you say about the surrounding disaster, the better. Makes "utopia" like a dignified swan song.
