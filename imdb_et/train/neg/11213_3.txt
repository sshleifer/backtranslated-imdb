OK ... I'm watching a lot of bad movies. I'm proud of that. Many times there are some gems in B-class bombs. But this movie is one of the worst things I looked at. I like a good horror movie ... but one that has a graph and mobility. Opening scenes seemed pretty good. Decent music and images. Then it goes down the hill. One of the main characters is disabled (calling in the ears as Tinnitus). Now, in turn, it threatens to reveal its secret. They paid too much attention to this movie. So, what he does in his ears and accidentally left the ear plug somewhere he shouldn't have. There is no need to bring it forward. So this guy interacts with this girl and in the motel where he falls and hits his headboard. So, deciding that everyone knows their thing, he decides to appeal to the body. Now his twin sister tries to find out where she is and what happened to her. Well after he saw his sister again and again (like a zombie like a ghost) and even pointing directly to the location of the body, he finally finds. Now the body has recovered and is trying to deal with one and the only suspicion that killed him. The bad thing is that he didn't have much plan. Only when you pretend to be your twin and met a boy, where your body was dumped. The idiot didn't even believe he killed him. So everything comes out there and even if he had a gun .... somehow he managed to strangle himself. Thus, the last scenes of the film are the "spirits" of the outflow of his and his twin. So you want to tell me in this movie that a bad boy wins. And not one, but two innocent people die. <br /> <br /> A good movie about the film: Images <br /> <br /> The bad things about the movie: The sound effects of music are long and drawn to the low quality of the plot. some not all participants are active
