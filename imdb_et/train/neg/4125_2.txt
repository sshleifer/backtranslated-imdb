Holy shit! What a terrible, terrible Spanish thriller! I've been to it for about four years and finally I started it the second night. I was watching an hour before bedtime. I was pretty intrigued. I ended it last night and couldn't believe where I stopped it at night. Literally, I stopped this second before the film went downhill. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was quite curious and curious about where this mystery goes, but it ended as soon as Simon took the pack to the bar. I picked up when he opened a package to expose a laser gun and then played a "dangerous" laser game. Whew! Then it is a great revelation that the whole thing is a terrorist attack played by game games. IF YOU! You can say that Spanish industry was definitely behind the leader Mateo Gil (co-author of Amenabar's two big previous hits). Have a great score and great photography. But this scenario is stupid. How someone sat straight in the last 40 minutes is farther away from me.
