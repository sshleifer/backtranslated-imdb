The writer found the story to be a fairly good idea, but many mistakes in the execution made the film so far away that it almost became invisible. At best, key elements, such as character development, were slipped. Contradictions also increased their ugly head. Great Country House in the Countryside of Ireland? Signs that just "appear" in the gardens during the storm night (at very convenient times, could I add)? All in all, it wasn't "bad." I rated it 4, based mainly on Alison Elliott's story and talents.
