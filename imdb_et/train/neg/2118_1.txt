What can I say about the seven pounds ... I looked at a flight from Seattle to Tokyo and this flight was long and the boring movie didn't help. Ben Smith, a Will Smith character, is almost unlikely even after he has finished his redemption. The film's two hours plus running time wastes most of the time on the screen with random garbage that simply draws the plot as slowly as possible. Protecting the film, Rosario Dawson's character adds a little life to the film, though not much. I don't understand how someone could cry during this movie, if all I wanted was to turn it off. Will Smith also kills himself at the end of the jellyfish, proving that killing himself with a jellyfish is the stupid way to die.
