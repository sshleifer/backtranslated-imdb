I was also deceived on the packaging. I also fell on the packaging and the DVD case, which claims to be "exhausted fans, because every copy was pulled out of the shelf". Although it was cheap ($ 6.99), it wasn't all worth it - not the fear and the very limited gore. The end result was a lot of fun and didn't give him the punch he needed. I don't even know how it became "Video Nasty" when it comes to it. The story is shrinking, the characters are obvious amateur actors ... it doesn't match the promise. The DVD bonus feature ("interview") is very strange because the director seems inconsistent and not all there. Leading actors speak like Shakespeare's production. It's a big laugh.
