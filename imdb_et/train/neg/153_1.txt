"Spielberg loves the morning smell. But the sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty? No one should love it." - Lucius Shepard <br /> <br /> "The Color Purple" takes place at Deep South in the early 1900s and tells the story of Celie and Nettie, two African-American sisters. The film opens when girls play with purple flowers, an idyllic shelter that is immediately broken with the look of their father. This motive? the innocence was cut off by men? it passes through the entire film. <br /> <br /> The film then starts a series of short sequences. Celie reveals that her father has been twice impregnated, gives birth to a dirty barn, has taken her newborn baby and is forced to marry a local sister, Albert Johnson, a violent oaf that rape her repeatedly, forcing her to eat, clean and care for her children. <br /> <br /> All of these terrible scenes are scarred with screens and are surrounded by fine dust cinematic moments, hostile symphonic scores, inappropriate comedy, and overflowing camera work. The cumulative effect is similar to combining Disney comics and a rape film whose aesthetic style caused Stanley Kubrick's comment that "The Color Purple" made him so angry that he had to turn it off after ten minutes. Ten minutes? It took a long time. <br /> <br /> It is often said that it deals with "racism", "sexism" and "black culture", but that is not true. Alice Walker, the author of the novel based on this film, claims to be bisexual, but in fact it is lesbian lesbian. His book is a lesbian fantasy, a story of female liberation and self-knowledge that paints men into violent brides who worship women. For Walker, the only way out of this maze is to link women to some sort of lesbian utopia, black sister and women's independence. <br /> <br /> The Spielberg movie, however, hangs on Walker's story through comforting American mythologies. This is a film in which the redemptive power of Christianity exceeds the natural cruelty of men. The film, in which Albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations, places the misplaced comedy moments so that he looks like a bumblebee stupid. The film, in which all characters are derived from racist minstrel exhibitions, is cast consisting of tiny men (always radiating with ghostly smiles and toothy-stories), stereotypical fatty mammoths, jazz bands and gospel choirs. <br /> <br /> This is a movie where black people are naturally childish, easily and happily accepting their social conditions. The film, where black people are too relatives, is dominated by violent passions that dominate the sensual senses. A film where poverty and class issues are completely invisible (Albert lives in a big house) and black men are completely wrong. It's not the old southern part, it's the old south that is derived from "Gone With The Wind", MGM Muscals, "South of the South", Warner Cartoons, "Hallahuha!" forbidden Disney movies. In other words, it is the southern part seen by a child raised on a television set in the 1950s. All of this is so comic, so racist, that it reduces these people to one-dimensional ethnic stereotypes, so the black writer Ishmael Reed probably compared it with the Nazi conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Of course, in a typical Spielberg fashion, the film ends with an improvement in family ties. This reconciliation took place in Walker's novel, but Spielberg goes further by creating each character with his relatives. <br /> <br /> In addition to Walker's hate letter to black men and Spielberg's strange charismatic black life, nothing about black communities is shown. We only have vague ideas about how some of these characters live and do not see how they interact with others in their community. Instead, the Spielberg camera desperately jumps in the battle for our attention (one of Celie's kitchen contrasts seems to be part of the film "Home alone"), every emotion is played, the director never stops looking at something or just a little life. Connect it with Quincy Jones' ridiculously "white" music and you have one of the strangest movies in cinema history: an angry feminist track filmed in a white Jewish Disney and Griffith style, appreciated by a black man trying to emulate John. White characters are also a problem. Think about it: the men of this film do not make each other tough or women, because they are a racist society that reduces their masculinity. No, they are cruel in nature. And women who are quiet like Celie or rebellious and harsh like her sister will survive and survive only because men are too stupid to destroy them. A better film would not only focus on the oppression of women, as is the case with oppressed people, but would have shown that social abuse has led to the abuse of the spouse, that enslaved black women are forced to do the same tasks as their male counterparts (having still fulfilled traditional female roles) and that African-American domestic violence is mainly due to economic factors, women who cannot support themselves and their children alone. <br /> <br /> And so there is a hidden ideology work here. At the end of the movie, one sign goes on to say that because he did not respect his wife, he severely stopped beating and white prisoners. This means that the blacks must return to their African roots to restore their dignity and that their fault is that the white crush them unfairly. ie - respect each other in your poor minority community and you do not run against the dominant white culture. <br /> <br /> 3/10 - Sex and lesbians, unsuitable musical numbers, innumerable sequences loaded with alien visual pizzes, awkward comic book action, empathic musical characters, and wildly hypothetical emotion, all contribute to rendering. Colorful purple "worthless.
