Just bought this movie for two bucks on VHS, did I waste my money! Hey, I dig Adam's Batman west and Tina's Giligan Island Louise, but hello! This third-rate production is the transformation of ten other biker films; Crazy Cyclists Psychic Ride Hick City, beat everyone and everything, and then the man hitting a scary hero. Adam West sees a part as a hero, but he's gone, and his Batman uniform. Sorry, just not the same. Tina L. looks really nervous and scared the whole show, but at least we know what happened to "Ginger" when she was rescued from the island ... LOL! Cyclists are a dirty group, known to have acted again or at least not. Hell Riders are on Hell!
