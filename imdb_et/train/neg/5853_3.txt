IMMORTALISER was interesting. It certainly didn't kill me for a year and a half, but it didn't impress me either. A group of children were kidnapped by alley with muscle-head mutants (a scene with the least convincing head-breaking sound effect) and brought to the forefront of fantasy. Here, the divine and his team, with their brain training, are their rich old patients so they can get young bodies again. Hey, it was quietly rebuilt with a big budget a few years later than FREEJACK! Who knew that if you move the old person's brain into another body, their new voice sounds just like their old voice? With all the jargon talks and the use of glowing green serum, you can almost see visions from BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR dances in the heads of manufacturers. But literally it doesn't have to literally pull it out. I've never understood why, if someone makes a small budget horror movie, they won't pack it on the edge of the frame. The actor is equally dreadful, the only good result from Clarke Lindsley as dr. He has a nice laugh. The only other note about IMMORTALIZER is that there are a lot of old people doing their tricks. Seriously, most of the cast takes some serious bumps from old people.
