Let me say that I watched this video watching Saw and after Bleed, Saw looked like the biggest nightmare of all time, though I thought it was just pretty good. Bleeding is pretty bad. The best part is to see the female nude. Gore is very fake and straightforward. It has funny parts, but it's extremely predictable, and I didn't want to miss that terrible end. If I could, I'd deny these actors and actors because the only reason is that Debbie Rochon (Maddy) has had over a hundred other videos and I've seen two other members in equally or inferior movies. They should not continue this madness.
