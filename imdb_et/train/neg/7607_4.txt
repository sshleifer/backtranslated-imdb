When a local sheriff is killed, his wife takes over and has decided to clean the city. But not all in the city are happy with what he does. When a sheriff subscribes to a city break, a local salon owner (including a woman) hires a killer to take care of the sheriff. The owner of the cabin does not know that the sheriff and the killer fall in love. <br /> <br /> - Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a pretty interesting concept and combine it with a bad performance. Here's a good movie somewhere trying to get out. Gunslinger would have had an interesting look at the role of women in the old western part, with more likely hands or more budget. As it is, the Gunslinger movie is a sloppy mess. <br /> <br /> - There are so many things in the movie that are wrong: a support game that does not have the ability to function, inclined and unnatural, and sets it to look like kits. But the biggest culprit is editing. I was surprised how many times the scene started with the actors (and the horses on this issue) who apparently expect Corman to hear "Action". The best is a scene where two horse riders stand next to the building. Maybe suddenly they come and come around the racing around as they had been driving for several miles. Or take an example of people who seem to see transportation around the city. We see that a person enters the building and another later city will start to install his horse. <br /> <br /> - It's not like Corman had some decent players. Although none of them were big stars, Beverly Garland, John Ireland and Allison Hayes were able to perform well. But Gunslinger doesn't give them much work. <br /> <br /> - I've seen both MST3K and non-MST3K versions of the movie. I strongly recommend that you go to the MST3K route.
