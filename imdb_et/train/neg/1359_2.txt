Well cast is wasted when it is slower than molasses and casual comedy. Peter Ustinov here is trying to bring something to life, but the result is a boring core that does not let all the right shocks that would have made it traceable. Regardless of whether there are favorable comments here, this movie is terrible. Poorly directed. Bad edited. Bad worked. Bad written. You have to sit through one hundred movies to meet one of those bad guys. <br /> <br /> The perplexing and astonishingly disintegrating plot touches Ustinov, who connects his way to an American insurance company to hack his computer and force millions of pounds. How he does this is not a fool and credibility (he learns his computer skills seemingly overnight, reading some brochures, and hitting a computer expert Robert Morley in South America and stealing his identity). <br /> <br /> Side Primer, Ustinov's Romans, loner Maggie Smith, who just happens to get into an apartment in his building. He gets to share scenes that have a sexual undercut with Bob Newhart, which doesn't go anywhere, while Ustinov goes into a little graft and tries to keep one step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden. Then he marries Smith and they travel to Brazil, which has become the main finale of almost every British comedy comedy, as (Nuns rolling? Fish called Wanda?). Finally, I thought I had to be really out of my hanger to pull it out of such a turn. Even Cesar Romero did not help. One of the most uncomfortable, badly drawn comedies I've ever seen, and definitely the worst capric. Don't waste your time. If you love it, you need to see better movies.
