It has been considered fashionable to emphasize every social evil as a result of patriarchy and male domination, but this illogical "logic" can be moral. But the story and theme of the film does not include the gray area and the woman who should be called the film antagonist is "the story" stupid. Under no circumstances can he justify it. The sexuality of women in this case is simply a leap and has nothing to do with reality. This is the betrayal of the supreme variety. The man spent his resources and time wasting the offspring of the other man. First of all, the weakest arguments raised by the three "liberated" female characters are pathetic. The woman's sexual needs are not an excuse for adultery and constantly betray her husband and worse, there are no other children. So, in essence, his life is wasted. In some societies where justice still prevails, such situations are unfair.
