I could barely break it or just turn it off, but I decided to exclude it, if only for the reason that might happen. It is the work of a writer / producer / director / specialty fxi, Kenneth Herts, who wants to make ecological damage to making a monster movie. That's what he wanted anyway. It turns out that this is a lot of action, either a little hammy or just everyday, and without much merit, and scenes that seem to be repetitive as a monster of rivers (oh and luck, a woman just happens) be naked in it ... DISAPPEARANCES!) <br /> <br /> It's just a pointless thing, but I think it's not too damaging; it is not at least unpleasant at least once or twice we get a semi-interesting look at the Brazilian "culture" (which is the father walking through the city with its cattle or other pieces that are "hey, that's not American!"). But any hope that the director was casting Mitchum or Carradine is the best for the pedestrian and in the worst, embarrassing and banal dialogue. It does not help that when we finally start looking at the monster and when the "action" happens, it is also stupidly staged and just buggy. Normally, I would be sorry for a filmmaker who had many problems getting a specific picture - in this case, it took a better part in the mid-1970s, but Monstroid or Monster or whatever it is called ... nah. <Br /> <br /> If you get Blue Sunshine with this dual Elvira DVD (poor transfer quality), be sure to skip it. Of course, if you are not Elvira dead and unable to hear you, to hear his gentle comment; personally I get Joel or Mike Nelson with Mystery Science Theater robots in this roasted turkey.
