This movie is one of my favorites. It's not really good, but it's a good laugh. Dialogue can become incredibly ridiculous and poorly functioning (eg "Manji, can we ask some questions?" "Of course." "We think you can help us with the answers.") All the struggles are more or less surreal. Be sure to watch Brock, the main character who has attacked the white boy. He has only two lines, but he is one of the best men in the movie!
