DO NOT EXCLUDE THIS EXISTING QUESTION. I have wasted time and money on it and have pretty much **. <br /> <br /> Actress is comparable to high school games. The script is shocking. No plot. Twenty minutes after the end (which I believe must be paid for), I have headaches from all of the crawling, weeping, and witty girls. <br /> <br /> Most of the violence is (rare film offered today, not graphically depicted, but I found such indignant irritating signs that I wanted to see them, and indeed every single person who participated in it , die in the most terrible ways. <br /> <br /> I will spend another ten minutes of my life saving you from a very bad 100 minutes.
