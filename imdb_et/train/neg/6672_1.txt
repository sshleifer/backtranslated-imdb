I am 47 years old and have spent so much of my life as a fan of horror and sci-fi movies. Whether they are quiet, black and white, no budgets or big budgets, there are very few of them that I find nothing to please. That means I give this movie a good gore and creature effect, but that's it. This is a situation that affects the story. The truth is that we live in a time when there is very little left to see what has not been seen in the horror film. For this, any movie must have a good and original story for real entertainment. A good story can go beyond bad effects and bad performance, but a bad story with good effect and good effect is still a bad film. This film does not even have good functioning, but good effect. So, if you can't just go gore, give it up.
