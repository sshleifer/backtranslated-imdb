This movie made me feel like I had some important scenes from the very beginning. There were continuity bugs and plots that stopped as sharp as they started. I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg & Danny Glover, and Danny Glovers has always trusted and respected his role in the selection, such as the Grand Canyon. I just couldn't finish this movie after what seemed like an eternity, but it was probably just over an hour; we had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing about the characters that would make you empathic or sympathetic, there were no emotional clues to this movie, and their past clips were poorly edited, confusing, and unnecessary. What could have been a great idea for a movie, even as a drama and not a comedy (although I think the comedy in this situation would have been better because I love to look at white people and start acting like a perfect idiot, laughs at me) changed my $ 1 credit in the video store waste.
