The brides die on the altar and their bodies disappear. Everybody is worried, but no one seems to be able to find out why and how it happens, nor can they prevent it. Bear me. Bela Lugosi is responsible for this, because she separates these young women from the spinal fluid to carry her old wife and keep her alive. Continue with me. Finally, the authorities explain that somebody has to design deaths and disappearances, but of course, they cannot guess unlikely motives. Let's just ignore the ridiculous pseudo science and move on ... If you get through this confusion in the first twenty minutes, you will be treated by Lugosi, who whips your laboratory assistant without respecting one murdered bride, explaining that she finds sleeping in the church much more comfortable than bed and other vague parodies of real horror movies (budgets and plots). Anyhoo - The female journalist follows her nose to the culprit (and it is remarkable that the non-existent police are never seen!) And then the fun really begins. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and acting are OK. There are many well-dressed, very good-looking people in this movie. Management is fair and the script is a bit better than the material you earn. Nevertheless, this film does not support the interests of all but hardened b-film fans. The best thing .... It ends eventually, but not fast enough.
