Heldeke. good casting, but writing and searching is art and writing with wisdom and direct spirit is a bit of a task. Even when doing good comedy, you have to get the timing and the moment. I didn't put it all down, there were parts where I laughed, but it was a couple of times. My focus was on a quick free flowing dialogue that made some people annoying the film. It may seem great to read the script with the head, but turning it off and the camera is a different task. And the hand-held camera work provides energy for some movie parts. The general direction was good, but the script wasn't everything for me, but I'm sure you read your head script that would be good. Sorry.
