Not too enthusiastic about it. The story is quite terrible and convincing. I liked the first 10 minutes, good bill. After that it was quite terrible. Tim does not fit this role, he comes over when he is self-inflated and Pruitt taylor vince is absolutely convincing as a trumpet player. This is an idealistic film and, as a musician, it seems a little offended after that. The scenes of 1900 have not been practiced or played with their colleagues, he is completely self-conscious. I find it hard to create this kind of relationship, maybe I look at the wrong movie. If you do not have any real passion for life or mindset, please rejoice in stopping the accident and watch it on the wafer.
