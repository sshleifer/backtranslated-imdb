I'm very surprised at the positive comments because we had four who saw it on one screen and we all went out. We personally felt that it was painfully slow to look and could not sit through the whole movie. And we really tried to stick to it. I didn't like specifically those who wanted to see it because they had a personal experience of schooling depicting sexual orientation, and they didn't like them at all. :( <br /> <br /> That means it's nice to see that this movie really resonated many people here at tables and reviewers, this is the beauty of the subjective art form of the movie :)
