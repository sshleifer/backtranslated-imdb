This movie was terrible! I rented it without knowing what to expect. I watched the first 5 minutes and the movie and knew it was a bomb. Operation was bad and there was no plot. Monster is soooooo fake. The mouth does not move. Also why should they have a doctor who is playing a xylophone to kill a monster. Just a bad thing that doesn't even waste your time.
