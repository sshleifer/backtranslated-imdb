So, Chuck Norris somehow found a way to continue this sequel. I have one question - why? Who read this script and said, "Sound is great! Original!" This movie is a regenerated crap that won't hurt my toilet. Of course, this is another story that follows the tradition of MIA, Invasion USA, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force, and so on, where Chuck Norris is, of course, one man who can share the same America with some bad guys. He doesn't usually need a weapon. It's a stupid patriotic jargon that attracts the spirit. It is a big surprise that the only one who manages these Norris films is Eric Chuc's son. Eric Norris has worked mainly on all his father's films and TV shows. Didn't it hit anyone as a sign of having no leading talent? After that, he directs the same people as before in the same stories as before ... only the difference is the names of the characters. If it were to make me patriotic to the US and rejoice when our country was in a much worse shape than I ever imagined. Hopefully this is the pound of the coffin that Chuck Norris is working on.
