This movie is just so terrible. So bad that I do nothing but just a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> None of the details of the crimes have been changed correctly. Lots of slaughterhouse material. Weird cuts and changes. There is no plot continuity. Action is absolutely the most amateur I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This movie bomb was apparently made to make money without considering the accuracy of its content. Camera work is sometimes uneven and always shaky. It seems to be a video clip. <br /> <br /> In fact, now that they have Dennis Rader in prison, I want them to put those horrible movies in jail. . Don't even think about how to look at it. I'd give it a negative letter if I could.
