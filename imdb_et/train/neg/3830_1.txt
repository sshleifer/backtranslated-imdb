I don't know why I'm taking the time to watch this time-wasting movie. If you stayed there long enough in the hope of a satisfactory conclusion? good, bad or surprising? do not do. Finally, it tends to develop after strong, formal, predictable dialogue and action. The internal scenes are so harsh that you think that when the camera is enlarged by one millimeter, customers would see the lights. Costumes, hair and kits are starch, pressed and impeccable. Should we imagine that ordinary people lived as Arizona at the beginning of the 20th century? Other comparisons of reviews with Sam Peckinpa are insult to Peckin: at least this director led his violence in the context of chaos and chaos. HARD MEN's Gore has free drilling habits from the wooden bells of poor pups. Ah?!? I believe Heston thought he would be worth it for this movie. (He can tie his gun with a cold finger.) But Coburn? I never think he logged in for this travesty. Want to see a movie from the West of the West, when we knew it, to the end of the West, when we knew them? Check out SHOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN again. LAST HARD MEN is a glimpse of Western obedience.
