I have no comment on this movie. It's so bad that I have to put my first comment on the IMDb website to help some viewers save some time and do something interesting instead of watching this "movie". It is even better to stare at the walls. <br /> <br /> And since I have to write at least 10 lines of text, I'll tell you that this is also a low-budget movie, a bad actor, name-lovers, a stupid mole as a wolf and so on ... , special effects are made in the 80's style. <br /> <br /> The film is almost as bad as the movie "Megalodon". <br /> <br /> So enjoy! ;) (doesn't watch this movie)
