I looked over the other comments and was amused to explain that only the people who actually worked in the movie had commented on it. I mean, I don't want to say that amateur production is bad, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, bring it down a little. "Bumpy" is a little up. It's a Boston-based college production that doesn't even reach the level of most college amateur movies. This is what you would expect from a lot of children. A stupid action movie that doesn't have much creativity. It's pretty funny when you're ready to entertain it. Nothing you will ever see if you are not a student at Emerson College.
