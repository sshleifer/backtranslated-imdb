There are so many things wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, the first twenty minutes of a movie could be compressed to just five or ten. The overall movie is (gracious) short, but it could have been that a little more attention was paid to the middle lion (how did the reference to "Wiz" about that? A little more on the basic piece. In short, the script was a good idea, but needs a lot of reprocessing. Secondly, it could have been done without the humor of raw material, the original also had some that it could have done without, but at least it was almost aftertaste - there is plenty of flatulence and urination. Thirdly, the show is too little aware. , just like the first movie, but here's just so much. Brendan Fraser's jokes were a little over the top (and why wasn't the "new Ursula" mentioned?) Other narrators, especially a couple of interaction ends, also have a good idea. could have paid a little more attention in the first, it was hard to say that Shemp was not a real elephant (except of course the behavior), but here CGI seems to be Ideally, the special effects just have to tell you whether they are good or bad, and they have at least that number, so it's a relatively small problem, but it's still there. <br /> <br /> The performance of Christopher Showerman by George is sufficient. It doesn't have the charm of Brendan Fraser, but Christopher does not really succeed in this particular comparison - he even managed to give George some personal depth that should have been in Jay Ward's inspired film, but not here. Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me when Leslie Mann is even better than the original. <br /> <br /> Most other performances were quite common, not in my opinion good or bad.
