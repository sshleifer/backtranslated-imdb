Every once in a while when a movie comes, it's so terrible that I feel people forced to warn. When I work all days and I can save one soul from watching this movie, how great is my joy. <br /> <br /> Where to start discussing your pain. For the beginners, every five minutes there was a musical assembly. Not tagged. Each character was a stereotype. We had a frightening man, a fat guy who eats donuts, a stupid stranger, etc. The script seemed to be written when it was made. The production value was so incredibly low that it seemed like I was looking younger than the video presentation. Have the directors, manufacturers, etc. still seen the movie? Halestorm worsens with every new entry. The concept of this movie sounded so funny. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of justifiably legitimate participants. But trust me when I say it, things went wrong, VERY ERROR.
