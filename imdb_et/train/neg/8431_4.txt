Though the actors are doing convincing work for losers who parade across the screen, the fact that it is impossible to detect these characters is to watch me in the movie only 20 minutes (and more than once). The development of the plot is inseparable and slow, the verbal diarrhea of ​​the only friend of the main character is virtually uncertain, the main quality of the activities of the majority of the characters and the treatable way of treating them is annoying. <br /> <br /> Ventura Pons is characterized by the appearance of mental disorders. But this artificial sociological analysis is a big step down from CARICIAS or Caresses, where the characters are denigrated and thrown out of one another for justified reasons that play during this movie. In AMOR IDIOTA, we are forced to follow a genuinely abnormal intelligence when it hides a serious depression and an isolated woman. This is probably due to his own depression, but it is not supported by the script. I'm not giving the rest of the story when there are any masochists? Does she heal through obsession or is she shocked by her depression due to her insecure attention? Although I looked at what I didn't do to take care of any of these moments. <br /> <br /> If you can sit through all these prejudices, ignorance, betrayal, BAD dialogue, thin philosophy, etc. ?? The camera's work was pretty good and seems to be inspired by the DOGMA group. Makeup also seemed to be aimed at showing these players in raw and sharp light, as it is the worst thing I've seen in Cayetana Guillen Cuervot in any of her films (although personally she is actually attractive). <br /> <br /> I think if the idea is that we should be forced to see the lower layers of society so that we can be grateful that we are not part of it, then Pons has achieved its goal. The creation of almost identical sex scenes was the right waste of films (when the actors were filmed, but if the blue green dress had the back background capable of changing the special effects in the studio). True, I heard that many male viewers in their seats were scared at this time, but objective viewing proves that it is not the real purpose of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and see something else.
