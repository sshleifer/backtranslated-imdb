A young American woman visits her Irish and wipes out the druid's witch in her possession. Sounds intriguing, but after an interesting start I lost and spent most of the time thinking about where it goes. The film seems to be two-way: are we looking at an Irish-American woman who is struggling with her alcohol problem, or are we looking at a straight horror strike for an evil witch that returns from the past? The director does not seem decisive. These two do not seem like a gel, and eventually they don't get anywhere. This could be done so much better and the story seemed to be dragging to the end. It was the most boring and disappointing.
