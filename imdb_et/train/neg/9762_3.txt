Alan Alda is playing the real "Sports Illustrated" writer George Plimpton, who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member. Rather threatened by an uncomfortable drama that is fantastically funny. Director Alex March takes an interesting hit on this material, shooting it almost documentally (with a macho comment) and giving the story one more capricious. still making cinematography into this structure, it turns the main story into confusion. Alda's insidious, imparious performance is another obstacle, although supportive cast is full of real pro-athletes (and relaxing Lauren Hutton as a girlfriend of Alda - how is this for fantasy?). * 1/2 from ****
