1 review 28/26/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Sydney Pollack): - DVD version I watched "3 days Condor" - so CIA drama full of relaxing shows to do modest Movie. The prerequisite for nature is about 7 CIA members from eight members who are killed by Robert Redford's character, code name = Condor, which remains. Who killed them and why? At the same time, Redford is trying not to become the 8th victim. Along the way, he gets involved in Faye Dunaway's character initially because he needs a hiding place, and then he finally helps out after some loving-dovey time. This is one handful of innocent guys from the stories, but it doesn't have much tension. Flat performances do not help and the finish does not seal enough audience. Despite the fact that Sydney Pollack has a good director and a group of classical performers, this story and performances are not what they should be and therefore this film is not what it should be.
