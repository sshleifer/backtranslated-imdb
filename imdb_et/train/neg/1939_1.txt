Come on! Go over Pakistani worshipers. Bollywood can not only make great movies, but can also seriously affect the audience. <br /> <br /> I am a huge Bollywood fan, but anti-Pakistan films just make me too much to enjoy the scenario, cinematography, action sequence - everything. <br /> <br /> I am really happy that viewers on both sides of the border are restricting propaganda and there are movies like Main Hoon Na who have done great not only because they deserve their Bollywood masala quality, but also because he tries to say: give a chance and show that there are both parties who do not represent the mass.
