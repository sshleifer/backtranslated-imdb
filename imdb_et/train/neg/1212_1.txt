In general, this film is terrible and should never have been done. One of the problems with this movie is that there is no connection with the audience and characters, for example, when he is ready to attack, you want to feel, "Oh God, no!" in that case, you don't care about the fact that there is no connection to learning about the character. The trailer seemed to be nice, but there is no tension that ever is. Maybe it could have been a secret, but not. "Everything he has is a toolbox." The DVD was said to think that this film was carefully planned and intelligently made, but it is not, the end was just terrible, very straight and pointless. Action is average or lower than average, maybe even smaller. In my opinion, it was a waste of one hour in my life. The "special effects" and the kits were also medium, nothing special that ever. There is not much gore or bloody violence, not much blood. This movie was advertised to be amazing, but it is not really worth it, but it is not recommended to anyone if they are not just satisfied, with some struggle and a boring story.
