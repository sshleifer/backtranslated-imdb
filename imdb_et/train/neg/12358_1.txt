The character of Demi Moore's film was chosen for SEALs because of his appearance. It was a bad start and the movie went down there. The plot was absolutely incredible. The will to do this in a harsh military unit is not enough. This film did not convince me of the woman's physical ability to perform the required tasks. <br /> <br /> Trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone's intelligence. Due to gender differences, life is interesting.
