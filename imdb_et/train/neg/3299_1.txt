It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. I was really expecting a bad movie, but I was surprised to believe it or not. Style is traditional, all clich√©s are included. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is so badly written that you are actually laughing at the otherwise semi-descending actors trying to make it real. The photo is not too good, the music is so disgusting that it really frustrated me, the actors don't even try, because the script makes it almost impossible for you to wait for more people who have been in business for 30 years and the so-called action scenes can't actually act. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why such bad films come on, who is funding this shit? Where is Screening? And why on earth do actors take this task as an impossible script? <br /> <br /> There are millions of Hollywood movies in this genre, even if they don't want to go to theaters, but even those who are directly into the video can actually watch Professional Comparison. <br /> <br /> I can't say anything positive about this, except for the title that explains it all, I have been kidnapped for 2 hours of my life.
