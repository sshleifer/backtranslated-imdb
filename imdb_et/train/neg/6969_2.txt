The blue monkey (1987) or the "invasion of human bodyguards", as is known in the United Kingdom, was a pretty boring horror film of an old man in a mysterious poisonous plant in a bitten greenhouse !! The man rushes to the hospital, where the worm like the creature comes out of his mouth, of course it becomes such an insect monster and goes on a rampage! Despite Steve Railsback and John Vernon having been in the movie, I found it to be boring, flat with a predictable line, uninteresting characters, cheap special effects, and lack of action !!!! Horror fans don't have to watch this rare movie, you don't feel much confidence !!! I'll give this movie 2/10.
