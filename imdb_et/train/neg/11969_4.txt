If you want to enjoy entertainment, don't watch this movie. If you want to see the heroism of war, don't look at this movie. If you want to see good action and a great scenario, don't look at this movie. If you like a typical Hollywood warfare that ends in a timely manner to give the public a politically charged call for the greatness and glory of war, look at SEE MOVIE. Otherwise, don't waste your time. I am always interested in war movies because I think that if they are well done, they may know something about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of war. This film has a number of people running around the countryside, saying terrible clich√©s, doing the most predictable things and defending the oppressed with the same force and cruelty that was emphasized. This movie is shameful for filmmaking and the United States! Can you imagine that you are a person from Europe or Africa or from another country, looking at it, saying that this is how the Americans really are? No wonder everyone hates us! Please, please don't waste your time with this spam; if you need, wait and rent. 4/10
