I've seen it. It is not "good" but interesting in an undervalued way. Its boys are quite naturalistic, but ................ a graphic / free gift for rape is reluctant and -oh yes - the arbitrary insertion of World War II material is offensive to trying to compare the real horror of this content. Real cruelty is real - this movie is just cruel. But the film has a look that can draw you. But it seems to me that this is "the Emperor's new clothes", but in fact the opposite. The film looks good, but the direction, story, content and the ultimate feeling you take from the movie are empty. If the feeling can be empty - that's it.
