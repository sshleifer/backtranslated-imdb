I am usually disappointed with online movies. Even flix, which attracts large names, usually destroys people on TV. But this is the worst of the worst. The scenario is weak and working, especially Tracey Pollan's behavior is terrible. I've graduated to see the games played at my kids' school and they were better treated. Pollan works as he read the script when he speaks. When he tries to express fear, anger or grief, it is very hollow. Because of the overall quality of production, I found it difficult to take it seriously. If you decide to do this brave, you just have to prepare for the big disappointment. Frightening things don't scare you, sad things don't make you sad, romance doesn't make you warm and foggy, and you're probably worried when I saw the end. "First Death" says a lot about this movie.
