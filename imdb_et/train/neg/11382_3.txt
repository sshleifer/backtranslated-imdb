Anyone noticing that Tommy has only 3 facial expressions. <br /> <br /> 1. Angry eye looks at every enemy. 2. Hands and face, mouth agape and frightened eyes. 3. Smiling Tommy Turnbull. <br /> <br /> I have to say I hate this play, I don't look at it, but it's like Code Lyoko, we've all been watching at least one, I have to say that this exhibition is racist, uninteresting and pointless. every episode ends with a robotboy winning, except for one exception, when robotboy basically lets that flyer fly over a jetpack. <br /> <jokes are also crude crude oil, I think most people say "Suck" or farting, I think the show's bullying is also quite shocking. <br /> <br /> Hide your bowling ball under your anger, and the other uses a chain in the interests of God which school it is going to. Not to mention his older brother who is psychopathic and has no other qualities. <br /> <br /> The whole show I feel is a hanging mega XLR and Fosters. As you might say, the co-operation, Jamie and Kiva trio, as well as Robotboy, are similar to Megas, where he wins everyone, no matter what its odds are and he is free, regardless of the robot. <br /> <br /> Just this show doesn't like me, I'm surprised that it's still working.
