In essence, the story of human nature, this movie is beautiful cinematography, Ceylon's lush jungles and Elizabeth Taylor's presence, but the film never goes. Her husband ignores Newlwed Taylor and neglects it and is later directed to the plantation master played by Dana Andrews. Planting is a late father of the owner Peter Finchi, whose ghost casts over to Elephant Walk, which becomes the main point of dispute between Taylor and Finch. Elephants have decided to insist on their traditional way, which is blocked when the manor was built to their right. Animals go rampage and give the best moments in the picture. Taylor and Andrews have some good moments when trying to remain a loyal spouse, despite his marriage problems with Finch.
