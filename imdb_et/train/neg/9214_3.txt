Many things come to light when watching this movie: 1) Action is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so, but the older-child conflict limits the soap opera-ish. The other two boys: an over-pouty child and your stereotypical-I-baby-but-I'm a really sensitive-inside blonde dreamboat; 2) the film as a whole is frustrating and disappointing; 3) Robbie's Dreams and Episodes Are Disturbing (Acting Tom Hanks); 4) Adding original love balls is a strange choice ("we are all special friends"); 5) terrible activity does not improve strange lines and side plates; and 5) it's a really bad movie. Expect disappointed - and likely to be distracted.
