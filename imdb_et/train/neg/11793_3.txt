Deep Shock plays like a television movie: a whole bunch of commercial quality participants, a badly designed creature that is a "bad guy", and a script full of technical, political jargon and importance when he knows what to do together. <br /> <br /> I checked the movie because of the creature (I love to see what the filmmakers have remembered about their cheap video design), and immediately from the bat, I have to be disappointed because the creature in the box was not in the movie. Actors I look forward to as this is a movie type (really quite common and not thought through for a while). Music was a typical, non-thoughtful action symphonic music. <br /> <br /> I liked the design of the computer and the technical equipment and the mini-sub design. The movie even flipped really well, the control filters let you know what you are watching. But there's still not a lot of story there. <br /> <br /> This movie receives 3/10 of the IMO. Bored search and destroy mission to protect the North Pole and those creatures that protect it ... sure flat. Even the camera is labeled a love relationship between two characters that you don't see. Criticize it as a film that tries to get the participants out of the bench and video. Do not worry.
