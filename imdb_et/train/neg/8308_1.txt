Entertainment Tonight has gone down the hill in recent years, but last night (August 17, 2006), they reached a new low. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to reach their broadcast, they decided to post real photos of JonBenet Ramsey's body last night in their teasers ... saying, "Pictures of a case you have never seen". The two photos were graphic and very disturbing. One of them was on his face and head / neck, and you could clearly see the cord used to strangle him around his neck and bruise. It was so terribly terrible, I couldn't believe it. How is it related to any remote control of Hollywood entertainment? Something! They have fallen to a level of dignity and values ​​to a new low ... and it shows. It was a premiere earlier to see ... and it's just a waste. <br /> <br /> I now look at Access Hollywood.
