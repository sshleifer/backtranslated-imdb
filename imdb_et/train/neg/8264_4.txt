This is a movie where the actors are all well, especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino, in a movie where all three pairs meet in a situation that feels verrrry forced to be either cute or story-driven. In other words, they seem to be filmed scenes that do not like the real life. Even though women who work in lounges will never go out with their clients, it just doesn't seem realistic as it is written in this movie. Also, if one character meets an overweight woman in a movie, it seems artificial how they look at eleven seconds. Again, all the actors are good and the moments of this movie are nice, but in general it is another indie that could have used some rewriting before starting production.
