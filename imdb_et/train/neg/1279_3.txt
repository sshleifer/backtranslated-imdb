This film talks about three stories that seemed nailed without becoming a combined vignette. The makers tie three vignettes when they are all connected to Martin Kove, though you never see some leaders with Kove. <br /> <br /> The first vignette is sexy Vivian Schilling, a woman who is afraid of everything under the sun (she makes Adrian Monki beautiful), who has a home in Paranoia evening alone. You're literally going to be ridiculous to Vivian. He spends most of his time at night, showing his amazing qualities. But his film is the worst, if not the most nail biting. Another vignette belongs to Bill Paxton when he depicts room stuff in hell. His geeky roommate allows him to take full advantage of him and Bill does it whenever he can. <br /> <br /> The last vignette was funny because the man fears that death will take him at any moment, like his palm, who pulled the olive oil to death. <br /> <br /> Not very interesting, because the film seems to be cut together with very little thought. Bill Paxton has fans.
