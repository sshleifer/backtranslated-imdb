This film is overheated, predictable, pretentious, and hollow. Settings are faithful but long-term contact with your self-consciousness. The lengthening of the artifacts stops the action and almost as much hides as an empty dialogue. It looks like Tom Hanks is in a dream ride, like Bruce Willis in Hart War. Tom, you can't give the symbols deep, making your face empty! The content did not guarantee Paul Newman's hysterical activity. It is the core that is packed into the atomic bomb body.
