I have not read Lincoln's biography, so maybe it was an exact depiction ...... <br /> <br /> And maybe it's because I am used to equally alienating and unrealistic worship images unnaturally godly Lincoln is a brilliant, honorable and savior of our country ...... <br /> <br /> But why did they make Lincoln's movie? Although Henry Fonda did great Lincoln, he depicted him as "aw shucks, I'm just a simple man", it seemed a little offensive. <br /> <br /> [It was Bushie Jr. campaign to think that he was "just an ordinary man" so we don't care that he is a rich and privileged hero - but that's a different story.] <br /> <br /> Not just the film show Lincoln as a simple (almost simple thinking) guy, says the film that Lincoln has seemed to be by chance in the law and that he was not even interested in the law - just a mistakenly simplified idea of ​​rights and rights. In the film he is not a very good defense attorney (he sits around his feet around the table and amuses the witnesses) and the result mostly depends on chance / happiness. <br /> <br /> In addition, partly because it was funded by Republicans (in response to some challenges for Democrat-sponsored games) and partly because it was only a mood of the times, the film is unfortunately religious, racist and conservative. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this movie!
