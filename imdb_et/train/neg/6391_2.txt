hg is usually exploitative, and it has never worked for me before - I loved "blood strike 2", but I really don't like pseudo-science or heuristics. The whole movie is based on a man who has esp caused by an electrical accident and a witch. I'm not against witches, and I liked the "carrie" (novel and film), but it bothered me. I think this is due to the developer of the power line esp. also a university professor who wastes his time exploring esp cases. In the 1960s I was not aware of whether esp was a general mistake, but I assume that this kind of theory is simply discredited. What disturbed me was how the police described schizophrenia as ruthless, unpredictable villains who may seem like 99% of the time in normal people and then just a snap. nothing can be further from the truth. I reject such concepts because they add public ideology. Many people think schizophrenia is a dissociative identity disorder. who wrote this script didn't know much about psychology. <br /> <br /> The movie had some decent concepts. I liked how the witch used men; it was a nice change. I liked how she could make her attractive but didn't do it when she was forced by her lovers. I found interesting how his second lover burned his face. if the script had been touched for a few weeks before production and not focused solely on the inaccuracy of that audience, it could be a decent film.
