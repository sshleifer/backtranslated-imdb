When a film, such as the "Hazzard Dukes" brings over $ 75 million, it gives some incredibly sad statements about the state of its society. We are collectively too foolish to stay away from the trash or maybe I just don't understand how many people like this type of effortless trash. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has no incentive to make good movies because if it puts it in the trash, people will still see it because there is nothing else on the screen. That's it. I went out, despite a free movie ticket. The dialogue cannot be sad. The Stunts couldn't be surprising and terrible. Maybe this "bigger than big" picture likes Texan, but it didn't like me or anyone else in the theater. None of the "big names" in this career ended in the flick except for Burt Reynolds, who says everything you need to hear. Jessica Simpson - don't make me laugh. <br /> <br /> I don't even recommend this movie to a video, even if you were desperate. It was about fooling the public to make enough money after the opening day to equalize or perform better than marketing. They did, despite warning the public. Rumor is abundant.
