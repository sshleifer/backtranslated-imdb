My complaints concern the pace of the movie and the material at hand. When using an archive film and stars, the film gives the film a fresh and interesting perspective, too often the highlighted material is not very interesting (for example, when Goebbels complains about this or that disease, & tc. Small town). The film also moves c. 1920-1939 and then the years of war. In conclusion, the film is a bit better than the documentary of the historical channel, except that the filmmaker's sensitivity is slightly higher than the documentary editor of your average history channels, and so he can organize the details of Goebbels life more artificially. But I found it involuntary.
