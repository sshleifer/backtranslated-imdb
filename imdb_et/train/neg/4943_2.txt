I've been watching 3 Caveman episodes and I have no idea why I'm going, except maybe I'm looking forward to it. <br /> <br /> For me, this exhibition will pump off ads without real humor. When we saw these views, we all speculated what would happen. <br /> <br /> The woman's cave-woman episode with attitude was actually great, yes, for us. she is toned with crude oil and acts harshly against strangers, and the truth is that she needed a little <br /> <br /> I consider myself a pretty good reviewer, but I have to say that Cavemen is a comparable old show, my mom , car. I'll give her 2 just because they deserve 1 better than 1 because they spent money on it.
