and shot in Vancouver, South Carolina, in the low-country "mountains" that are visible in the background. For heaven they would have resettled the place. There are no coastal mountains in South Carolina. Period. <br /> <br /> Lame visuals. They should have been beautiful. And the story pulled away. I usually read the book and give the film a response. There was nothing in this movie that made me buy a book or even borrow a library.
