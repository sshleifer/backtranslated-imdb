Say Funky Forest: The first contact is a bad movie with an incredible proportions of underestimation. I really get a good art house movie, even a surreal and twisted romp like El Topo, Naked Lunch and Survive Style 5+, because these films have something to discuss when credit is rolled out. <br /> <br /> FFFC tries to be deep and intellectual in every way possible, and in essence there is no substance in this film. This film is badly made, the visuals of this film are not inspiring, the dialogue is worse, the musical numbers destroy the film. I smiled at GUITAR BROTHERS, but it immediately wiped something completely unnecessary and irrelevant. He tried to be deep and meaningful, but I think it's just a pretentious inconsistent mess. Fresh film students who don't have a camera could do something more interesting. <br /> <br /> Guitar Brothers and the starting lines between the Skits get 1 point each, everything else is just poorly worked, pseudo-creative, heavy hands. Being a good AS like other REAL executives like Sogo Ishii, David Lynch and Jodoworsky. Leave me alone. I am convinced that the people who are engaging in the FFFC will do this because they have no idea what they saw, because there were nothing but easy, relevant statements that were mixed with foolishness and blended until you smiled at your shoes. <br /> <br /> This movie was extremely disappointing, coming out of the high, Survive Style 5+ movie, which is really meaningful, with great landscapes, cinematography, memorable dialogues, funny moments, a good soundtrack, great performances, fantastic tempo and stream. FFFC has exactly the opposite in every respect, boring terrain (20 minutes at night when entering a delicate beach, a completely white stage? Alien balls floating in the white space? Dinky school corridor and then ... school corridor?), Terrible cinematography, forgotten dialogue, something funny or humorous, save this fact that you just waste your life for two hours, a soundtrack, an amateur performance, unevenly, scattered and often pulled out, zero current at all. <br /> <br /> There are those who claim that this makes the FFFC an excellent movie that it is so unusual at every step of its pure genius. It's just a way to feel your ego, because "unpredictable" can be a good quality for a movie if it isn't combined with "boring", "eager", and "terrible". I personally talked to two people who admitted to me that the FFFC was terrible when leaving the theater, but the overwhelming rave of the artistic elites made them look at the film again and then came back to me ... "Hey, it was pretty good, I liked it. "<br /> <br /> I put my mouth down, this film is sliding, I don't care if Roger Ebert says this film is the best he ever watched lost his innocence." ... this movie does not mean in any way other psychedelic / trippy movies coming from Japan in the last 10 years, Taste of Tea, Party 7 and Kamikaze Girls are much better movies (even with low budget) and no one can honestly compare to Survive Style 5 + View the FFFC only if you are interested in a predictive fabric that does not contain a rubber shock budget.
