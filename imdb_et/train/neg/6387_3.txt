When I first selected this movie, I was intrigued by the basic idea and wanted to see what was going on. I'm a fan of animation and love it when it is successfully connected to live video. But the animation of this movie was everything I enjoyed. Although it must be said that the performances of the actors were excellent. The visual appearance - including animation - gave the piece a wonderful air. But it was the quality of anxiety that disappeared from both visual and scripted images that you practically grabbed the head. The most irritating thing was that the plot had a relative shortage. The primer seemed to be horns at irregular intervals, giving a stuttering effect that greatly reduced the mass flow. Felisberto's voice transmissions - especially the end result - felt like a very desperate attempt to fill the empty holes in the plot, which were set aside for issues such as the whole ant thing (and not even that). properly treated). I'm afraid that the whole piece at best came to a "reasonable first attempt" by a teenager who has spent too much time reading DH Lawrence. Not what you expect from the expected filmmakers at all.
