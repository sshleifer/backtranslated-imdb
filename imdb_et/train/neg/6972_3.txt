When I first saw the cover of this movie (a giant mistake that looked at a couple of sisters) And the name "Blue Monkey", I knew I wasn't a big Hollywood movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see that Steve Railsback is in this cheesecake kick that always does a good job no matter what role he is doing .... FX is pretty horny, not too much parcel and I'm still not sure why this movie is called a blue monkey, because there is nothing in this movie with a monkey. But come to the people you were expecting? It's not really as bad as it seems .... If you enjoy old 50-style black and white attack films, this is basically an updated version with no updates on FX
