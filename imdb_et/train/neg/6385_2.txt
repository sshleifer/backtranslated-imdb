Gayniggers from space are pretty much by their name. Only a 27-minute run describes a spaceship with black blacks coming to Earth to release men. Although I see little importance on the plot, it is really illogical. It is for comedy / society and science fiction. I found myself laughing several times so that it would succeed there. <br /> <br /> Special effects are terrible. When the spacecraft floats above the ground, you can see the star zoom out for no apparent reason. The asteroids at first appear fake, the ship's equipment is illogical; in general, the whole thing does not take seriously. When you pass all the aspects that make it into a bad movie, it is very accessible and easily visible until the end. Some parts are fun. In general, the only thing you remember is that it was once one of the most ridiculous concepts. . But it's illogical and has little long-term value. I can't really recommend it; if you look at it, do it for a unique concept, not for quality.
