What starts with a delicate country yarn, an unpleasant and easy-to-enjoyable romantic story, Edward Norton will initially become a charming Harlan that will gradually reveal more of himself and things, as the film gradually turns from southern romance to a modern wild west. <br /> <br /> Pleasant traveler (Norton) wanders around the city and admires the young girl (Evan Rachel Wood), which apparently saves her dead existence with her bad tempering father, with a chill romance, but it gradually becomes clear that Cowboy is more than an eye. <br /> <br /> Edward Norton ?? the real chameleon of an actor (making facial hair fit) who plays hick in the country is a bit nervous, but maybe because he's just trying to act without worrying about the accent. Certainly, he does it to find out more about Harlan, it seems that all the nuances are little adjusted. Too many minor changes means that we will never be sure where Harlan comes from, and what seemed like a good result for Norton will gradually become confusing. Evan Rachel Wood is pleasant without ever having to worry about her eyelids in Norton. <br /> <br /> Oru captures the slightly uneven story of this change and never really explaining the main character's motives for the audience's sympathies. Do we like this drift or not? Even after the dramatic course of events, it remains unclear. This vagueness is to the detriment of the film, as if the writer hadn't been able to think about what kind of story he wanted to talk about and solve somewhat hotch-potch. If the film had remained one or the other, it could have been a strong film, but as we are left it is a mess. Old-fashioned romance fans will enjoy a part of the film, but because of the darkening tone. Fans next to Norton (or fans of the lush landscape of the San Fernando Valley) will answer it.
