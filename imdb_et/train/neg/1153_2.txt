Disappointing and irritating. The sculptor does not have a true understanding of human history, but rather cliches are separated. The mark has not been thoroughly investigated. These are the dolls he publicly admits that he needs a dramatic element, the mother's attitude to her daughter's lover. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid delivers excellent performance, despite the fact that she has been given some special situations and lines that are passive to allow her angry daughter to slip her eyes. The script depicts Darren (Daniel Craigi) dr Jekyll / Mr. Hyde without hints as to why, except that he sniffs cocaine before a big scene. A mature writer could have done much more with this topic.
