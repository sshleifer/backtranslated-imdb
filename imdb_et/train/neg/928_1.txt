This movie is so terrible that it is difficult to find the right words to describe it. <br /> <br /> At first, the story is so ridiculous. The actors are bored and uninvited, maybe they were forced to play on this cheesy film. <br /> <br /> The national forest camera reception is the only good in the film. I should feel ashamed because I paid for this evil picture. <br /> <br /> Hopefully no one will make a sequel or make a similar movie with that worse :-)
