Particularly outrageous example of an Italian cult cinema with a meaningless title (if anything, alternating Satan's MARK is even less relevant to the plot!), Only this Gothic horror and Giallo hybrid (with a strong Erotica dose) creates a solid atmosphere? it really fits with the handling that is absolutely terrible! Here we get the people of the usual group (acting troupe) left on the island (to which they were called with the Count because he had become the dead circle of the leading wife, his lost husband)! The characters are quite a lot of stereotypes: a medieval but hostile hero (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart and whose family history carries more than his share of a violent tragedy), a deadly heroine, a buggy companion (remembering Mae West and making the most annoying!) devoted stage leader (forever one and all for his unmanly behavior!), a few lesbians, a mysterious gardener (everywhere Luciano Pigozzi who ever acts when you know what I mean), a jealous housekeeper (nominal star Femi Benussi, what is it worthy, this is really a piece of the band), the loyal religious fanatic, the impressive spiritualist, and so on. it means that it is not visible, frightening duplication, snail tempo, slag production (where some black and white films are raised by raging seas!) and the fact that murders only occur in the last half-hour will not help. Moreover, Marcello Giombin's score, albeit pleasing in itself, becomes so unreasonably modern in such circumstances; that is, revelation is surprisingly complicated (given that there is no shortage of suspects here).
