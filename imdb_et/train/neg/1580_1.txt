it became a film of culture for Chinese college students, although I didn't see it until it was sent on the channel4 in the UK. <br /> <br /> full of funny claims, the plot is mediocre and unrealistic; The "spirit" he wants to pass on is how independent artists "stand up to the commercialization of the music industry" and retain their "artistic soul purity" and "do not sell themselves for dirty money". it is really filthy and superficial; The diologist is mainly pathetic. acting is bad. sceenplay is full of artistic responsibility. this is a fantasy movie for kids and it's all <br /> <br />
