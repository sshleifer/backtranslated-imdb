Although the book was not exactly the actual situation, it was still Japanese. I find it hard to believe that anyone who was involved in making this film had ever been to Japan because it didn't feel Japan the slightest. Almost all of this was terrible. I admit that the actors were generally pretty good but couldn't save it. Before the movie started, I was surprised that there were only ten people in the cinema on Friday night just after opening the movie in Japan. For 30 minutes I was surprised they stayed. I missed it so I could criticize it. The whole movie was cut off by my jams and I stunned my Japanese girlfriend with an incredible laugh. Everyone I saw out of this cinema seemed confused and disappointed. <br /> <br /> This filmmaker owes me two hours.
