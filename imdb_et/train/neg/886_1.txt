A few years ago, the same people who created Paris, J'TAIME, which was imperfect but very enjoyable (my rating was 7), created this garbage out of New York. <br /> <br /> In Paris, I love you (J'aime) created Paris feeling and it was made in many beautiful Paris. <br /> <br /> In this current movie, I didn't know New York, I didn't feel like I was in my city of birth. <br /> <br /> New York has 5 counties, I didn't see any scene in Bronx or Queens. Brooklyn has one scene (Brighton Beach), I saw no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village / beautiful hotel or theater scenes. It is a big pain, most of the performers were not even stereotypes, they were the smallest cartoons. <br /> <br /> Very few humorous moments are all naturally sexual or offensive to many. Fine New Yorkers we all know and love. <br /> <br /> Some razzie awards were much better. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (of 4) 20 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> I think the title should have been <br /> <br /> NEW YORK, I hate you.
