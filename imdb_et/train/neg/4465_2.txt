After the overestimated success of Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish horror films, like the disease, spread in the increasingly sad world of fear films. The result is all such films as El segundo nombre, a TV-like production that has been poorly written but has worked and directed even worse. I didn't read Ramsey Campbell's book, but I'm sure the author of The Doll Who Ate's mother didn't have much in common with this terrible production. Avoid it at all costs, unless you are looking for a fresh cinema. 2/10
