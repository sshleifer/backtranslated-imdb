This movie can't even be said to be unfortunately bad, just painfully mediocre. In the absence of any real mindset or imagination, the thin plot is stretched to the absolute boundary and the "jokes" (which are predictable and fast) are twisted to such excess length that boredom and wakes up quickly to the viewer. Another notation to mark John Waters' sad downfall and a reminder that what is shocked or amused us 30 years ago is not working quite the same now. We have seen it before and taboos are no longer taboo because they have long evaporated. Great shortage.
