I have to say that I am really surprised at the high rating of this movie. I found it completely idiotic. Mother gets "visions" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing he touched twice did his vision ... It just seemed ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's presentation was terrible. He was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job and did most of the painful pains they had to work on. <br /> <br /> I usually love LMN and I'm very open when it comes to movies, but this movie seemed to be a ridiculous plot and seemingly, and it just wasn't for me.
