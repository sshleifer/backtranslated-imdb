Captivity in thinking comes with many words. Among them are: uninteresting, endless, unuspensful, unsexy, incomprehensible and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> I hated these films from the mid-nineties to the end, which was basically Scream, but these new visions are beginning to look like these classics. They still have the same demographics that these other films were so successful, but now they add a new level of degeneration that makes the twelve to fourteen-year-old girl they are targeted feel like they are hardcore and hips. br /> <br /> This movie is a boring hunt! What the hell has happened to Larry Cohen? His name has not been good since 1993! However, I was surprised that he had something to do with something like that! Was anyone surprised when the interest of the movie's love turned out to be one psychopath? Didn't anyone know when they first saw him? Only someone who has never seen another movie in their lives before!
