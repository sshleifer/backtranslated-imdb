In short, this movie was boring. There was no life and spark. The big problem is with two drivers. The Jewish law and Gwyneth Paltrow had no chemistry. He was bored and he was annoying. <br /> <br /> The visuals were interesting, but they didn't improve the scenes. If anything, the visuals tend to separate the audience from what happened on the screen. No sequences of action felt real and thus the film could not create a real drama or a threat. <br /> <br /> The film had the potential, but it needed a better script, better action and a better director. I was thinking of the movie, you know, this movie would have worked when Harrison Ford would be Sky Captain, Karen Allen was Polly and Director Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> Ignore the critical accolades of this movie. The critics I think are praising the film because they want to * like it and want it to succeed, even though it does not succeed on so many different levels.
