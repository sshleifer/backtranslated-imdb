There's a group of Fox TV executives sitting in a meeting room table wondering what a new show to order. <br /> <br /> "How about something like 24 or West Wing?" says one of them, but they all agree that it would be too expensive and cheap television will likely damage the station when it flops. <br /> <br /> "How would some big comedy writers come together and make high-quality sitcom?" offers you and fires on the spot. "Don't you know that good writers are paying a lot of money!" big leaders. "That's why we invented a reality TV." <br /> <br /> "We could make another criminal drama ..." the man suggests cheerfully. "I listen ..." is responsible for the boss suddenly. "People like CSI, so we make a second copy of it," adds Blandman. <br /> <br /> 'But there are already too many CSI clones, what can we do to make us stand out?' naive junior asks and immediately punches off. 'Stand out! If we do, people may be confused! Give them more what they want! big major screaming. <br /> <br /> 'We just add more violence and make it really joyful, we're finally Fox,' the second suit refers to the great responder 'now you get it' for a joyful response. "We could make them into the Deviant Crimes Unit," he clearly adds to the roll. <br /> <br /> "Jove has got it!" The great chief laughs, "and the victims can be beautiful and vulnerable women who wear very little on the screen." "Well, what would draw people out of the middle and bad scripts," Blandman notes. <br /> <br /> "Then it's solved, we just need a name," the big manager says. "Could we call it the violence of sex lords?" <br /> <br /> "Too Written, How is Killer Instinct? it gives violence, but sounds a bit like the Basic Instinct, which had a lot of sex. ‚Äù<br /> <br /> 'Puuurfect', the big main answer and then they all hit each other back and go and cancel Arested Development.
