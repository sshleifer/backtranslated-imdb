Here we are: two people coming from the far futuristic world arrive on earth ... one is a desperate mission to preserve life, the other is an inhumane killing machine that has decided to abolish a woman who gives birth to a whole race savior So what can we call this machine of killing ? It's almost like he's a destroyer or destroyer ... sort of like a fighter or something. What is the word I am looking for ... something that ends - things? Hmmmm .... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the defender (who quickly reads Luke Skywalker stealing a white scarf from local clothing) who finds a young woman and impregnates her with a future hero. The Evil ... "The Destroyer" kills some tiny and steals their weapons and clothes, then tries to find a woman by visiting her job and asking around, threatening people's eyes and repeating her name intimidatingly. <br /> <br /> Then a desperate race to survive will begin, as the seemingly deadly and unstoppable "destroyer" will catch the pair across the country. At some point, he can get boots and a motorcycle, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Maybe he's trying to crush them with a huge tanker in an exciting final. .. acid. The truck then rises. They'll be saved ... but no! Then it reappears as strong as ever. He kills the defender and continues the girl in a meat packing plant where he is put into a big industrial cutting machine in a terrifying finish and destroyed once and for all. <br /> <br /> But maybe I've extrapolated too much ... after I finished watching this movie after Mr. Protector magically impressed Sean Young, kissing him at the bar, he tells him is born after 3 days. Costumes and effects are great in this movie ... I loved them the first time I saw them on Star Trek: Next Generation! Sean Young makes another great turning point as the unemployed replicator and career sweat-hog Stephen Baldwin is also on board as Young's Fat Cop Boyfriend. Not sure where he fits on the plot ... maybe he imports another James Cameron movie?
