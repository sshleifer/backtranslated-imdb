I'm honest - the reason I rented this movie was that I'm Kyle Chandler's biggest fan (especially Early Edition). Because he usually plays a good man, I wanted to see him in a different role (curiosity). The plot itself pulled me in; we want to die (Tony Greco.k.a. Mr. Chandler) has to kill by accident before being entrusted with the life of a witness or rather with the death of someone who recognizes "in the family". Movies were not something I expected. It was sick, I hated the end (when you saw it, you know why), and there were so many unnecessary parts. Basically it was dirty and a little pointless. Yes, it was a mob movie and yes guns go to BOOM. But there is more in the movie. This film worked as if it had no time to go into detail - just to deal with it and understand it. It really was a thing - James Belushi was as fun as "The Rose". Sheryl Lee made Angel credible when she got. He surprised me the most. And Kyle Chandler was as convincing as the anxious newcomer to the "family". If only the script worked for the fairness of the participants.
