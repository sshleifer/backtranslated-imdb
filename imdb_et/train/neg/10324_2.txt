The little mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I've ever seen. They have the opportunity to prepare the simplest comedy programs they get for the oldest most offended viewers, which means for the CBC the 85-year-old Saskatchewan farmer. Jokes are all predictable and so deadly that I can't believe it. The performances are very teeth and general, but I do not blame the actors because such one-dimensional stereotypical characters are probably what the CBC demanded and demanded. The very flat show with the bad jokes they tried to present "controversial" well, is less controversial than the other boring CBC comedies like The Hour for 22 minutes, the Royal Canadian Air Farce and the Rick Mercer report.
