The echoed "bubble-free" sound effect used to sleep. Very soothing show. I think I would have slept through parts where there was a danger or danger. I had also heard that some of the attacks on the SpongeBob diving show were shot in Floron, Tarpon Springs. I think Lloyd Bridges has never finished there. I only remember the rumors at the show, and although it was never very exciting for the seat, we would make underwater moments near the lake at our grandmother's house ... depicting repeated bubbling sounds and telling our adventures in our heads. I thought Flipper had better underwater action. Of course, he had the advantage of being in his natural environment.
