This movie is a timely warning to anyone who thinks they can both write and direct their movie. Stand, you can't. Because there is no one in this way who would tell you when you hit the big holes in your plot, there are pointless transitions, tritiated, unememable dialogues, and you can make a pretty cool Korean legend a steaming celluloid pile. <br /> <br /> I wanted a movie like trashy popcorn movie, really I did; I like a lot of crappy movies. But if I have to ask myself what the hell happened and WHY, Dear God, why? more than a few times, I can't take it anymore. <br /> <br /> I would also like to explain how LA became Mordor for the last scene.
