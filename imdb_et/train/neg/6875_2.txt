One of the most imaginative and unbelievable films in the vision was the attraction of erotic scenes, but to understand it. Like a high school film project. What was Rosanna's arquette thinking? And what was among all those covert city dwellers? It is quite difficult. There is no need to learn about it, there are no brilliant insights, but crappy and rather ridiculous (but lots of skin as it intrigues) video was crap .... What was bisexual, somewhere, after all the heterosexual encounters. And what was that absurd dance where everyone played their stereotypical roles? Give it one pass, it's like a million second miles of bad, wasted movie, money that could have been spent on starving children or Aids in Africa .....
