I had the greatest enthusiasm for pre-screening this movie. After all, it is one of the oldest and most sophisticated tales known to mankind, and it was one of the first epic stories I read as a child (even before Tolkien). I have to say that it was a huge deprivation. They made a full plot of fun and made it one of the long soap operas. The elements that were loyal to the plot were splashed all at random so that the audience laughed at the silly script that paid for all the battles of that battle. It was a tremendous disappointment to see a complicated character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of almost matrix-like powers, obedient and male lovers in the original poem) to turn to Pitt's "Fabio Beach". A good script and more effort could have made it the most challenging and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced). The participants were really decent, trying to make the most of the ridiculous script. It was actually so much a waste of talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it to a LOTR or Gladiator and don't even hold a candle on them. Lots of pieces that ladies blame over, but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege. I would not recommend that someone pay to see that the story was beaten, like one of those characters (at least they got it).
