I can't believe that such a tangled, yingist material will go to the Americans as the material of an art house. From the telling line like "we want to make sure they're playing for the right team" and the beginning of manipulative framing and lighting, sharing Love says it's a real face. The Irish Catholics are hegemonic, the Protestants are peaceful and descendants, both the poor and the former Westerners of the US, who are fighting between a cowboy and an American Indian. The story of truth is distorted by Irish Catholic stereotypes and direct misery; the corruption that the filmmakers themselves recognized! It is sad that people today think that they can win a moral attitude by making a film that is so easily recognizable, because it is obviously deliberate, not so much art. This movie has no legal cinema or library.
