If you want to be offended or amused or both, you probably need to look elsewhere. LMOTP is not even very common in provoking conventional stupid clich√©s. At the end of the second episode I felt a little embarrassed that I was actually sitting in a thoughtful confusion. <br /> <br /> In addition to the thin reflected tricky premise, it first drew attention, it's just another flat, harmless, and antiseptic test of the comments and entertainment that CBC usually produces. And if "ZOMG MUSLIMS LAND CANADA ROFLMAO !!" The hype bears its welcome that the show is likely to be canceled broadcast because it is as low as it is assessed alone. <br /> <br /> If you are obsessed with Muslim culture in the West and / or the most minute topics on this topic are easy to entertain I really don't see how LMOTP is more enjoyable than the curiosity that emerged from the leap. Other exhibitions have better addressed the problem of cultural / ethnic dichotomy in Western ethnic societies. LMOTP is never among those entertaining or understanding.
