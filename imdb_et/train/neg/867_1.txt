I had great hopes for this film, though it got a bad overview of the paper. I was extremely tolerant and sat through the film. Finally, I felt very ill. <br /> <br /> While I'm not the most unpleasant or particularly sensitive to the tasteless cinema - I enjoyed Woody Allen anything you ever wanted to know about sex. and Michael Hanneke "Funny Games" - I found the leaders obsessed with the ten-year-old child who wanted to drink women's milk completely ill. And when the film reached an "orgy" where the boy drinks both the mother's milk and the woman he loved for the whole movie, I almost vomited with a full perversion and sentimental priest that it won't get me wrong, I enjoy most European cinema, but also independently made movies so that this flick should have enjoyed me enormously. Avoid this movie at all costs, it should be next to historical seasons as a lesson in the bad cinema.
