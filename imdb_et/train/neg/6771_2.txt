There are a few lifting things about it, but I can mention Matt Dillon, who is doing his best to do something and a lot of split screens and graphics that are worth it. Since most racial films suffer from the assumption that car lovers are not so intelligent, we get into such films. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Lohan, who surprised Mean Girl so much, has to make better decisions about what roles to take. Here he can only fail. <br /> <br /> Kids are just a little entertaining because they try to get more adults than children (though still pretty stupid). Those in the theater I saw didn't show a real interest in just a few minutes. And as a family sports movie, it's terrible. Better moments are at the beginning of the waste, creating some feelings and later an auto-bash festival that creates some tension. If you get the central character of your car, you need to develop it better than here. After some of the mandatory racing scenes you will have the best part: multiple misses in your car.
