What is a movie dog. Noni Hazelhurst's performance is pretty good, but it sits in the middle of the abortion scenario jungle, mediocre direction, and wood that is cast in most. Many characters are disgracefully unsuccessful, especially overrated by Colin Friels. <br /> <br /> Very small work in this pretentious garbage. Much of the "character development" takes place through a silly and dirty voice, and is often in complete contradiction with the behavior of on-screen characters. In fact, it is difficult to even understand who is talking about voice commands because they describe the different characters we see on the screen! How should we know that Colin Friels (Javo) is meant to be an uneven, violent and unreliable junk? One of these stupid voice commands tells us. To cry out loud, the character of his character is half the movie and the only thing that tells us is the flippin's voice! The real killer is the characters. All about them. Their clothes are well maintained and fresh despite the fact that we are constantly reminded that they are meant for artistic excellence. All of them are absurdly spoken for "junkies". No one seems to have any real understanding of slippery or odor, but it is meant for most of them. <br /> <br /> Monkey Grip deserves more attention than a weekday TV movie. Such a witty, perfectly well-fired and technically playable, but clich√©-driven angsty drama that is so wide-ranging that it is believable and tends to be around for hours without actually going anywhere. At least Noni gets his birthday party at every opportunity. There is no other reasonable reason to tolerate this junk.
