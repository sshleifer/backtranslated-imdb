This movie is really nervous. In fact, nothing can be said about this, in addition to the moral truth about the neighboring countries involved in the fight against crime, expressed at the culmination of the film. In addition, there was nothing in the film: good shots, good action and no good script. I give this film F and 2 out of 10.
