I saw this movie some time ago on a video CD. <br /> <br /> First I mention good points. is not biased, like one character in black and the other one in white. Both main characters are friends and exist very well in a country and economy that does not flourish at the same time without failure. Their families gather together and they have political parties and they train their favorite sport, shoot a sports gun when comrades are not competitors. <br /> <br /> But after the first 15 minutes, the plot goes to the fork on the road. It is believed that the audience believes that, for their unknown reason, these friends must hate each other. For some unknown reason, Bosnia is now in conflict. Of course, the script adds to the TV frame what the characters see in the live news program in English, but the clips have been since 1993, when the war began in 1992. <br /> <br /> History, the 1990 elections, the people who caused the war are not mentioned. The film attempts to blame Karadzic, who was the presidential candidate and the leader of the 2nd largest party in the Bosnian parliament. According to the Bosnian Constitution, the SDP was supposed to hold the presidency in 1992, but a coup d'Ã©tat took place in January. The Bosnian Islamic Democratic Action Party arrested complete control and held a separate referendum in March, declaring itself a law in Bosnia and announcing Secession. <br /> <br /> The history of IDAP begins with the Bosnian Muslim Alija Izetbegovic. man suspiciously missing "STTH". He was a Nazi student in World War II. He even wrote his "Mein Campf", in which he stated: "It is not possible that there would be peace or coexistence between Islamic and non-Islamic social and political institutions". In 1990, he lost IDAP elections to "pre-Yugoslavian moderate", the Bosnian Muslim Fikret Abdic, who worked with the Serbs of Christians during the Civil War and treated his supporters as brothers. Abdic failed to take power from Izetbegovic, who lost his election but won his seat. <br /> <br /> The above events are missing from the movie, but they are factual events that lead to war. <br /> <br /> There were also problems with props. The film's Serb soldiers suffered the Soviet WW2 helmets that they didn't use. One soldier also held a M-1944 WW2 rifle, which was used only by the USSR, not by Yugoslavia. <br /> <br /> The director and script writers had the opportunity, but they decided to rewrite history.
