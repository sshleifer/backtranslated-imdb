I had never heard of it before the owner of my local DVD leasing company mentioned it to me; Having been in the 1980s horror, where the notorious difference was forbidden in the US, I decided to review it. The film turned out to be boring, amateurish and ugly; sound recording is so bad that the dialogue is incomprehensible to the time, while the actor gives a new meaning to the word inept! What's even worse is that the film follows the terribly tired formula of a teenage girls' trio who is protected from a distant family. Soon one of the girls will look for help and will never be heard; the second, still bedding, is quickly destroyed (after forgetting most of the duration). The heroine is most in touch with the house's three inhabitants: the Bible's deadly mother Harridan (with a commendable overflow), her repressed (and long-suffering) daughter, and her strange brother, who occasionally appears at the scene of hitting a sleeping woman's guest. <br /> <br /> Often, the recollections of the Mother's Annoying Mother's Dinner Tables (as a spouse to say something unigiginal, backstory) and that always develops as a mother-daughter sparring match have one of their own ace, which is as unexpected as it is is brilliant, but it does not diminish the bad taste left in the mouth of the film (as much as it is through the bones and the intermittent gore) or the inevitable feeling of wasting 80 minutes ...
