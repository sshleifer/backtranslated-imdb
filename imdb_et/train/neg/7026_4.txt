On his birthday, the little boy tells his mother that he is not his son, and that he wants to go home to his real mother. <br /> <br /> Sometimes Comedy De L'Innocence has a different film making time, perhaps the 60s or 70s. Certainly, it reminded me of Losey's secret ceremony (1968) and Richard Loncraine's full circle (1977), both dealing with the disappearance, grief and relationship of parents and 'lost' children (strange film film Mia Farrow). > <br /> All three films are populated with atypical characters who behave in strange and inexplicable ways. All three films have a sense of cold, both emotionally and literally. All three films focus on the parent-child relationship, and finally all three of the film's questions - "what is real, what is imagined?" Beautiful but faulty, it does not provide easy answers and leaves much hanging, inexplicable and strange.
