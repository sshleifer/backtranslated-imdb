Gee, the movie's hell ... ... I said I wanted to become a specialist in bad movies for decades, so I decided to start with it. It was a fairly appropriate choice. I entered this adventure to find some lost gems and incomprehensible masterpieces, but I didn't see anything like that in pastel colors. I haven't really watched a lot of bad movies, but I feel it's called "so bad that good", probably because it's so inadvertently funny! First, there are inaccuracies. There are plot inaccuracies, physical inaccuracies and psychological inaccuracies. Especially the latter are as crazy as the Van Damme ass cheeks inside the blue spandex. There are also very sticky lines and I won't even talk about some fun activities. It is not exactly bad if everyone involved in the hot confusion of this film does not happen, except in one particular case. Geoffrey Lewis seems totally pathetic like Frank, which is a totally stupid character. And to tell the truth, I was very surprised that Van Damme was doing a decent job playing twins. He managed to achieve convincing two roles and moods for me. But the movie was mostly very bad and the sad part is that it was produced in a big movie studio ... which is now bankrupt.
