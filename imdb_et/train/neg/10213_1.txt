A lot of people seemed to like the movie so I feel bad, giving him a bad overview. But after sitting for 96 minutes, I feel I have to do it. When the hell in this movie ?! I have to miss it, I was expecting the story to go and nothing happened. Of course, the end was "somewhat shocking" but they didn't build it. I forgot who was half the time so they didn't really develop characters. It was so, most of the time it was plausible, but I could usually see it. So ... without giving anything, I have to say that if you do not like the participants in the movie, there is no real reason to watch this movie. I might be wrong, but I just didn't understand why there was so little or too much movie. I can't decide what it would be, so I'll tell the judge myself. I don't even know if renting would be a good idea, cost and all ... <br /> <br /> Plot: 0/10 characters: 1/10 In action: 2/10 Overall: 3/10 I feel like this is really too high, I'm up with my voice.
