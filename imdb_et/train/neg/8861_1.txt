The Howling is a terrifying horror. It picks up Karen White's funeral (she was killed at the end of the first movie). Stefan Crosscoe (unfortunately, Christopher Lee) arrives there and tells Karen's brother Ben (Reb Brown) that Karen was a werewolf. He's going to Transylvania to kill we need a werewolf (Sybil Danning). Ben and his partner Karen (Annie McEnroe) join her. A terrible script, bad direction, improper editing, and Brown's and McEnroe's one-time amazing action sink into one hand. The effects of werewolves are mostly in the dark - for good reasons! They see them terribly. Special effects subpar - I also like a cartoon from Danning's fingers. There is also an orgy of werewolves, which is especially stupid and Danning takes his top eight times at the final exam! <br /> <br /> There are some good things - I found amusing in the village of Transylvania - it seems to come from the Universal Horror Flick of the 1930s! There are interesting camera tricks between the transition scenes; Brown and McEnroel have good bodies and Lee and Danning are good at it - but they can't save it. Really - why did they do that? Where do they pay for the money? This is one of IMDb's lowest films. That alone should tell you something. Probably Danning was terrible when he saw the movie - I understand why! Must-miss.
