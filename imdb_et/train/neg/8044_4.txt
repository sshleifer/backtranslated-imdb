Well, OK, I watched this movie a little over 2 years ago and now I pulled it out of the dust shelf to watch it again and I have to say I think this movie is good. This movie hit the buzz, as I know what you did last summer 3, as the last stabilizer was Scream 4 and well this movie is not so bad. I mean, it had mistakes and it would be ridiculous, of course, to release it in theaters, but at midnight, this movie is not half-bad to slip the popcorn. It has some fears and some very hot women I could add. Plus it shows off Joey Lawrence's new beefy look though probably even that hasn't won him any great Hollywood roles either ...... I feel like a bad guy, he had such a career in the early and mid 90's blossom, some Disney movies and eternal Lawrence brothers show ..... Joey Lawrence was a bit of a sitcom player, but then, like a 360 degree turn, his career went south with only low budget movies as it was. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Also throws you in the guard, it makes you think about the team, there's a secret that somebody knows to finally be disappointed. It also casts you out who the killer is, I had an idea, but still doesn't think the killer was who he was, but his motives with the secret were a huge drop. Now, if there had been a secret that was released? This movie could have been one of the best b rated movies. But I'm also a sucker of college subjects and I went to college on a spring day in a manor-sized beach house that resembles here, so it just made me feel sentimental about this movie. <br /> <br /> A slip like this. Good night movie.
