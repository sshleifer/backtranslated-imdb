If you liked "Blair" then you like it. It has the same bad camera work and soundtrack and has the same non-existent plot and suspenseful moments. Tarantino and Rodriguez '"Dusk Till Dawnist" you are treating. He is also an icon and a very good actor. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. This movie is definitely the most beautiful film I've seen for a long time, and I've also seen quite a few movies - even bad. I can tell you that I find the most fearful films in some ways entertaining, but that was just a waste of time. and hot action with all sharp-looking plastic teeth ... No, I'm just kidding. I have to be unanswered before I vote for "submit" on the voting form. <br /> <br /> Stay away, even though it has sexy girls with teeth!
