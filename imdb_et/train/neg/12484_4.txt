Woosh! The man? What can I say ...? <br /> <br /> Maybe opening? We see a number of mongoloid-barbarians who have a bad make-up jump from the walls of some ruins. They sneak around and attack a somewhat dressed-up girl. The guy runs off, the Mongolites follow him and one of them stays in the rape of a seemingly girl, but he releases one of his chest and kidnaps him. Then the guy (still going) sees the horse and tries to steal it. Suddenly? a bad wig with a ridiculous hero appears, saying, "This is my horse!". Mighty Deathstalker did just that. Mongoloids arrive, Deathstalker kills all those (including the guy) somewhat inappropriate in the Mexican West Scores (this should be swords and sorcery, so what is the “arriba-trumpet”?) And then Captive Girl goes out and reveals both breasts. She starts rubbing them and Captive Girl likes it. She will love her lips and admire Deathstalker. Just when they plan to do so, this old guy will come to a halt, ending the end of a day that is suitable for Deathstalker (and possibly a perfect ending for a short film). <br /> <br /> Now tell me ?? Isn't it a place where a feminist would have turned off a movie or another male viewer would say, "This is one good movie hell!" The plot is as simple as throwing a kitten off the balcony: Deathstalker must get the sword of justice and use it to steal the life of an amulet and magic quiz from the evil witch Munkar. <br /> <br /> Apart from decapitations, rupture, accidental bloodshed, sluggish fist attacks, and embarrassing sword fighting, this movie also contains a huge amount of t! ts & $$ photos. First of all, I wanted to add one extra point to this film for every naked boob I can read. After 9 points (not even half of the movie) I had to give up counting. It disturbed me from the rest of the movie. And the rest of the movie was worth it. Completely crazy thing. Look at this mutant cat / worm-like creature that Munkar has a pet to feed his eyes and fingers. And here's an interesting question: what would you do if a man in the woman's body entered your bedroom and tried to kill you with a knife? The answer is simple: you hit him a bit, take the knife and try to rape him. Then you find that she is not really a woman, so you throw her out of her bed and tell her to leave her room. It works well, I tell you. Deathstalker does it and Deathstalker Road is the right way! <br /> <br /> DEATHSTALKER is a real movie, as noted in other comments. The villain is a whistle. Women are delicious. There's blood, sex, violence, rape and a delicious chicken. There's a totally useless tournament that simply includes a bunch of barbarians who beat, beat and hack each other. My favorite weapon used in this tournament was a giant wooden hammer used as a bad competitor for bloody pulp. And my favorite competitor was undoubtedly one spicy Warthog head (reminiscent of JED RETURNIST). I'm not going to show you how the movie ends, but get ready to just rejoice when I tell you that four-way spreading is thrown at the top of the movie. <br /> <br /> And of course the whole movie. Look at the man who is dragged behind the horse by dirt, and the next point shows that he is dragged over the grass (not the road). See that the magic tattoo magically magically turns the sides of the same scene (on the left side of the head, on the right). After all, Munkar is a magician. This is, or this film is captured in an alternative universe where things like "continuity" simply do not exist. <br /> <br /> As much as I enjoyed it, and as far as I am waiting for the other 3 installments in this series, I have enough intelligence not to let this film go. However, I am ready to give him the maximum minimum point so I can deduct some more points for the next possible worse after-effects. DEATHSTALKER can be a great fun, tricky and sloppy CONAN-rip-off, and it's a terrible movie.
