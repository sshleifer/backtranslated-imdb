I really can't say anything bad * or * good about it. His characters are pleasant enough, it is powerfully produced and designed, and professional in appearance (except for this cheesy monster suit). But it has no originality, ideas and nothing that has been seen by ALIEN, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON and / or OUTLAND. It's just one formula, cookie cutter, "grimy corporate drones in deep room and unstoppable monster". Pretty much waste of time.
