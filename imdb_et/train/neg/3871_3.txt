I'm trying to be very objective when I watch a low budget movie. I also apply less weight to independent and low budget products compared to large budget products. I hope that the great budget and their studios are almost flawless. That's why I apply stricter criteria to larger studio publications. But this movie was just stupid. Period. The premise was terrible. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was unbelievable as a high school senior who wanted to deal with crimes. There was not enough depth in his character or his actions that drew you into your world. Also, in order to make this film more mysterious, the lighting of certain scenes did not determine the mood, especially in the store. <br /> <br /> Another disappointing movie that I can give only three points.
