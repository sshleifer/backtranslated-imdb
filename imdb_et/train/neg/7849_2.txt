The film takes a remake with the army after the last year, creating an electronic tracking device in the desert, where the first film was attacked. The team will be killed not long before one of the group of exercise soldiers sees anyone. You can fill the rest. <br /> <br /> This is a paid image. There seems to be no passion or camera behind. This is a movie made for money and nothing else. At some level, it should have been working, it could have been more terrible in Southern Comfort (where national soldiers ride some people in the genders), but instead it was nothing. In large part, you can blame the script written by Wes Craven incredibly, which hits the same old targets over and over again. Add to the confusion that the direction is boring and the sequences are not so clean to remove any tension in the scene. <br /> <br /> It's not that bad, it's badly done and dull. Let me put my feelings into context: the reason I saw this movie was that the local multiplex spun and ran this movie instead of the kids sliding into Last Mimzy, and I wanted to see what caused it to cry (I mean, that films have so much in common - he says sarcastically). I'm convinced that this movie scares only those who like the last Mimzy.
