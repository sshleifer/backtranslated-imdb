I'll never forget the smart and great comedy of the ORIGINAL Vacation movie! The events, tempo and timing in the film are outstanding! However, this order of European holidays has been greatly suppressed. <br /> <br /> At this stage, Griswalds won the European holiday game at the show. The problem is that many movie jokes are a bit more than light, "ha-ha" laughs. For example, a flight crew on an airplane asks Clark: "Do you want your tree to be carried?" Clark says, "No, I have it here." It's really the only line that is funny in this movie. <br /> <br /> The humor of European holidays is tense. As if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first film, they tried to rewrite the script that had been done before, and relied on the ridiculous stroller scene sequence at the end of the picture just to kill time. What's worse is that natural comics like Randy Quaid like Cousin Eddie and the original kids who played the first movie Rusty and Audrey have not been found anywhere. Replacing them is not funny; you can't act and just look like they usually move over time. There are also a few sex jokes and comments that are not only funny, they have a bad taste. The place that made them a legend! Don't join them in this terrible adventure in Europe. Instead, viewers should watch the original movie instead. You're glad you did.
