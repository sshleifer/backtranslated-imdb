This movie really, I mean really sucks. It got a lot of holes in the plot and a 30 ft dragon could fit through them. Not to mention a dragon, which is inevitably the worst computer-generated image ever put on a film. I mean, if you see something like this, you have to think "Wow, someone actually did that. Then you released it. No matter who they are, I'm sure they won't work in the movie business anymore. <br /> <br /> this movie was hired, it wasn't on a DVD, so I (reluctantly) took it out of the video. The first thing that came to me was a two-finger ring master. reluctantly), giving 1 star to the movie, otherwise I would have zero marks on it. Next, they used a split screen technique (like Hulk) to (I assume) compensate for the fear of this piece of film. On the cover of the box we see a picture of our hero and dragon. in both cases, the movie The dragon looks like Gremlins 2 rejection and since the early 90s (maybe worse) the Nintendo video game disappears. Also, dragon movement is not as it continues its victims - the same F ## cking monotonous movement - right leg, left leg, right leg left foot, dom, dom DOM, DOM F # $ king DOOOOOM! It tears me. Perhaps the filmmakers thought it was exciting and would have the same jaw effect. Why not drag Dragon POV. Either way, it was just funny, just like watching Weebl's tone. <br /> <br /> Dean Cain gives a glimpse of the film during his film (perhaps his meeting with this film may end his career). Don't wait for Superman here. For the first time I saw the trailer of this movie, I thought it was a PS2 game. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's so bad that my 5-year-old brother can get better than he doesn't convince me why he was in my room in my fairytale when I wasn't there. Oh, and I mentioned that I am F @ # KING HATE PEOPLE WHO WILL HAVE THIS INCREDIBLY STUPID STUPID CRAP ATROCIOUS FILM? !!!
