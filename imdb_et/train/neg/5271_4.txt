An American generation in the West, discovering a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. They know little that this ghost town was once a test site for nuclear bombs and a deadly presence for them. I generally love such mystery-horror films. "Cube", Spielberg's "Duel" and "The Birds" are all great examples of movies that don't answer but still leave us interested and want more. Obviously, "disappearance" of the writer / director Walter Klenhard was trying to make such a film and whether he was successful or not. Personally, I think he got about half way, then the film just sank. <br /> <br /> Actors are simply "ho-hum". They are not very bad, but we, as an audience, never feel their fear and react to unrealistic situations. Does anyone have absolutely SICK characters who just go out to explore strange sounds?!?!? At least give them something like that!?!?!? <br /> <br /> What has been done for TV shows is definitely fairer than average. Director Klenhard It is to be praised that indeed the desert environment is being milked for all that it offered, and some settings were striking. There's really a cool scene where two characters find an old nuclear test site where the sand was completely glass-melted as far as the eye. I don't know if it was real ?? <br /> <br /> No gore to speak and "beings"? Or whatever hell it is after these people have never been shown, not to mention that we have never given a real idea of ​​what they are (mutants, aliens, ghosts, or ancient evil Indian spirits? Oh, it really narrows it for us !) or where it comes from. <br /> <br /> There are also many clichés here. Why is it that cities and folk in such films are always really, really stupid? Why is there always an old man who thinks he's crazy about what's right? Why? Why? Why? How's the new scenario, people! <br /> <br /> "Disappearance" is trying to be different and intelligent, but in the end it doesn't make it too familiar to fans looking for direct-video-horror feeds. Hey, I've seen a lot of worse movies and disappearance is not bad, it's just too ?? Middle. <br /> <br /> 4/10
