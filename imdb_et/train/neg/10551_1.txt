Obviously, a person speaks of a man who travels with the earth, showing self-harm exhibitions to fight his abusive childhood. I'm using the word "probably" because without listening to Andy Copp's comments (which I didn't have) or reading a movie before watching, the viewers have no idea what it is. br /> <br /> Gorehounds and extreme movie fans may be minded to watch The Mutilation Man, allowing some tough shocks and real material, but if they don't like the pretentious, headache experimental art house cinema, they find that this is a real chore to sit. <br /> <br /> 82 minutes of ugly images, accompanied by unpleasant sound, horrible music, and incomprehensible dialogue, this spirited terrible turning is a great way to test your peace of mind: if you still have all your marbles, you turn it off and watch something decent (I looked at the whole thing, but I am aware that I am totally thrilling!).
