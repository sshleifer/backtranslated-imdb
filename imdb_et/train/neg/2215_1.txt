This is a sad film of a woman who thought her ex, she loved so much, was probably dead, but her father, a scientist, had just given her a spell to make it a really cute shark-dude. Like beauty and beast. It can probably be used for dance ballroom dancing and maybe some song candlesticks, but instead there are some pretty big plants. They turn it into one girl's heart, so she lets herself eat the shark instead of scratching the whole movie. Scientist man is a good father who is trying to reunite his fish shark with the son he was involved with, he even arranges for them to have a personal time for sexual purposes, but the woman is a really low snob and thinks that shark man is ugly, icky monster and don't want to do anything to her. He gave up love! Just because he was a shark! I thought it was pretty sad how everything she had to do was kiss her and she would be back to normal and they would live happily ever, but that's not such a movie.
