I had rented MY HIGH - YELLOW from my video store because it was a 1967 first-ever dispute that I surrounded. I also heard that the US customs was initially confiscated when it ever tried to enter that country. a filmmaker who was considered "controversial" had to see it myself. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the plot is a young Swedish drama student Lena, who wants to learn all about her life. In particular, he wants to focus his attention on a documentary about the average Swede on some political issues, such as the Vietnam War and racial issues in the United States. Occasionally asking Stockholm politicians and ordinary denizens for their opinion about politics, he has sexual sex with his drama teacher, classmates and married men. <br /> <br /> What kills me about being passionate about YELLOW is that for 40 years it was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are little and far, even then it doesn't hit like some cheap-made porn. Although my countrymen think it is shocking, in reality, sex and nudity are the main cinema in Sweden. Even Ingmar Bergman, who was probably their answer to the old old son, John Ford, had sexual scenes in his films. <br /> <br /> I commend filmmakers for showing the sex shown in the film for artistic purposes. just to shock people and make money to show them in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good movie for anyone who wants to learn Swedish cinema meat and potatoes (no pun). But really, this film doesn't have much of a plot.
