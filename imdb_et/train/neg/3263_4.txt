This is the second British Rank movie that adapts Sommerset Maugham's stories to the film. Everything except the story from "Quartet" doesn't go well with the fire age; and the speech of the participants is certainly "truncated" because only the British can be actors before the 1950s. In any case, the "Trio" seems to be much tougher and more film-like than the first customization of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the problems that these two films can't overcome is that their source material was written 25-30 years before the movies. Consequently, in the popular "small morale" narrative of the 1950s Maughm, it seemed odd, if not honest.
