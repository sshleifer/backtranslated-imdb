This film is very similar to "Flashdance", you know that the dance kick with Jennifer Beals. This movie is probably the most boring film I've ever seen, because it's not even funny enough. "G.I. Jane" is much better than this movie, but it doesn't say much. Here Demi Moore sweats a lot and has high music and we can see his struggle and everything, but it is certainly not very interesting. I really think the idea of ​​the movie is interesting, but the script is too cliché and Ridley Scott can't do it. Well, as I said ... It's better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
