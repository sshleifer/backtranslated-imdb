The TV has an impact on society ... see the growing popularity of cappucino stores after the low work that debuted. Moreover, there are no problems for real people who look as good as these people. <br /> <br /> Besides, does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a comfortable Manhattan loft, considering what they do for life? NBC just loves to insult the viewer's intelligence, even if they are almost at Gump's level. I know a person who makes $ 100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a small one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, costing $ 2,200 per month. <br /> <br /> I would like to see an exhibition called Phriends, where it has six ugly addresses in dead workplaces that live in a harsh neighborhood where the sirens are constantly laughing and someone gets weekly every week ... and then the landlord raises the rent. Now that I look.
