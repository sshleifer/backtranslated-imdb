I really wanted like Julian Po. I think Slater is undervalued as an actor and many supporters are better than having the chance to show this movie. I understand that it is based on a short story that I have not read. So, I don't know if what I see is the film's mistakes that came from the story or what the director / scriptwriter put it on. The prerequisite is wonderful, and I loved the voice command, capturing the confusing tone of the opening story. But then ...? Something! Several clich√©s of local characters ask Julian Pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide. It may be argued that it does not respond because it is not their business. But Julian is the one who only publicly disclosed his intentions under symbolic pressure. Then Julian and the director / writer do not seem to be, despite the fact that Julian's character keeps a magazine recorded for God's sake, a tendency to offer something other than a little preliminary information about Julian's life. He says he's an accountant. He says his family moved when he was a child, thanks to his father's work. So what? There are several interactions with locals that seem to be meant to enlighten Julia's purpose. But none of them goes anywhere, because Julian seems to keep all these terrible locals as if they were aliens from another planet, as if they were one (and only) healthy among them. It can act as an allegory when Julian Po had some defining qualities or something that approached wisdom. The closest thing she reveals about herself is the scene where she deliberately humiliates the naive, religious woman of the mechanic. And what this scene shows is not something that inspires Julia's empathy. I see only Julian's character - which is rendered - so selfish, small and completely sprawling. Similar responses to the attitude of the director of this film baked by that party. And for poor Michael Parks, an actor who had ever had so many promises, nothing can be done here.
