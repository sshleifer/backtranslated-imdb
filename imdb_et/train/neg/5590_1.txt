Terrible movie. About an old tough painter hanging out with a young girl. Bored. Tatum O Neil passes through his movements and has some of the most important features in film history. Richard Burton sees death in this film, and we should believe he looks good. Operation is bad, as is the plot. The characters are terrible, as is the story. It's really hard to know anyone in this movie, except for Larry Ewashen, who plays in a boy theater that hits Tatum, he's funny. This movie is indeed a waste of time. If you are a fan of Tatum, like me - why I rented it for the first time - don't look at this movie. He's really bad about it, and you don't know if PAPER MOON was a fluke. It wasn't because BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS are known to be able to do well, but still not rent it. And if you're a Burton fan, rent something if he was good looking, not fossil.
