Being a fan of Elvis, I don't understand how to do this. It is by far the slowest Elvis-related film, which is completely wrong, stupid and a lot of mistakes about the king. Come on, Elvis's tomb in a public park? In 1958, suspicious thoughts were mentioned ... and these are just two examples. Some people cast their trying to do their best, Mike Starr is funny (specially as an impersonator), Tom Hanks's home is a surprise, but a boy who plays young Elvis. Generally there is no fun in the movie and becomes a boring minute minute. If you want to see a very cheap, crazy, but totally funny little movie about Elvis, I suggest you "Bubba Ho-Tep" instead of this confusion.
