After waking up at 3:30 in the morning and not being able to sleep, I decided that I might also have entertainment if I have suffered from sleep disorders. This movie was in HBO and I decided to watch it. What's wrong! <br /> <br /> Here's a plot (possible spoilers, if you care about it): A neurotic man with a candy addiction (Josh Kornbluth) works at a ridiculous company temp. Suddenly he is offered the opportunity to "go permissive", which seems to be the favorite phrase of this movie. But through secure work and secure income, Josh decides on any stupid reason that he doesn't want to do it. He hopelessly crushes several smaller tasks, and his laziness and lack of ambition fulfill me with contempt. His inability to send several "very important" stars for a certain period of time should be fun, but it's just stupid. Josh meets and deceives a woman as a lawyer and ends up in bed (probably Josh's fantasy in real life, because such a thing would never happen). A lot of other things happen, but it's too small and unfair to go now. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film is a comedy, I laughed only twice; for the first time, Josh Kornbluth's opening game (my original reaction was a frightening fear) and the second was when he was in bed with an attractive woman (yes, better). Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most terrible person I've ever seen in my life. He is an unpleasant, overweight, bald Jewish man whom I should believe to have sex with beautiful women. I don't know Joshi's character at all. He is lazy and unmotivated and I just don't understand successful humor. Leave it out even if your life depends on it.
