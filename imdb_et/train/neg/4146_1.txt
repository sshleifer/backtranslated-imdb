After watching this thing, you read the summary on the back of the DVD, thinking back to the real movie .... I became a little dizzy. I thought I forgot that I was a child with a syndrome traveling through an endless forest where people travel 11 miles per hour and stop for purposes other than the occasionally tasteless lesbian. Where (zombies?) Come out somewhere (vampires?), Who (seduces?) Clean cordial citizens on their way to saving the world. Neither the zombie nor the vampire are particularly exposed. The only fight I remember was that I got this walrus Bonny Giroux panties off. Coo Coo ca FAT! All of them! Maybe it was because we watched it on a widescreen that was stretched and too lazy to turn it into a native resolution, but it really made it more fun ... All in all, my final thoughts were more consistency, graph, character development, antagonism, the theme of it works then all over the movie. It made Bloodrayne look like Citizen F *** ING KANE
