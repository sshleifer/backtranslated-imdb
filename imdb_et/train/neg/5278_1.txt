If your comedy film has its marvelous back cover on the soundtrack, you will know that you are not dealing with the upper bound film. I rented this movie with friends who were waiting for some smiles, but in general I got most of our smiles fun, amusing the movie. We wouldn't have chosen the inferior movie. <br /> <br /> The film may have been a decent change with some changes. First of all, the comedy was painful. Physical gags were poorly executed and placed. The greasy boy in the movie made us want to kill ourselves, bless him to try out the scene and the scene, but he was like a puppy who asked for love. If he had pulled the film, it would have been tolerable. There were some funny jokes, I believe one was when a group of boys steals one parent from porn movies and this is gay porn. But to best compile comedy, I just say to the open-minded play of a greasy child. She wears a colored shirt and talks about not knowing when something has been done. School scenes and graduation that are longer than thirty seconds of random shooting. <br /> <br /> OH, BTW, has two good elements on the film. Kadeem Hardison plays his role wonderfully and fills his jokes so that none of them will be overlooked or underestimated. Another movie redeeming element is the beautiful Mrs. Ali Landry. His character is ignored by most of the shameful films. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time even letting it out. It didn't like me and I was part of the target group (18 men).
