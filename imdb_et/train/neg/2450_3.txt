I watched Lord Jackson's Lord version when I was reading two towers and I thought it was brilliant. <br /> <br /> At that time, the Lord's animated version of the rings appeared on the DVD, but I told myself that I would stop reading the return of two kings and kings before seeing it (as I thought it showed the whole trilogy). went and brought to the DVD what was a stupid idea, because it was completely garbage. from this movie, one might even think that at least 1 and a half of the books would fit into a 2-hour 8-minute film. <br /> <br /> No characters felt any emotion while talking, and it didn't seem like reading this page, even my favorite figure, Gandalf, didn't seem interesting at all. <br /> <br /> Animation was the only part of the movie except the orcs (they looked awful) and Aragorn and Sam face. <br /> <br /> I don't know how this movie was released because there wasn't even a good ending there, but maybe it was a good thing for the maker to run out because the film didn't get any better. <br /> <br /> I hope no one will rate books by this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
