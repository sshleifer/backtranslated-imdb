This is pretty bad if the overall movie summary has more information than the film itself. The length of the "plot summary" written on the movie page contains details that I couldn't read from watching the actual movie. I found myself constantly to see what details I missed, which could tell me what (bleeding) is going on. Alas, without results - this film leaves out the monstrous pieces of stories if you could name this story. It's like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some film here, just filming that the story would be similar and the rest left our imagination. Newsletter for creators: I paid to see how you made the movies. I can sit home and imagine free plots and story. And Rosario Dawson? This is someone I have never paid enough attention to put my name on the face, and I see why. He had one of the more artificial productions I've ever seen in any movie, A or B. I thought it was okay, maybe he didn't want this role, just got a great offer for the film he wasn't in? Wrong. He was one of the producers. The next time you produce something, don't book yourself as a leader if you can't act. If you really can, create a decent character for you. Someone here also mentioned the white / latino problem - yes, I hate to say this, but this film is not facing white college-aged men wearing a baseball cap. This happens when there is nothing in the movie that monitors the latino characters of the guard. Adriani's character seems to be a stabbing jerk who is no better than a story antagonist. With the Maya nature, he didn't seem real. Anyway, I'm ashamed of Hollywood that this movie was even made.
