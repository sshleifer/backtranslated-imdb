I've seen many movies from China and Hong Kong. That's the worst. No, the worst was "Unknown pleasures". I looked at "Platform" last night and thought the other two movies by Jia Zhang Ke should be better. Tonight I was disappointed again. I'm not watching "Xiao Wu" tomorrow night, because I put all three movies in the trash! Anyone who gave this film "Ten Ten Platforms" must watch more cinema! Photography was very poor: it was very difficult to distinguish between some stars because of the lack of close work. The story was so separate that I quickly sent it to the end because of pure frustration. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Give me every day Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage. These are true masters of Chinese cinema, not pretentious men!
