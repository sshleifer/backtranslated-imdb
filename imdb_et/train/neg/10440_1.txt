If you are not 10 to 14 years old (except for the R rating), there are very few things here. One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we should see him more) and Sam Jackson are humorous, and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can consider her surroundings, but unfortunately it is so. Poor plot. Poor performance. Worse writing and delivery. Special effects are bad. As far as the whole situation is a strange and terrible joke, important individual hidden situations are equally terrible. When we take into account the parts of the activity, some films have very incredible actions that will make you confused and have some that will boost you. This movie only contains the last type. It leaves little left. I'm so glad you didn't pay for it. <br /> <br /> Despite every leap, I can read and think, so when I looked, I didn't expect anything good. I had no expectations, but I was somewhat concerned about going in. But like a train wreck, one can't just look. And even without expectations, I was down. Bad. Not even "so bad, it's good" material. I'm tolerant of very bad movies, but it makes Oscar worth the "six-string samurai" I liked. <br /> <br /> No, this CGI garbage is in the same company as Battlefield Earth, Little Man and Gigli. The way it is currently rated 7.2 is completely mystifying me. Brainstorming or stacking the voting system is all I mean in response. <br /> <br /> I can go on and on, but it is enough to say that I saw a train wreck tonight. I have to wash my eyes. 1 out of 10
