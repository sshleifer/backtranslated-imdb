Nobody owes Ang Lee an excuse. In fact, there are many people. And I'll start. I was never interested in Ang Lee's movie Hulk because of almost unanimous bad reviews. Also, premium cable TVs were rarely seen. Finally, I decided to watch it on the US network yesterday and ... wow .... <br /> <br /> ANG LEE WHOLESE AND ANY QUANTITY SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Was it boring! I almost didn't do it through Ang Lee Hull. Eric Bana was outrageous, Nick Nolte was terrible, Sam Elliott was unlikely (and it's not fun, he's usually cool). In fact, I think they chose Eric Bana because his non-descriptive face was the easiest way to emulate computer graphics - and it was clear that Ang Lee Hulk had to see Bruce Banner in his angry state. When Hulk fought with mutant woolen trees, I was ready to give Hulk to the worst superhero movie ever. <br /> <br /> But something happened. About 3/4 doing this annoying movie, was really exciting and - dare to say - reasonably convincing - an extended action scene that starts with Hull's defense chamber, M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert, then riding the F22 Raptor stratosphere, San Francisco only on the streets. It was one of the best sequences ever made for a superhero movie. And I have to say that CGI was pretty good. That doesn't mean Hulk was absolutely convincing. But it didn't require much more incredible stops than needed in many non-super hero films. And it's pretty nice. <br /> <br /> Of course, Bruce Banner's father became really stupid, turning into a shape-shifting frog, but the previous long-term sequence put every Iron Man's short hero into shame. And in general, with the exception of animated mutant dogs, it really seemed like Hulk, who in Hulk tried to convince you that he was real and actually communicating with his environment. It was definitely better than I expected. <br /> <br /> OK, but what's incredible Hulk? Guess ... It's boring! Hulk has only a few appearances and here's the thing - the CGI of this movie is terrible. Perhaps Ang Lee's version of Hulk has occasionally seen a fake and a comic for others, but also his convincing moments. The incredible Hulk seemed positively ridiculous. It had a skin tone and muscle tone that didn't even look like a living being, but a texture created by a computer. It was really potty. Lighting, the environment, and facial effects didn't seem to be 5 years younger than Ang Lee, they saw 10 years older. And there is really no excuse. We really live in an age when computer programmers can destroy the film as thoroughly as any director, actor or operator that could ever have been. Ang Lee "failure". All the same mistakes have been made. Bruce Banner is practically emotional. The general is so relentless, incredibly one-dimensional, that it feels like a tree as a Hulk. Love is not convincing (I have to give Liv Tyler credit to be more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, though both are quite simple for the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson goes almost as much as Nick Nolte, although he is only a few minutes in the film. Hulk really doesn't do much in this movie, certainly no more than in the Ang Lee version. The incredible Hulk was a little faster, but because nothing happened anyway, it's not much worth it. Oh yes, the villain is everybody as fake as Hulk. It is actually much more interesting than a human being as a monster. That's how I can finally say that Ang Lee's version was better: if I ever have the chance to see the Ang Lee version again, I can sit down to see good sequences of action, or else try to value the dialogue a little more (I would just be more likely a good part to move on). But the Incredible Hulk has absolutely no scene worthy of once, not to mention twice. It's really a heap of superhero films. The classic CGI is offensive to the audience - at least in the version of Ang Lee, they seem to be trying to make it realistic (except of course the giant bottle). <br /> <br /> Talk about how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings of Ang Lee Hulk by making almost the same movie. <br /> <br /> It's Edward Norton's credit that he seems to be far from the movie.
