I read the book a long time ago and I don't remember the plot in particular, but I remember enjoying it. Since I'm sick on the couch at home, it was a good idea and hey !! It's a lifetime movie. <br /> <br /> The movie features B-class actors and actors. <br /> <br /> Female desperate housewives are cast. I have never seen this example, but there are many ads for the show and I get it. Isn't it the original anymore? Of course, but not in a lifetime. <br /> <br /> Male casts look and act fairly feminine, but girls must have spouses. <br /> <br /> In one scene, a woman has difficulty in her life, her life and what she does? Kicks him in the testicles. Whatever? Women love it, but let me tell you girls ... It's not as easy as always looking. <br /> <br /> It wasn't all bad. I got chills for a while or two, so I have to credit someone with that.
