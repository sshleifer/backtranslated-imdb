My title says it all. Let me clarify. If you've seen the BBC's "Planet Earth", which I am sure most of you are, then this movie doesn't like too much. And I have all the planets on Planet Earth, which I saw very high on the rating of this movie and read some good comments about it. I was happy to check it out. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I went to the theater and the movie started, I saw it was a Disney movie that produced BBC and Discovery companies. And when they started the first scenes about the polar bear, they felt at home on their DVDs at "Planet Earth". <br /> <br /> The movie continued and went on, on and on, keeping me and my friends on the scene were all "Planet Earth". <br /> <br /> We were very disappointed because I think 90% of the film material comes from Planet Earth. I say 90% because of some scenes that I didn't know. I feel like I just didn't remember them. <br /> <br /> So, finally, what this movie really is, "Planet Earth" is a collection of films from different discs, aimed at children. Yes, narration is quite a baby. Let me give you an example. If they show that the mother of a polar walk is a mother's boy, the narrator says, "Polar boys are not like children of a person. That's it. Briefly. It's compressed for" Planet Earth "children!
