The family moves to an old house in Japan. But there is the catch it haunts (BOO !!!). Aw, you didn't want to jump. It's just a review. Set back. Ahem, now anyway it haunts an old samurai who killed his wife and lover slowly. This, of course, makes a 3-minute scene that reaches about 7 or 8. A terrible story. But how bad is what you ask? Well, it was so bad that my brain started to melt and leak through the nasal drops. It was so bad when Doug McClure came on the screen that I prayed I would have a small miracle setback (yes, I know Doug was "out of this world" and not a "little miracle"), but it's pretty much the same fucking show , & I can make a "little wonder" better. There are so bad movies that they are good. it is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Beyond <br /> <br /> My Degree: F- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Mako Hattori Gets Topless, Susan George Gets 2 Love Scenes ( one naked, one just topless). <br /> <br />
