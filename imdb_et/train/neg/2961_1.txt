I was three babies for a family, and their mother gave me this to show them that they had just grabbed Wal-Mart early this week. All three children were physically ill while watching it. I'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate, or something they all got from school, but it really could have been this movie. Absolutely nasty. How anyone can calibrate this trash is farther away from me. Luckily, I turned the movie off when I noticed that the kids didn't react and act strangely. For all parents, I strongly advise you to avoid young children watching this movie.
