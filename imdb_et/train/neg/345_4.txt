It can't be Mandy Schaffer's last film. Someone, do something! :-( <br /> <br /> Argh. <br /> <br /> What a small life it might have been, management ended, don't blame cast, they did OK. halfway in, and please, please, Mandy for some more movie! She's too beautiful to bury her career so young. someone who liked this movie very much) First of all, how Traci constantly opens at the right melodramatic moment to see what he was supposed to see and what he did not see was very annoying Hollywood: use this lame plot device more if your script is not good enough to stand up without it, don't do it. <br /> <br /> Second, Carmen wouldn't have fallen fake injury trick pulled by Trac. He already had Trac's finger. <br /> <br /> I could throw this movie even further, but mercy denies it. In fact, I didn't hate it as much as others seem to be. It was not just a reason to do it unless it was a clean vehicle that proudly showed Mandy. And whoever did not think he was sexy, the character wasn't very well written, but how can you say he's not sexy?!? One or the other of us needs glasses and I don't think it would be me. <br /> <br /> MORE MANDY. (Must not be confused with "Moore, Mandy" - although I would like to see him again. ;-) <br /> <br /> P.S. Did I mention that I hope Mandy will make more movies for me? <: - D
