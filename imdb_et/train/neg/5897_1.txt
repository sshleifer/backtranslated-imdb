Recognized Japanese director Takashi Miike does not seem to have the wheels moving with this tiring thriller, adjusting Yasushi Akimoto's book to an evil old woman (and abuser of a child!) About the part of a new city legend: if your cell phone rings in a strange tone - and you see the message "One Missed Call "- You send the message again to listen to your last words before you die. The most successful part of the film is the grueling satire of reality TV cameras of the intruders of future victims, but non-complicated deaths (which contain hidden red candy!) Are disappointing and misleading. The frequent shots of corrupted corpses are actually relatively hidden, and this common courtesy may be the reason why the film is ultimately so relaxed. Hollywood was expected to jump into a far-flung plot in 2008, but the US version wasn't better. NO STARS from ****
