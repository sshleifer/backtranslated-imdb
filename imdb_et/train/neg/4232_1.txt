Karl Jr and his father are now on a remote island in the army. They hit the trio who stumbles on the island. Whose after a while ago. (well survivors) It is blood, gore and carnage that would have been good if some of them saw a real distance from the distance or if the output didn't look like it was made with lunch at the value of the week (I can be there overexxagering, it was probably just a couple days worth). Dreadful copying didn't bother me so much and I suspect that if I were really drunk, some MIGHT has been a little humorous ... maybe. But as it is, in just 78 minutes, the movie was still too long. Oh I don't know ... 78 minutes. Don't waste your time. <br /> <br /> My Class: F <br /> <br /> DVD Additions: Bonus Movie: "Zombie '90: Extreme Pestle"; and trailers for other Shock-o-Rama films
