It is quite ridiculous, I hope many people are exposed to Muslims who live all over the United States, the United States, and all over the world. Religion has over a billion followers. I am born and bread in America, and through my religious classes and teachings, I have taught me to pamper my country and contribute to society. I am very committed to the offspring of my religion and the teachings that I have emphasized throughout my life to educate and prepare for success through education to contribute to the world. I know many Muslims are all over the world and I have traveled to countries like Pakistan. I have not yet met one person who believes we should injure anyone or accept any other religion except the media people ... why ... Also sad that these extremists are the ones the media uses to represent all religion . The religion of one billion people, which is less than one percent, is confident that other religions do not want to be represented by FAQs, IRAs, and many others who are simple small percentages who use obsolete and not respected passages from their books to continue revenge, personal or business issues through their so-called religion
