Reminiscent of the dirty details of the "movie", it is like a rusty, salted spoon in the breast cavity. Perhaps "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992) was a little predictable, but this pathetic apology for the film is just one of the most disgraceful offers of commercialization I've ever heard. A boy fighting for spies / terrorists when he's home alone with chicken pox? Ridiculous! Why should this film be done? I am a person who believes that even horrible films are not a waste of time, but rather a learning experience. It's actually a waste of time. This should be avoided at all costs.
