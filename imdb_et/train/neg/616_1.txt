Let's face it; some flat boy who dies and his soul is taken to the scarecrow. Das is not supposed to! OMFG This stupid loser boy who can't stand up for himself gets his ass in some drunken worshiping his mother. Just when he dies, he looks at the peacocks and his spirit goes to the scarecrow. A drunken boy covered his death, making him a suicide and thought he had got it. Later, we saw that he was thrown out of the trailer and later he made another meeting with the scarecrow. They had a short meeting involving drunk, calling him a loser, and a scarecrow that would restart "One Takes One, Losing!" The scarecrow pulls the building down, calls him "dad-o" and then screams the poor man. We see how this awesome movie opens. He then kills many people. She kills mostly people who gave her hard time in rl, and goes down to kill some random asses, but some laugh. Don't laugh here. He also adds a punchline to every kill. Every time he killed someone, he made some karate slips and finish it with one of his signatures. When someone hears, he said, "Here's the corn EAR!" then pull your ass. OR we can actually take the lead in the movie! He just killed the policeman and was on his way to killing the only person who ever stood for him. His father, the sheriff, was crazy to stop, and he said, "Hey, watch some time!" and threw the hat threw on his chest and put him on a tree. At the end of the movie, he killed two men and threw a punchline "Gotta split!" and killed two men, bringing their cunt into their heads. Wowzors, this movie made me want to peel my pants so bad. Maybe the next time this guy makes a movie, it's not gay.
