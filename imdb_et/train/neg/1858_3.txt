The serum killer dies on a snow storm and becomes mutated to the snowman's evil twin. Then the deadly spree goes. Interesting plot. Sounds scary. And it's scary. If you're five years old. Otherwise, it is cheese. I saw it on the cable and I'm glad I didn't see that money. It has all the charm and style of a low budget movie that can become a cult film. I'm sure it has a loyal fan base somewhere. I'm not just that. Although I didn't like the movie as a whole, I found some scenes that I had fun. Like a bath scene and an explosion scene with Picasso reference. It was also fun to see how the heroes were trying to kill Jack and he just didn't want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a good low budget B-movie comedy, but a bad low-budget B-movie horror.
