Just saw it at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid it at all costs if you have no sleep disorder. This is a movie full of claims - it opens with a small quote from "Hiroshima mon amour" and it's all downhill. Camera Work - Imagine a child trying to track Wong Kar Wai. The story line - Smokey Robinson and Miracles "The Love You Only See in the House" was extended from 3 minutes to over 2 hours, but full of repetitions. For worship pain this film is with benches Methodist Church my parent dragged me when I was a child. I want to pay 2+ hours for my life. Julian Hernandez's promoter in the foreground saw that the film was "controversial" - it only applies to the narcotic effect of the film.
