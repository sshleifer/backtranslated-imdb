Looking at it now, it's still as skanky and sexist as I remember. comes from a time when girls were "Dolly Birds" and mostly male toys. It's hard to say it's in the Hammer Studio and it's available on DVD when there aren't good movies. Our peoples are shameful where the working class is portrayed as shy or worse! The problem is that you can't help feeling nostalgia on the bus for Clippie. Try to keep your tummy when you see Olive fluff? In 1972, the blue "chic" nightgown or something like Shirley Bassey was worn for the concert. A warning that this movie shows that the red two-storey bus I have learned is not a router but an illegal tow. Just just bother to look at something decent, like a porridge or a father's army ... or fly that climbs the wall.
