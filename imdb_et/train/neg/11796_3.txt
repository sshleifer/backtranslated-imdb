Is there nothing else on TV? Are you really bored? Well, look at Phat Beach. But don't rent it and be sure to NOT buy it. That would be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I watched it on television and found myself laughing at certain points. I didn't laugh long and I didn't laugh. However, there were jokes and comments I laughed at. If you're looking for a very funny "hooded" movie, check out Friday. If you are looking for powerful emotional movies (something that this movie is trying toâ€¦ look at), look at something like hoop's dreams or Jason's lyrics. If you look at some good black "catch", look, look at Dominique Simone's porn clip, because the nudity of this movie is almost non-existent. But if you have nothing better to do and this is a cable, go ahead and see it. You're a little amused. <br /> <br /> *** 3 of 10 ***
