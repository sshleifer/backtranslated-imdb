The title says it all. "Tail Gunner Joe" was a label given to the Senator based on public ignorance of World War II aircraft. The pistols at the back were based on a latch that prevented the rear tip from shooting the aircraft's tail, preventing the gun from igniting the ignition. When the senator practiced on the spot one day, he was able to drop the plane's tail. He would not have been able to do this if the weapon was properly aligned. The Turkish official responsible for this testimony, openly, in front of the camera, was responsible - he had made a mistake, not a senator. The fact that the film did not report this fact shows how it is one-sided. This film was meant to make one thing, destroy the image of a complex person. <br /> <br /> A much better program was made for him in PBS. He was a hardworking, intelligent, ambitious politician who won extraordinary shortcomings that led to extraordinary heights. He made some mistakes, some serious errors, but the removal of the tail from the plane was not one of them. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this movie is due to the fact that the public loves simple stories. stories that they should not think.
