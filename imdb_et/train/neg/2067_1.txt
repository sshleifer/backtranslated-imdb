Straight to the point: "The Groove Tube" is one of the most unpleasant, unpleasant and even terrible movies. This "comedy" is so trivial about anything far from being trace that it is almost incomprehensible that it was even made. I said almost because everyone is a fan. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even "good" bad or "enjoyable" bad. Placing this movie on the same level of entertainment as "Plan 9" or "Robot Monster" would be a crime for these films. Such movies that you can actually watch and get out of. But this film is so bad, so badly done, behaved and written, and the incredible SO is not just a trace of a "camp" or "schlock". <br /> <br /> Although this was done before the premiere of Saturday nightlife, the comparisons were apparently inevitable. I'm not a big fan of SNL, but this film is worse than the worst SNL skit. And man, it's BAD. Just to leave men's viewers, Shapiro throws a few pairs so often, but poorly filmed breasts since 1974 don't let anyone these days. Indeed, this film is so badly made and it is such a sleep-inducing tour, I doubt if they inspired anyone in 1974. <br /> <br /> One man called Ken Shapiro made this movie. I swear to God that every ten-year-old camcorder could have made something more funny and smarter. It's just unrealistic - it's really an incredible movie. "Jokes" and "gags" are so infantile that even little boys who want to steal their father's porn at night do not laugh. <br /> <br /> I give this movie one thing - the last sequence of the "Dancing Man" series, where a man (Shapiro) dances on NYC streets is just this terrible movie. Not that the "dancing man" is so big - it is definitely the moment when he is not wise, because Shapiro is desperately trying to fill the whole song, but in reality it was somewhat observable. The part of the sequence where the cop dances with the man is the only trace of the film. It is no wonder that Shapiro finally put this sequence - again, though it is not that big, just wins it with this "movie". <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this movie is so nonsense that it is incomprehensible how a real person can be so smart. The name of this movie should have been "Ken Shapiro Craparama". It is amazing that this has been done, but many truly talented filmmakers cannot get in. But I say I will contribute to the NYU geniuses love this movie. All the garbage.
