Let me be clear. I've been using IMDb for years. But only today I went through the site registration effort, so I got this movie to give the lowest possible rating. I've seen hundreds of movies, some of them bad, some terrible. Never have I seen such contrast and incompetence, high intentions, and failure. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is an enormously cast princess, but absolutely incredible as a young boy, Phocion. Fiona Shaw is always an entertaining character, but in dialogue with the film it is much worse, even than in the French game, which is the source (Marivaux has not yet reached Hollywood and we should keep it). For example, to illustrate that Leontine is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scholar, it is shown that chemicals are poured into the beaker beaker by listening to the names of well-known scientists. The romance between Agise and the Princess is even played by sillier. To do this, the couple should receive a joint Clair Danes award, which will be awarded in an equitable world for the anachronistic and unppired teenage literature of the 1990s' brats (see Miss Danes Les Miserables). <br /> <br /> In addition to the terrifying plot and dialogue, artistic tricks are also being sought. For example, there are times when a handful of spectators are dazed and, despite action, sitting on chairs looking at the main signs. The director wants us to understand that he has played. I get it. But it doesn't happen at all until the movie. At this point, it can be seen that people who sit on the chairs for a while will disappear, be horrible and disturbing. They are like a scary zombie crowd that appears through the fog, filling us with fear. If you see the terrible stupidity and song ending this movie, you want to pull your own zombies crowd and kill them all to poison your mind in 112 minutes. <br /> <br /> -Matthew McGuire
