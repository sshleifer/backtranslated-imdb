This is probably the worst film I've ever seen. (Yes, it is even worse than Dungeons and Dragons and a movie starring Kevin Costner.) <br /> <br /> Chris Rock seemed very uncomfortable for the whole film and the supporters. did not even look like they were trying to act. Chris Rock is a great stand-up comedian, but he just can't transfer his talent to this movie, which is probably just two intense laughs across the picture. <br /> <br /> If you haven't looked at the movie, avoid it like a plague. Go do something constructive and more interesting as you look at the air channel or look at the paint dry from brick. <br /> <br /> Chrise's efforts give me 2/10! <br /> <br />
