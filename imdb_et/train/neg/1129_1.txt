I've seen this movie because I had to do it (my work involves seeing all kinds of movies). I couldn't stop thinking, "who gave money to make such a terrible movie and to make it to the Cannes Festival!" It was not only boring, but also the actors were terrible. It was one of the worst films I've ever seen.
