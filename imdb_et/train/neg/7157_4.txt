1st reviewed 26.06.2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): A strange story of a druid witch trying to capture the body of her granddaughter by inheriting eternity. At least I think it was a relationship. This film is about the quality of fear that is not different from Stephen King The Shining. The difference is that in Nicholson's performance campiness was not at all in this film. All of this is taken very seriously, until the end, when some flat single liners and attempts to make the mood do not work at all. Performances are not a problem here, but the story is. Not everyone seems to have come together smoothly and the viewer is left with a lot of information and a real understanding of what happened in the movie. Christopher Walken is very small as the granddaughter of a granddaughter, who naturally gives her an attempt to sell a movie. Don't buy into these tricks and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
