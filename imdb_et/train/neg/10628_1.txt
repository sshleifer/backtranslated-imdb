This so-called "documentary" attempts to say that the US has distorted the moon-landing. Right of the Year. <br /> <br /> Everybody who has actually investigated the case knows a different one. <br /> <br /> First of all: there is certainly evidence. When the astronauts were on the moon, they returned several pounds of stone to geological research after a month. Those that spread around the world to hundreds of laboratories who tested them. And they all came to the conclusion that they came from the same planet, not from the earth, because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those on earth, but are similar to the moon. I.E. The conspiracy theorists will never investigate anything: they only take things that fit into their theory and ignore the rest. IE flag moves. There is a logical explanation: the astronauts moved it by hand, so it moved. And that proves that if conspiracy theorists even investigated the material, they would see that the flag would never move after the astronaut had been let, I.E. conspiracy theorists are bad scientists, they are unable to study the substance correctly or only study it until they have what they came to do and make a profit (IE documentary). <br /> <br /> The claim says it is possible to be filmed because all the shadows come from different places, because there are different light sources, artificial lighting in the studio. Again, the conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), the same thing happens at night with no light sources. But I doubt that any Conspiracy theorist has ever been outside his grandmother's basement for more than several days over the Star Treck Convention. They only see what they want to see. So they make up all those lies that seem important - it's a fact.
