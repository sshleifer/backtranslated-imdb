Well, did you start? This is by far one of the worst films I've ever seen for good money. I don't comment on the story itself, it's a great classic, but here it seems to be a soap opera. First, there is the quality of the soap opera, except for Eric Bana. I've always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here's the shame of every Bold and Kaunas actor. The camera does not work. How he thinks of him when he thinks, it just takes me back to the Brooke Forester Days in the lab! Peter O'Toole has had really bad plastic surgery or he desperately needs one. In both cases he sees Linda Evans more than Linda Evans! To finish her comments, Diane Kruger is a lovely girl, but she's not sure it's Troy Helen. Peterson should rather choose Saffron Burrows because Elizabeth Taylor would be rather confused by now.
