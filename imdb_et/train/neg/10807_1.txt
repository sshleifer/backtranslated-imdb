This movie has successfully proved what we all know already, that professional basketball players suck everything after playing basketball. Particularly staggering and acting. I can't even begin to describe how bad this movie really is. First, is it just me, or is it the ugliest child you've ever seen? I mean, his teeth could be used as a canopy. Secondly, why should the genie continue his career in the music industry, though he has magical power, but sucks terribly in music? Thirdly, I have read the Bible. In no way did this form or shape say that Jesus was brilliant. Fourth, what was the reality of all the embarrassing special effects? I assure you that any acne-infected teenager with a computer can do better. Fifth, why did the end end so badly? And what the hell is djin? And finally, having created a nightmare known as Kazama, you must throw away the plane and the Eiffel Tower, because this film takes the word "suck" to a whole new level.
