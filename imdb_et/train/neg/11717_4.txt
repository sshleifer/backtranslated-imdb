Many themes or stories are the same as in Leon, then other parts like some other film, I don't know what it is, but the whole film is familiar. It was a pleasant look, but it would have been fantastic! if the story had been more original. A little girl, a bad assassin of Leon, is just a little. The opening scenes are really good :-) It's strange that people want in the kitchen, in the movies :-) My biggest problem was remembering which parts were from Leon, Nikita and if they were from French or American. If you haven't seen Leon, it's a good movie. If you liked this movie, I can recommend Leon. <br /> <br /> Best Regards / Rick
