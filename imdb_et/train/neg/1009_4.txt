*** REVIEW may include some spoilers *** I will make this review short and sweet. I bought this movie from Best Buy because it sounded interesting and was top-rated by Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad it could be, right? Well, it's pretty bad. Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a wannabe journalist who steals a case that could lead to corrupt police in the Edison police force. LL Cool J is a policeman who has reached a special force team called F.R.A.T. (First response to attack tactics). He's with a "on-the-edge" bad cop named Lazerov (Dylan McDermott). On the home screen, we see Lazerov & Deed, who take some bank robbers, but at night they break a few men into drugs. I don't want to give it much, but things get bad when men do drugs. Pollack, who works at Ashford (Morgan Freeman), goes to action and Lazerov. He suspects an unpleasant game and, with the help of Ashford, some are studying ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey), all of whom are F.R.A.T. The team joins Ashford to try to bring corrupt police officers to justice. <br /> <br /> From the start you can say that the performance of Freeman and Spacey is quite weak. The only person who gives the whole show is Dylan McDermott. He's a full-bodied box in this movie and made me a believer. LL Cool J is terrible in this movie. He says every line in the same way and shows quite a lot of the same emotion. He was much better in films like Deep Blue Sea & Any Given Sunday. The movie starts with some nice action, but then drags the legs through the rest of the movie. The end is far from satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this movie. I'll put it on eBay this weekend.
