I'm a big fan of western countries, but that's one ... who's smelly! I think what almost turned me out of slipping was a dirty dialogue. I think I could have written a better dialogue in the eighth grade. And the poor participants! Given this terrible dialogue, none of them was able to look anything but ridiculous. Really, I'm not kidding. Some of it is a little better than Ed Wood's films. <br /> <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. He was probably the "big" star of this movie, which, if you called it B-Western, would be glorifying it. This should be called B-minus West. Injury to Sterling Hayden, who appeared at other times with Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra and other great talents. In order for him to appear in the vehicle, this poverty must be something he tried to put down for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> One of the tricky things about this movie is that all men look like they haven't shaved a week and their faces are all fats. I know old western men were not always well-groomed, but this is a movie that just makes you go 'EWWWW!' Really, it's a noisy western. Denver Pyle had to live it, especially after he appeared in so many large western parts. Bad, bad movie.
