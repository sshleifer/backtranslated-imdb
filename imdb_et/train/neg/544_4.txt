PROS: Akshay Kumar's performance (is it just me or can this man always win AB?). Some touch scenes on the other side. <br /> <br /> CONS: The whole hour (jokes were minimal). Every scene that includes Rajpal Yadavit. Greater stupidity in AB decision-making. Let me get this straight, he believes that his son's soul is brutally offended in every way possible (which is likely to destroy their relationship outside repairs) is a better way for Akshay to finally take responsibility, then actually tells him the truth? WTF? He believes that Akshaye is too soft to have the fact that his old father will soon die due to cancer, but he thinks his insult will make him stronger? Am I the only one who doesn't see the logic here? Just the biggest mistake in the movie. <br /> <br /> - Akshay becomes a stuntman. LMAO !! We were told that he graduated from college every year and has an MBA degree. But when the time comes to support himself and his pregnant wife, he becomes a stuntman. LOL! How do abt actually apply for normal work in ur field? Or Heck, somewhere else where life is not in danger? This is some incredibly dark writings. <br /> <br /> - End. I hate this melodramatic mess. Everything is pushed under our throat to know about AB's character that I couldn't. The whole thing reminded me too much of Srk in KHNH (what I hate). This "please feel that the man with the disease" has been running. I felt like a bang as a sympathy for an OLD man. It couldn't be seen in the last 20 minutes, so it had to go away quickly. the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Bottomline: Waqt is just too stupid to be called a good movie. Its apparent leader, Vipul Shah, directed it emotionally to the weak chicks and the old, who could feel less of a story that really makes sense. Give a decent song to the picture, fancy equipment, lots of glycerin-filled scenes and some stars, and they'll happily get the baby up like that.
