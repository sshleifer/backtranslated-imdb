I'm a big fan of Stephen King. I loved the running man. So obviously I was very excited to have made a movie about it. And when the local network showed the movie, I was in the sky. I was all ready for a fun night. <br /> <br /> The first indication that something was wrong was when I noticed someone had cast Arnold Schwarzenegger. I just couldn't believe that a man who became famous for movies full of runnin 'shootin could play a more skillful part, as described in the book. However, I was convinced that it would be a good movie. Who knows, perhaps Arnold had a hidden talent? He didn't do it. Soon I discovered that the only reason he was even cast was that someone had written the whole story to make it "shooting". Yes, it was a standard film by Arnold: the hero is wrong, the hero solves the problems, amplifying his mighty muscles and scaring everyone away and the hero gets the girl. <br /> <br /> I was stunned. This is not what the book said at all. I know books can't be literally put on the screen, but it wasn't even related to the book. Stephen King should have publicly condemned any association with the film and he should have denied the title The Running Man for this shameless film waste. I don't say that often, but this movie was BAD. If I weren't looking at my home, I would have thrown rotten tomatoes on the screen. Once again: bad. <br /> <br /> (Note that I used a lot of "someone". I did it because I'm sure many people are ashamed of working for it and I don't want to torture them anymore by naming them here)
