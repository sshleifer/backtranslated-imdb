The movie was shown here in Bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater, it failed. <br /> <br /> There is probably no water in the writer. Something was definitely gone. In my opinion, people must have a reason why they look at it from a historical perspective. The accuracy of history is not what we are looking for in entertainment. <br /> <br /> There is no substance in the movie. The only way to make this movie was to make changes if it was a legend, not just a story. And the legend has certain elements that try to tell you something that people have forgotten over time, such as the meaning of sacrifice, nationalism, and so on. It's called a central theme. <br /> <br /> Can't answer the movie, why am I still watching it? <br /> <br /> At least some strange legendary flying elephants, a psychological king or an eccentric king, like "King and Me" would have been beautiful, would have added something to the film's appeal. I think there was no other complaint except for a simple vanilla movie. <br /> <br /> When you have received a complaint, this story is the next thing we focus on. In marketing terms, we call it "must see". Listening to the movie's title, people would say, Oh, I have to see it. Now, where's the complaint in Kingmaker? Why not just rename and name "How not to be a king?" and make the old Siamese day comedy "Strangelove" style. It would have been much more interesting. The keen fans of similar experiences from the first persons who would have gone would have made the film very funny. <br /> <br /> Most films now have a "black" complaint, such as Spiderman, Men X, these titles speak for themselves. If they don't have familiar characters, some other film, such as the island, had a complaint when the ad asked, "Do you still believe it is an island?" <br /> <br /> In the case of a movie that has been sent back to "How not to be a king", one might ask, "Do you still want to be king?" <br /> <br /> Parat
