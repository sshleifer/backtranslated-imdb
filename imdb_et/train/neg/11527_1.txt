<br /> <br /> The movie begins as a regular comic book hero. This is about a boy who is picking up who has no parents and who is in love with the # 1 daughter of the school. Nothing surprises in the movie, there's nothing you can't come to the movie. Toby Mcguire shows us that he is not a good actor or that no world actor can save such a script. Perhaps ten-year-olds can enjoy the movie, but for the younger, it is violent. You can't think of thinking about movies like X-Men, Batman and Spawn. All these titles are better. I went out in almost 20 minutes! One thing that could have been good was computer determination, but not even to put a Christmas tree! So my suggestion: Don't look at this movie even when it's paid for!
