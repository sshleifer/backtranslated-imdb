The world may be over. Unfortunately, this film still held another testimony to Canada's inability to make films that go beyond condemnation. Perhaps it is that all our really good people (Norman Jewison, Martin Short, etc.) are going to Hollywood.) It's actually too bad. He could have given him some credibility. The Canadian government should understand --- and this film is a great example that breaking money into a trough does not bring good cinema. If people who split these public funds had to compete, they would have been forced to do something valuable. As they are, they have brought another beat.
