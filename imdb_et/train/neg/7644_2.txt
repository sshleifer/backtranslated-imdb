It's been a long time since I saw the last movie about this bad .. The actor is very average, the story is terribly boring and I'm losing words. It was totally mischievous. O, and it's as much comedy as Clint Eastwood is pregnant with Schwarzenegger! <br /> <br /> One of the first scenes (where is the TV show - where the hell are you?) got it right - 80% cast, let's be forgotten actors. If they were hoping to re-launch their career, I think it might never happen in their CV! The script had the potential, but 80% of the actors or the director (who is an actor and obviously should be an actor) pulled it away. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any other. <br /> <br /> I am sorry, but if you ever look at it - I suggest you turn to a less traumatic one, because not only is this a complete waste of time, but also a weak example of what a bad movie looks like.
