Now, I do not deny that when I bought it from eBay, I had great expectations. It was an incredible print comedy from the captain, which I enjoy. I was soon disappointed. I'm sorry for those who enjoyed it, but I found it very difficult to see Compleat Al. I got a few smiles, but most of the fun came from music videos (which I have on DVD) and the rest basically stuffing. It could be said that it wasn't Al's biggest video result (this honor goes to UHF). To be honest, I doubt if it will ever jump to a DVD, so if you're an ultra-hardcore Al fan and just OMA, buy a tape from eBay. Just don't pay too much for it.
