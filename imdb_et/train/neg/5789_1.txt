My husband and I really had great hopes for this movie, but it was a big disappointment. It was the American version of Mr. Magoo's American origin. A pathetic father who can't do everything he strives for, eg. fishing, hunting, obviously, putting your family on their wild fantasies. His "visions" are not only ridiculous, but in the process he repeatedly talks to his son about various obvious things. Words cannot be expressed as a bad film. Children and women are very real, which makes the film even more sad. I don't get humor ... if you don't want to laugh with other people who make you stupid. I can't get how it could have been awarded. Save the bucks, it's not worth the rent.
