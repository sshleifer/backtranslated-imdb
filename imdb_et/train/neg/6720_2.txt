Now here's a movie that would have been done in Australia would have been just comedy. Unfortunately and tediously, it is here, flabby and bright, and Lala is burnt from the ground. How did the erector get it wrong? Well, mostly being serious at work so hilarious amazing that someone with their right mind could seriously take. Of course, if they were a funny lonely gay cliche (but somehow cute) ... or is this clich√© cliched. There is no value to the story that almost seems to be Gus Van Santi's GERRY prequelina ... and a title like THE FLUFFER, how is it all such a weight? Well, this auteur must be so mad that he didn't get to Burt and BOOGIE first that he had to do it himself. The "drunken love drunk" left behind by the runaway Streisand's lodge has been left behind and only a spirited story of beef and TV series has been left undeveloped. Making the fourth action necessary for this overly long drama is really terrible when the film travels like a Gerries in the desert and gets stuck there. At the end of the 1990s, about 20 similar, but actually fun, MONEYSHOT films were made by Oz. Originally VENUS FACTORY was also filmed that auteur was more terrible than Orson, so they filmed half of it again, got a ruthless TV editor to grind it up and down to 72 minutes and hey-presto..comedy, today ! A lesson where bad movies make it easier. I think FLUFFER was free and after seeing it, I understand why.
