This movie was strange ... I watched it when a quarter of psilcybe cubens (fungi) was spent. It was really weird. I'm pretty sure you should look at it, but the fungi were not enough. I couldn't finish laughing. Maybe it would work. The film is a series of things that crumble into other things and dance. Its truly cheesy to today's standards but when it appeared im sure it was well ... kind of. I saw some people think this movie was good, but I didn't think it was very interesting and I was mushroom at that time. If your party or anything and everybodys are quite illuminated, then pop it up when you get some laughs.
