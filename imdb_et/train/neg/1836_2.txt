How can Barry Levinson collect white hot comedy talents Ben Stiller and Jack Black, gorgeous Rachel Weisz, old Prof. Christopher Walken and still such a humorous stinker? <br /> <br /> Stiller and Black are friends until the latter attracts the spray that makes the dog nasty and becomes an outstandingly multi-millionaire. <br /> <br /> The rooms are thin, but in the right hand, there is enough sound to have been a stepping stone between the two big stars, but everyone involved has every hand, every chance they get. <br /> <br /> Stiller and black are not just too much fun, Weisz seems sensational as always, but has been abused and, except for Walken as a batty barfly, who requires Stiller's character to retaliate, this is the tense end of the farce.
