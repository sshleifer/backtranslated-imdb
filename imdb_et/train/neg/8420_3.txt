Despite the great pain, it is an unobtrusive film, especially for aviation. It may be somewhat better than the extraordinary "von Richthofen and Brown", but not much. "Blue Max" is the best in the small market in the last 35 years, while "Darling Flower" is fun when not taken seriously. It is interesting to speculate what ILM could do with Zeppelins and Gothas in the new, high quality WW I airplane.
