I was at the origin of Puertorica, which was mixed with this documentary. It was first insulted that Mrs Perez compared Senor Campos to Che Guevarra. Just a fact, Mr.. John Leguzaimo is not of Puertorican origin. His parents came from Columbia. Where its investigation was not very accurate. I feel that the future of our race is based on education. That message should have sounded like this movie, Education is our way to freedom and power I think the future efforts of this production team should focus on it. I think this film pushed the anti-American mood.
