"John Hughes's son wrote a high school drama! Wow!" I thought that when I checked the flick information in IMDb, it was late on Saturday night, having discovered BBC2 opening credit. <br /> <br /> I've just finished this and unfortunately it was down there. Supposedly, you can't ruin this poor movie, but I leave the spoilers out of this review ... <br /> <br /> Very few very many styles: unfortunately this style hasn't been eight years after its release. As far as content is concerned, the film tries to create an interesting look at the nature of social control through the microcosm of school life; but under a shiny veneer, no remote or relevant argument is realized. The characters are painted childishly with a wide hit, getting into such general stereotypes that the writer's father wanted to ask in the breakfast club. <br /> <br /> Director Kyle Cooper does decent work by keeping up the pace (perhaps relying too much on the assembly of information that will soon become a tiring device, but at least postpone the story), but his efforts should not be enough to deprive the poor scenario and odd pain (how should anyone be with "Maddox" when Blake Shields rings and she shines through that part I just don't understand), let alone a plethora of opening holes (I'm all for a creative license, but if "bad guys" "know the" good boys "identities that make their lives poor, but can't stop them in any way, you really have to ask why this script didn't go through some redesign before production - did the father even read it?). <br /> <br /> I am sure that younger audiences can enjoy the pleasure of this movie (and all of their power)), but they are really better off with Hughes Sr high school output and when the idea of ​​school riots is an action is the 1968 classic "If ..." topic more sensitive research.
