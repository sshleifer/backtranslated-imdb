I thought the film was OK but very disappointed that they didn't hit the real picture of their lives. I was so waiting for her mother to be a real Jamaica that makes me crazy. Watching the beginning of the movie told me that the film was not accurate. What I lost in interest just a few seconds after the movie started. I'm very disappointed, this is like Mark Anthony's biography story and Arnold's playing. I don't know what the writer thought was missing a valuable movie, which I'm sure his mother played a big role in his life. I say the movie was after Fla !!!!!!
