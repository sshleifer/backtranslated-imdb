An interesting idea and story that didn't work quite well. <br /> <br /> When you see a movie, you feel as dissatisfied as I did. I really didn't know who to root in the movie, Taye Diggs seemed bored as a detective, the rest of the characters seem so one-dimensional and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> When the victim Alicia (Mia Kirschner) had been a more nice girl, we could actually see that the plot opening and the criminals have brought to justice. The problem was that he was as slippery as the other girls, turning the sweet girl into an opportunistic place. I do not understand the moral message of this film and it does not work as a detective story and as a thriller.
