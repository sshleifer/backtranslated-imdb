This is an experiment by both authors Edgar Rice Burroughs and filmmakers in Arabic "Apes Tares". But this desert film does not show any majesty of Burroughs' more successful jungle adventures. The focus is on the love of the beautiful English noble Jon Hall (like "El 'Lion" Chatham) and the exotic Arab beauty Kathleen Burke ("Princess" Eulilah), where revenge took place in their desire to join. Opening says that while guilty of behavior, the boy's mother is alive - but never gets into the picture. Unfortunately, The Lion Man has deteriorated and looks like there are no film footage. <br /> <br /> Lion Man (1936) John P. McCarthy ~ Jon Hall, Kathleen Burke, Ted Adams
