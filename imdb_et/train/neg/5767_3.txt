As mentioned earlier, visual effects are stunning. They are breathtaking. I personally use Blender and graphics that aren't easy for ALL. But that's all this movie. The plot is not confusing, but the general conflict is not clear. For example, Proog and Emo are trying to go out of the first scene who knows what. The conflict here seems to be between man and nature. Later, when they enter the bottomless space, Proog explains that "one step out and (you are dead)". Here is a more exact contradiction between careless man and nature. As the film progresses, it is clear that there is a conflict between man and nature. But suddenly there is a conflict between man and man, as Proog, somewhere, murders Emot. Proog is changing as a caring guardian who takes care of the lost child as a "sick man". He betrays us. This is not only frustrating, but we do not care that there has been no contradiction between the character's thoughts and actions. It's not the story of someone fighting, becoming stronger. It is frustrating and does not make sense because there is no great truth about the human soul or the world that has emerged as a great drama. In my opinion, this film is very underdeveloped in all aspects. However, the graphics are stunning, but the film is much more than just eye candy. There is no truth, no fight or bad surprise. In conclusion, the underdeveloped film with no point. ... but the graphics are good.
