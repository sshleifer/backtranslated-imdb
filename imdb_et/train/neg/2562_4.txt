Let me start by saying that this movie initially has a funny point between the narrator and George: narrator: Huh? Wait a minute! Who the hell are you? George: I'm the new George. The studio is too cheap to pay for Brendan Fraser. Narrator: How did you get that part? George: New George just happy, I think. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only funny part of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was still fun ... But then again, I'm just entertaining ... <br /> <br /> I wouldn't say it's the worst movie I've ever seen I am. <br /> <br /> If your little child, who is easy to entertain, enjoys this movie. If you are an observer of the film who wants a good and funny movie, you will be on the side of taking a picture.
