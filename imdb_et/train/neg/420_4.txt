For those who want to see this movie? I'd say, go! Without narration, it can be a very good movie / documentary. But music, narration, and some applied story make it a very difficult skeptic like me. After several animals, their lives are felt for several seasons as being the soap we look at. But the melodramatic point of view just doesn't cut it for me, besides catching the catch at the end of the predator (one exception was left there) the camera zooms in or jumps to another scene. I ask myself, why would this happen if they wanted to show the reality, why cut the scenes that the melodramatic fairy tale remains? I think morality is important to the crowd because it ultimately leads to: it is a beautiful destruction of the planet.
