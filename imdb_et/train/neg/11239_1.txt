Don't pay attention to the comments behind the curtain! Most people who leave positive comments on this movie must receive a royalty. It's a tough film. Imagine high school students with no money and a sense of humor to make a video / comedy. They get it D. College children get F or are asked to leave school. Since this monstrosity is done by "Professionals", I believe that it should be in prison or at least a cinema trial period. I enjoy watching bad movies like "Plan 9 From Space Space", but this thing doesn't even belong to this category. The script, operation, sound and control are so bad that it is virtually unnoticeable. If you like watching bad movies that are fun with Ed Wood, blaxploitation or 1970's horror movies. After watching it, you'll feel like you're wasting one and a half hours of your life.
