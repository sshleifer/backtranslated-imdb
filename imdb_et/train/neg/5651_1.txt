In my life I've seen many great and terrible movies. I'm not an expert expert, but I definitely have something to say. First, these actors are the worst I've seen ... Their action is so unrealistic that you even want to throw a DVD in the first two minutes. I don't think these participants were interested in quality. <br /> <br /> Another terrible thing about these dialogues is that they are so flat. Sometimes you feel uncomfortable when you hear them. Your 14-year-old son seems to be doing better. I think the budget for this movie was similar to the cost of my 14-year-old European car ... <br /> <br /> Please, if my message arrives at you - save time and money.
