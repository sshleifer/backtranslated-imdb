The 2002 Undervalued "I Love the 80's" is an ugly, idiotic, offensive, and disgusting pop-culture confusion that was the first to be the first long-lasting scary television program that ultimately explained the end of VH1. at the same time the only real music-oriented channel left on the TV! I practically used VH1 until spring or winter, I forget what now, in 2002, when garbage in this form for some reason started to appear. Because of the high level of curiosity (I think that's what you called it) I had decided to go ahead and give her a vision anyway the first night, even if the ads looked as complete. At least I can honestly say that I was not a little disappointed about this because my expectations were the foundation of the foundation. The emphasis of this exhibition, which was discovered in the first 5 minutes, was less in the 1980s, and what was and was not culturally important or popular (what I expected), but rather an improvised platform for all the truly godly no-name comedians who show what they mostly probably think their comedy skills * eyes * roll more than their absence when you ask me! Now it is quite easy to see why no one had ever heard of such an idiot before they appeared in this exhibition because they are all so terribly unpleasant and pathetic about their so-called humor, which I swear I feel about my intestines to make every dirty lumpy lining what they threw away one after the other! All in all, I have no problem saying "I love the 80s" was / is the lowest denominator of the trash and one of the main reasons I never see VH1 again.
