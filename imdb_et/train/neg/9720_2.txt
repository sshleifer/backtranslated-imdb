This movie is just boring. <br /> <br /> He is trying to copy some of the effects borrowed by the creative manager, such as Jeunet "Am√©lie Poulain", but that's too much. The dialogues are pretty bad, some of the worst I've ever heard, Guillaume Canet is not convincing (I'm almost never very convincing about her), her father's movie is playing very badly, the story is stupid, the end is ... stupid. <br /> <br /> I think I don't like the movie so much that "le pacte des loups" (wolf fraternity) from Christophe Gans (and I watch / watch about 80-100 movies a year)) but at least it the film had some activities and many good actors. <br /> <br /> I've never commented here (rated only) and when I saw rating and comments, I thought I had to write something down. <br /> <br /> I think we have no problems selling DVDs that were offered: not so bad in our (big) collection !!! <br /> <br /> I am open (I watch SF, westerns, drama, comedies, resins, horrors, fantasy ... movies!) but this movie was so boring that I felt like I would have lost one and a half hours.
