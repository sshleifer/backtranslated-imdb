Cowboy, who understands the difficult situation of a close Indian tribe, is blamelessly accused of rape and murder of a commander's daughter, leading to much hatred and violence. <br /> <br /> This crackpot nudie feature is fun to watch, although it is absolutely impossible to protect on artistic levels. The terrible costume and the fact that all Indians are obviously white make it more like a living comic than a serious production of what his press materials see. <br /> <br /> In short, rich nudity (the real reason for viewing it) is good. There's nothing else. There are certainly better examples of both genres. More interesting is that Ramrodder was filmed at the infamous Spahn Movie Ranch and has no one but two Manson family members, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who were probably already in the murder jail when it hit Pussycati Theater Soda Colored Screens!
