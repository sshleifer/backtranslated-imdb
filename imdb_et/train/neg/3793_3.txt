Nutcracker has always been a somewhat problematic ballet. It is little like ETA Hoffman's original creation on which it is based. <br /> <br /> Ballet is essentially the story of the second half, when Clara (or Marie in this version) travels to the Kingdom for a series of sweets to watch several character dances. <br /> <br /> There are endless productions that interpret the story in many ways (not always successful) to compensate for the weak ballet libretto. > <br /> The Balanchine version has no drama or story at all. (despite the fact that Tchaikovsky's great first-time music has a lot of drama and secrets). The result is a completely forgotten Christmas party in the first half, where almost nothing happens and where even dancing (the little that is there) is not very memorable. <br /> <br /> Pantomime too much, especially Drosselmeier, which may be thought of on the stage, just looks stupidly filmed on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, things are not much better when Sweets reaches the kingdom (Phase II on stage). While there are some choreographic highlights, most choreographies are fun and uninspiring. This is definitely not the vintage of Balanchine. <br /> <br /> Balanchine is widely regarded as the master of abstract dance, but I have always felt that he is less successful than the creator of narrative ballets. Watching this version of the film by the nutcracker has only confirmed this view.
