Allows you to make a movie of an already existing storyline that basically has everything that is happening at exhibitions! Well, if that thought doesn't intrigue you what it shouldn't, away from the ringmaster. I was dissatisfied with seeing it in the theater, and actually I was able to sit through the confusion of this movie. I think jerry springer does not play as it shows props for the show (yes, it seems even cheaper than the actual jerry springer show) and is only known as jerry in the movie. The plot (if you call it) is about a daughter, when she lives with her mother, decides to start with a mother in life with a boy. So the mother's brilliant idea is to call the Jerry Springer Show and get her to her daughter's boyfriend. (Is it a coincidence they live in a trailer park). Meanwhile, a woman somewhere else in America finds her friend bed together. So, of course, call the American therapist Jerry Springer! I'm talking about the rest of the movie, but even thinking about the film gives me a headache. Jamie Pressly, who plays her daughter, is completely unlikely in the film. And remember that Michael Dudikoff is an American ninja series champion karate captain? See her now as a white trash drunk. The thing is that he really looks too horrible and in shape to call it "your career". But if your mind for singing for Jerry Springer sings about your song or boys who connect with transvestites ... well ... SEE VIEW SHOW! ... at least steve was smart enough to stay out of this flick.
