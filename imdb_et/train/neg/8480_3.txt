I can't say it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. But then again I can't say it's one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> OK, so it's basically a girl who skates, is good, wants to go to an expensive school, can't afford it and must stay in a hockey scholarship. He must hide his skating secret from his friends. <br /> <br /> Personally, I didn't like the actor playing Katelin. He could not cry out to save his life, just shouting like a toddler pretending to cry to get his way. <br /> <br /> Katel was just a tedious person. How he tried to make everyone happy and helpful. Also the part where two skateboarders call his name and they say something about his choreographer, and he says he draws the lines that changed me. <br /> <br /> We all knew where he was going with him and Spencer. Classically they did not like each other and a kind of meeting was just typical. <br /> <br /> In general, I think it's watching a movie if you want to skate, but if you don't mind this, the main skater is extremely annoying. Basically it's a good time to kill.
