it's just a terrible "comedy" - it's a really bad movie. no funny elements. jokes are not funny. I don't know how some people might be "smarter" or "high quality" for this violent short film. maybe, if his only film that a person has seen, this statement can be made by the brothers. but i've seen thousands of better movies: leonard six (now, it's funny)! I don't know how brothers are even eligible on the internet movie database list: it's a home video rather than a real movie. <br /> <br /> Fun, just skip this movie. The root canal is more comfortable than the clutter's uncomfortable material.
