Wow ... making this movie speechless, I can't say much. The portable video mailbox of the local video portal should have said all this ... not just 6 participants / actors who disappear from the Scream kit and decide to film! <br /> <br /> The exhibition was probably out of the budget, but they could afford nudity and beautiful actors! The style over the substance almost makes it a sign, except for most of these failures in the class of action forget that there is a plot that has to go off reading the script. After only 4 or 5 killings of a disguised murderer and a confusing plot about the murder club that the dark leading actor thinks is the real club he can join (only if he gets over the girl who drops him in the car), you want your own replace your hand with the closest sharp object to ever remind yourself to get a good movie like this too happy. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for people who bought this movie and can't find someone to pick it up. Another example of what is wrong is when a number of direct and terrible horrors grow without believing it is important. Throw it away when you bought it.
