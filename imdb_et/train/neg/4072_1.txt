I'm watching bad movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not good enough to be a bad movie. There is no ounce of humor, not an ounce of talent all the time. <br /> <br /> I'm LAZY. <br /> <br /> Usually I see a bad movie and a curse. It was so bad that I did a review to try to save others from a completely boring confusion. <br /> <br /> I will copy this movie. Too flat to even use space emptying. So boring. See "Bloodsucking Freaks" or "Shock, Shock, Shock" for an absolute mess with some entertainment. This mud looks awful, terrible, and everyone who did it should be terrible.
