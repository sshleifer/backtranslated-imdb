I can't believe the positive comments on this movie - I thought it was one of the worst, worst-performing and badly-performing movies I've ever seen. And the plot was completely ridiculous (sp?). He starts with him when he's in the chair? clean rent. The worst part was that it wasn't good, even in a ridiculous way, even bad. Just terrible - I couldn't figure out why they even struggled to show it in HBO. I thought Belushi was ridiculously silly - a very unbelievable "eccentric" hit man. I could continue - again, I am shocked by positive assessments. The only thing that watched me is that it is interesting to see how the film may go wrong and what makes it bad. And the end is not disappointed with your stupidity! "live through the sword, die through the sword ..." ridiculous.
