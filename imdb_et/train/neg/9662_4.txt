I usually read comments before watching a movie. Guess, I didn't do it before viewing TLB, and I have to say I was surprised that the average mean rating in IMDb is. I found it to have a complete story. You just fell off it (and unfortunately not as Saving Private Ryan fell into the movie), and that's the end of a sudden end that was very pleased for me. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that wounded soldiers seemed quite realistic to me, especially with a low budget. But prepare yourself to laugh ... Some boys are thrown into the air after an explosion like the Olympics. During World War I, the air corkscrew or abyss is a bit too much for me, especially if it happens countless times during the movie ... <br /> <br /> But the parts that really laughed at me until I almost cried were scenes containing close fight. Screaming and screaming German voices ... incredibly funny. They seem to be spoken by one actor / performer because they all sound exactly the same and it just sounds like a "typical" German voice. <br /> <br /> I definitely do not recommend this movie to anyone except people who just want to laugh because of this sadness and poor quality.
