Shiri Appleby is the worst little embodiment that showed a good girl demonstrating Buffy's clone, Elle. But I go ahead, you see that Lilith was the first woman to be God's companion. But he got all of the evil feminist fury so God wanted him out of Eden. The secret queue known as "Fath" strikes him but does not kill him, so now, with Amnesia (which is not really explained, well), Lilith (now Elle) is free to get the Buffy clone mentioned above, who has to Fight the mad scientist who got the Lilith blood. <br /> <br /> If the previous paragraph sounded sad, it is. The film is also boring, the general and the plot on the film does not seem to lick about it. This favorable baseball CGI film was probably a failed serial shooter. All I can say is that it couldn't be amazing Amen. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Additions: Writer / Director Bill Comment Platt and co-author Chris Regina; and galleries; samples of video effects: before and after (this is also an "available" option you think you would take to some trailers but faster DVD covers for other movies, which is a stupid idea) <br /> <br /> DVD-ROM i extras: The final shooting script and deleted scenes are both in PDF format
