"Well Chuck Jones is dead, lets the soil with his cartoon characters, adding cheap explosions, American drawn anime captures style and gives them big powers". "But sir, are we not all prepared to have several examples of such works?" And these exhibitions make us a lot of money and we need more! "" But are every man and woman who has grown up with these times with less characters, is annoyed? ". set it in the future, make all these descendants of the original characters, and change all the names a little ... but not too much, but we still need to be able to achieve classical success. "". <br /> <br /> Well, this is the only reason I think it even exists. If you look at the terrible destruction of our beloved Looney Tones, it seems to be OK. But then there is already a teenage titanium, which is the same bloody thing. All characters are dressed like batman, they ride some sort of super-villain in a ship fight, they have great powers, only the difference is like Looney's stories and they have similar names and characteristics. <br /> <br /> This kind of thing is "it's so ridiculous it's a good" category. Think of Super Mario's brother's film and Batman and Robin. If you want to laugh at all the wrong reasons, check it out. If you are a younger generation (what this thing really is about) and you can look greedy leaders with shame, then run with it and enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this comic, then I'm not doing it for you, it's people who thought it was crazy. You know how they say piracy is like stealing a car; this exhibition is like a grave robbery. They could also complain to all the people who were involved in the original comic, pushed them on the screen, dressed them in pirate costumes and took the money. If this exhibition did not use the signs (those that in any case did not resemble Looney Toons), which has already made the studios, it is good. But not! Because of shame for the Warner brothers. <br /> <br /> When I saw this thing for a 30-second gagina episode of Simpson or Family Guy, I love it. As I just can't believe it's ever done. I would make someone that 80% of the people who work with this show hate it. But whatever it really is, in 10 years time, this exhibition is forgotten, while the originals live forever or at least until the end of the world. <br /> <br /> "Coming in 2008, Snoopy and Peanut Gang are back and now they have nice lasers and they can become invisible!
