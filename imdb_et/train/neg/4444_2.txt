Dr K (David H Hickey) has tried to manage a formula that would put an end to all illnesses and deficiencies, but needs live donors to complete his work. His doctor brother Richard (Dennis O'Neill) is the son of Eddie (Derek Philips), who has been admitted to a medical school. Eddie has a girlfriend named Sarah (Lizabeth Cardenas) who is a prerogative and plans to attend a law firm in the autumn. He and Eddie continue their relationship when Sarah calls her current boyfriend, who also shines Walt (Bill Sebastian; Eddie's best friend who recently paid her for cheating on her girlfriend's work). Eddie accidentally gets in the car and appears to death when Dr. K makes a recommendation to Richard. If Dr. K applies his serum to Eddie, terrible results will come. Eddie's face collides with massive warts, while she has also got the taste of human meat. Many die so that Eddie is able to feed this uncontrollable appetite. Soon he could even pose a threat to his father and girlfriend. Eddie Monster must be stopped. <br /> <br /> Typically, a terrible direct-video-horror flick suffers from a severe budget deficit, acting and general talent. The assumption, which seems to be interesting, is not even a zombie flick. Gore is limited to some scenes, but most of the violence is in the camera. Using the times to move the story can really disturb you.
