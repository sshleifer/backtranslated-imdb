Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly becomes a widow when his wife dies. Shortly thereafter, he will turn to an expert in electronic voice phenomena (EVP) Dr. Price, who claims to have received messages from Jonatan's divorced wife, Anna, using various electronic gadgets. Is Anna trying to say something to Jonatan? Is it just a hint on a larger cosmic or other world scale? It is good to see Keaton playing a leading role, but the story with which he is stuck is difficult and absurd in points; it is like a movie does not know how to answer any questions it raises, so it just disturbs the viewer with new, independent issues. <br /> <br /> Keaton himself is pretty good, convincingly like a sloppy widow who desperately tries to communicate with his late husband. She has matured quite a bit as an actor, leaving behind the fingers of friendly waacky-hijinks that she played 15 or so years earlier. He looks a bit tough, maybe some more wrinkles than one might expect, but he doesn't lose any of the crap and panic he showed in his quarter in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> So it's not that Keaton turns to mediocre performance is that the script itself is a subpar. The piece written by Niall Johnson gets confused as it progresses, any embarrassing path that ends with another embarrassing path. It is all well and good if the road leads to some acceptable testimony that links more or less everything together and explains ... something. But not white noise; I knew less what happened to Jonathan when I did before I first saw him. <br /> <br /> Keaton is really the only reason to watch it, though she gets a fine support from Ian McNeice (dr Hind) and Deborah Kara Unger as the necessary love interest.
