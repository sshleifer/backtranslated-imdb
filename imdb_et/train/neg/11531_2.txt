The plot is so manipulative, taking full account of the parents' most unbelievable and unthinkable decisions in each parent's decision. Children are overwhelmingly concerned with the transmission of charm and lines, but, as I say, the whole plot depends on the perfect idiots of every adult and, therefore, on being more meaningful about their activities (and at the same time) is the only way to explain boys' actions against total distrust). Why would delicious charming boys have taken a child from the shore? How did the baby get to the shore and at the same time think it is the last place to look? Why should 2 boys never be informed while a child is missing, no one gives them figs where they run with food and diapers, all that torment, what's going on and literally all the other places he's looking for? There is no reason to ask the audience to believe it. Asking to believe that this is a trial (even an informal situation) is too offensive.
