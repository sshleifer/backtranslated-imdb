This movie is like a thousand "cat and mouse" that preceded it. (The following may seem like a spoiler, but it just describes a big movie class) It is a passionate, clever main player, his funny but well-meaning sidekick with his poorly placed experiments in humorous comments, initially hostile but soon softened by a proud lady who unleashes the inevitable "unlikely" love story , the loved ones took hostage and, of course, the careless evil against their brutal minions. Everyone has already seen these movies and "National Treasure" is like none of them, just a little modified package. Any story was easily predictable (and I can assure you that I am not the sharpest tool in the shadow). I'm quite tired of getting money after leaving Hollywood movie theater, and if you've ever felt it, listen to my warning; stay miles away from this movie.
