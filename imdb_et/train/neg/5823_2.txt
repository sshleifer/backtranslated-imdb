"Drawing Limit 9" is a film that loves or hates; Fortunately, or not, I left this with a strong sense of wasted time and I was thoroughly filled with "whale killing is bad" propaganda. Aesthetically, the film may have been pleasant, especially in the first half, until it is clear that each of the actions depicted is an allegory of various aspects of whaling. So far, looking at the daily work of Japanese employees can be a bit of fun, but later it turns out that everything displayed on the screen is propaganda and no frame is an exception. I use the word "propaganda" because the film basically uses an old moral gaming device, where "good" and "bad" are not derived from action, but are placed in stone. This is probably only me, but I think that such art is low and its predecessor, even if it is all about the supreme (not sarcasic) endeavor of environmental protection. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this cardinal sin when film material is stretched without stretching is justifiable. In my opinion, Drawing Restraint 9 could easily fit within 75 minutes, but its length is 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting shots, but they weren't enough to leave 15-minute gaps without notice. The film has no ordinary scenario and no character, but it is not a documentary, but a conceptual installation. This is an unusual form of film, but it can still be considered art even if the concept is as simple and naive as here. I also believe that the director should have had honesty and not pretend that it could be delivered in no less than 135 minutes. <br /> <br /> And the music score mostly resembles whale chains. How surprising. <br /> <br /> 2/10
