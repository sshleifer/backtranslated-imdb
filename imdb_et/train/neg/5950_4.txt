My first question after seeing the movie was, "Why is the title LIAM?" If you wanted to tell a story from a boy's point of view, it wasn't done well. Of course, when using camera corners, the boy's scenes were also formal, but much of the decisive action took place outside his field of view. The lack of the "main" character (which obviously refers to the silence of the child, the powerless position) makes it difficult to give this character much deeper. <br /> <br /> Melodrama is defined as "dramatic or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotypical characters, exaggerated emotions and language, simplified morality, and conflict" LIAM is suitable for such a definition of T.. The viewer hits the stereotypes of the fire and the Catholic Church, which were dipped in the head. and a well-fed priest pushing money from the parishioners. (Stereotype that is becoming very tiring.) What's more, Jewish characters are money lenders and factory owners! <br /> <br /> Much of the movie was predictable ... Who didn't think we'd watch Theresa's wash when her mother told her, "No daughter will chew another woman's toilet!" I'm a fan of British Realism, if it's done well. In my opinion, LIAM is not. <br /> <br />
