I'm a fan of Jean Harlow because he had the quality of a star. I don't think his films are good and I don't even think he was a good actor, but he was definitely great in comedies. Missouri girl is very good. But this film is probably a love story. Jean Harlow is wonderful in this and you can forget the rest - their performances are not new. I am always impressed to think that Harlow's beautiful body was a sick woman. Well, in this movie he looks beautiful.
