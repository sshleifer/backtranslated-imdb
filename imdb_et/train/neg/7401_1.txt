Lord is at best a mediocre band and one trick can only get you so far. <br /> <br /> For all who market idiots there: this is why Finland often has a minority complex. trying to export something. <br /> <br /> Lord is not scary. Lord is flat. Lord is over. <br /> <br /> I want to excuse the rest of the world for this plastic idiocy. Of course, they won the Eurovision Song Contest. <br /> <br /> No, wait - they won the Eurovision Song Contest. That's it. I'm talking about my case.
