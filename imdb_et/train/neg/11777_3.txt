Years ago, I saw the Godfather and it made me a lasting impression, the atmosphere of the film was first-class, memorable and classical. Recently, I bought Trilogy and after watching Part 1 again, I was eager to watch Part 2 ...... I was so glad I got to the 2nd part early to realize that here was the perfect godfather-movie again, everything was almost perfect and I could not wait to see the godfather III ........ WRONG!, I would like me to stop II. The story was not good, it seemed to me like the story that was just a story, the characters were weak, especially the daughter. Pacino's demonstration was of a weak character that would have been in the life of the godfather 1 or 2. Then scenes such as Corleone were caught in the trap of the Catholic Church with a full choir, riding an assassin to the sunset, an invisible helicopter machine (where the "good" would be missed and everyone else left behind), the daughter and the first cousin rolling pastry over the table, pathetic shooting on steps. .... Corleone stuffed sweets orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and innocence is not ready in an emergency?) ... NO, it wasn't good and the best will of the world can't look it again. But I look 1 and 2 times for several years.
