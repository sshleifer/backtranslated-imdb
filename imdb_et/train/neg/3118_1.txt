I felt the film was dry ... a very disappointing plot ... was waiting for something to happen, and nothing dried up like a bone .. a waste of money. One of Robins Williams' worst movies. i think i'm looking forward to a couple of months when it's on DVD because it seems to be a pattern for movies that don't work well in theaters when renting before the end of the year ... this is one you don't want to see or tell me why I spent my money for it! Plus, that is such a new movie, just 8 people watching it .... It was Friday night, showing 9:50. I also felt that it needed more excitement or something to keep us awake. When they talked about the characters in the movie, the voices were very small, so you didn't hear what they said.
