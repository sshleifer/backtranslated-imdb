Yes, there are worse movies. Most of them are made for fun, shoe string budgets, or t. a week's movie, but even if it was a weekly movie, it wouldn't be more than two stars. This is a bad film about a serious issue that has been abused by a woman who escapes to the weapons of the people led by the king of the mucus. (If this is an attempt to show that he does not need a man to protect him as a wuss, the man is superfluous and should not be at all). It has no relationship, character development, and heroine to cross the rat-onion. (I think she rubs her wedding ring with her boat in an independent tank instead of just falling off the ocean (where her body should be anyway) and after her husband finds that she is a moor, childish assumptions, which lead to almost his death.) I am always surprised to see such a movie as it usually does and understands that dr. Seuss has a huge untapped market for people being challenged through his work. After I have laughed at humanity, I cry.
