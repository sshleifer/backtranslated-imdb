But this film was clean. History was good, but there was no musical part. No song I cared for and no sound. <br /> <br /> When sweet Jesus was supposed to be a comic relief, it will never work. If John Adams should be reluctant to annoy, the rest of them tried to drop him in every scene. <br /> <br /> Hancock and Jefferson were the only tolerated characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Historical quotes and discussions about slavery in their historical context were interesting enough, but not enough to overcome the lack of music. <br /> <br /> Shouldn't you make a musical call except a few chirps, nothing else was worth the soul.
