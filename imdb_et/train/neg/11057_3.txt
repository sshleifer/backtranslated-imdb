What about Dahmer's childhood? - A double-breasted operation that probably has created his obsession with the inner workings of the human body? But the "infinite land"? The game he invented as a child accompanying stuck men was destroyed when they came too close to each other, suggesting that closeness was the ultimate threat. But his parents' relationships and mother's emotional problems, which were much more important than his own relationship with his father? His feelings of negligence when his brother was born? But his fascination with insects and animals? How does he blast the road and hang it behind his home under the forest? And how about his parent's divorce? These are all things that should have been added to the film. Instead, the filmmaker decided to give us a 'snapshot' of soaked at night or twice in his life, and to combine it with a series of confusing and sometimes unnecessary setbacks to events that were not even very important to our understanding of Dahmer. <br /> <br /> Why didn't the filmmaker show Dahmer interested in people? He could have done this point several times, especially in scenes where he is at risk of drugs, if he has sexual intercourse with them (which actually happened in a health club, not in a nightclub). Instead of simply showing him that he is throwing him back from behind. <br /> <br /> While I appreciate, there is only so much information that can be cramped for 90 minutes (or even a long time), but why spend so much of this film exploring his relationship with Luis Pinet? (known as Rodney). My only guess is that the director tried to build a Pinet character, try and scare him, but this movie should be about Jeffrey Dahmer, so why couldn't he spend forty-five minutes doing anything else? If the scene and their relationship were important enough to be fair in time, it wasn't. The scene in which he kills his first victim, Steven Hicks, is an important part of Jeffrey Dahmer's story, because it was the first killing and the consequence of killing the rest of his life. Unfortunately, the film does not explain that it was his first killing or that he did not kill again for nine years. We assume that her hair style is different and she wears glasses that it is a setback, but when? And why? <br /> <br /> What is the shrine he did at the end of his career at the end of his life? - One of the most important tips we have to understand Dahmer and his motives. <br /> <br /> Some people find my need for precision and accuracy a bit of an anal, but it is clear to Jeffrey Dahmer that this film has very little in common with the person he was doing and the crimes he committed put. Why bother to spend time on loosely relying on Jeffrey Dahmer instead of dealing with the real problems behind his madness and the ensuing killings? <br /> <br /> Finally, a film that is as repulsive as we should bear 18 testimonies, not 15. We had to see our perversion deeper to understand how he left the rest of us. This does not mean, for example, showing that the drill has actually entered the head of Konerak Sinthasomphone, but at least a reference to the death of people and its Modus Operand situation at the time of slaughter. Anyone who watches this movie who doesn't know Dahmer's story can come away, thinking he was killing only a few people. He actually killed seventeen men. <br /> <br /> Besides the lack of facts and depth, this movie is not all bad. Two of the main symbols are some nice cinematography and good performances. I would like to do it again with a filmmaker with more knowledge, more energy and a better reason to make a movie.
