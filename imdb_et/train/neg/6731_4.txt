Contrary to another reviewer, I think it is well written, especially the more fancy, the greater the imagination needed; and well done, because there were no other characters with whom these tens of minutes plus, well done monologues focus. But I'm just not entertaining such festive, divine memories. Everyone has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others. Everyone has problems and some are more intense than others. These are just ten, non-very atypical stories and problems that illustrate how someone's life (or part of it) is a film feed. Again, I also think of TV reality shows. So, if it's your bag, you might like it. It is such a thing that would make a good phone and / or internet rumor; but absolutely without any verbal activity. And while all the speakers are female, I leave it out of the gender.
