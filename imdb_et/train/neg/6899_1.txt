Ever wonder why the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands automatically feel black Americans as a sense of humor? regardless of their ethnic origin? Well, this film does not provide answers to this often thought-out question, but it provides an excellent case study. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of this film, this film is working for an "old school" for the Pacific Islands. , which immediately raises the question of what is the point of such a task. Is it intended to maintain the built-in stereotypes of the Pacific Island New Zealanders? or is it intended to use this potential market? The story is weak, funny jokes and the end is expected. This movie hasn't done anything for New Zealand cinema because it's just a peculiar romantic comedy that has no value at all.
