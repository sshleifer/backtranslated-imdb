Beast Wars is an exhibition that has jumped over, overpriced and overpriced. We will meet the characters of this terrible exhibition whose creators must be acid to show and try. <br /> <br /> Cheetor Seriously, they have to have censor bars for this man. How does he not pull out viewers with the same voice as baby Taz? (At least Razzoff from Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is expressed in Slip & Slide) Action Blast- If you want a line show to suck, get a G4 Tranceformers Cybertron-A show that should go to the toilet. Creators of a Good Job (sarcasm) Show it stagnant in itself and boring (at least Super Mario games are better) This show was a lot of followers who say it back, but I believe it was canceled for itself.
