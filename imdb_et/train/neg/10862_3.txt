I watched as 8 or 9 Herzog films and none of them affected me. <br /> <br /> I watched several documentaries about him. He is obviously an intelligent person with excellent knowledge of films and passion for making them, but does it make him a good leader. Definitely NOT! Complete anti-talent. Because of the above-mentioned features, he can make a good documentary, but a movie with actors? Never! <br /> <br /> She can't control or write. His scenarios are full of poorly thought-out situations and many of the situations / dialogues in his films are so childish and bad that they cannot be hidden behind the word "art" in any way. Not possible. Not to mention the unreasonable direction, so amateurish. Say he wants to lead this way and write such a mess as wrong. <br /> <br /> Like Scheitz's arrest and Storszek hides at the back of the store. WHO IS FIGHTING? <br /> <br /> He is a fraudster; he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want. He knows what elements he needs to enter in the script to get his attention and empty praise. Don't forget the rest of the script and the sluggish direction. <br /> <br /> Just look at Julio Medem. If Herzog can make a movie like Medem, I can check my old movies again and try to find talent.
