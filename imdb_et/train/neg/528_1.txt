I never expect the adaptation of the film to be too close to the novel (especially for a loved one, as in the evening), but when I saw the author of the book Susan Minot was the writer and CEO of the film, I thought the evening would be a good adaptation. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed this book, don't worry about this movie. The book is so far away that the two are not similar to each other. <br /> <br /> Here our characters are completely different: the bride is in love with Harris. Harris is the son of a housekeeper. Buddy is drunk, in love with Ann and / or Harris.

This movie is a disaster. Skip it.
