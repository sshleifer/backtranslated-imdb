I get that Diehl's character has to be American microcosm - we see Arabic terrorists under every rock to finally find out it's his own activity all the time he got into this state of siege and really when he practiced good will for all men , all have raincoats and lollipops. I'm sorry that Wim has made amazing movies in the past that remain neutral from politics and for good reasons polemic is your weak point and they weaken it with well-made, amazingly filmed, absurd letters, dialogue and drawing. Better luck with your next flick. Another thing that brought my crank was the belabored point of the homeless part of LA, which was there because of hunger because these people can't eat enough. Truly, these people do not eat properly, but the real hunger, these people, is a mental hunger, an emotional hunger, a mental hunger. They need self-respect, self-esteem, dignity that you cannot give to man. Yes, these people are hungry and if they need it, it is there. Less of an American hunger center, I would say it is the center of alcoholism, drug abuse, mental suffering and economic destruction. Addressing hunger, although a noble endeavor is to help the band deepen the systematic social and aging problem of the homeless. Bill Diehl was good and Michelle Williams was lovely as a young (still clich√©) old soul.
