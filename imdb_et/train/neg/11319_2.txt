Vampire dungeons dominate the world and use human blood as fuel, but thanks to Lance Henriksen and Gary they are faced with the renegade android (Kris Kristofferson) and warrior wife (Kathly Long). Daniels (who plays cyber in this ridiculous movie) Of all the questions left unanswered for this terrible movie, the one who has the idea to cast the country's singer Kris Kristofferson into a cyber warrior who can give as good as he can is the most sensible. No, don't get me wrong when I saw Kristofferson's vigilant or something, but not as a cyber. A strange suspicion that it was written for Dolph Lundgren, but Lundgren must have the wisdom not to do so. Despite the catastrophic casting, Kristofferson is an easy-to-use movie. He gives a lot more people to the performance than the expressive Kathy Long. (And Kristofferson is playing a robot) despite his failure, Kristofferson has a few moments of interest. Lance Henriksen is sliding and Gary Daniels is wasted, but basically Knights is a puzzled failure. You're awfully back, thinking who the hell thought it was a good idea on paper. (This is a film where a broken Kristofferson fights in a robot backpack) The worst thing ends up being a sequel, luckily it has still come true, although I still have a nightmare about the likelihood of such an event. br /> <br /> * 4- (bad)
