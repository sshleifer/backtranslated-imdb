Even when I saw this movie as a teenager, I was wondering how ironic it was that Pia Zadora played an artist in the movie who was high on her way. As beautiful and sexy as Mrs Zadora is, she couldn't even release this apology for refueling. Not even his photo visit to Penthouse, where "Lonely Lady" was advertised "back", could refuel this movie. The only thing that could have saved this movie? A completely different script. Give this one.
