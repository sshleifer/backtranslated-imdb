Well, you would be better off if you were going to sit down with the mother of a middle-aged widow, having a little more in common with her young adult or with her old daughter's daughter than she'd wanted to slip. A Tunisian mother keeps the flat around, gets an anxiety and decides, though reluctantly (she just can't help), a costume and dance from a local cabaret. Meanwhile, the daughter takes dance lessons. The common denominator is the Tunisian band drummer. This movie is so full of stuff that I watched a DVD in x2 and read the subtitles, fast transmission through many very ordinary dancing and hopeless walks (they walked everywhere) and more walking and just exploding with x4 it's boring, unententful, low Budget Flick Which Some How Collected Some Really Good Critical Plaudits. Get your finger off. (C-)
