Spike Lee has diminished after his previous advances and this confusion does nothing. I often looked at my watch, hoping the movie would end or reach the point. Lee's first film with all the white light is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> What's the point? Do Italians swear and like funky sex, but not with their women? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I'd go to the Scorsese movie. Incredibly flat character of the godfather is added only by the stereotype. <br /> <br /> I have admired several Lee films, especially "Do the Right Thing". This movie is a waste of time.
