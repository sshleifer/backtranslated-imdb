I rarely write IMDb.com comments, but I'm forced to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible. Just terrible. I like Shaw Brose movies (I'm not angry.) And I had great expectations about it because I found it listed on many of the "10 Best Kung Fu / Martial Arts Movies" websites. (I am now convinced that these 10 best lists are all cut and pasted.) First of all, there is hardly anything in the film. Most of the movie consists of talking about a plot that is an amazing game because it is at best slim. This activity may already be impressive in 1978, but it is customary to today's standards. Special warning for Netflix users: The DVD they send is terrible; the picture is terrible and not even 16: 9 amplified.
