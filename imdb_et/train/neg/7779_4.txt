"True" story of a late monster that appears when an American industrial plant starts to contaminate water. A funny, though not really good, monster movie has many people trying to get a monster and find out what's going on, but not in a fully inclusive way. Give him points to give us a giant monster that is clearly structured for some scenes, but take some away because it looks like a non-dangerous puppy. A funny movie of enjoyment that is pleasantly silly in the right mind. (One of my complaints is that the print used by Elvira is so bad that it looks like a copy of a worn video tape that was the main thing in the past 20 years.)
