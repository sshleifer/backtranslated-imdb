What is disappointing! The IMDb score of 6.1 brought some easy expectations, but I was disappointed. The first thing that makes me wrong is the braindeads, the stereotypical kids of the university. Yes, I know that teenagers can be children and so on, but why are they in films that are always portrayed as full braindead morons? There was one sign that I thought it was okay, but he (who didn't reveal it here) was killed before the end. Other characters were badly killed and even the supposed hero / heroine just didn't do it for me. On the plus side: The plot is pretty good and output values ​​are above the above cuts. The actor was not very good at all, Rutger Hauer seems to have a small role. But it all fails with perfect and braindead characters. You just stop caring for them in 10 minutes. 4/10 (and it's generous).
