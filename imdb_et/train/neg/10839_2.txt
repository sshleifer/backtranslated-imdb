It appeared on the biography channel and was as informative as the children's comic! I gave it to 2 out of 10 to pay attention to detail because it was mostly 70's, and three women who played the original three angels saw them so that the make-up was good. <br /> <br /> It was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel, but it was trivial to anything that is usually / usually seen in one's life stories. There are no interviews with surviving cast members, team members, production team members, or biographers of their friends, families, and their people. In fact, I now know as much about the program as I did before that movie based on a (supposedly) biographical book. As a matter of fact, learn something that no one knew about the program and was not well known for having ever happened.
