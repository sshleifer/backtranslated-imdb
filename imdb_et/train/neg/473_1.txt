That's what my friend Brian said about this movie in about an hour. He couldn't hold on. I was talking about how damaging it was and finally I gave it and played it, being "boring" adjectives run out. <br /> <br /> Imagine, if you want, the top of hacking. Something so indestructible, so impossibly terrible, that everything you want to do after watching is in the dark alone and doesn't tell anyone. Some people work under the illusion that this film is traceable. It is not under any kind of narcotic or brain injury. I only recommend it to someone to help them understand how truly unbearable it is. Don't believe me? Gather around. <br /> <br /> As a nation, we in America do not always represent the people of the Middle East tastefully. But what about a child in Sheik's dress, wandering salami in bottles of Castrol's engine oil? You can find it here. SAAB IT? ARAB COVERED OIL. I couldn't believe what I saw. It would have been more appropriate to take the aircraft of a child into a skyscraper. Who would think that it was a funny joke? It's not even "cleverly offensive". It just sucks and makes you hit who is paid to write that face. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the movie, a five-year-old singer group called "Landmines" takes the ball of officers at the stage. Okay - are you ready? The joke is THE THE SING TERRIBLY AND OFF-KEY. Why did I also write hats? POUND, POUND, TURNOVER OR BIRTH OF HORRENDOUS IN A MARITIME VIEW. They start with enough mediocre; the glasses are cracking, the shocks break ... then there is, I'm 100% serious, a two-frame stop-motion sequence that consists of a woman's shoes. You read it right - music was so bad, in one frame, on the feet of a woman's shoes. In the next case, the shoes are off !!! Get it because the music was so bad, his shoes came out! What does F ???? <br /> <br /> Then the endless assembly is equipped with footage to drive home to SINGING ON BAD. If a person has actually suffered through the scene in the theater without hell, I would be surprised. This movie is honestly like a practical joke to see how fast people would pull the door out. Robert Downey Sr directs the comedy as his son orders the drug to remain free. Bad. The other things to watch: <br /> <br /> 1. Popular music decorated as much as possible. Every time Liceman appears, I really play an inappropriate Iggy Pop song. Plus, all the participants do their best to act as it really got cool for some reason. <br /> <br /> 2. The terrible accent of Barbara Bach. She sounds like she's trying to talk like a baby when she rolls marble around her tongue. There is no nudity, and there are several scenes where the boys fluctuate and look at his splitting as they are in a community school class and they have been targeted to act like awakened slow people. <br /> <br /> 3. Liceman nourishes her disgusting dog's condom. Remember; when this movie came out of "abortion" and "condom" was considered "nervous". <br /> <br /> 4. Tom Poston plays a splitting, boy-hungry pedophile when Hollywood thought "pedophile" and "homosexual" were the same. Flat embarrassing. <br /> <br /> 5. Look at the end. There is nothing wrong with VCR. It's actually the end. Tell me you don't want you to explode anyone who has ever made a movie. <br /> <br /> Look at it at your own risk. Top Academy has reportedly made other movies, such as The Jerk or Blazing Saddles, less funny, just by placing a video tape near them.
