Don't even ask why I watched it! The only excuse I can point out is that I am sick with bronchitis and too weak to change the channel. :) It's too terrible for words, movie, not bronchitis. Action is regrettable, Richard Grieco hurls it as a loser, a robber, a robber who has the certainty of knocking the police. Nick Mancuso's phones present their tracks and Nancy Allen has the only sympathetic role to play in the film. The script is inconvenient, hanging on the piano, "Are you ready, Pardner?" Richard Grieco complains to each of his victims. Dire. Avoid.
