I know you've read it before, countless other movies, no doubt if you read the comments here, but the voodoo academy is still the absolute worst film I've been able to follow. undoubtedly not really buying or watching bad TVs, but even so I feel it is fair that I am not just a stupid tenant who was badly chosen. <br /> <br /> I 've seen two - thirds of the 100 bottom - up movies in here are imdb, and I mark all the other options. most of these heads and shoulders over this ... with exceptional absolute monotony. <br /> <br /> I like to evaluate really bad movies (like those who don't have humor, even if they're bad), how many people you need to watch to make it through the entire journey. If you can look at it yourself, it's not that bad. if you can watch it with one friend ... this is bad, but it can be much worse. <br /> <br /> Five time to do it through the Voodoo Academy. and even generally, no fun moments for watching bad movies (for example, marking boom microphones, 3 times when I'm not mistaken) could take away the dry taste in my mouth. Yes, I looked at it, but I also forced 4 friends to see it with me to achieve this goal. <br /> <br /> I hope and pray that we saw the directors cut ... there may be a 20-minute version of the big-eyed buttons with chewing gums rubbing their torso. so many movie centers around it. <br /> <br /> I thank David for being able to capture this movie with a short budget within two days, just as I thank him to persuade people to pay him for paying him, no doubt some of his fetishes Cellulite version. but this is not a good movie. The original horror shop was shot for a similar amount of time (considering inflation) and was the ultimate pearl. this is not an excuse for how bad this baby is. <br /> <br /> Front Spoilers ... <br /> <br /> It is not even worth opening the parcels or clicking on all the characters in the heroes. movie pace ... is crazy ... nothing ... not interesting how long is the time the pectoral devotes himself to massage. no matter what your alignment or gender ... rubbing just can't support such screen time. <br /> <br /> The actor is cheese ... but not too amatuer ... I have seen much better movies ... but somehow it's the semi-skilled delivery of some of the worst lines you ever hear in the movie, really grate . <br /> <br /> Rent it if you have like me, the worst for the worst, and only if you watch it with a group of people ready to get through it. it is not ha ha ha set wobbled thing. this is a durability test that you probably want to skip. <br /> <br /> I'm sure it's even worse ... but I'm not surprised if it has a decor name.
