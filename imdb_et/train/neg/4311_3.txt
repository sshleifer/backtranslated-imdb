I watched this movie when I was a young boy who was full of angry hormones and it was about as sexy as I had ever seen or ever seen. It may not be a great movie. I guess it wasn't. I don't remember much of that to tell you the truth. I only remember the sexual chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. No woman in any movie has ever done it for me because of the incredibly sexy Cathy made this movie. I haven't seen it because I first got caught on TV for the first time in the 70s and I don't think I'd like to see it again, because I'm sure it would be disappointing - my hormones aren't so fierce and I've become tougher over the years. Still, when I think back to the shower, I still remember how great it was when. <br /> <br /> Added later: After watching the movie again, I found it dangerous to go home. What was once erotic is now quite annoying. The older woman the younger man is still working for me, not as much as ever before, probably because I am no longer 12 years old. This older woman is now younger than me. Even my twelve-year-old mind did not perceive the whole thing as an amateur. Moral: Sometimes it is better not to look at the past.
