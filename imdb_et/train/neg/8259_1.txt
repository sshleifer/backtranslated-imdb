I first saw this movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> It was based on the understanding that autistic children could interact with printed messages with someone else who simply helped them and guided their hands. <br /> <br /> Then suddenly those children, many of whom did not watch the keyboard or screen when the messages were written (they may in some cases look for a ceiling), but their moderators were glued to the eye. Keyboard, started writing parenting messages from parents and others, sending parents and child care institutions proberbial tizzy, left and right. <br /> <br /> This whole thing has turned out to be a mistake when a third person presented a folder, opened it to a child, and said "type an unseen picture", when the speaker turned to the folder moderator, the flip would fall down, revealing another different image. <br /> <br /> The child may have seen the dog, the moderator saw something on the boat. <br /> <br /> Every time a Bloomin time was written, the name of the picture was written by the moderator, never what the child was showing. <br /> <br /> So who was writing? Never a child. <br /> <br /> This movie also took a disastrous course, as the Australian poster pointed out that the person who had infiltrated the film was in a situation where he tried to help the child. <br /> <br /> If Melissa Gilbert had never placed her son in that place, she would not have been a moratorium. He was better under his supervision. <br /> <br /> When I help my boyfriend to his organization and instead kill him, do I think I want to listen to something you have to say after that? Not likely! I think it is certain that all those accusing messages that these children wrote that this film was based did not blame anyone for their action here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, please remember that the movie gave Gilbert a very good result as the mother of an autistic mother, but not that the movie really didn't do much. <br /> <br /> The worst thing was that the child wrote to Patty Duke and we hear that the mechanical voice reads what he wrote. . . . . "We won!" This child was molested. If you cut my leg and I go to court and you are guilty of damaging me, attacking, whatever, it is justice, but it won't bring my leg back. <br /> <br /> At best, in my condition, I look at it as a hollow victory. <br /> <br /> No matter what way this child is perceived as autistic with autism, it will further damage. br /> a "normal" child is sufficient to combat such an experience. <br /> <br /> It's completely superfluous to think that you have to look at any situation and go 'winning' if that person is guilty of a lawsuit. <br /> <br /> Just treat the situation and circumstances badly here.
