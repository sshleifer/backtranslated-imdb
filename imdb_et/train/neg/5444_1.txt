It was in 1974. And he played Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> This alone tells you what to expect from this movie. <br /> <br /> And it was a movie. According to the film, Slovik had reformed, got a good wife and didn't want to fight. <br /> <br /> In real life, Slovik had been naive innocent or he just wanted to manipulate who Slovik was or had not decided on history, but it was a film about dessert when the state asked why he was fighting, and the film took What concerns the military who were in Vietnam in 1974 (as Willie Nelson would say, the truth was Vietnam War, not World War II). propagandist because Gung Ho was in the forties. <br /> <br /> According to this movie, Slovik stated his simple and simple position. He had a nervous problem. Heck, I have a clinical nervous system, and trust me if I had done my military duties, it would have been a problem for me to just let my nerves go and fail in my tasks and get humiliated or put on a KP or if we believe in teleflick because of his suspicion of his criminal history. <br /> <br /> Whatever the viewer wants to believe is the viewer's decision. I have learned that films from this decade or decade related to service or military service take quite the same attitudes. <br /> <br /> 1940s and 1950s, serve your country. <Br <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's history. <br /> <br /> The whole movie seemed to me to be Hollywood predictable. He refused to serve and only when he was forced to build, he showed emotions. <br /> <br /> Such an emotional outbreak could have worked easily in a privileged position, but apparently the film wanted to be shown to a human being and only when he died would he become sad. <br /> <br /> I am not Catholic, but I thought Ned Beatty and Mary Hail's reasoning at the end, with the Lord's prayer, was funny because it seemed like they were trying to see who could say it faster. <br /> <br /> I can't see how this movie can be viewed without it being understood by the purpose of Tricky Dick Nixon and Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> I hope Slovik and everyone who decided to follow his example is worth it.
