I heartily disagree with other viewers of this evil movie. The only reason I didn't appreciate it 1 was because of Carmen Miranda's great talent. At the beginning and end, the best parents are thanks to their talented song and dance. <br /> <br /> The problem is in the rest of the picture. Alice Faye comes out quite hollow. Don Ameche has a great singing voice, but he's so frightening with evil written material. <br /> <br /> Plot is a real stiffness here at Amec, assuming that the two parts are singing and the dance man and baron are not happy with Faye. <br /> <br /> It seems that playing a song and dance with a man, Ameche gets a second rearrangement of marriage. Some foolish nonsenses about the need for a baron to cancel a business and get away, allowing him to play both parts. <br /> <br /> S.Z. There is little work to do for Sakal and so his comedy gifts are not shining. For Ditto, J. Carrol to Naish, who actually feels uncomfortable in his role. <br /> <br /> This is a boom bomber of chica chica.
