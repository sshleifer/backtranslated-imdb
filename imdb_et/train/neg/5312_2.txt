Director Fred I am Ray's terrible trash bin, Warden Jan-Michael Vincent, for a cyber-hunter (Teagan), to find and fill a runaway alien who understood Ross Hagen, who has mapped the earth. Soon, Forest Ranger John Phillip Law has to defend the band with Richard Wiley, who ran over Hagen with his RV. Soon, the cyber will hit his hand with a laser that burns one innocent alcoholic doctor (Count Yorga-Vampire's fame, Robert Quarry), which proves that no one is in disguise of a convict whose collar is a tracking device that weakens his body. The law finds Leo Gordon's ally, an old Vietnamese military doctor whose weapons have been detained in his cab. <br /> <br /> Perhaps deliberately horrible, that is, fans of "runaway cinema" fans miss. impact, action and assumption. At least the film PJ Soles has some eye candy. This laser gun is funny ... you can burn some houses even if Cyborg fires the law if it barely leaves the mark.
