I have no idea what it was done, but you can definitely say that they did not have the budget. Bad performance, terrible cinematography and flat plot and some decent special effects don't make a good movie. WWF-style cinemtography makes you cry ... where is the tripod?! Cinematographers tried high, but wrongly left their mark.
