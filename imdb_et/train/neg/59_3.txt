The protocol is an unreliable film whose only sustainable arm is that it marks Goldie Hawn with a good actor. The story revolves around the ditzy cocktail waitress, who will be famous after the unintentional recording of an Arab dignity. The story goes down to the movie and Goldie's charm just doesn't record this movie. If you are not a Goldie Hawn fan don't go out to see this movie.
