In less than 10 minutes of this movie I wanted it to end because it was painful. All this "horror movie" was a group of funny females who made foolish things for 90 minutes claiming crying and screaming. Don't let the positive appraisals make you fool, because it's really a terrible movie and you shouldn't really watch it. <br /> <br /> The plot had the potential to be great, but it just doesn't happen. A group of five "teenagers" girls drive home one night when they find themselves a terrible female driver who wants to kill them. Two minutes of the movie, and the characters already claim and it doesn't stop. Everything that we have 90 minutes is a group of girls who are frustrating, crying, screaming, "acting" and claiming. No dialogue is far from interesting, so you can't really feel these characters or enjoy them. <br /> <br /> Action was terrible and I was shocked to find out that these characters were meant to be teenagers. None of these women were under 20 years old and one of them easily looked like almost 30 years old. At least people looking at age. None of them even gave remarkable performances remotely, and as if they seemed to be picked up on the street or were friends of the director who had no ability to act. "Actress", who played the murderer, surpassed it, but she showed at least something other girls didn't have - a little talent. <br /> <br /> Characters do not help because these girls are a bunch of fools, stupid bitches. That's all I can really say about them, and it didn't help them all to survive. When I have to go into the details, on one scene the girls drive by the killer and their car knocked a lot. One girl injures herself and asks for it ... four of them don't wear seat belts ... what are you waiting for? One of your friends is brutally attacking the killer ... and you are all just "too sick" to help? What ever. <br /> <br /> Filming a movie is absolutely terrible. I don't care if the film had a peanut size, filming was terrible, and it was like watching a pirated version of the movie. The cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls, pushed somewhere against the window, and how many times the camera blurred, shook and brushed the "actress", was terrible. It was also grainy and sometimes you couldn't hear what the characters were saying (not that it was something worth listening to). <br /> <br /> The car is said to be killing in the movie (probably hit, even though we only heard the accident), actually the drivers are in real life. No wonder they didn't hit the car! This movie is so cheap that they can't even scratch the car a little. Oh, I have to mention the soundtrack ... if it was. It was terrible ... sad one second, then hard stone next. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, five eyes seem to know a terrible home film that was filmed in the middle of the road with a lot of foolish girls screaming and claiming for 90 minutes. It doesn't help if the script is terrible, fears / tension / relationship and (hardly even any gore to do) missing, the actress is terrible and the picture quality and filming are terrible. <br /> <br /> It was a terrible low budget movie. Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> 1/10
