Although it is early to say how the series is developing, I can say that the pilot was smaller than I thought it would be. However, there is potential for the series. Of course, when I first saw Voyager, I thought it was also potential - but was very disappointed. My gut says the company is not as bad as Voyager. <br /> <br /> The pilot's impression ... <br /> <br /> The pilot had good ideas and good themes. I liked the introduction. The opening credits of the exhibition were interesting, with an exploration and a suitable theme for song development. Scott Bakula is excellent in the captain's role. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't for me, it was largely that the story was not an "adventure" that was a great adventure. The episode graph was rather a "general" story of Trek, whose subjects were "exploration" and "the first step towards space" but the sub-platform and subtext. If you wanted to refer to this first deep space field, the plot would be difficult to distinguish between Enterprise, TOS or TNG ages. The central plot did not reflect or did justice to a series of major topics. <br /> <br /> The first mission launch would have been sufficient without "action". Instead of referring to the new side of the study, they would have been a story. Take a little more nostalgia and philosophy (oh, for a TV show that thinks of us again). Feel the excitement of "wind" and be "at sea" instead of distracting us with salvation and playing with many weapons. There were too many attacks. <br /> <br /> We had the feeling that people were in school at school. New kids in a block, not much in the unknown universe. Unfortunately, Klingons landed on our doorstep instead of finding us. This meeting could have been much more historical and much sociological. How do two different societies communicate? Don't just hint, SHOW! <br /> <br /> I had to think more about "Trek with the Akward Team and Limited Technology" rather than "the first bold steps to the unknown". I wanted to see something newer and newer. The series promises a new concept, but so far I haven't seen this new, big concept. <br /> <br /> Finally, I repeat that this series has the potential. There are interesting signs. Bakula is wonderful. Blalock has the potential. The general theme is the most interesting because we saw the Church for the first time before Apollo 11. If only future episodes can justify this great and wonderful topic, we have an exhibition that creates new legends. <br /> <br /> You're coming to the air ... Lucky Captain Archer. <br /> <br /> For Manufacturers: ATTENTION RISKS AND US * THINK *! :-)
