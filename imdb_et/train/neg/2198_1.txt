The scientist and his girlfriend drive off when his speed exceeds a car accident. He flees unharmed, but he is destroyed. He will save his head, bring it home and keep it alive (!!!!). He then continues to look for models and removers for the perfect body. His insidious assistant looks over the head that starts talking and has a telepathic (or telepathic) link to a deformed monster kept in the closet .... <br /> <br /> As you can see, it's pretty stupid, but I had it some affection. When I grew up in the late 1970s, the local TV channel showed this film about 20 times a year (no exaggeration). They always showed it on Saturday afternoon on television - uncut. Seeing it on television was great! Explicit blood and gore with a terrifying monster and buggy sexploitation - who cares if it was good? Now I see this is very sad. <br /> <br /> The actor is completely sad, production values ​​are non-existent, the script is pretty stupid and (apart from the rather disgusting gore) it's boring. . The fight between the two women and the really big monster at the end is easy. Add an end that leaves tons of loose ends. On the one hand, this is an interesting example of a film from the 1960s. On the other hand, this is the perfect trash. In both cases, this is not a good movie, but it is a must-see (only once) for horror and gore fans. <br /> <br /> Head-to-head laughter is also quite horrible. Note the final credits that get TITLE wrong (naming it "HE WHO DO NOT DIE")!
