I cannot vote on it because I would not look at the garbage of these people. They got my money for another movie (Mr. Jingles) and I swore it would never happen again. I think this is my civic task to help people stay away from this trash. Go to this movie forum and read where the cast members are trying to act as they see the movie for the first time. One man even answers himself ... by the same name! There are competitions in the forum that say it is as good as Shawshank's redemption and Citizen Kane ... Not even close (under no circumstances). If this is another company movie, it should be better than the first. This means that the third movie should be much better. Not so, I've seen it. All I want to know is how you distribute this trash all the time using the same name. Have fun with friends and make a movie over the weekend ... but don't try to market this garbage!
