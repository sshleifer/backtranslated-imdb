I was just wondering what is the purpose of making movies? profit? and to whom do they refer to what intelligence must use your brain to look at that kind of mess? This movie can be tracked for children under 3 years of age, if you are an adult, do not try to watch it. That's why I think Hollywood started using movies with actors in movies, forget about cinema art, be sure you have tons of popcorn to spend that time until this movie ends up with many pound hamburgers on your mobile phone, this movie can be easily used in the restaurant, but certainly not in the theater, my dog, who is always next to my family when watching a movie. The warning is that this movie refers to people who do not require cinema from art. The only thing this movie can use is to watch it on the supermarket shopping list. I give 2 stars to support Indian cinema efforts, but nothing more or less.
