Looking at this movie? I thought of myself what a lot of garbage. These girls must have stones for the brain to even accept this part. A waste of time watching it, the weak sky I hired it. The action was lower and the story was unbearable. Anyone who watches this movie, please save your money. The film has no credit at all. I'm a real movie buffer and it's worse than the "green tomato attack". <br /> <br /> I only hope that it didn't cost too much for the trash. Money would have spent better on homeless people in the world. I only hope there is no sequel to the pipeline.
