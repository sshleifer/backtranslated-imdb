The first 30 minutes of Flick were awkward and it was hard to know what was happening (if you didn't read the book that I hadn't done). <br /> <br /> When you get stuck in the first half, the other side is sweet - predictable, yes, but sweet, not less. <br /> <br /> The way it was shot would probably have been produced in the early 80s, not in 2005. <br /> <br /> There are no glorious moments, blissful, but it didn't move forever. <br /> <br /> I would like to know why Keaton chose this role, his part being better with the player to keep the balance between the other players.
