I've tried to like this movie. Looking at it, all I think is, "This guy gives me a slip, I would have had a restrictive regime". It also invokes CODEPENDENCE in capital letters. Was it really a conversation before making a movie? "We make a film that puts two chronically depressed, socially failed people in a relationship that deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are!" What I have seen in life is that the last thing we find attractive on earth in potential companionship is constant self-pity. <br /> <br /> The movie's mood is clearly 80-ish; rubbing and slow. Don't do me wrong, the movie has only a few moments.
