For the first time I saw a film cover and stretched photography, which I thought this guy, this "Scwarzi" friend must be like 6 feet or 6ft 2in. <br /> <br /> Not 5 feet long. Not so, it's his fault. For any rating, I turned a movie in Tucson into one cool evening, another story blanket that had a good cigar and let it roll. At that time my husband had a thing and things went down the hill, so I needed a good deviation. But as bad as the movie was ... I enjoyed it completely, a bottle with Merlot too, I can admit. <br /> <br /> Really, I've been watching this movie many times. It always makes me feel good! It is not that it is trying to cool too hard or it is so close that it captures the action film .... It's foolish. And then really helpless. Then again frantic. This is best when it comes to a slow speed chase scene. Wow! I never felt safer in my life. Also warm and happy. I was grateful that they maintained gasoline during the fuel because there was less production in the summer months ... whatever, <br /> <br /> The direction was "uninspired" that had to be choreographed, and again choreographed and tightened, the sound was out turned on, it didn't stay with you, but kept going, in another way. The town's "locals" they were, the city was rather "off cue", which they also did not see what happened very well, would look and even "look" at the camera lens. Like deer on the head, there are only a few of them with a smile, a smile with deer. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because Columbu, which I just bet, is with a good heart and caring spirit both in America and in my own country. <br /> <br /> But Baretta Island is very sleepy and incredible. Even still like it a lot. Now my x-wife hates it, but I love it! The funny thing is that I'm pretty discriminatory when it comes to movies that I like or even love. All in all, I like Franco. So that's it. <br /> <br /> When you add a movie, if you want to kill for a few hours for a really fun look, directly to video-B movies or "bad" movies for your small library, if you find it, see 'The Big Sweat' (1991) With Robert Z 'Dar. You know a big man from TANGO & CASH. "Big Sweat", a police story bomb that has no real plot discovery and is so flat, can also be "crowds" and "The Big Sweat" at the end I think they ran out of money because they had a picture cast and just put it fire and let it burn during burns. - Good fun. But all in all, not as good as the island of Baretta, "I gave him" 1 "and a general assessment of the" terrible "terrible good B movie. I look forward to a sequel, perhaps as" Baretta's revenge on Montazum "(Franco takes a Mexican vacation and gets sick , proclaiming a war on a water body) or a "baretta powder war" where he put out a big country drug in his country and chemically gene-splice and create a hybrid super bug (insect) that would be bred and fallen in cocaine fields and eat coke and passing it through error, it is a chemical reaction that turns into a coke of pure powdered sugar, and then another offspring should be able to save the young person from excessive sugar dependence and so on. He could become a large toothpaste firm to confirm and partially finance the project with product placement.
