This movie is not that interesting, except for the first ten minutes. The pace and editing is the perfect introduction to the ensemble's piece, even better than the Gosford Park. Then it slows down inexplicably, loses focus and begins to resemble a traditional French film to finally focus on the love relationship between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cécile (Deneuve). There is too much in the middle and the end of the story is open, many of the threads that have started have not ended. <br /> <br /> ******* SPOILERS AHEAD The main story is the relationship between Antoine and Cécile. He has been his loyal relationship with him several years ago, despite having remarried to Morocco. As a builder, he now restores his life and restores Cécile with a marriage mask. Having achieved this, he is buried after a crash (literally) and becomes a comat. She wakes up only after she has burned her old picture, pointing out that they have agreed with the past and are able to bring their life together again. ******* END OF SPOILERS <br /> <br /> It is unclear what vision this director wants us to see, because there are so many other stories here: illegal immigrants want to enter Europe, there are frequent radios transmitting information Of the former regime in Iraq. Cécile's child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs (loyalty) when she meets her boyfriend, while the girl she lives on seems to be sick (of this?). Her sister is traditional Islam and enters Céc with her husband. It depicts Morocco from an unnecessary upside down, despite the whole building's strange colonial vision that looks like it almost glorifies the past. It represents Islam in terms of return and extremism, which can sometimes be true, but certainly not in general. Ultimately, this can best be described as adding some couleur locale and l'art pour l'art. <br /> <br /> Deneuve and Depardieu are great. With this material they are so familiar that they can put something extra in each scene: eyebrow raising, body language, pride, irradiation of uncomfortable behavior. The film itself is disappointing and only confirms the limited role of the French cinema in the world today. Of course, there are some notable exceptions.
