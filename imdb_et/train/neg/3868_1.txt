When you learn Welles and want to see how far he fell after Citizen Kane, this film proves it. The cheap pretext that the protagonist is a self-proclaimed mannequin to explain how he gets into such a semi-baked scheme does not explain the absurd courtroom theater and the ridiculous twist of the plot that eventually arises. Don't take this movie as high as I was; I think there are many old Welles and Hayworth fans dead there.
