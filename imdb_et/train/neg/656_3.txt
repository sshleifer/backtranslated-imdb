Note: I was unable to force myself to make a constructive review of Prom Night. You just can't do that. Instead, I went through what I was thinking while watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Things I was thinking about while watching Prom Night: <br /> <br /> -I'm so tired of those dreams where these difficult deaths happen, that the main character wakes up before he does bites. Of course, when I say "developed deaths", I mean that the throat slashes or stomachs are dropping. Didn't Dallas destroy the whole "it's just a dream"? Speaking of whether or not I know if the couple is going to die in the gut immediately. <br /> <br /> - The movie is only ten minutes and I can already read horror hands on two. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> - Even after the headmaster boy's meeting, I'm sure he's going to die. Anyone want to make predictions? <br /> <br /> - The killer of this movie is a teacher who is embedded by the main character Donna. (By the way, does anyone think that "Donna" is the main character of the horror in the horror film?) She spends three years in maximum security before she leaves and finds Donna celebrates her high school. Even though taste is ignored, I mean seriously, who takes all this time to steal someone like Donna. <br /> <br /> - Colleges allow promos to take place in hotels and not follow students. Obviously, students can buy a hotel room and go in and out as they wish. I think if this plot point was not in place, the film would be a 90-minute-long person who would forever forget and accidentally dust when they go to the bathroom. I think the compromise on their excitement is my complete boredom with everything. I've already played "counted chewing gum pieces under the seat" and "I guess I have a wallet" and I'm just a 20-minute mark. How else would I entertain myself? <br /> <br /> -Note yourself: Don't forget milk and bread at home. <br /> <br /> -The previous scriptwriter: You have used the wrong fears to pass this movie. and every other horror remake this year. <br /> <br /> - The 1980 version of this movie was not so good, but compared to this remake, it was like Kane or at least the Godfather. It had Jamie Lee Curtis with her many Halloween post-horror pairs and at the end she had a little "twisting". I miss Jamie Lee. I want him to do more. <br /> <br /> -It'll be a lot of dancing. Instead, girls are fighting with their friends where they intend to attend college. I hear that all these colleges have grown up by name, and I can't help but know who these girls have to catch up with. <br /> <br /> - The killer needs to carry a truly effective bag of cleaning products and sweeps his confusion between scenes. This is the only logical explanation for why he could push anyone in the carpet or bathroom, and by the time someone goes to the hotel room, there's no struggle to follow. (On the other side, note: This is a very lazy killer. Michael Myers went to hunt for his victims. Simply put.) <br /> <br /> - This is an official: the entire audience in the theater is gathering a killer. What triggered it? Was it always when Donna went back to his hotel room while the sirens went out, ordering everything to leave the building? Was it his constant dream and how even after a dramatic break in his dream did he require his steps back to the road? Or was it convincing for Brittany Snow? I have to say that it was all mentioned above. <br /> <br /> -Okay, who was "he dies out of the third work screen?" You win the pot. <br /> <br /> - Finally the movie is over. My friend turns to me and says, "Donna wasn't too smart." This is an underestimation of the week. Similarly, a tornado is a small wind power, or a week-long power outage is a mild discomfort. <br /> <br /> -I can't wait to get Rotten Tomatoes and see if anyone gave it a move to the preferred review. <br /> <br /> -I can't recommend it. I do not recommend this. It is both a horror film and a lazy movie, and the only way to try out your own smell of cheese is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers. And, unfortunately, there is no alcohol for theater makers. <br /> <br /> Rating: * Off ****
