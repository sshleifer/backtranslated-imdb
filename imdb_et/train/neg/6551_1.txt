Study badly. Bad operation, bad music, bad scenario, bad editing, bad direction and bad idea. Sculptures don't come from cheese or inadvertently more fun than this ... thing. At the end of the "movie" you have a question about why they first bothered. Bad Malcolm McDowell, did he have a little money or something? Think about seeing it yet? * SPOILERS AHOY *: If you have not laughed for the first thirty minutes, you will see the cyborg city of Cytown. Avoid this, my movie-loving friends. Avoid.
