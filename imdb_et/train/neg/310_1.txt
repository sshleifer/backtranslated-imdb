I had never heard of this Adam Sandler movie until I saw it in Blockbuster. At the time I was a fan of Adam Sandler, I rented it. Honestly I could only watch for about 30 minutes. about it. It was terrible. Do everything you can to keep it public. I sincerely hope that this movie will be coming soon and hope it is ON NEXT!
