OK, I have long been Black's big fan and after seeing the movie DISGUSTED. Let's name the problems ... First, this movie has a lot of the same team as the first two. This is also called PREQUEL for black black slave. Why don't they get the name of Shetan dam right or its color? The Black Stallion Returns, we learn that Sagr was the mother of Black CHESTNUT and in this movie he has the name of Mare Jenny?!?!?!?!? WTF? And it was set in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I could be wrong, but the first one was set in the 1940s when the ship wrecked. The timeline doesn't seem to me quite right. There is also a frieze at the beginning of the film, which should be Shetan's father. Ben Ishaak is the only sign that was left in any way associated with the previous two. Some may have a lovely family movie, but that's my biggest film disappointment.
