OK, this is not the best movie I've ever seen, but at the same time I've been able to sit back and watch it twice !!! The story was quite terrible and during the first part of the first short story I was wondering what the hell I was looking at, but at the same time it was so terrible that I loved it cheaply laughing all the way. <br /> <br /> And Jebidia deserves the Oscar for his role in this film, the only thing that lets him step down, he stopped calling his foolish names. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie was pretty perfect, but if you are laughing cheap and you look at it.
