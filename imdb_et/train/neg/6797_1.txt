What can you say about a grainy, poorly filmed 16mm film where the best and most attractive performer is the German Shepherd? Something that would be positive. Avoid this profitability at all costs. In any case, it would be difficult to find, because goodness is a taboo and illegal subject in the US. I strongly urge IMDb to visit its weighting scheme for rating, as 8.8 ratings for this stool are absurd! I'm by no means a bride and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70s and 80s; but it is a worse product even if the (then illegal) stag loop is loose.
