This movie was just terrible, the first movie wasn't so big that I thought it was ridiculously stupid if they didn't have enough first 5 movies to add, why not just do it in a continuous series like James Bond. why exactly why bond movies are really good and these movies just stink, I don't understand if it was supposed to be a cross, so genres like horror and comedy for the good that is my 1 year old niece wouldn't be afraid a ridiculous event in horror, spit on people who want to scare the horror at least for a while. Please don't do these movies anymore.
