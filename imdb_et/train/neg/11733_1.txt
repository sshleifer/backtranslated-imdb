I am shocked that there were people who liked this movie .. I saw it in Tribecas and most of the audience laughed at this scene, which wasn't meant to be funny. I felt bad because the leader's actor was in the audience, but frankly, the plot of this movie was MAJOR's review ... it didn't even make sense, one second of characters doubting exactly what it was that they snorted. the scene they hopelessly depend on and explain how to do it? Also finished just took the cake .. I'm not going to ruin the excellent conclusions. But it's pretty much mixed with the rest of the scary plot / script ... see this comedy movie if you need to.
