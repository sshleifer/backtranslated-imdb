In short: this is a cookie cutter romantic comedy that really wants and TRIES to be more. He wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, Graduate. He wants to be deep and human. It has interesting camera pictures, lighting, music, editing, all of which give him an important film feel. Dialogue is sometimes wise. There are some moments of "laugh out loud". <br /> <br /> But here it will ultimately be more than a formal late-night cable, in flight, killer: 1. David Schwimmer - how many times can Joe's puppy be bothered by an empty space if he jaw hangs out before it starts tedious? Maybe some stupid would have helped. <br /> <br /> 2. Gwenneth Paltrow - He's really flat here and not just chest. His job should be that lively, nice, caring girl who just goes into the wrong situations, so it's very confused and that's why it's a sad bag loser like Schwimmer with her. But Gwenneth plays him very boring. Combine this puppy dog ​​with a foolish face (above) and you have very little chemistry to care for. <br /> <br /> (I took someone else in this role - for example, Kate Hudson.) <Br /> <br /> 3. Script and plot - the things that happen are not basically true; all the problems end up with a clean and regular belt that seems to have flew and the scriptwriters just said, "Oops, it's time to wrap!" So they pulled out the Hollywood formula book, checked out all the boxes and went home.
