Seriously, I mean very seriously when I first saw the show, I thought it was good. But the plots deteriorated. The story was either too boring or predictable. George is not always funny, sometimes he's stupid. His jokes are superfluous. Her mother is the silent character of the show. How can a mother treat her son in this way when it was a legal daughter, but it was her own son. I just give this show 4/10 just because some of the first shows were a little funny. Actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha are doing a good job. I don't know how these shows are playing for so long. <br /> <br /> If you're really bored as I was and I have nothing else to look at, I suggest you look at it.
