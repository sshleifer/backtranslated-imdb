I have to admit that there are some books that have the movies I've seen before cinematic adaptation. Nineteen eighty-four cases are one of those rare cases. The book was great. It was an surrounding and interesting prophet. But the film just suck. It's just the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason I didn't turn it off in the first 5 minutes was that watching the movie was a half-class two-part task. It was dark and grotesque, but it did nothing to achieve the right atmosphere. Action was not above average, and given the fact that there wasn't much to do there, it was a serious disappointment. For example, the book did not give me the impression that Winston could not crush more than one syllable at a time. Bored, distracting and visually unpleasant, the movie is completely in the movie. Wait more ... Isn't it British?
