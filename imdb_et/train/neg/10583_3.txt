I'm sorry to say this, but acting in this movie is terrible. The dialogue sounds like they read their rows for the first time. Maybe I got a mistake in the "dress trial" version. The director uses excessive movement during special effects, perhaps trying to compensate for the poor performance of the participants themselves. The story is pretty well written and the combat sequences are actually better than I can see in many feature films. The struggles seem pretty real. But all of this happens when two leading players are again overwhelmingly overwhelmed by the incredible amount of point-blank automatic fire, grenades, moravers and bazookads. The enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots I've ever seen, especially if they have a running truck in their sights about 30 meters, and every bazooka shot at least 50 feet. These basques need serious site calibration.
