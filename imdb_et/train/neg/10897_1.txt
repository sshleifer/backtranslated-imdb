This was probably the worst film I've ever seen in my life! It was stupid, there was no plot and the special effect was ridiculous! And I've never seen such bad behavior in my life! The only good part of the movie was all the hot guys (especially Drew Fuller). I don't know what these people were thinking about making this movie !! I didn't even want to end the whole thing because you get to that place in the movie where the boys are in bed. I mean, it was like some sick and twisted kiddy porn! I recommend to anyone who has heard about this movie and is interested in simply forgetting it and finding another movie to watch! I was very disappointed! The whole movie, in my opinion, was a waste of time.
