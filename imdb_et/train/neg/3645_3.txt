Young gets bad hair day, goes to the mountain and gets to where he can't get. He then meets with MR. ATLAS, "mythological" guy since 2000 years ago as his best friend and Arnold Schwarzenegger appearance and sound.

There is something new or tempting to add godliness, and before you know it, there is some attempt at violence that does not qualify it as "family" entertainment. However, the scene where Atlas complains about its footnotes is amazing. Just spend a nice, quiet afternoon in the park to make changes.
