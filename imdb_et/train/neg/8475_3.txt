(NOTE: I thought I was the only one who wrote below, but I see others agree here. I think it was quite obvious - it was a surprise to feed a cat a bit. It was written :) <br /> < Owners have left for two weeks for a vacation in California - leaving the cat (Sylvester) alone and locked in the house. This means that there is no milk, but the cat relieves him lightly of tuna. But because of his fear, he doesn't find an opener. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the house's little mouse is ... and feeds it with the cat. This is the average rodent who keeps Sylvester in the elbow and then in the last second. Sylvester tries to open the tuna can, but can't do it. <br /> <br /> This is a frustrating story and why they make a sadistic mouse a "good man" outside of me. It's like some of Tom & Jerry's cartoons, where poor Tom's get the worst, though many times a small mouse has started a conflict!
