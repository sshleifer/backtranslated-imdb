First of all, let it off the road. . . yes, this movie steals LOT 'Darkness Falls (2003). The Darkness Falls plot is doing something like this: Tooth Fairy, a murderous woman who hides her face because of discord, kills people who look at her for revenge. In "Tooth Fairy" (2006), the disguised Tooth Fairy (who, yes, hides his face) triggered his angry revenge almost anything. A little too similar to be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> But what to ask is this: if you are going to steal an exact plot from a movie, why choose something mediocre as "Darkness Falls"? Of course, it made a few bucks at the checkout, but it was strictly for the fair theater experience the film gave. A low-budget movie with direct video does not have the same effect. And it wasn't. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie open for 15-20 minutes, my expectations really increased. At least, the production value of SOME seems to be. The story didn't seem terrible, just blatant. As the first scene, we get the right character, including a former secret doctor (played by the man who looks like Busey) and some hot veterinary students (Jenifer Argento masters "Jenifer"). After a few minutes, however, the film will slowly fall out. It serves all the basic terrible clich√©s, including, but not limited to: some mad old person who has a neglected warning, a buff-fool jock, a psychological and a stripper with a golden heart. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems with this film was his inability to stay with the target audience. It's like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone that was in the character's time. When the adults were on the screen, he had a mature feeling. When Star (stripper) and whatshisface (jock) were on screen, the dialogue went stupid, immature, and level. When the boy was on the screen, it looked like "Are you afraid of darkness?" . . only less scary. <br /> <br /> Technically, film is all over the place. Visuals range from a pretty good ordinary to a boredom. Writing is a subpar, as is usually the case. On the plus side are some parts (including a rather cool (but painfully predictable)) wood patch scene and a pretty nervous nail image scene. Also, if you are looking for some sexy stuff, there is a short topless scene (but if you want to see this chick topless, you have better movies). Moreover, this film is not a lot of trouble. <br /> <br /> If you're a huge fan of "Darkness Falls" (do they exist?), maybe you can see the story in a different way. . . but this is the only reason I see it. <br /> <br /> Final decision: 3/10 -AP3-
