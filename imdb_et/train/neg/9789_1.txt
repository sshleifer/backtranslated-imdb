They should have called this movie: "A mouse mouse that is somewhat inspired by somebody's vague memory of Stuart, who just made a little book, but most often just remembered the cover," if it wasn't that misleading, I'd give it a better review. <br /> <br /> But seriously, do your children serve and read this book. They could actually learn something instead of thinking about what we all know as a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Stuart is little about the mouse, but about a person who is very small and similar to a mouse. He was born to his parents, not accepted. The book talks about his life and possible departure from home and the journey he is starting. There is a cat named Snowball who thinks she is feeding and wants to eat her, but the snowball can't speak. <br /> <br /> In the movie, they are all closed. I think the only ones they kept from the book were the boat race and names.
