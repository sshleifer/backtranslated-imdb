Strummer's hippie past was a revelation, but in general it seemed to awaken. Campfire sites work best around campfire intimacy. There were too many semi-old friends with anecdotes and too much filler. I like The Clash and Joe that they have not yet reunited and sold their songs (FU Mick Jones), but this doctor left me with the desire to ... communicate more. The use of campfire storytellers without the proper explanation of the anecdote tells the viewer to some extent. They should have been questioned separately. Even using Strummer 's radio DJ' s voice did little to glue the film together. And does anyone explain the flags behind the campfires? After a fantastic "Filth and The Fury", I was hoping the temple could deliver. Joe Strummer doc deserves better.
