Hello there, <br /> <br /> This is my first post in IMDb, although I am using it for some time as a reference. Therefore, I would like to welcome you all. The fact that I am a Greek will inevitably affect my decision, I hope not your resentment. not Homers, as you can see everywhere), rhyme by rhyme. If I remember well, Iliad (Iliad) was in 8th grade and Odyssey (Odyssey) in 9th grade. Warner's Troy was a great disappointment to me and my fellow countrymen on campus (I was studying in the UK). Iliad Epic is one of the best literary works ever made. It was compiled by the Greek poet Omirus 400 years after the real war. Historians put the Trojan War at around 1200 BC, and the real cause of the war was not Helen's beauty, but Troy's strategically important position. It said that now it can be understood that Omirus epos does not present actual events (because it is not historically accurate), but it was never the purpose of this work. Reading this enormous poem may seem to reflect on the definitions of honor, love, anger, hatred, heroism, discipline, loyalty, and so on. The best part and the most educative ones were those long talks between warriors before the battle. None of them emerged from Troy's <br /> <br /> Troner's Troy was really inexpensive to me and also to other intellectuals, English and Finnish colleagues. It is a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. By the way, the perfect storm was a bad and stupid rocket (computer graphics did all the work), but that's Wolfgang Petersen's best job. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'd say something better to look at. I'd give Troy 10 out. This is really an expensive B movie. Cheers <br /> <br /> Alex
