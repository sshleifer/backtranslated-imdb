My friends and we went to this movie without knowing what to expect, but hoping for the best. When we came out, we were just a little more informed about what the film was about. Although this is not the worst film I've ever seen, I certainly don't recommend spending my money to see it in theaters. Maybe this is the friend you rented (it's not even worth the rent) if you really want to see it. <br /> <br /> If the movie is so complex that you have no idea what will happen before the last five minutes, there is not really much to say about protecting it. Action was decent, more than you would have been expecting to receive this movie, and some shots were good, but it was all spam and bad script corrupted. <br /> <br /> This movie was actually so bad that as soon as he came out, I went and bought a ticket to see a good movie to clean my mind. I suggest you all just skip the first step and see a good movie.
