I've always said that some games by nature just can't translate a movie, and this is a great example. <br /> <br /> As a game, this very funny Catholic satire is a church that has a razor and a central character who is so shockingly unrealistic, we have to root it, even when it starts killing its churches (one of whom made a deadly mistake, that he has not sinned after the last confession, so he feels he is sending him directly to heaven). <br /> <br /> This is just one example of how far out of reality is playing and in the theater world where it works. However, such an elevated reality rarely works on film and it certainly is not here. <br /> <br /> Director Marshall Brickman has put together an excellent casting job that will do a great job, but presenting all this absurdity in a realistic fashion comedy will become a tragedy and you will have an empty feeling of a stomach pit. <br /> <br /> Instead, turn to the production of the production, you will not be disappointed.
