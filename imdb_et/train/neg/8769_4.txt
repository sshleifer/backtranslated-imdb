It was a film I was hoping I could offer to my Americans. But after 4 attempts to finish the movie, I knew I couldn't even look at that fucking thing. You are almost convinced that the actual war does not last for as long. Others are trying to question my patriotism by criticizing such a movie. But you're sure you can't go to see Saving Private Ryan's LOC. Forget about the budget budget difference or audience - they don't rule out the director's intelligent movie. The length of the film is not so bad and the fact that it is repetitive - they attack the same mountain, but give it different names. I thought LOC was a terrible landscape - this mountain looked like my backyard. The sequences of character development (soilder rebounds, viewing their last moments before they were deployed) should have been throughout the movie and not just one long memory. To date, I have a look at the end. But there was a much better film (not to say a lot) called a border.
