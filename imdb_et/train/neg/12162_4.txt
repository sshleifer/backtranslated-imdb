It's not horror because the first part was: It's ("campy") light and humorous entertainment. Like many successes, action begins immediately without explanation. But there are boobs, so I don't complain. And the real chest is that. If I understand correctly, they are quite rare among teenage girls in the US. What reminds me that the main actor here is Pamela's "Bruce's sister" Springsteen. <br /> <br /> It can't be thought without the first movie, so I compare it with it. Again, there are too small clothes (mainly pants) and funny hair, it is not hard to say in what decade this film is made. Again, there are really strange signs, this time with even more visible pathological features. Especially camp workers. It's like a summer camp for mental rehabilitation. People are older: most participants must be at least 25 but I think they should be 16 or something. Some of the "methods" used by "Evil Dyke" are quite unpleasant. In fact, this film does not have much in common with the first part, and it is worse than any other.
