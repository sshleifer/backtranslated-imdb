As other observers have noted, the film dies within the last 1/2 hour. But before that, Kate Capshaw's predicament and astonishingly brave performance will suffer, who has probably never found her character and destroyed every scene she has. in terms of unreality. And the end is just odd. The filmmakers probably knew when they confused that all they needed was a sweet potato and a pumpkin cake to be a Thanksgiving dinner. Each small jump is accompanied by an orchestral performance until it becomes ridiculous. If you want an example of a big, too bad movie, it's one visible, otherwise skip it.
