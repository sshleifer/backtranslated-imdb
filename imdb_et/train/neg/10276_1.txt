So you can read some of the comments posted on this movie, and you may think of yourself, "Huh. December 30, a solid RAVE REVIEW was posted." The funny thing is that most of these rave comments sound like they come from the same person or, at best, a small, coordinated group "Open House". The truth, my friends, is that this movie is really incredible. Just because it is "independent" does not mean that it becomes free. If you intend to make music either on film or on stage, regardless of whether it is from Broadway or the local community playhouse, you should probably make sure that (a) your actors can sing, (b.) Your actors can dance (c.) audio equipment, (d) you have a well written result and (e) you have clever and charming lyrics. Even Anthony Rapp won't save it. This is one of those unfortunate film experiences where I really felt deeply embarrassed for all involved.
