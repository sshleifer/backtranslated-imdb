Jess Franco's three titles, which made the official DPP Video Nasty list (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon, and Women Behind Bars), are probably the least worthy of being a terribly dull jungle clunker that is very lively. little incest gore, free maternity landscape and nudity loads. <br /> <br /> Amazing blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays the Laura Crawford film star, kidnapped by a ruthless robber gang and taken to a distant tropical island, home to a feral tribe worshiping the "god of devil" in the jungle who loves to eat female female victims). <br /> <br /> Laura agents recruit $ 6 million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his Vietnamese pet teacher pilot to the island, but there are problems when bad boys try to double baptism. During the confusion, Laura escapes into the jungle, but runs directly to the island's indigenous people who offer her to her god. <br /> <br /> Franco directs his usual embarrassing style and loads this ridiculous effort into his usual terrible brands: crap gore, twilight cinematography, fast zooming, numerous foot shots, focus pictures, terrible sound effects and ham-fisted editing. The result is a terrible confusion that is a real struggle to sit from start to finish (it took a couple of sessions to end it), and even the strange Buchfellner's sight in all its natural glory is not enough to make me film rush again.
