If you haven't been in this movie for five minutes, give it a few more minutes. Lilia is a widow. He's been left on the shelf for too long and he wants to break. She has a teenage daughter who only points out that she is not younger. Checking her daughter, she discovers a world she has never dared ... cabaret, where she can dance to her belly with dirty consistent sets, while men take her money. The film is very mistaken. This is a bad image of people. What is rather strange when Lilia worships for them, not for money, but simply for hell. If he succeeds to wake them up, he will make himself feel like a woman again. He doesn't want to communicate with them, but he's addicted to it. Other dancers are mostly aging women who look like dragging men and realize that their focus is short-lived. I'm not saying short enough. She finds romance, but short, with you thought ... No surprises we didn't see here. Although the end is good, you realize that it would not have changed in any other way. Perhaps this movie is not for my demographic targeting - 30 Men
