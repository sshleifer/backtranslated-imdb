Only a few segments are involved here. The segment that comes with a garage from Nigeria is heartbreaking. One with whom Fanny Ardent & Bob Hoskins makes his note spins twists until the final shot surprises things. The problem with this movie is that only a few clips refer to Paris. Others are so sprawling on the theme, tone, will and production that you can also see "The Years Best Commercials, 2006". It's really all over. It does not develop over the current time and no driver can manage the drivers. No structure ends with pieces successfully ... tedium is on. I'm one hour, twenty minutes, and a nice, -commercial, vampire-vampire with Elijah Wood. It's about as much to do with Paris as the old ladies who knit in Antartic. Fantasy Appears I think first in the Coen Brothers segment (Uh, thanks to J & E for destroying another movie) and then too many performances. The idea of ​​staying in Paris is that you don't have to make your day extraordinary. Why share it by neighborhood when Quartier de la Madeleine is equal to vampires for a loser director? Has the genre ever been more represented than a vampire movie? Every three years we get the same flat vampire guard. <br /> <br /> The worsening of things is that the transition from segment to segment is quite artificial. Transitions disappear. It doesn't feel deliberate, it seems sloppy.
