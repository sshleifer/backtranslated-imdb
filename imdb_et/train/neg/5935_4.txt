The saddest thing about this "respect" is that almost all the singers (including the otherwise incredibly talented Nick Cave) seem to have lost the whole point where Cohen's intensity lies: Cohen transmits his lines almost in a familiar way. his poetry, irony, his all-embracing humanity, laughter and tears on the one hand. <br /> <br /> To see that some of these singing upstarts make difficult suffering, pathetic blows in patent attempts to shout "I'm a singer!" It's the same feeling that many of you probably listened to the frightening simple songs like Lennon's "Imagine". Something, just nothing goes to the simplicity and closeness of the original. If there is a form of art that does not require decorations, it is Cohen's art. The ornaments poured it on the street, which looks like an offer of tasteless sex. <br /> <br /> In this respect for Cohen, I found myself in suffering and suffering through impatient tribulations and terrible interpretations, all of which were completely original. the irony of the master, and when the truth has been said, many of these singers sounded like they were recruited in some asylum applications. It is Cohen giving them respect, allowing them to sing their material, not really the other way around: they could be friends or his daughter, he could have become very gentle and a gift of mood. Too bad it didn't stay in the family. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Cohen only made his majestic "Song Tower" for his ultimate purpose, but even this flower was spoiled by totally inconsistent backgrounds in U2, all those with boring children when they visit their poor grandfather's nursing home . <br /> <br /> A sad show, really and sad, if you really love Cohen like me.
