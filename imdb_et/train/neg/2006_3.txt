This would help to know why it took so long for the book to be ready for the "House Next Door", which needs to be adapted for movies or television. The book was copyrighted in 1978. One reason may be planning a house. The house in this life movie is really so ugly that I can't imagine anyone buying it. In fact, it is so ugly that someone would probably have come and destroyed as soon as it was built. <br /> <br /> I am not crazy about crazy genre books, but it was hard to come by when I came about ten years ago. The main characters are not people who are looking for something okay in life, and this is one of the strengths of the book. They are not people who would conclude that the architect was some kind of demon ... (or a devil personalized) without seeing and analyzing the events so well described in the book. But this is mostly a shrinking book, and I don't think it's turning to lifelong people. Maybe somebody in the future will have a future version of the book. Better house .. better music ... better scenario and darker lighting ... would definitely help.
