This is one of the worst movies. Trite. Predictable. Lame. The only thing that gave one point was a couple of nice scenes that highlighted Barcelona. I think they would use Guantanamo for such films or some other hidden CIA / NSA prison for torture. <br /> <br /> Often, bad movies have some redemption features, nothing. If I had worked there or worked on it, I would change my name. Really storm. It's hard to write more, but I feel that the world's film watchers need this head. On the other hand, it is a great gift for people you can't. <br /> <br /> You can send it to politicians you don't like in the law, ex-women, teachers you hated, former employees, Dick Cheney, W. and many others.
