Bugs Bunny comes randomly to the South Pole when he tries to vacation in Florida. Where he meets with a small penquin he is trying to save for Eskimo. This short event and penquin are divine, but in the end, it is a bit too light in the laugh. Eskimo is not really as big a Bugs foil when I saw much better Bugs Bunny cartoons, even other short ones, when he is involved with other unknown antagonists. So I can't recommend this good conscience. But it's nice to see it in an uncut form. This comic is "Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1" on the 3rd album. <br /> <br /> My class: C
