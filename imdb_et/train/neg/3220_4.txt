I hate it absolutely when the movie ends almost completely after you have invested in an hour. and this happened to this movie. I was interested in its actors and the fact that Malamud wrote in his source book. I haven't read this story, but I can't imagine it ends like this movie ends. Fortunately, I didn't pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it. ohhhh such a waste of excellent behavior (especially the woman was so perfect). But milo o'hea as a Jew? now it was funny. I haven't studied it, but he played as the director lost his marble or died 3/4 of the way through the movie. Before that, the story and the characters started to develop, there were lots of clean parcels and no time was wasted. but what's in the last 1/2 hour, if it wasn't the toughest, most valuable testimony I've ever seen, I don't know what it is. I just hate it if faith is so destroyed; it seems like an act of violence.
