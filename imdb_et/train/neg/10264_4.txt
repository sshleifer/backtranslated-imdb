Jane Gail (Mary Barton), the leader of the joint New York family, works with her younger sister Ethel Grandin (like Loma Barton) in "Smyrner's Candy Store". After the abduction of Mrs Grandin by the dealers for the purchase and sale of women as slaves to prostitution, Mrs Gail and her police boyfriend Matt Moore (like Larry Burke) must rescue a young woman at risk of being harmed. "Traffic in the soul" is a reputation that is difficult to support - it is not very well done and it does not show something very unique when sex dealers threaten the "virtue" of a young woman. Maybe it can be supported as a film that dealt with this topic more than usual (it was said to be ten rolls). After all these years, the main attraction of New York City is its scenes. Prisoning prisoners behind bars is memorable because nothing seems to be able to move the cameras. <br /> <br /> **** Traffic in the Soul (11/24/13) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin
