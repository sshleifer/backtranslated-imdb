I have advice for people who made this movie, if you make such a movie, make sure you have f / x to back it up. Also, a number of z participants will not be able to play in this list. Another thing almost all of us have seen is Jurassic Park, so don't boldly copy it. All in all, this movie was sucked, sucked, sucked, sucked, unoriginal. Let's talk about acting in just one second, a Carradine man who reached his career in 1984 when he made "Nerd's Revenge" (which was actually a great comedy). He's not exactly z list, he can act. He shouldn't have said that in s bag. He should have done what Mark Hamill did after "Jedi's return" and quietly at night. He made his mark "Nerd" and it should have been. I understand he has to pay bills, but this excuse s-t for the bag. Am I still calling this movie? OKAY. I just wanted to be sure. When I call a little hostile, I apologize. I just wasted 2 hours of my life if I could have spent something useful like looking at color peeling and I feel cheated. I'll close this note. Thank you for your time.
