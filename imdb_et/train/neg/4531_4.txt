"The death of a college campus seems to be suicide, but it is actually a murder cover. sleeves. <br /> <br /> Stars may be larger than the movie. Handsome Charles Starrett (like Ken Harris), who has a small "lingerie" scene, became one of the 40's of western stars, achieving "the return of Durango boy" (1945). The man who plays his father, Robert Warwick (Joseph Harris), was one of the teenagers most acclaimed actors, starting with his performance "Alias ​​Jimmy Valentine" (1915). Look out for red herring. <br /> <br /> **** In the Dark Shot (2/1/35) Charles Lamont ~ Charles Starrett, Robert Warwick, James Bush
