We should have suspected that we discovered that only two minutes later we came out, we were the only ones there. Only five people joined before the movie started. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to redeem this movie. The actor is terrible (especially Mrs Hurley). The script is banal. The impact we've seen a million times. The film's direction is the worst we've seen. Meandering and scattered. No one laughed, including children. <br /> <br /> We left in 25 minutes. It would have been before my wife hadn't gone to a hot dog! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money on this movie. If there is nothing else to look at in your cinema, buy some drinks, popcorn and dogs and watch some people. You have a much more enjoyable time !!! <br /> <br />
