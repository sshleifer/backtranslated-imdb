"SherryBaby" is a rather painful and varied melodrama in Jersey, a story about a young mother who is imprisoned and struggled after being convicted of drugs to stay clean, to find her place in life and especially to win back the love of her child's daughter whom she brother takes care. The only reason why the film is being viewed is at the top of his career by actor Maggie Gyllenhaal, who fits very well and carries the whole movie on his shoulders. But this is not enough because the story is too simplified and expected, and the emotional stress is put on the wrong place - I asked myself from the whole picture whether I had to apologize for the past and maybe future drug addiction as a mother's director and manuscript writer wanted or innocent child who is in the middle. Even Maggie Gyllenha's actor could not convince me that I should not worry more about the child.
