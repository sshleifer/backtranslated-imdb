Supposedly, Domino Harvey is based on a life model that turned to the ledger. I'd say 95% are made. Remembering movies, I always keep an open mind, but this movie lost its potential when it turned out that it had the whole movie's narration, something I couldn't hold on, and up there, the heroine is so angry and depressed b! ch I just wanted it to end with his head. it is too inconsistent, too flashy and too boring, the one who gives the story of the mess, and I really think that big leaders have to make films based on their own or the writer's own imagination, which is not based on any unknown snobby brat. .
