OK, slasher movie. very, very stupid slasher movie. <br /> <br /> We got your stereotypical teens in the house. We have an FBI agent who saw Dirty Harry once too much. "So what's the secret ... punks?" We have about 4 different small camera shots and scenes that make no sense. "Hey man, I assure you sprinklers" ((this guy was the favorite of the movie)) Suddenly, home-watching movies on the couch associated with the preacher, he kills. follow the killer in the middle of nowhere, without the police. maybe he's in the church, wearing a wedding dress. I swear it's the stupid movie I've ever seen.
