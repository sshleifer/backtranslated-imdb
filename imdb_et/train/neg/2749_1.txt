This movie was so badly written. The characters had no depth. They should never have made a movie about it. My 11-year-old son could write a better scenario than Hyung-rae Shim. <br /> <br /> The only actor who did not suck was the zoo guard. He was the only funny and plausible one. <br /> <br /> I love the movies and try to give them some doubts, but it was there in my flat list number 2. Number 1 For those who really thought it was a good movie, you have a serious need for brain surgery. <br /> <br /> Most movie creatures were not even dragons ... why did they call D-war?
