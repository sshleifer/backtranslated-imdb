A very unnecessary movie with so unreasonable characters that I really don't care about who pays the best (or was it a film's goal, to portray the people of the New York City, who speak smoothly?) No romance, no comedy. Action is a very flat and very predictable plot. What disturbs me was the constant joke of classic movies. Man, don't you see that the more you quote, the less important your movie is? Try to be original! A small budget is not an excuse at all, the first driver is not. Crappy, crappy, crappy. No wonder it only cost me one bank ...
