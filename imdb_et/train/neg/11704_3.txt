One of them, "Why was it done?" movies. Romance is very difficult to swallow. It's one of those romances that maybe "click" - they're in love. The film is full of long pauses and uncomfortable moments - the most remarkable is the car-driving restaurant. Charles Grodin does a reliable job, but for most movies it's just him and Louise Lasser. Ask yourself if you want to see Grodin with your neurosis and Lasser with neurosis for an hour and a half?
