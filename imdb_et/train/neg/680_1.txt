I ended up last night on "Starlight" television and all I can say is. . . wow! It's hard to know where to start - incredibly extraordinary special effects (see the laser beam coming from Willie's eyes!), Scary action, meaningful dialogue, inappropriate use of stock footage, or serious pretense infuses all production. This is a truly unique experience and we should all be grateful for it. I call Jonathon Kay the real successor of Ed Wood!
