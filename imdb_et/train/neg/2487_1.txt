Take the "Rambo" blend in some "Miami Vice", cut the budget by about 80%, and you have something that some ten-year-old boys could come up with if they have enough backyard and too much access to the "Penthouse". Cop and ex-commando McBain (Busey and named as McBain, you know he's as sharp as they come) will be hired to become an American supertank that has been stolen and hidden in Mexico. Tank caught Sgt. Major O'Rourke (Jones) & McBain's former love of Devon (Fluegel), messenger and now meat abandoned for terrorists / spies / drug footballers with no reason, blah, blah, blah. In the case of a feature-rich feature film, it is a little activity and not a lot of sex. The current joke is that McBain will get down all the time and stay alive, keeping the balls as souvenirs. Apparently, the writers did not see "The Great Seven" ("For us, the man who sees him") and did not think he would give McBain even intelligence. Even for the budget maker, the output values ​​are bad, distant shots during the dialogue and very little movement. The main project, the tank, is clean enough to produce Ed Wood. Fluegel, who might have been a blonde Julia Roberts (she had a much bigger role in the "Crime Story" than Julia!), Must go inevitably upright and upside down instantly. Jones, who has had an amazing number of movies, has hit quite a lot here. He and Busey were probably just a few simple money and a few laughs. Look for the talented, forward-looking actor Danny Trejo ("Heat," Once upon a Time in Mexico ") in a stereotypical, threatening bit. Too dull even with innocent joy, "Bulletproof" is still enough noise to play when you leave your house, but you want people to think there's someone home.
