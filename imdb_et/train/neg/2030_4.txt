The "Eliz7212-1" comment hits this program with the "turkey head" of Turkish turkey. But it's a hit to see William Shatner's "cavort" and "dance" (yes, the words "dance" are needed for Bill). This exhibition would be a big skit for SNL or MAD TV - and it will judge a couple of stars for one to see Shatner, who seems to have taken the "camp" to new heights - either in his role or in himself. But the boy is funny. <br /> <br /> Girls who play game data in cabin areas are lucky enough to have this turkey canceled unless it is a whiskey-a-go-go genre that has been recreated for young women Dance in the high cages again. <br /> <br /> I watched the first competitor, who was annoying and literally "exhausting as: post," but lucky enough, a quarter of millions. Another competitor, somewhat more intelligent, but happy to get $ 1,000 from Jeopardy, got a card with a card that requires a special question - which he didn't know and thus left with the zilch. <br /> This set of gaming games that hang and sometimes make large sums of money for everyday people is generally a cheap view to catching the viewers. Even if the host is well compensated and give six numbers of the average episode, I assume that the revenue and expenses can be favorable - because you don't have a sitcom, where several stars get six or seven numbers, for each episode, with some major transactions. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that even better will wear thin before long. It has already reached this point. I think his bids, especially with James Spader and others in "Boston Legal", should give us a good deal of Bill Shatner's bids. <br /> <br /> The above rating is just the right Bill Hoot and Prance, maybe once; it should be enough.
