I remember watching it at the best time I was about 7 years old. At that time, I was a great comic book reader and all the superhero-related things were very welcome. However, the end result was great. <br /> <br /> I was aware of "Emma Peel" Diana Prince's stories because they were only recently over and Diana was returned to her Amazon form. However, there were so few steps that I missed in most movies. The final costume was an interesting idea, but it seemed like a cheerleader rather than a superhero. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie again in my late teen years. It wasn't much improved. Cathy Lee Crosby was more familiar with it because it was unbelievable, but her action wasn't better. The script had some good ideas, like rogue Amazon, and a decent villain Ricardo Montalban, but it just didn't come together and was still boring. <br /> <br /> I think they should have built the story better and made the exhibition a more epic climax. It was too much like a spooky spy movie, a superhero story overwritten by someone who had never seen a comic. The elements of the Amazon were intriguing but need expansion. <br /> <br /> The film managed to force manufacturers to go back to the drawing board and find something more loyal than a bit too camp and a small budget. The budget was also quite low here and the superheroes are not cheap. <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the movie DVD had it only as a reference and historical document. Even Superman 4 is available and has no such movie (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). It is worth seeing curiosity and a bit of inspiration and caution in future versions.
