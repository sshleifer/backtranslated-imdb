First of all let me tell you that I'm still surprised at how the plot sucks, but not again for the movie that follows Steven's mixed movie only without Steven's mix omg !!! <br /> <br /> Simply random low budget action scenes really don't make sense I am still surprised that I burned 90 minutes of this mess really !! <br /> <br /> Just rent a Jacky Chan movie or go wwf more fun and he doesn't have and expect to have and prime !!! please please avoid this !! btw best actress plays on bill goldberg and it says a lot! <br /> <br /> And he doesn't play very well as I said to avoid this pfff I still don't think I wasted 90 minutes and spent 10 minutes more writing! :)
