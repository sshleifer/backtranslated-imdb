I had a Mirror Mirror mainly because Yvonne De Carlo was in it (I thought he was great in American gothic), but unfortunately he didn't play a big role in this film. It starts OK and the pace moves nicely ... but in the end it starts to be a bit annoying and boring. This does not mean that it is a boring film, but it is just very average and something remarkable. I didn't like the "posession" side and there were no decent gore scenes. In addition, the main story was very confusing and the end didn't make any sense. But I liked the story surrounding the gothic girl and how she was revenge on her tormentors. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend a mirror mirror especially for horror fans.
