She was not happy to have such a Western video that a rider on Big Frank while her career was sliding. The back room writer must have written a story that lives according to the reputation of her great weapon brother and who flees badly from the city only to return to their town homes with the new courage they have found. All in all, this example is smelly. The story is basically boring, poorly understood, and so naive that it can offend your intelligence. I have to leave other appraisers who found it "... underestimated ..." The critics slipped it during and dignified. You need to get it in the last show when you are late and insomnia. But if you can sit through it, you have more beliefs than most of my movie friends.
