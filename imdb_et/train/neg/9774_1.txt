Hubert Selby Jr gave us the book "Requiem For A Dream" and wrote this manuscript for Aronofsky's film. This film succeeded at every level, giving an intimate and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters and their horrors that destroyed them. "The last exit to Brooklyn" is still the opposite and there are many characters who live in a sad life, but hardly they do the same justice. Aronofsky did it. Especially when homosexuality equals film death. One homosexual sign gets stuck, rocks up in the sky and lands on the sidewalk. The other is crucified and even more beaten. Another exaggerated shock value that can be good if well done is the scenes of trade unionists that literally make strike action. Who would have thought that the drama Brooklyners would be in the event of action and truck explosions? movies. The film is dirty, which does not even seem like a genre. The lake is given a meaningless role that all the dummies could have filled and Baldwin seems only to know that he has to look at his fake part. And then Jennifer Jason Leigh will be our lead, hopeless whore called Tralala (believe it or not, I'm not kidding). His performance is not great and his character's fate is dirty. The poor use of color and composition makes it cheaper than it is and takes the "real" edge out of more provocative bits. Failure.
