This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. Its events are completely random and make little or no sense. The fact that there is a sequel is so sick that I can come up with a fever in the cabin (I'm so). I describe it as a mistake to the newspaper because it seems to be mixed. for example, a pancake-loving karate boy, Kevin, is quite strange in itself, then a policeman who is a bit strange and perverted, then a drug addict, is the fact that they are attacking some random man who clearly needs help. then maybe the main character's having a girlfriend with his girlfriend just because he says something stupid about the plane. then, at the end, some good old family racism, followed by a flock that worked for Kevin's karate boy. It's actually quite despicable that racism can be used in this movie as a joke. There is no reason to enjoy this movie if you don't love Eli Roth, even that doesn't make me a movie. Hate is a strong word, but seeing it as the only word that I promise to use must do it. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
