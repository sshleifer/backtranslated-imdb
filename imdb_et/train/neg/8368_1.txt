A little man watching you spend your working time trying to find out a lot of it. And it's not a good sign, because this movie should be comedy! You should laugh it !! But what? Probably not. <br /> <br /> The main problem with a small person is its concept - it's too ridiculous to accept (even comedy comedy), so when loud, laborious, and top-down jokes, they make the whole thing seem ten times stupider than it already is. <br /> <br /> "But his comedy" may scream some of you. It's true, but it's no excuse for this dark plot. I think of fire, think about it when you saw a baby with a growing man, wouldn't you be a little suspicious? And if Calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly, why did he place it in a nearby shelf instead of an unintended female handbag? And how does a qualified doctor do not understand that calvin has grown a man? I mean seriously ... what? <br /> <br /> "It's not about a plot, about laughing" you may be screaming. Well heres the thing to see, there's a little man laughing and it just makes a stupid ass piece to stand out. <br /> <br /> If you really want to look at Wayans' brothers with a comedy stop, stick to the white chicks, because at least it had some good laughter.
