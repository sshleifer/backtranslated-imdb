When I was a boy in the '50s and' 60s, there was something to do with Disney. What happened? They are able to get all the actors and actors they want. But somehow Disney can turn difficult things into its rich resources. <br /> <br /> Disney can afford the best writers, the best manufacturers and directors, but still ... they screw things up! This movie is nonsense. The sad thing is that I suspect that Disney is not even aware of whether the film is good or bad. <br /> <br /> Because of the number of participants, I can even do it from 3 to 10.
