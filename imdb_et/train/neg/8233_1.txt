It was probably the hardest movie, seriously. I could do better myself, not even properly. It's like this movie was a $ 5 budget and remained a change. Don't look at it. I didn't even get through this movie, I had to turn it off. I give it 1/10, because it was fun how the film producer wanted it to be a horror movie, but it really became a bad comedy. Basically the car collapsed, the headlamp fell, and the owner of this car went after them. Some of the things I saw were women who had a gun that told the girls that they'd take off all the clothes, what the hell? it must be a cheesy porn movie.
