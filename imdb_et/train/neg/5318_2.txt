Well, I had to be generous and give it 2. It was mainly due to the free holes cut in this woman's shirt were her breasts. I found it to be a little fun. Other than that, this movie does nothing more than just laugh at a woman. Funny if you are willing to comment on something with a mystery theater, but it's no better than 2. And 2 pretty much sucks.
