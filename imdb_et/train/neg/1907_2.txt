This frighteningly bad trash can be racist, sexist and homophobic at the same time, but pretends to be terribly chic and experienced. Uneven performances, a clich√©-driven scenario, and a dull direction make this movie one to one. Two scenes were particularly offensive - one where Schaech cleans his tongue after kissing another person (would it have been so great) and the scene where Eastwood kisses Schaech's best friend pretending to be Russian. After he leaves the room, he shouts "f ** king aliens"! As far as he is a cultured artist who dreams of a dream to live in Paris!?! <br /> <br /> Jonathon Schaech can be a pleasing actor on the screen and with an amazingly good look. It is a shame that he did not learn to work with a top-notch gay director Gregg Arak on an earlier film and try to save this film from falling into homosexual stereotypes and homophobia.
