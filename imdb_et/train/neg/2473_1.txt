if my grandmother made movies, they would probably be much better than that ... incredible bad ... the main characters (mother, father and son) are OK. Especially the mother she is a beautiful actor and child, also beautifully specially in scenes where she should be scary. But does the manager know the meaning of the words Plot Point, Triller and Good Script. the script has no evolving atmosphere to become a temporary thing. If you like tracing trees, you can probably enjoy it, otherwise just stay home and sleep. oh ... actually there was something funny: movie since 2001 but we couldn't understand it because the picture is so bad (like mini-dv) and cars are so old (like 70 and 80).
