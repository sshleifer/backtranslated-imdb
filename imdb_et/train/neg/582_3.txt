An excellent book with excellent testimonials and insights into human history, especially the nature of addiction that still resonates strongly. <br /> <br /> What about the movie ... eh. Nothing special. The operator apparently had an unsuccessful addiction to the ring and rounding, and everything around, making the viewer quite angry. Why didn't the driver finish it over me, but maybe he was too busy, trying and somehow failed to make good results from these very good but inappropriately cast actors. All in all, it is a weak adaptation. Your three hours would be a better reading (or reading) of the book.
