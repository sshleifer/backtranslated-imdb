It's not a very good movie, but it's not smelly. It is very confusing and unnecessarily long to rent it at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My GF and I have excluded (we think) this movie, so here is: <br /> <br /> * ** MAJOR SPOILERS ALAS *** <br /> > First, this movie is actually quite simple after you have removed all the confusing dreams of an unconscious dream state (95% of the movie.) Junk's ignorance, which really happened, is this: a group of school friends goes one night to carve. They leave and get into a car accident where everyone except Cassie and Sean die. This is a simple version. (That's right, I told Sean, wear me) <br /> <br /> Right after the accident, Cassie puts her in the hospital between life and death until the end of the movie. Here begins the part of dreams. <br /> <br /> The film is called SOUL Survivors, right? Cassie's spirit and soul continue after the unhappy communication with other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, 2 weirdos and Jude) with the images she has grown up (Sean, school and everything else around her). The souls do what they defined as: Annie's engraving chick, two strange killers (opening scene), Father Jude still encouraging people, and so on. <br /> <br /> Then we take a very long ride, a lot of pictures were shown (many of which are my GF and I still can't bind), but it all comes from the fact that it's not Cassie's time to die. <br /> <br /> Finally, Cassie wakes up at the hospital, "dead" for some time. His family and Sean are there. This is again a reality. He's OK. <br /> <br /> Then the director adds a bit of extra spice, trying to confuse us again, showing a small dream fragment by strangling the wheelchair. But this part is really just a nightmare, and she wakes up next to Sea, probably still with her traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Due to space constraints, we didn't cover all the small things, but feel free to email us if you want. <br /> <br />
