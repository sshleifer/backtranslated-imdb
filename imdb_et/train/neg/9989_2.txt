I was afraid to watch this garbage on the cold winter night of Sky Cinema Max. I'm not a big fan of fear films because most of them are just a trash. It's even worse: it's one of the worst pieces I've ever seen in my life. Horror movie? Yes, it has terrible things: actors, scripts and special effects - Gosh, I laughed at this ridiculous attempt to make a 90 minute flick. In fact, if it had been a comic movie, I would have given it. 5. Don't even think about renting it if you don't want to mock manufacturers. <br /> <br /> Vote: 2 out of 10 did not vote because it always made me laugh ;-)
