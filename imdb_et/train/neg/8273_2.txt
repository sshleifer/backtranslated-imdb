Lots of promises and more. All the stars are mostly HK standards, but the person is that person. No story? That's okay, this action offsets, like most HK action marks. What? The action is terrible, dirty and sparse? The dragon dynasty releases up to this point and are generally considered classic in the Asian cinema. It's gentle. They managed to pair a couple of infernal actresses, but they can't bring out a script that left their lives. There are dialogue scenes where two or three lines are spoken, between which there is a cut and that does not mean the consistency of the characters. You almost feel that they each give a rolling monologue and simply ignore other signs. Michael Biehn Is Really Wood? Sammo Hung uses a double stunt? Not possible. Yes, yes. Stay away.
