Men 2 was a real disappointment to me. Though the actors did a good job, especially Smith, there is no treatment for the poor scenario. The film really had a "follow-on" feel when playing the first events of the first film. The story was, at best, bad. It was not well thought out and at times it was very inconvenient and inconsistent. <br /> <br /> The first flick had a certain "elite" power on the MIB organization. You had some special stuff and had a "secret" feeling. In the queue, the MIB organization has a JROTC summer camp. <br /> <br /> The film was neither horrible nor anything. Movie. Much of the same old humor was recycled from first to second and did not add any originality to the MIB universe. <br /> <br /> The perfect analogy would be the first 3 movie episodes. Was that okay? Yes, yes. Is it worth wearing this title? Not quite.
