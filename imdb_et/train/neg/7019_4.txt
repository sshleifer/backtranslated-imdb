After seeing the Smother movie poster I knew I was going to live with one of those intolerable film experiences that would make me look my eyes. But I felt a bit of optimism because the film had a solid fake that I thought wanted to save the movie. Unfortunately, this didn't happen. Sometimes it is a terrible movie, but it's not disastrous. That's the best thing I can say about it. <br /> <br /> The Smother scenario (writer same men from license to Wed, explaining that they have something but talent for writing movies) is full of cheap and predictive humor. I didn't even laugh at watching this movie. After a great deal of the garbage he has been involved in (like monumentally scary and destructive, because I said so), some people may think that Diane Keaton's career is gone. However, I cannot forget the great performances she has highlighted for decades, such as movies like Annie Hall or Baby Boom. Smother does his best to do his job, but his character is so terribly written that he can't do anything about it. performances on films Baby Mama and Idiocracy.However, he does what he can in his character.Mike White also makes good efforts, but he does not get too far. He is a very talented scriptwriter (as he has shown on films such as Good Girl and Rock School) so I would have liked to see that he was one of the screenwriters of this film, rather than just acting on it. <br /> <br /> The hardest thing is that Smother is totally boring and unpleasant. This scenario is nothing more than a set of forced scenes and situations we have seen on sit-coms.
