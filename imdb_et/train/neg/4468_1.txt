OK, plain and simple, if you are a fan of other Tomb Rider games (yes, even AOD) for LEGEND. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the most disappointing TR game. It looks very nice, it sounds very nice, but it is completely unplayable and I have given up. I feel Eidos has been kidnapped. <br /> <br /> It's very simple. TR was a PC game before anything else. You control Lara using the keyboard. 6 In Tomb Raider, the controls were standard. In AOD they were "sticky" but still have the same general control sequences. In the legend, they have completely changed their methods of movement and control, and they are completely uncontrollable. <br /> <br /> I've seen comments from other people who say "Use Mouse". No, why should I? Others say "Use gamepad". No, why should I? Others say: â€œBut this has been the standard of third party control for years. Well, I don't care, it's not a standard for any other TR game, so why be confused. Oh, I know, because they couldn't take care of their original, loyal fan base, they wanted to bring cash to new kids who hadn't even heard of the series until the movies came out and earn much more money. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> My recommendation for serious TR fans is away from this game, and when you buy it, he complains to Eidos. I've seen massively other posts, mainly in Eidos forums, from people who tell them how garbage it is, maybe they listen.
