Now, I like sci-fi cartoons. However, when Robotboy appeared in Canada at the end of 2006, I looked at the premiere and it was inevitably terrible. Characters are generic and stereotypical (do they really need to make African-American man's fabric print and talk with Jamac's accent? WHY are all Asian characters lively yellow and splashing? Does the mother have to be big thighs and chest and constantly complain?) To the point where things become unrealistic , predictable, brutal, and sometimes distracting. Astro Boy even has similarities with the throats. Let me explain (young people's names): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Constantine / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shay and so on. A Short Similarity to "My Life as a Teen Robot", "Star Wars", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "Kamen Riders", "Sailor Moon", and Co. is underway. Not to mention the racial / gender stereotype. Don't let me start with the enthusiasts. I say they are hidden and quite dirty. But seriously. Don't even try to look at it. Especially if you like Astro Boy.
