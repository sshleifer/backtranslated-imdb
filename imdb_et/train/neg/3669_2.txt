I really don't mean to say something good to this film ... no matter. The script is a nightmare. The writer blurs the line between chemical and biological traits, and it seems to understand the difference. You would think they would at least get a technical advisor. The performances were bad for most of the majority ... although I don't really blame them .. the material really smells. Editing was equally bad .. I just finish now .. its all bad 2/10
