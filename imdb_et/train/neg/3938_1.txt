Not even Timothy Hutton nor David Duchovny could save this dead fish. For starters, the script was definitely written to make a B-film, but somehow Duchovny (looking for a star vehicle to raise myself out of television) and Hutton (looking for "two" one-two punch "he hoped to define his career after" ordinary people "), Cheesy Lines, Big Bad Napkins From Scene To Scene (Fire - Who Uses Napkins In Class 12 Telecoms?) And Ordinary Old Poor Cock This Film Even Duchovny is not immune to the bad behavior that this film is. Timothy Hutton is getting up on the material at all. I have to admit that you know Duchovny's pain when he read the lines that are loud. Although I found myself laughing when I'm sure the director wanted me to feel I'm afraid I didn't make it something for Duchonvey's voice line: "If you ever need a doctor, be sure to call 911." If only the studio had called 911, this movie would never have been made. for the price. <br /> <br />
