This is the third parody of scary movies and hopefully the last one. This time, the loot is mainly a ring, signs and 8 miles of some strange reason. In my opinion, this film was very pointless and unnecessary and not even funny. I laughed maybe three times and that's not enough for comedy. I liked the first two, but it was just plain. If your jokes are made up of corpses that beat and people are throwing each other on, then this movie is for you. In my opinion, if your staying smart enough and saving money and stop making these movies, they will continue 3/10.
