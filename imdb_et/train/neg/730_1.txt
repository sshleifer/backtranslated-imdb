I haven't seen the first movie, and if there's no such thing, it's not a big wish. <br /> <br /> Having just looked at it a couple of hours ago, I'll try to remember it. <br /> <br /> What I remember, the main plot seems to be a group of very distracting people who stay in a house from Friday 13th with this tiring old woman who is kidnapped by a wooden man. <br /> Some people die, the movie ends, I start a lawsuit against the person who sold this movie to me because I want to get compensation for the lack of time in my life. <br /> <br /> I pay about 1 pound to take this movie away from me ...... o wait, I was expecting I already gave it to a "friend."
