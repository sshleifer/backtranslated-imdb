What Bleep we know is a misleading and random look at the secrets of the universe. We are presented with a parade of obvious experts (none of whom are mentioned) who speak and torture thoroughly unscientific. Their interviews are scaled down into small segments and dispersed between some plagues of cgi and banal mini-plots. <br /> <br /> The film is spotted by science, philosophy, theology and politics, bringing it together without any precision, and then extracts some prudent and absurd conclusions. We believe that quantum physics tells us the purpose of our existence and any other difficulty in answering the question that filmmakers would like to point out with their finger. <br /> <br /> It's robbed and logical non-sequential. How did we begin with quantum mechanics and end this pseudo-scientific spirituality and mysticism? It's like saying, "two plus two equals four, so I can move things to my mind." <br /> <br /> In this movie, there is nothing original and almost anything that is right. All discriminatory viewers are annoyed by heavy editing, intrusive and pointless special effect and general lack of content. Educated viewers are disappointed by the science and violence that this film touches.
