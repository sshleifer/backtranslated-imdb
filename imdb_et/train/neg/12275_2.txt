This is the case when a person thinks they are so clever that they have a good time. Remember the all-encompassing political conspiracies captured with the camera in the years that led to Watergate and a little later? Most movies that try to make money on TV are so powerful to remember that conspiracy was actually their navel-looking attitude. <br /> <br /> I was never The Chat, which I find so much of the time since other moments, but Coppola was his main character, and Hackman was a pretty interesting actor. I mean, these conspiracy films are mostly drowning in the genius of the heroes. Many unanswered questions, a lot of interaction ... Well, it takes at least Bergman to create such a film on such visual bases. <br /> <br /> The next person is the perfect example of this time: one political soup is served with an idealistic character and a terrible conspiracy that tightens his web around him. Neither part is interesting in itself and the whole is not improving. In fact, you can say how bad it is from the first sequences of "watcha" that murders without any storyline evolving. Pedestrian driving in the worst direction, because most of the film is a pompous scenes of scenes that turn the ridiculous laughter into the eyes of the viewer.
