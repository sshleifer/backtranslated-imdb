Very bad behavior and very low story. Not even a decent B-film <br /> <br /> The events that were supposed to be shocking, like people coming on board an alien ship, were boring and very flat. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw 5.0 stars and decided to watch it because I like the genre, but it sucks so bad. <br /> <br /> Now there are very few good movies about ALIEN because most of them are low budget <br /> <br /> I give it 3/10
