Sentinel represents everything from Hollywood's lack of soul and exhausted imagination, which are so many films today. I can't think of one good thing, it's all so common that the factory-made and so lazy to gather, that it really exists only as an information sign, how to make money from an unsuspecting, unwanted public. <br /> <br /> The secret service agent plot to kill Prez can be fun. If it is run by a good director or a caring cast, that is. Douglas is the one who is framed. Basinger is the first lady with whom she has an affair (undeveloped, unresolved plot agreement). Sutherland is the best palm who believes in his guilt because he wouldn't have a movie if he didn't. And Longoria has nothing. Woman Maybelline's fortune and ... that's it. I think there are fewer requirements for women when entering the secret service. As usual, in such a film, Prezi's role is not a tool, a symbol, and it is very poorly written. <br /> <br /> Clark Johnson, who gave us the equally pathetic SWAT back in 2003, has no signature in the mechanical direction, and all the visual complexity is a cheap TV movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland look amazingly forever and far from their phones. Eva Longoria, the 21st century's most exposed woman, is basically just about attracting desperate housewives. His role is 100% meaningless and he does nothing to develop the plot or to complete the character development. She barely has 2 lines to rub them. A truly shameless marketing project. <br /> <br /> If you're punished, don't let me stop you. But it's time and money that you can't get back.
