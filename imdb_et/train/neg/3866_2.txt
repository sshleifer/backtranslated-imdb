I thought this film had no moral. I guess how would you feel if your groom left your wedding day for your cousin? I'd be broken by heart! It's classified as comedy, but I couldn't find it funny. I thought it was mostly cheap to laugh and took them. I usually love Julie Stiles movies, but this is an exception. Jason Lee celebrates another shameful exhibition, which once again proves that class and decent morality are not relevant in today's society. It had a complete lack of taste and I despise such films. I understand that people are protecting this movie and its morale because it's just a movie, but I still stand under my own brand that this bad behavior should not be allowed on the screen. I'm not trying to say that if you enjoyed this movie, you're a bad person because everyone has the right to own opinion, and some of this movie was enjoyable, I just say people in real life like the characters in this movie are disgraceful.
