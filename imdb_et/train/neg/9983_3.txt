This movie is a huge Yawn, which proves that Americans have not hung out for farce. Even if it's already written to them! The original movie "Hodet Over Vannet" is wisely about the comedy mistakes I would appreciate in 8/10. It's not just a linguistic translation, but some absurd chains of events are completely omitted, robbing this original smart landscape movie and making it a cheap "victim where my pants" are in the farce style.
