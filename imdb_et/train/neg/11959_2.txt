This film is a twisted nonsense of a film with a dysfunctional family in Japan that comes with a strange violent visitor who just sits back and watches 4 family members in the worst situation. Nothing in this movie is sacred, sexual drugs, and violence that goes beyond such boundaries, I'm surprised that it passed the censors. <br /> <br /> In general, I think it only complains to those we shouldn't be encouraging, not any of the key messages that come out for the rest of us. A film that hits the worst element of society and is dirty anyway ... Disappointment from a man who made the ultimate Dead or Alive and Audition films.
