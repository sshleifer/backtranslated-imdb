Demer Daves is a wonderful director when it comes to Western countries and the "broken arrow" remains in everyone's mind. As for the melodrama, he should know this to find out people like Vincente Minelli, George Cukor or the fabulous Douglas Sirk. The scenario is so predictable that you will not be surprised if you look at such a lukewarm fear. The nature of Natalie Wood was inspired by Fannie Hurst's "imitation of life" (see Stahl and Sirk), but who could have believed she was a Black Man's daughter anyway? Susan Kohner was "more reliable in emulating life") and Sinatra and Curtis are given so stereotypical parts that they can't do anything about them: a poor officer and a prosperous visitor and an average sergeant. to whom does Natalie fall in love? France is shown as a country of tolerance, where interracial unions are warmly welcome. At the time (about 1944) it was doubtful, it is still for the narrow-minded people you find here and everywhere.
