"Godzilla vs King Ghidorah" is a great example of how a big idea can destroy pathetic issues like pseudo-patriotism. Here, future travelers try to destroy Japan by replacing the local hero Godzilla with his puppy monster, King Ghidorah, a three-speed golden dragon. But they can't, and finally fight with Godzilla Ghidorah. The battles between the two battles are very cool, but the plot of the movie is full of holes and all the thing "Japan is great" is really stupid. The creators of this film did not even threaten the respect of the Japanese enemies, making them a stupid big blonde who is easily overcome by a smart Japanese. It is good that Godzilla and King Ghidorah finally destroyed both Japanese and ridiculous enemies in one (actually two) struggle. But until that battle, the movie was really boring and pathetic.
