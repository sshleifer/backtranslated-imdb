Cafe Lumiere is a beautifully photographed void. Without getting to know the chair, I am familiar with a filmmaker whom he allegedly respects - Ozu Yasujiro. Even when turning to Ozust's greatness, Hou has not communicated anything about the depth of Ozu's emotions and the focus on the meaning of closed space. One of the things he can't do is Ozu's character - we are not even "guided" by Hou to his lead (perfect blank page). His people have no middle or near frames. One of the DVDs provides interviews with actors and gives us exactly what Hou does - a good vision of their face. <br /> <br /> There was a big Spanish movie, Bardem named Nunca Pasa Nada, which translates something like "Nothing Ever Happens". This would be a much better name for this pointless use. Throughout the film, hints are given about hidden Taiwanese composers whose work we hear on the soundtrack. But hints, like everyone else, add something. If you are not a train driver, there is nothing to suggest on this film.
