What the hell is that? It's one of the darkest films I've seen. I don't understand why people on this site love it so much. His nonsense and nudity for no reason. Its the worst than Resident Evil. I don't strongly recommend it if you don't want to look at chessy, bad-acting mess. Watch real horor movies like Stephen King's, Shining, Jurassic Park (kinda horor), JAWS and more. Leave this crap for rent if there is nothing to rent. It's bad when Crudy vs Gayson. Killer's tomato attack is better than this mess. <br /> <br /> Oh, the meat eats zombies. How many busy zobie movies we need. Stop this one. <br /> <br /> * outta ****
