What happened under the name of God here? How is Redneck Zombies practically cheap to knock? Did Zombie '90 ever have to entertain anyone ... or even make a profit? But what, what happened here? <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence was run by Andres Schnaas, who specializes in soil-colored films such as Gore and Anthropophagus 2000, and some of them contain fright. headlines. In Gore, it's not much more than the rest. Despite how bad it is ... ..., it is burning. <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence is as bad as Peter Jackson's Dead-Alive, think about it. <br /> <br /> Too specific a story would be a waste of time. The accident involving chemicals causes the dead to come back and live. Never has this concept been dealt with in this way. Gore effects are healthy, new. Just a Z-Class Nightmare. I can't tell if it was originally funny or not, I doubt that English duplication was very true to the original script, but foreign stuff has happened. The whole thing just reminds me of the video that introduces the video to Troma, unless it lasts much longer. <br /> <br /> I've only seen one movie that was worse than that, Chooper. <br /> <br /> To prove that Andreas Schnaas is the real director, I would very much like Nikos The Impaler. If you think you have no standards in what you are looking for in a bad movie, try out Extreme Pestilence, but you are warned. It takes the nerves of steel to pass it. But if gore is everything you are here for, you might want it on your stomach. In addition, there is no atmosphere, no, and I mean NO budget, no entertainment value, but mostly no pride. Show pride, Schnaas. Updated September 5, 2009: After watching another Zombie '90, I've had a change of heart or I think I'll get it right now. Zombie '90 is funny, so eternal is harsh words, though Extreme Pestilence deserves only one star.
