I love watching early color films - do you think these 40s clothes were not all gray? <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford dominates this movie. His "eccentric" spectacle is actually quite attractive and yes, he has an amazing hourglass indicator. But I feel he was given too much head. He probably developed this characterization on many performances and no one told him that if it laughed, leave it out. She's doing too much stupidity if she should be surprising on earth. Madame Arcat's joke is that mediums were usually depicted in long drapery on nervous women. Arcati behaves like a pensioner (we really put it back!). The difference between his dull, ordinary way and his nervous beliefs is not really outlined. Just because all actors are English (except Cummings), the Americans feel they have to use the words "Brit", "rigid", "lip" and "upper". Oh, give her a rest! The three main characters lose their constant pace and make notes (Did he love you? Yes, but very discreetly - he was a cavalry!).
