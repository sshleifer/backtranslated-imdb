I've seen Dolemite and (Avenging) Disco Godfather, two other beautiful works from our friend Rudy Ray Moore. But this film, The Human Tornado (aka Dolemite 2), always holds a special place in my heart. Human Tornado cannot be folded, lack of filmmaking skills and absolute enthusiasm (to be honest, too much). <br /> <br /> The opening status determines the tone. Our old salary Dolemite captures a white woman when some racist local policemen attack the house without good reason and don't know it! Woman in bed with ol Dole is no other than a sheriff woman. His cry when he sees him, "He made me do it!" Dolemite crying: "& $ * @ $ is real ???" Fineness was never her strong place. <br /> <br /> Highlights? A very young Ernie Hudson (fame of Ghostbusters), continuity errors (characters that look in one direction on the next, Dolemite suit that changes colors for every shot of every nightclub action) and Queen Bee's demonic eyes in their first scene. <br /> <br /> The real pleasure here is Rudy Ray Moore himself. Did the man really think he saw the cool in this movie? I certainly do not know why, but you have to admire his enthusiasm. Does it jump out of the rock nude or command a command on the train (for example: Fast! Cave! I have a plan to let this mother $ * @ (% and dig my grave!), The man will definitely go overboard but never when he does kung fu. The climate fight has been filmed at high speed, but from time to time it slows down to make Rudy and teeth teeth as they accelerated the film as an effect or if they really want us to believe he was so fast. It's not like that. <br /> <br /> The human torso, like the original Dolemite, is incompetent with a huge proportion of film, but at least it's fun, and you definitely have to give those people the effort.
