This film is similar to Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005), but it is also much more graphical than both, and not as good as it is slow and quite predictable. There are also Deliverance and Amityville Horror. plus tones, we get a taste of a new age that is mixed and some of these scenes come as motivational / inspiring sermons. really, this movie is almost everything. In fact, they look a bit cheap. Of all this, there is really a terrible dialogue. And I'm not saying when, but there is a point where a couple of activities were not authentic or credible due to the circumstances. someone in the right sense that would have done this way. When you watch a movie, you know what I mean. Also, some nudity is a sake of nudity. It was simply not necessary at all. The good news is that the action was actually pretty good. Better than this film deserves s.so, after careful consideration of the evidence, say id say this movie was satisfactory but not good.
