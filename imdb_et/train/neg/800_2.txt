In fact, the 1999 flick has very good production values. The actors are attractive and reasonably talented. There are not a lot of clowns running through blasting, spending hundreds of rounds, but never hitting the meat. Also, there are no wild car drivers / crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are useless in the trash. <br /> <br /> The interiors look modern, architecturally and the equipment looks sniffing. Well, there is this high-tech computer room equipped with residues from the 50's electronics lab. And the body pancake make uples me up. Not a pancake make-up in the usual sense, but that looks like a dried pancake batter slathered over their open skin. It should support the idea that the bodies are calcined - although the way the virus performs this transmutation is the student's exercise (the viewer). <br /> <br /> Yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for sci-fi, horror flick, which I know, but I can't. A computer virus that is transmitted through a television (or computer monitor) and becomes a deadly biological pathogen? Give a break. Warp drives a la "Star Trek" is one thing, but photons become viruses? It is so stupid that the desired "fear factor" is simply not feasible. Flick could have used one of those terrible dreams where the dead come alive, or the cat jumps out of the closet or something because the viral thing doesn't do it. <br /> <br /> One assumes that Robert Wagner has the same excuse to play in the failure that Lord Oliver gave to some of his later, tricky places. He needed money. However, no other comparison should be interpreted.
