Ben Masters, "Kyd Thomas", "Dream Lover", "86 plays a kind of Mike Hammer character, a private character who does some old job and never misses all the good curves of good views. Kyd makes one big mistake when he stops Morgan Fairchild (Laura Cassidy / Eva Bomberg), "Arizona Summer", 73 for beating and rape. Kyd takes Laura to her pillow and when she wakes up, she eats her eggs and orange juice on her terrace and makes herself at home. By the way, Kyd sleeps in her bed and Laura slept on the couch of this scene Laura is mixed with all kinds of hoods and there are some hot scenes between Kyd and Laura, everything is said and done, it's a sad picture and I bought a DVD for just $ 1.50 and I really fell off!
