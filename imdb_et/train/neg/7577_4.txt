This is just a somewhat attractive "bad movie" for entertainers fans. For the 1970s pop culture students, it is more useful: fashion, furniture, attitudes, and the great "women's slip" of the early 1970s when it was still new to a fresh and independent woman. <br /> <br /> "Superchick" (Joyce Jillson) was financially rewarding as a punitive career (after all, being a team member but a 30,000-foot speaker - this also applies to men), he slept around several men, can protect himself and others (with carats) and nothing was involved. This is an emancipated woman who scared the juice out of the anti-feminists, the retrospective idiots who believe that no woman is without her husband. <br /> <br /> Sexy stewardess was a strong archetype in the late 1960s to the late 1970s (geez, even "The Partridge Family", remembering swinging bachelor Ruben Kincaid constantly with stewardesses) and from this point of view this is a silly film is an important pre-culture AIDS AIDS capsule. , free love, female lib, seventies. The plot is quite terrible. And there are a few bare breasts for the caves in the audience.
