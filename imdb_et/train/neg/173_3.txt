The right sequel, but does not pack the original stroke. The pivotal scriptwriter (Judd Nelson) takes on new identities to direct his novel CABIN LAKE. Still a merciless killing, but the film seems to be very exciting. Every humor is not funny. Overall, the quality of the whole project seems to be fast and sometimes Nelson is up. This movie talks about rewriting a script before going on the screen ... it should have happened to this script.
