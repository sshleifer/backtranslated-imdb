This is undoubtedly the worst film I've ever seen, and I have a big fear of terrible (and good) movies. It could (just) succeed in the humor of certain adolescents if it had been constantly linguistic - ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, which was really funny. Other movies, like PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, can be funny, but (obviously) trying to be serious. As for the actor, they seem to have rounded the dead teenagers of the brain and asked them to read the whole production. Compared to them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was one decent interpretation - it was the older ghoul-busting that was wide on the motorcycle.
