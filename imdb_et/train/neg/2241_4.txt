I remember it a few years ago, but I came again, I don't know why. I think it always looks good and girls do pretty well, but men promise to get down. Why, so why do we have such men in so many English sex movies to be next to girls? What's more, it starts as a farce predictable enough to resemble veins in the veins of Confessions, but about a third of the way (though we're going to enjoy the lovely Me Me Lai), the film asks us to start it seriously. Not only this, but the central rock club and cannabis sequence is very forced and easy to watch. In short, it is neither innocently silly nor intelligently serious, as it seems to be. Perhaps Richard O'Sullivan, like such a central figure, would have helped, but I think it is one of his worst performances. Just worth it for women.
