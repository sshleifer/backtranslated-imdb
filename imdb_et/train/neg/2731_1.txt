Really bad and easily the worst episode I've ever seen .... ever. <br /> <br /> They tried to make up for it by giving him "we know we're doing it" routine. It would have been funny if it hadn't been that "Simpsons" had already done it. And it wouldn't make up for it if they had come out of the idea first. <br /> <br /> Returns took place as part of the fantasy of ordinary characters (mainly J.D). Returns were not even real events, but they say that J.D fell over or, I don't know ... Elliott crashed. If I would like to look at Scrubs compilation that would be with me on youtube and not waste half an hour on my life. </Amend> I managed to go with them for 5 and a quarter of a year without it. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that cleaning shouldn't be such a sit-com. <br /> <br /> And like passing, why hell was Dr.Cox's bald?
