I had doubts that the film was bad. I'm behind the Duke fan. There are three years on the TV series DVD. Well, I was right. They took the family to see it. I really wanted to see that the general jump again and some of the pursuing scenes were good. But in summary, the film was a silly version of television. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson was pathetic. While I can honestly say that the original Daisy outfit was just as revealing, Jessica Simpson's interpretation of Daisy was just terrible. Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle must also run in their graves. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money. If you are an old tried and true Dukes fan like me and my three kids you are very disappointed.
