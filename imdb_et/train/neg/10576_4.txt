I was very excited when this series was premiere in 2005. The assumption was very simple and appealing: every episode would be a one-hour movie, led by a famous, remarkable horrorist. Then when I finally looked at them, it was a little open. There were some good episodes from this first season, but it was a mess. I gave it to the learning curve and thought the 2nd season would be much better. <br /> <br /> Boy, who was dancing. There were some good stories here and there at least in the season. The second season (except for the "Black Cat", which is a great Jeffrey Combs) was a complete and complete loss for me. The episode "Sounds Like" can be the worst thing I've been watching on television for the last 10 years, and most other episodes aren't much better. I really hope that season 3 will change it next year, but I will not hold my breath.
