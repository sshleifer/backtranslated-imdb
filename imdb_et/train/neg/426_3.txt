Don't make me wrong, the movie is beautiful, the shots are stunning and the material is dramatic. But it was a big disappointment and I was very angry with what Disney had done. It was fine. It was a general feeling of balance and showed all life and death. There was a tragedy and triumph, a loss and a benefit. It was balanced. <br /> <br /> Disney's Earth editing is not one of them. They tried to make a movie about which we Americans would talk about. They made it to DRAMATIC. They put a top musical score there to scare us. They did the evil of the predators. They made WALRUSES evil. They showed each meeting negative. He tried to be suspicious and succeeded, but to balance the lesson. The film was an hour and a half negative and only about 10 minutes positive. <br /> This is another thing I went to see on the big screen but was disappointed with the picture quality. It seemed better on my TV at home. This is a better lesson, better sound, and (if you have Blu-Ray) better picture quality.
