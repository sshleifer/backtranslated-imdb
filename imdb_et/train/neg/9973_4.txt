"Troubled child" is one of the films ever made. This is not the worst (though some people disagree with it), but it's not the best either. This is a 7-year-old devilish boy who makes a comic devastation for a childless child (John Ritter, Amy Yasbeck) who takes him foolishly. This movie is too foolish and unbelievable because I don't buy for one second so that the child can act as hard as the child does. It is asinine and unpleasant, although I smiled several times (I really don't know why). But I can't recommend this movie. I know I'm too kind to her. If there is one positive thing about a problematic child, it is better than steep, which was just terrible. <br /> <br /> ** (Four)
