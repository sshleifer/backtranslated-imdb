I read this video after reading the text box, the story seemed good and it was Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes of watching, I noticed how terrible his actions were, he walks and talks so foolishly all the time, it's fake and not convincing. It doesn't end there, almost all the characters work so badly that it is ridiculous, the only acceptable way of action was Alan Boyce (David), but the man makes suicide early and you don't see him again, you never know why he did it! Everything about this movie is screaming at low quality, I can't believe how such a thing is released! I was tempted to stop, many times, I did, halfway through, I decided to stop watching and I turned this thing out, I came to IMDB to check what others think about it, I found zero comments (not surprised), so I I decided to force me to handle the pain and go back to finally stop it to comment here. The only good thing (for me) was the theme of the high school Rock band, playing the guitar from time to time and singing, but that's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Very bad acting and control ... A terrible movie.
