This is a bad film, but I have to give it to the actor. Francine Forbes. He seemed to work the least and I thought he was kind of cute. Too bad appears in only one other database. In addition, the film is full of ridiculous gore and fakey death scenes. People grab and they get like 2 gallons of blood! But if you want to watch the scared movies of the poor, I highly recommend it.
