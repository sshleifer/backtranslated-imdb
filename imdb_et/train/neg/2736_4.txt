The only reason I comment is that I finally realized why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all understood this week, Dr. Cox balded because they showed these episodes in a different order when they filmed them. The last episode when our favorite tough, Jesus loving sister Roberts dies Dr Cox shakes his head. They must see them unevenly for some strange reason and forgot that they interrupted continuity. Because shame, Scrubs. They have made mistakes before that. I remember Elliot still trying to get Scott Foley and his hair wet for 2 seconds before the water hits him. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite exhibition must speed it up.
