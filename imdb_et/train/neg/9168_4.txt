Randolph Scott leaves the United States for Canada's British Columbia green pastures. He wants to start a livestock partner with Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo. They will strike a toll bridge built by Victor Jory over their small herd. Later rusty Jory's herd and Williams loses his left hand during frasades. Unfortunately, the Cariboo track is never considered one of the best Western countries. <br /> <br /> It's more than the material that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry could use. The story is sometimes silly. Williams, who had traveled with Scott, wanted to go to see gold because there was a big strike at that time. He does not blame the rustler, he accuses Scott of persuading him to travel for the loss of his hand. <br /> <br /> The film also features a scene where the Indians are Scott, Lee Tung Foo and Gabby Hayes. They're fleeing because Gabby's mule is taught to command and flees from the Indians, allowing our heroes to escape. I'm not sure I could have played Rogers movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the story really wants to believe that Randolph Scott, a striker, is randomly hit by gold after some lesson from Gabby Hayes on how to find gold. <br /> <br /> It was part of Gabby Hayes' farewell film. It would have been better for him to go out in the good west and actually he had done a few better with Randolph Scott before. <br /> <br /> I say this, although no Caribou appeared in the movie, it's one of the few Canadian past movies that doesn't have any counties. <br /> <br /> But if I were you, if you're not a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes, take the next tour out of the Cariboo Trail.
