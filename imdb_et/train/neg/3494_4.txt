Given its popularity, I found this film a great disappointment. Maybe I was expecting too much of this movie. After all, it is one of the most famous martial arts films of the 1970s, but I never realized why. The story is uninteresting. It is also a very talkative film with sporadic sequences of action. My biggest problem with the film was that the story doesn't offer the character I could root because the hero is an idiot. Director Chang does not have a sense of style and is unable to hide the outstanding shortcomings found in the narrative. I know it shouldn't be high art, but I found the movie boring. This is certainly not the best example of a beloved genre. The status of this cult escapes me. I suggest you skip this.
