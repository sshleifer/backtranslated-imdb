I saw this movie a few years ago. I couldn't sleep and there was nothing. So I peep at it. What really happens to me does not make sense and why it disturbs. Richard grabs the chicken wire and Jarvis starts Richard with the girl when he is unconscious. Then Troubador, a friend of Jarvis, plays a silly song on his guitar. The next morning it will show Richard the girl who speaks to Jarvis and Trouby, and then walks back to Richard and looks at her until she is still there. Then they play some happy music and the movie is over. I mean, what happened? Did they hold back? And what did he say to the two men (Trouby and Jarvis)? It's puzzling and poor. I don't stick to movies that are distracting and don't make sense. It was the worst film I've seen since the 90s butterfly version of the Lord.
