Wow. What a beautiful novel a terrible adaptation. Here are just a few handles. - Two main characters from the book were removed from the script. - Changing the plot is grotesque. - Voiceovers sound like they are directly raised from written passages (which can be read well but not spoken, especially in the style of Chabon's writing). - Actress is more than a log house. (Esp. Bechstein) - Should this be set in 1983? It seems more like 2003 ... <br /> <br /> To be fair, I couldn't watch this movie, so it's possible that he redeemed himself ... (sarcasm). I really hope that no one will pay to see it, or at least someone who read the book, hoping for something good (la Wonder Boys). I like Chabon as a writer, but he should be ASHAMED about this customization. <br /> <br /> No stars.
