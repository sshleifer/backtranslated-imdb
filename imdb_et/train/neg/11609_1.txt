I'm not from America and I know what "husband exchange" is. When that name came out, I was glad to see some cool glamorous sexual moments from the program. But what I got was genuine stupidity of sucking. I had misjudged the title of this title, it had no adult content, no nudity, not even vulgar dialogues (a wide-cast folded Hallmark channel and I think they changed / silenced such content to make it clean). <br /> <br /> An exhibition that gives an overview of the current state of the American / Western family, overweight obese people, contaminated teenagers, and their sucking family. In each episode, two women / two mothers (or more) were chosen to live with each other at home and exchange each other's family routine with their new rule. Sometimes it is good or more evenly bad. At the end, each mother is brought back to her husband and tries to stop what they did to each family during the last day. This is a part of the program designed to suck in, where each competitor fights for their rights. I had to suck to see all of them instead of seeing some cool adult sex. I mean, who does this program more than the one who gave the name "Wife Swap"; it is better to call it "mother exchange". All in all, it breaks all the great things that real husband exchanges mean! <br /> <br /> Spouse Exchanges = Average Suction Reality.
