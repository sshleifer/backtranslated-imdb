The fact that I didn't like music is a very personal opinion, there are no historical events. I understand that this is an opera, not a documentary, but some important aspects are missing, especially if other people misunderstand it. <br /> <br /> Abbu Abas was the mainstay of the operation that was staged for re-organized on board a ship to discover 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons, one of whom was Samir Kuntar, a terrible terrorist whose story was found in "klinghoffer samir kuntar" google also. Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations, even though he had never been to Acho Lauro on foot. Ben Laden never set foot on the airplanes that hit WTC, was he? <br /> <br /> *** Possible Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> The film almost apologizes to terrorists for their actions and reactions to the horrors they may have lived, exaggerating and exaggerating how many Israeli persons are to hurt them. However, they never pose a loss to the Palestinians for the Israelites. The film uses (quite awful !!!) pictures of the horror of Sabra and Chatila, and nothing is said without understanding the general belief that it was Israel, who was responsible, never to mention that it was in the Syrian army in Syria. bloodshed. <br /> <br /> Actress was generally very bad, but I think it can be expected from opera singers? <br /> <br /> In the second note, I am shocked at how a person can apologize for the hostage killing of terrorists because the hostage attempted to mix 400 innocent hostages against armed terrorists and add that he should not be considered sympathetic because he is a supporter of Zionism. Imagine how his wife was uncomfortable spitting the terrorists who shot his wife and threw his body into the sea. I hope no one in the world is as cruel as he is
