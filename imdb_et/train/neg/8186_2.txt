Has anyone read the script. It must be part of the worst writing and management of the whole year. Three great actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz, and Miranda Richardson, couldn't pull it out. About two-thirds seemed to say that Giamatti's eyes said: I can't believe I have signed the contract. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's really a bad Christmas movie list. Not enough lines, but what else can I say? Okay, the movie just doesn't go along with Vaughn's decent dialogue, its character is just a horrible guy you just can't get past. Just walked through that no one seemed to be caught up.
