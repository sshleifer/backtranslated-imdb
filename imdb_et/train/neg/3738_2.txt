It should be the title, anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie combines weapons, explosives, and pointless killing to make one "movie" flop. Let me point out a number of questions: the answers are about the type. <br /> <br /> What happens in the movie? People die. <br /> <br /> Is it? Yes, yes. <br /> <br /> What is a graph? What's the plot? <br /> <br /> What is the point the movie is trying to make? Slaughter is the only solution. <br /> <br /> What are these characters? Extremely flawed and contradictory to your personalities. <br /> <br /> Is there any good thing about this movie? Yes, yes. I'm sure they used some nice Panavision cameras for filming. <br /> <br /> If you like constant killing and greed, check out the movie. If you experience such a low standard of entertainment, "Made Men" is not for you. <br /> <br /> To sum up, the plotline stinks, the characters are not worth it, it is the opposite and nothing matches. <br /> <br /> It proves one thing: the actors, the leaders, and who definitely helped make this movie "Made".
