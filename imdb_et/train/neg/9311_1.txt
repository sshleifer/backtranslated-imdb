The DVD and disc cover is amazing, you think they made a movie with a twisted black tooth that is really a great idea, but this film's actors are worst than Ben's pearl heat, porn is better quality and better players. I bought a DVD, but fortunately I rented it for the first time, the plot and the script are terrible, nothing seems to work together so the film never makes sense. Poor attempts to intimidate you with posterior scenes are worse than those used in the 80s sitcom exhibitions, and finally leave you who want your head against the wall of your house.
