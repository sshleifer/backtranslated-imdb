One Star. That's all this documentary deserves. I haven't been watching this movie for a while, not to mention the documentary, for some time now. <br /> <br /> I am the biggest fan of the "Walking With ..." series, including Nigel Marvin's spin-off, all their gleeful fun but informative information. And while the theme of the prehistoric man is not nearly as interesting to me as other prehistoric beings, the subject is still interesting and unique to explore. After seeing all the other serial documents, I thought I had to see it, especially after I saw relatively good comments in other places. <br /> <br /> For those of you who made a good overview of this doc ... what did you mean?! lol. <br /> <br /> Although the information they were able to pass was interesting, the presentation failed in other ways. It was a terrible stream, incredibly purposeful in what he was trying to say (confused and sometimes on the spot), terrible effects (which include some CGI moments and especially makeup effects) and excessive MTV style When talking about camera effects, one reviewer mentioned how ridiculous The scene was when the caves met this giant monkey and how it looks like a 70's man-suit-horror movie. Well, there are many moments just like people who portrayed monkey men, saw ridiculous and acted ridiculous. None of this helps in terrible camera positions and compositions. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this is none of what is shown in an interesting or dynamic way or that looks remotely real. It doesn't even look like it's taken seriously. It also lacked the emotional punch the predecessors of the series had. Remember the episode of Ornithochirus (sp?) Fate of "Dinosaur Walking"? This episode always gets me on the edge of tears every time I watch it. This is the attitude that was most absent in this topic. If you have been more concerned with the subject and your own personal story, even if it is just speculation, you care about the facts surrounding it. <br /> <br /> The only rescue work for this production is a fairly good story (at least in the BBC version) and music. Otherwise, don't even worry about renting it if you don't want to laugh (which I did frequently but usually followed by rolling eyes). It is not on the shelf of other "Walking With ..." documents. <br /> <br /> Is it reasonable to know that this document is not produced or directly related to the same people who did it in the other series? Hmmm ...
