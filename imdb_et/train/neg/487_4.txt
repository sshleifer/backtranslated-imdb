What did the director think? Everyone who has read the Artemisia biography has the impression that his courage is facing public rape attempts during the Renaissance, and even tortures to show that Tas is guilty. This fact shows true independence and emancipation - his most terrible hour is in his MAN. Why do the Renaissance films have to be so beautiful and romantic, are we afraid to see the vivid aspects of life, or did Hollywood's happy-lucky mood win? Although I would always protect the director's freedom to create a life reality in my film, I cannot understand that the story of Artimisia's life is put on the head. The makers of this film are very disappointing.
