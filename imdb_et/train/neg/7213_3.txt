While I think Exorc is a horror classic, I have to admit that I don't keep it as high as many other fear fans do. As a result, I have not seen many Exorcist attacks, and when Exorcismo has something to do, I have to say that this is a good thing, because this movie is boring like hell and definitely won't cost ninety minutes to do it! For fairly other exorcist attacks, it is often considered to be one of the worst and so it was not the best place for me. It is not difficult to guess what plot is: basically it is the same as the exorcist and sees the girl with a spiritual spirit (which happens in the spirit of her dead father). The village priest is then called to perform exorism. Like many Spanish horror films, this star Paul Naschy is the best of the film. Exorcismo was led by Juan Bosch, who previously led the Spanish Giallo 'The Killer Wore Gloves'. I have not seen other of his films, but on the basis of these two: I believe that originality was not one of his strengths. There are not many good things I can say about the film myself; for the most part it's just plods and the exorism scene is not worth it. I certainly don't recommend it!
