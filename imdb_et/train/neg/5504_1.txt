There is no reason why I understand why this film has ever been made. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood need to continue one of the most frightening classic updates after another? (Cases: Mister Magoo, Avengers - Terrible!) <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd, whom I usually enjoyed, was so wrong in this role. The manic depiction of his beloved "Uncle Martin" is so abusive that it is almost criminal. His waving, agitation, grimacing, and histrionics do not give us any reason to care for his character except for a 1-dimensional comic character. <br /> <br /> The director must have thought that the quick movement, the screaming dialogue and the "single chance" slapstick had a similarity to comedy, apparently he told every ACTOR to act as if they were red ants in their pants. <br /> <br /> The mistake must be in an irresponsibly processed script I think the writer used "It's a crazy, mad, crazy, mad world" as an example of fine comedy. - it suddenly looks pretty good compared to it. <br /> <br /> The most sad thing about this movie is that it is probably written to turn to small children. I am just not sure whose kids did it. <br /> <br /> If they had to "My Favorite Mars", why didn't they add some timeless charm to the original classics? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, IMDB.com cannot Readers rank zero to deal with, this is the only price the nang that comes to mind when describing this traverse. <br /> <br /> One good thing that came from this movie was the participants and the team paid - I think.
