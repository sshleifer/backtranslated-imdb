The only reason I earn it is that filmography is so stylized these days that it has at least something to comment on. <br /> <br /> This movie is asin. It's like many other 21st century grinding house feeds. Gore is free and easy to thunder. I do not care about any character, but I care that some cretan was worried about this mess: I complain about the money I spent, but my date and I went wisely after 40 minutes and went to the theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining "Live Free" or "Die Hard", which probably got a much higher rating from me because I suffered "Captivity" for a full 40 minutes.
