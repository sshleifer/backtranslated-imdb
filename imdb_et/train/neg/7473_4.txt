My husband and I were interested in the spectacle - a southern lady with strong willpower, who had a dirty personal life, solves the crimes of LAPD. The first season was a TV we didn't see. Unfortunately, the seasons in his second season changed because of the annoying and unreliable character we watched. <br /> <br /> My husband and I were concerned about an episode in which he was trying to hide him from his mother that he had broken. But the shredder of the deal was an episode where he concealed his potential pregnancy from his boyfriend but tells his boss. Why should a strong, middle-aged woman do these things? The answer is that he would not. In addition, we choose our husband and I have a poor boy with almost perfect accuracy. It is almost always a white male or female who was introduced to the crime scene or ideally in the family. Can script writers from time to time do something original? As I mentioned, we are no longer viewers. We prefer exhibitions that do not give character characters and insult our intelligence.
