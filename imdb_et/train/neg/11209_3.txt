This unpleasant mini-operetta, which has the Eddy-McDonald prototype in the Valentino scenario, is so bad that it will become an endurance exercise in five minutes. It is stupid because it briefly opens two soldiers who talk about the lack of masculinity in one officer's sons. In less than a minute he is packed in Morrocos, where he lives as a double shadow of red life; The Arab tribe, who rather sings as a fighter, leader. <br /> <br /> Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare have fine light opera voices (with little operational capability) and good bass, but there are so casual scenes that are so badly prepared, they feel they are doing things when they go. <br /> <br /> These two reels formed part of a larger performance featuring six writers. More space for fraud and looting might have shown some entertaining values, but this hurrying kitty is little more than an insult that awaits the feature's presentation.
