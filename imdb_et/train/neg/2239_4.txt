The plot has already been described by other reviewers, so I just add that my desire to see this movie was to see Gabrielle Draket in all its indisputable glory. <br /> <br /> Miss Drake has to be one of the sexiest, most beautiful examples of the "posh totty" cellulose commitment. In his age and age, only the same subtle Jane Asher is close. What was it with actresses with musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who like me, Gabrielle admired her scenes in this movie. He has a great figure, and none of them is here to imagine. <br /> <br /> The movie as a whole is very bad and very cheap at the time. The song that covers the open credit seems to be forever and terrible.
