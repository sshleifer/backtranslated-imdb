A woman asks for advice to reach a mysterious city and hears two haunting stories about the local strange, both related to it. But perhaps fate has something unpleasant for him ... <br /> <br /> The zombie chronicle is absolutely one of the worst films I've ever seen. In fact, I have to admit that it was so bad that I handed over a lot of garbage. And there were many, believe me. It only takes 69 minutes and there is another ton of filler. You have some skin heads that make a lot of thrusts, lots of blunt kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (this rhyme, tea) and fine examples of why some people should never be actors. <br /> <br /> For title characters, the movie hardly even has a footnote. Why do you get more undead activity in the intro than the previous feature! Even though pathetic eyes penetrate the sockets and eat brain sequences (among other things, "joy"), it may be a hidden blessing. <br /> <br /> And it's all off. like being filmed on someone's mobile phone to broadcast it on YouTube. Jerky's camera work, scratches on the print, flashing lights ... I had to rub my eyes when I realized that it was done in 2001 and not in 1971. Even the clothes and the fashionable look are outdated for about three decades! <Br /> <br /> If you think I'm not reviewing a qualified chronicle that hasn't seen the whole movie, go ahead. You're trying to sit through it, I'll make sure you don't do it even before you start your excuses and departure for the first appearance of the blue smart freaks. It is really ridiculous that someone decided to release it, and honestly, you can get a lot more fun for a rest than actually torturing a DVD player with this horrible excuse for horror. In fact, it is not surprised if it wraps bags and sheets in the morning, leaving you in the forefront of watching VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned ... 0/10 <br /> <br /> P. What is the 18-rating horror that a woman holds a massive sports bra during a compulsory sex event?! See that the movie can't even get that part ...
