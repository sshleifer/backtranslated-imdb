Don't you just hate it when you order a steak, but the restaurant gives you a chicken? <br /> <br /> So I felt the so-called "Battlestar Galactica" look. Arguments can be made about its quality, but the fact remains, it is not what the fans ordered. <br /> <br /> Imagine sitting in this prestigious restaurant. You've been waiting for these years to bring back your famous New York Strip steaks you loved. When your meal arrives, you will find that they have used the name "New York Strip" on a chicken plate. You complain, but the waiter just says "but ze cheeken, in front of a really good zir"! Do you really care if the chicken is good? You Wanted The New York Strip - STEAK! Then the waiter explains, "you zee zir, ze chef wanted to do as you zay, zomezing NEW. We felt that chee pleek would be a more popular zo when we gave him his previous delicious deesh name." You ask whether you will find a new New York bar in the future, but be informed that since the restaurant now has the New York bar title in the menu, you will never see the New York Bar - Such a case is something that creates something new and "Battlestar Galactica "namesake. <br /> <br /> * This mini-series violates all fans of fans. the original show! * <br /> <br /> It is a shame that the production team responsible for this new version obviously disdained the original. The BG Resurrection Team had to love the original series - trying to improve what the fans loved, not to try to sell the new series shamelessly, using the name of Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Give us a new show, do it! Give her a new name! Don't use the name we remember to try to attract viewers. This will deprive us of the opportunity to see any similarity in the future. <br /> <br /> We've been waiting for 25 years to see what we knew as BG because we want something from the original! We just didn't want the NAME and remnants of the basic concept. We are the things we loved about the original series! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the best elements of the original were those that were left out. Of course, the original BG was imperfect and could have used some innovations. However, this mini-series was not a kind of correction, but special effects (which were good according to today's standards, but nothing unusual). <br /> <br /> Many viewers are discussing its quality. NEW EXHIBITIONS, but we do not give SciF and Ron Moore forgiveness to destroy our dream. <br /> <br /> In saying this ... I offer some new comments about this new mini advantage (not compared to the original): <br /> <br /> Sequences were the best. Obviously, efforts were made to make the effect more "real" and less "wow - look at this effect". I wouldn't say that these sequences were exceptional by today's standards, but they were in line with cable original movies. What was this "pseudo-live-cam"? Some views attempted to falsify the "true" camera effect with lagging tracking and pulling zoom. However, it was used too much, given that these cameras did not show any visible SOURCE. The infinitely more intelligent series, Babylon 5, is the only example I've seen of "live cameras" that we used effectively when we allegedly witnessed security measures. <br /> <br /> The script you ask? The script seemed to be written by a teenager for other teenagers. Characters felt cardboard and stereotypical. Indeed, the whole story was familiar with other known stereotypes. The only good features of the whole story were the few items that were stored in the original series. It was obviously "dumbed down" by digesting its medium TV audience. <br /> <br /> People's communication was pathetic. Instead of a drama based on a subtle look, expression and fine timing, the moment of every human tension was so exaggerated that they lost any ability to move any refined viewer. It was evident in any communication between Adama and his son. The director must have tried to make sure that the closest and most unknown viewer does not miss it, even if he does not pay attention. Sorry, but real people do not behave like a constant. <br /> <br /> I would not have considered it as a BAD show if it were independent. Nothing great; it is never respected by true SciF fans or craftsmen, but it would be traceable by the masses. I could live personally without it. I only looked at it to see how it really hit the original spirit. <br /> <br /> How this mini-series is always remembered is a symbol of how the quality of storytelling is overlooked in order to turn to larger numbers. How even the SciFi Channel has "faded" its production to satisfy the mass, not its real niche market, fans of Science Fiction. This is the time we asked to fry and they asked us to give chicken to our chickens. <br /> <br /> I'll leave you with just one thought - <br /> <br /> NO "MOORE". <br /> <br />
