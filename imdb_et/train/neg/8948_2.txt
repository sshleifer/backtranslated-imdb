"Nineteen Eighty Four" is a film about a futuristic society where the government controls everything and no one can trust. It's a very dark film, and it doesn't make you feel good. It is the romance in this society and the betrayal of lovers and the fact that the human animal is self-centered. The film has some very good ideas and is doing well when depicting this society in dark tones (in contrast to happiness and vivid colors in sleep) and the feeling of general loneliness through objects, people and places. Despite the intelligence of the film in depicting this idea, the film was very slow and it seemed that the idea didn't get. It seems to have spent too much time wisely, not telling the story.
