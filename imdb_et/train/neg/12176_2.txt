The original Trancers are not a great movie at all. It was a massive plot of holes and very little way to internal logic. However, it was fun, better than most low-budget B-movies, and it can be surprisingly funny. Unfortunately, Trancers II is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Trancers II suffers from many of the flop results of many flops due to many of the same issues. The plot is thin enough to see and write inconvenient. It seems that the people behind this film felt that bringing the first faces of the first film would be enough and wouldn't bother anything else. Even veteran B-class actors such as Tim Thomerson and Jeffery Combs could not drag this movie. <br /> <br /> Short plot overview: Jack Deth (Thomerson) is a future policeman who was sent in 1985 to save the ancestors of his government members. Trancers II takes place six years after the events of the first transceivers. Jack Deth is married to Lena (Helen Hunt), the woman with whom he met in the first film, and both lived with Hap Ashby, the man Deth was sent to the past for defense. It has been discovered that Whistler's brother (the first boy's bad boy) has ridden back in time to create a soldier army, people became insane to kill zombies to kill Ashby. The complication of Jack's mission is the fact that his first wife, who had died long before Jack's past, was sent back to stop Whistler's brother, and now Jack finds he works with him. <br /> <br /> I have two real problems with this movie. One of them is that the Trancers creation method in this movie is radically different from the methods used in the first film. What makes it annoying is that, in a rather poor example of the Soviet Revolution, they act as a technique. <br /> <br /> Another thing that bothers me is that Deth, Lena and Alice Stilwell (Jack's first wife) are given very little time. This disturbed me especially because it was much more interesting than the real plot of the movie. It seemed like it was just something that was thrown to fill the movie room. In particular, Alice's character seems very worrying about the fact that she has reunited with the marriage to find she is married again, so she is very low or very poorly written. <br /> <br /> The only reason I think about watching this movie is if you are interested in watching the whole series of Trants (currently a total of six movies). Otherwise, even if you are a fan of the original Trancerside, stay away from this cold queue.
