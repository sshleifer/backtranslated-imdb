It was one of the most boring horror films I've ever seen. The child of the College has an epidemic of nightmares related to roaming in Alcatraz. In an effort to provide a blend of "Nightmare's Elm Street" and standard vampire tickets in the form of a bad 80s music video, this movie is stuck full of bad acting and exhaustively slow motion story. Although it is such a bad and often ridiculous film (dig these mullets and terrible dialogue), it would be a good material to cheat the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes. Don't be fooled by the fabulous reputation of the film, the winner of Sicence Fiction, Fanatasy and Horror Silver Scroll 1987 or that Devo bets on a soundtrack or that Tony Basil is in the movie. This is a gigantic disaster, but after that there is a small cult (see other IMDb comments about this movie).
