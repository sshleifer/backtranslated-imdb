The autobiography of the founder of the NYC Zoo begins very cute and would be a great family film when it was there. but we are dealing with reality more and more, because gorilla grows into a wild thing that cannot easily be satisfied with the wishes of its "mother" - it can scare younger children, especially. Scenes where Buddy tries to injure Gertrude. quite a quick solution at the end. below average.
