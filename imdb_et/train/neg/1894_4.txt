Although the film is titled Flying Guillotines, it has no connection with the original Flying Guillotines (1975) and the Flying Guillotines II (1978). The two originals are masterpieces of the kung-fu film and still stand out as a classic. This is a much worse copy of the original, and even if it's a normal kung-fu movie, it's below average. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie doesn't have much to do. This is one pointless fight scene after another and the flying guillotine doesn't even play an important role in them. The story is for some Shaolin monks who watch some of the villains who have taken off the holy book, and the evil prince who owns this book is part of the plot. The same evil prince plans to lure the monks and use these flying guillotines. <br /> <br /> Flying Guillotine has four titles. This is, in my opinion, the least quality. The design of this film's guillotine differs from the other three, which shows that the film was created by another unit from the other three. <br /> <br /> There is no chemistry in the movie that bad production would be unintentionally funny. <br /> <br /> Best to skip and view two originals.
