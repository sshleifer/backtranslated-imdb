I couldn't wait to receive a DVD after hearing so much about the movie. What a disappointment! It became one of the confusing films I've ever seen. There were so many signs, some reminding others that the story couldn't be followed. I did not understand how George Clooney was awarded the film because he was hardly involved, at least in the first half of the film. My wife and I gave up the affliction in about an hour and stopped the DVD. Perhaps I should have had a quick transmission to see if the end was better, but after so much confusion it was decided that the healing possibilities were thin. A co-worker told me that a lot of the movie "comes together" at the last minute or less. I was glad I didn't waste another hour. I gave the DVD the next day.
