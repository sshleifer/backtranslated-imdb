The ABC Family Test Blow Blocker "Cheaper Dozen" results in an unpleasant amount of brilliant dialogue, low plot lines and cheesy comebacks. About two good actors among many wishes, this film was a great disappointment. It's already a bad plot of Hollywood wannabe ditto. Then, because they needed a lot of participants, it meant they would probably be milder. So the actor was not five stars. The plot movement was quite fast and the twists were bad and they had terrible timing. The intersection of the characters and the "final relations" were too muscular and clich√© for me. Free yourself and rent something better.
