CQ was the worst film this year. Almost every movie I see in the theater is at least entertaining or has something to say. This film looked like it was directed by its intro film student. film making class. His father makes great films. Her sister did good. But brother Roman? NO! One critic was comparing this film with Godardi Le MÃ©pris (Contempt). Although Coppola, Jr. did the same idea, a movie about the film, he tried too hard to feel like a European, artistic and witty, if all this was really just another. The main actor carries the same expression of the same film as he is scary or shocked around the film. Schwartzman has somehow succeeded in fetching his enchanting director role. Depardieu is fine. One scene that has a real film shoot at all is not surprising, not B-movie scenes, but rather in Italy; assembling pictures taken with several different symbols inside a very small car that drives random people. It was the only thing that reminded me of the cinema I think he was trying to get corrupted. Or rip-off. Or both. A documentary that guides you into talking to the camera and filming various objects has been played out, ending in a "twist" or for artistic value ... I think the film was the funniest thing, and not the way it was going. No wonder this movie was sent back after the festival screening to edit it again or take a picture again or whatever makes me curious about how bad it used to be. I can't believe it could have been worse. If you want to see a good movie parody, check out Austin Power's movies. All of them. Opening to the third is more fun and genius than the whole movie. Lil 'Romy, for the cinema, return to your cousin's music video management. Leave the godfather to the father.
