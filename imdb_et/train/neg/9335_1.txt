The reason it is such a bad film is that it is so badly written, and it is the fault of the writer Robert James Waller, who is also the author of the Madison County bridges. Writing is bad because the plot is perfect and the dialogue is woody and unlikely. Missing couple is blocked by American writer and beautiful Mexican woman whose history is ashamed has been swept by a strong, self-directed offender, and after a few adventures (mostly terribly violent) alternating with scenes that show the warmest side of the assassin, she leaves the impotent partner with the killer for the killer, who, as he is bad, sees him more clearly than anyone else. Nothing will help this film succeed, not even as Scott Glenn's killer, not the appealing latin of Giovanna Zacarias as Luz, and not even the killing of Harvey Keitel as a CIA specialist who had been killed to kill the killer. Serious waste of time.
