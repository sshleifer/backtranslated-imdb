Obviously, people who wrote the back of the box didn't want to watch this movie. They described "blindly choreographic intrigue and violence". I didn't see "intrigue". Instead, I saw an impatient event in a dialogue in a kung fu movie. I didn't see "violence." At least, I didn't see anything that could cause me to stop my belief in what could damage a man with a "waterproof" skin, but here I probably have too much "plot". In addition, as a viewer of many and various films (some of which also contain a casual kung fu movie), it can be said that this piece of pulp is invisible. Regardless of what you decide to do, always stay with me <br /> <br /> Jonathan Tanner <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> P.S. Choreography wasn't my blind.
