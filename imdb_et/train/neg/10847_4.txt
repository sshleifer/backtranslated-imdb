The cut version of the drivers that I saw was very long for this type of movie. Almost two hours is too long. If you have a choice, then definitely go for the managers who are not chaired. <br /> <br /> The main plot is almost non-existent, the movie consists of several main parts of the murder picture that are connected, but they feel they are only shown to fill the film with adult violence. The connection will not be published until the last part and the lack of context longed for me long before I was there. <br /> <br /> As a movie, it doesn't work. You will never get the feeling you need because of mediocre action and general behavior (the character is presented, 15 minutes later the character is dead). Such images are the strengths of the spray part.
