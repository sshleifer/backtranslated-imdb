I just sat in the theater that was forever beating, I wanted to leave the movie halfway. The plot is easy 4 Samoan boys break the wedding. So they have to give dates to get to the wedding. Nohu. <br /> <br /> The thing that drew me the most was the so-called raw jokes ... They were very UNfunny, cliched and thrown to your face to get into a boring movie. The action was lower than average and I felt that the movie went on and did nothing more than just jokes and a predictable plot. <br /> <br /> All in all, one of the worst films I've seen in 2006 is unpleasant, bad behavior, just ugly. <br /> <br /> Thanks to God, my friend shouted. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
