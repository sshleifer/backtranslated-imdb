I am a person who always chooses to go into horror when choosing a movie, so I picked my eyes over five, I was disgusted with this movie and thought I had no story and no sense you could enjoy it, it made my skin crawl to guess people want to watch movies that just encourage this violence because it was a low budget and very rubbish! I think I could do better. I think it was the worst film I have ever seen in my life, and you shouldn't bother that the actors were debris that the camera was terrible when the picture was bad and the sound was not reset, I think it was a bit like the hanging of the seal, which wasn't working at all, was a mistake.
