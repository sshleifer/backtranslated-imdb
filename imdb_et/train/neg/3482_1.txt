So, I know I voted from 10 out of 10, but it really doesn't deserve more than half of the stars. I hated it. It was so stupid and unrealistic, I can't believe any letters signed to make this ridiculously absurd project. <br /> <br /> James G. and Cathrine O'Hara were great in their characters, and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate were equally good, but the story was marvelous and I encourage everyone who sees it in the video store to even bother and reading the back cover, but just walking away ... I don't even want to get into what the movie is, because it's too stupid to pentify it. <br /> <br /> Don't try it! It's terrible! Terrible!
