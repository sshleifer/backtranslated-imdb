Director Ron Atkins is really crazy. This very low budget film crowns a few days in one Harry Russo's life (John Giancaspro, who also wrote together), a nut job who gets his female girlfriend Rubberneck doll. He starts to take orders for the doll to take huge drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. What starts as a movie about the use of balls and walls, which remains so well, but it changes very often very quickly. I rely more on a certified madman. It's hard to forget when you have seen it. Great when Tom Green ever made a horror movie. <br /> <br /> My degree: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell gets totally naked; Jasmin Putnam shows tits and shrubs <br /> <br /> ANTI-eye candy: see that John is repeatedly naked
