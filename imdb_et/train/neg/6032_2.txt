I am a Christian who generally believes in theology taught behind the left. That means I think there is one of the worst films behind the left that I've seen for a while. <br /> <br /> To get a good movie, you must have a well-written script. The left fell bad for it. First, it is radically different from the book. Sometimes this is done to put the 400-page novel into a movie for two hours, but in this movie I saw changes that didn't make any sense. <br /> <br /> The second thing is close to zero. When a story is stored in characters (I don't say who), then the book explains that it's a long, soul-seeking process. It's fast and artificial in the film. The book is properly written, where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem realistic, but in movie scenarios they are given consistent quick treatment without anything important. In the second scene, where one character is angry about being left behind (again, I'm not saying who), it seems artificial. <br /> <br /> As a Christian, I understand that I do not want to say that I do not want to like this movie, but I cannot recommend a movie that I thought was terribly done with good conscience. Perhaps it would have been better to make the first book for 2-3 films. In both cases, Christians must realize that this must be taken seriously as a filmmaker, and we must begin to bring the film together. I understand that a lot of work has probably gone to the left, but I see it.
