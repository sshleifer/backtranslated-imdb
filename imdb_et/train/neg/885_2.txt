Anthology is always a risky business and I think this endeavor should be praised. There are many talents here. Lots of talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I couldn't really enjoy this movie based on three issues. <br /> <br /> First, segments vary incredibly in color and tone. And unfortunately, some of them have been in contact. Secondly, many segments are underdeveloped for me. Like the seeds of good stories that never come. I am not talking here about happy endings (or even the end period), but rather they do not even have the basic developments or even the solid settings that draw you. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I didn't know New York and its inhabitants were correctly portrayed. <br /> <br /> What you have missed is grand short films that may be of interest to some, but leave the average viewer dissatisfied.
