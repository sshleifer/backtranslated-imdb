I was so excited and surprised to watch this movie when the first ads appeared in November! It seemed fantastic and songs! I was quite disappointed when I watched it! This is a film that knits 6 pairs together. It is a multi-piece from 12 people! A huge number of stars have worked with this film. I think the director Nikhil Advan hasn't managed the situation well, and he shouldn't have had a lot of people in this movie because it would have made it easier for him. Compared to Nikhil's debut 'Kal Ho Naa Ho', Salaam-e-Ishq remains quite back. I think Nikhi should have a smaller star. I think the best factors in this movie are songs! The songs are great and I think all the songs are fantastic, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy did a great job and has done great jobs over the years. I think the ratings of this movie can rise because of great songs! One thing I was disappointed about was that the director shouldn't have included the nudity made by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar in this film. I found it extremely rude looking at it with my family! While some may consider this nude to be a comedy, it doesn't want to look at parents! I think Salman and Priyanka did the best to do it!
