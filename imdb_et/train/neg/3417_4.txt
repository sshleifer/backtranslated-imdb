Wow, my first film review was so negative that it wasn't included. I'm trying to put it under one tone. Allows to be real !!! Nobody wants to see a Chuck Norris movie where HE is not the main character. At the end, there was a good fight, but the rest of the movie stank. I have to think if the old Chuck just can't hang with the best. Has he slowed so much that he has to show such jealousy and hope that his reputation will carry him through the film? Chuck is a fantastic martial artist and, as we've seen from Walker, Texas Ranger, is a pretty good actor, but the trick is to combine both features in his movies and that's not. Very disappointing for us Norris fans. Chuck, be the main character of your movies because it doesn't work for you ... Gary
