Slow, tedious and one-dimensional film! Good choice with a clever dialogue, a boring story, and Mr Marshal's direction! The usual and predictable story of Asia's most famous prostitution, no heart, no new understanding and no depth. Lead's character looks like its tiny fixed and fake contact lenses. The lexicon used by the geisha sounds forced and a bit too complicated in terms of their limited exposure in educational ways. The story goes on and after hours trying to convince you of this small, boring, lame chested Asian girl is the ultimate Geisha, they actually say in the movie "She is set to become a legend" I say hardy! The film is just boring, it is beautiful to look at, it has very few interesting moments as much as you can go to cigarettes. Basically, if you don't believe the messenger doesn't believe this message and this girl didn't fill the shoe! Borin, boring, leave it!
