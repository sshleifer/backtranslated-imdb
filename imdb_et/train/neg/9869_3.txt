Didn't care about the movie, the book was better. Does anyone know where it was filmed? *** it was my first visit to your site ... I found the answer to my question. so now I see it seeming, but I think I'll give you some comments. and yes, British Columbia is lovely *** Or why did they take it from their coastal area of ​​South Carolina? I just read where I have to write at least ten lines. Here's my second main topic with the film. Kim Bassinger was too coarse and not what I saw in the book. I know the book was a book and a movie; well not so good. I found the character of this book much more empathetic. The book also brought out the rustic, almost primitive images of the monastery. Although the "castle" in the movie was a lot of visually impressive, it distorted the feel and seemed to be in conflict with the characters.
