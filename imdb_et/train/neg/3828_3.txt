By the year 1976, the western western genre was exhausted and its filmmakers knew it clearly. However, instead of looking at the project and saving it, they went on and did it anyway. Obviously they need an interesting yarn to get the audience to watch the movie, they decided to make it as violent as possible and to make it unpleasant. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch, so why not work here? Of course, Wild Bunch had a great script, but The Last Hard Meni script is a normal old-fashioned garbage. <br /> <br /> It's hard to understand what attracted the respective roles of Charlton Heston and James Coburn. Heston plays a retired lawyer who goes after the escaped prison led by a violent permit (Coburn). Hunton's daughter (Barbara Hershey) kidnaps the convicted and sexual degradation. Hunton's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is more personal. <br /> <br /> This is a bloodthirsty movie where every time someone dies, this top detail is displayed. In fact, it is a tremendous disappointment, because tying a star sounds like a mouth-watering prospect. Also, there is no speed or speed in the film. Approaching is an eternity, but when it finally comes, it is under pressure. All in all, this may be Heston's worst film. I am sure this is one of the productions that he adds to his beautiful CV.
