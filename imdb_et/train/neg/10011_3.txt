This film is about a male escort who participates in a murder trial that took place among a powerful male spouse. <br /> <br /> I thought Walker would be exciting and interesting, but I was so wrong. Stimulation is painful and tediously slow, so even after a 40-minute movie, nothing happens. Seriously, the first hour can be condensed for ten minutes. It's so slow. <br /> <br /> The fact that it has no excitement or action is aggravating boredom. It's almost shocking that even argument scenes are so simple and emotional. Perhaps this is due to the rigid upper lip of the higher social class? <br /> <br /> It's sad that "Walker" becomes such a boring mess, despite such severe pain. Blame it at a bad plot and even worse pace.
