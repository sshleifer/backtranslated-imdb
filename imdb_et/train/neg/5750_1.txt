in fact, it was pretty funny ... "God, how the hell this movie got" sort of. if you live in the movies for fun ... what am I ... going and watching it ... but if you really mean "is this a good movie?" eff off. <br /> <br /> This movie was sucked from the very beginning with the worst action I've ever seen in any movie .... usually they get five minutes before you realize that this movie can suck ".. but no, this movie tells edgar allen store ... never tried to explain it to people who haven't remembered the biography of the store ... so I don't know if any of what was said is a fact. <br /> < br /> this film speaks to the writer "ethan store" with his cousin "ann" .... they are both descendants of the edgar shop ... or are they?!? probably people give what their ancestors did. The store is actually ethan "Usher" who should be the descendants of the story "Usher House", which was written by Edgar Allen Store. Anni's brother sometimes shows that trying to rape him ... ann also has one person robbed at one place on the street (seriously, three ... they are just like the ones behind her right) and she doesn't even understand. The characters that are murdered at the end will appear at the end to try to save the day, but they can't. At the end of that shoots ethan as he tries to kill his best friend. Of course, before he puts him down, he must yell forever! this movie should never be seen!
