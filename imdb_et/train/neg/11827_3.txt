I just went back for free screening and I'm very happy that I didn't pay for this very sub-right movie. The theater was full and the crowd was a mixture of children and adults. It seemed like the children who smiled at all the stealth and farts (the good god loved these poor mice!). The film is pretty minor, unintelligent, predictable and mostly tedious. The characters just seem to fill up the empty space, and the relationships between them seemed no charm at all. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie is average and nothing different. They did decent work to mimic the look of Wallace and Gromid clay, but not just that it was a very forgotten picture. <br /> <br /> Although I was really bored in the movie, I started to laugh a few times. This is not an absolute failure, but I certainly wouldn't want to look at it again. If you are a parent with a child (and you don't care about your kids seeing useless cheap jokes), take them to see, but not everyone else should waste their money.
