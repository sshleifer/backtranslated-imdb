In the case of romantic comedies, I often appreciate the quality of the film, based on the end of experience. Unfortunately, on "Wedding Day", I can only evaluate a movie from four of the 10 possible tears. <br /> <br /> My apologies to fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but I didn't see two chemistry between them. The prerequisite for this film is the opposite of "Pretty Woman", where Dermot plays Nick, a high-priced man escorted by Katra's character Kat, to accompany her to England with her sister's wedding. A romantic relationship between a novel and a client is likely to occur. But dialogue seemed forced and artificial. And there were not enough romantic sparks in the relationship between Nick and Kati. <br /> <br /> The supporting role was Amy Adams Kat's sister. When Amy came on the screen, she served as a spark plug and a catalyst for the film's energy. Perhaps, if Amy Adams had been in Kat's role, the film would have been more dynamic. But as it turned out, I was looking for Visine instead of going to Kleenex, trying at least to pretend that this film had a real sensitivity and romance.
