The 40-bit Norma Shearer Monte Carlo's fluttery, girlishy society, caught in this forgotten tiny little one, is caught between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be tempting to blame this film for the failure of a dull, conversational script, or directed by George Cukor, who never seems to be interested in reviving the usual feature of the film. Most of the time, however, it is Shearer's fault, who desperately wanted to continue playing the "young" parts until he escaped. Inadvertently, this "lover of his cardboard" makes a strange memory of aging aging.
