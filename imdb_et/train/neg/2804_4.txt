I'm probably spoiled by seeing the 1973 version for the first time with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack, so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment. I just didn't get anyone between the two main letters. A lot of staring and theatrical acting just doesn't do it for me, and that's what made Timi put Rochester into action. When the casting director actually read the book. Very strange! He's a good actor but Mr. Rochester is definitely not! And Zelah was just, strange, a little bit mixed. Supporting pains were good for this, and for me, Lowood's scenes were the best of adaptation, but generally it didn't hit the magic of the novel. Surely no one would ask to see it as a real adaptation of the novel. Real shoot!
