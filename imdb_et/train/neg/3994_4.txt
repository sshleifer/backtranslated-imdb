I'm big, big John Cusacki, Samuel L. Jackson and Tony Shalhoub fan. I'm a little less loved by Stephen King, but I like some of his work. <br /> <br /> That said I should have loved 1408. <br /> <br /> *** POSSIBLE SPOILERS POINT **** <br /> <br /> I was eagerly walking. I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> This is not the fault of the participants. Shalhoub and Jackson have very small roles, because the premise of the film puts Cusack in a "locked room" scenario. <br /> <br /> It wasn't a BAD movie, but I can't call it good. It was a confusing confusion with moments of "ouch, it's just lost", combined with "ouchi, it's just painful" moments and "oh, now that just unfortunate" moments, there is very little consistency between them. Eisin's father appears once and does not seem to have any connection with the rest of Mike's personal life we ​​see when he tries to survive. <br /> <br /> The previous commentator described Olin / Enslin's argument, which is worth looking at, and I agree very much. But besides some clever musical clues (a little bit of a room playing Enslin and giving him the chance to get before the ante exit ...), it gives him one hour back and "The Woodworkers Line" "We've just started.") it's mostly "stuff jumps to you when you least expect it!" write a horror that was fun when I was fourteen, and surrounded by friends of my age, linking each other in the summer, while Jason walked to Camp Crystal Lake. his most painful experience "mindgaming," animate the paintings in a horrible way "cliché cheesiness. <br /> <br /> ****** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> I was waiting for this movie better Stephen King's name, as well as the aforementioned actors. <br /> <br /> We will never find any evil origin. We will never see evil being defeated, although we can assume that it was defeated. > <br /> And the end ended with just "What?" Wait until it goes on the cable. I shouldn't pay for it as a matinée, but I feel a little short of a change to charge for it.
