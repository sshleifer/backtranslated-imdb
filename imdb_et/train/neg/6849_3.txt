This quasi J horror movie followed a young woman when she returned to her childhood village on Shikoku Island to sell her family house and meet old friends. He finds that one of the daughters of the village priest drowned several years earlier. He and Fumiko (another childhood friend) then learn that Sayor's mother is trying to bring her back with black magic. The connections between the dead and the living are becoming weak and friends and villagers see ghosts. Nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie. Unlike the star J-horror film, the intercourse is not really structured, the result does not seem too threatening and ends with absurdity. <br /> <br /> This film is like a normal white rice that has been cooked too little for a long time, so it borders on saliva. Sometimes you can get it in poor Asian restaurants or prepare your white rice for a little too long. You can eat, because you need it with food, because what is Chinese or Japanese food without rice, but it destroys almost all the food, because it is gluey and delicious. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
