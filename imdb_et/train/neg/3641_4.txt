Recall: According to the legend, Valkyrie Brunhilda had attacked a stone surrounded by Odin and chained with eternal fire. Only a warrior in the heart can pass through the flames, release Brunhilda and release him from Odin's power and get him for himself. Now, the war is brewed in Norwegian countries, and the king needs a union with the Berserkers. Berserkers are warriors claimed by Odin Valkyries who love war, blood and meat and are therefore abandoned but better in battle. The leader of Berserker is the king's frightened son, the boar, and his price as an ally is his brother, future King Barek. But when the king wins in battle, he refuses to give up his only son, breaking his oath to Boar and betray him and kill him. The wild is only rescued by Barek's appeal to Odin. But this is just the beginning of the battle between the brothers and their last battle begins now, millennia later ... <br /> <br /> Comments: I was hoping it would be a movie based on some Viking land, too little quality film Viking has been done. It also started very well, with detailed long ships and armors, a nice and suitable landscape and OK battle. <br /> <br /> The foundation of Aesir's myths is thin and seems very corrupted to me. Odin is a lot of unspeakable, embarrassing and absent when I remind him of school and valkyries have become a vampire demon. I'm not an expert, but it seems totally wrong. <br /> <br /> But the deadly mistake made by this movie is time-setting from the original time period to the present. If two brothers had fought in time, with some good battles, the film would have been much better. Now this device has suddenly changed to today's Stockholm. However, Odin is there and sends herd and her berserkers to Brunhilda and Barek, who give the scenes of stupid and painted berserkers to Barek's industries. Beautiful mountains and forests are exchanged for cement. And when I was allowed to focus on a single struggle, I saw quickly instead of massive battles that actors' struggles and skills were slow and cumbersome. <br /> <br /> The end result is a thin story, sometimes tricky to follow, and otherwise just silly, and the only thing that saved it is an action drawn from slow, boring and clumsy sword fighting. It is very limited to the Aesir myth or the tradition of the Vikings. Both the story and the action fail, and the film is just bad. <br /> <br /> Finally, as a Swede, this movie is a little confusing. Supposedly, it was filmed entirely in South Africa, but still contains some familiar Swedish signs, discs and what seems to be an authentic police car. However, the efforts are poor and only so far as to actually place them in Sweden. No names are Swedes (maybe Anya as an exception), not familiar with the landscapes of Swedes, they speak little (old?) In Norwegian, not Swedish. And the uniforms, both police and medical, are obviously not Swedish. If they're not even going to do it right - and really give the illusion that it's set in Sweden, why not bother at all? <br /> <br /> 4/10
