As a writer, I find that films that make it bad are production that is a complete face. Talk about insult. I wrote better stories than in the 8th grade. Bad action, poor writing, bad leadership and all the result of adding together is a complete and complete failure. The only thing this film can achieve is beating unsuspecting consumers in a waste of time. Who would have written something so bad with green light? It is not artistic, smart, intelligent, steep, mysterious, scary, dramatic, nothing. <br /> <br /> Characters are flat and boring without development. The plot is remanufactured as an aluminum can. They succeeded in having some very familiar actors who must be rather desperate or hoping that one of these low budget independent films is "Pulp Fiction". This script should have been used to draw a bird cage instead of a movie. Oh, and last but not least, the 5'2 105 lb woman, of course, has the power to kill men and women twice without fighting and one shot. <br /> <br /> Avoid this bomb as it infects you with STD.
