The plot of this film has one important point: that this murderer was also a responsible, loving and caring father. Not that father and murderer are impossible. But this man has shown the murder of teenage girls without provocation or reason and without emotion. This girl was a daughter. I do not believe that a father who cared so much for his daughter could have been so cold blooded to someone else's daughter. Or alternatively it could have been so cold bloody and worrying and caring for your daughter. And the idea that a convicted murderer would actually ask the parents of his victim to take care of their daughter and take care of it is incredible. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the actors acted with conviction. I thought that changing the color of Scott Bakula's eye made him feel colder and more threatening than usual. You didn't see your eyes at all.
