It would have been an interesting movie for all accounts. I thought the competition for Alex Chandon's gore festival was a leap. <br /> <br /> False. <br /> <br /> All this movie is either a cliché or an incorrect one. The story of the story of anthology setup was made to death (and much better) in the seventies and eighties. Indeed, the idea of ​​"sick space" sent my backbone down, but as with most movies, bad script writing and action was left behind. Chandon can't write a dialog. Every punishment with the main police investigator is passionate and desolate (a typical "policeman on the edge" formula. Funny, I'm sure I've seen it somewhere else before ...) Not Chandon, you're not Tarantino. Or Scorsese. It sounds like a BAD. Add ridiculously to OTT, who works with a very merciless casting (don't get me wrong, Dani Filth is a great singer and musician, but an actor he's not) and the performances are ridiculous. Give me Bruce Campbell every day. <br /> <br /> Visual effects are all poor, some bad CGIs, terrible gore defects (for goodness, Peter Jackson did better and it was less than a decade ago with less budget) and filters that violate USE! Often in the darkness of the Cradle Of Filth ... man, they should bring an action. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the fear of Cradle Of Fear is that he takes himself seriously, trying to create an atmosphere and inspire fear and repel the public. too many good horror films made in the 1970s and eighties make it so much better than there are much better gore effects (such as maniac, zombie carnivores, farther, stop, etc.), which makes my fear fear, in my opinion, secondary and hopeless. <br /> <br /> I hope Chandon can learn from this cinematography and continue with some quality horror that really scares me. <br /> <br /> Better luck next time.
