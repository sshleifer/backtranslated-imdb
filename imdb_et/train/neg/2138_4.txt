War, Inc. - Corporations are going to take over the war in the future and use alone the assassin of Brand Hauser (John Cusack) to do their wet work against the rival directors. Dark comedy that sat in the army and businesses. It was often difficult to understand exactly what was going on. I was expecting things to be reasonable. There is no reason for madness. <br /> <br /> Cusack regards it as "spiritual successor" for Grosse Point Blank. This means that the war is more or less confusing. We see Cusack again as a salary wizard who protects the * spoiler * the person he should adhere to with his conscience. To be fair, John Cusack looks incredibly lightly with one and a half invitations. Short struggles look good. The rest of the movie is not. All of this is peculiar, often bordered by strange. War Inc. is not funny enough to be a parody, and too fast that anyone would even think about what the message of the film might be, which I think they can be heartless ways that companies like war groups, compete and schemes without should fall. how they affect average citizens. Interestingly, satire just doesn't work because it's not funny and has no heart at heart. We should give a damn about how war affects Cusack's character rather than millions of lives destroyed by war. <br /> <br /> John Cusack gives a decent result. His character captures the hot sauce and controls the smallest private vehicle, but is designed to replace character traits. Marisa Tomei is a romantic sidekick journalist. There are not really many chemistry between them. Hilary Duff tries a Russian accent and doesn't make himself stupid. Joan Cusack just screams and whips out and wigs out. Blech. Ben Kingsley could bring back the Oscar if he wasn't going to perform right now. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> It's not a terrible movie, but finally you have to ask "War, what's that good?" Absolutely nothing. C-
