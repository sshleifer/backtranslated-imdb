This God-abandoned film is about three foolish millionaires who collect a lot of people to play a deadly game and win a million dollars. First, it is terrible and the film doesn't make any sense at all. It's not the least scary, it's so stupid that it made me laugh, so she earned it with 1 star. The film is not at all violent, but it is rather weak and mostly focuses on the breasts of women all the time and some characters are very annoying and brilliant. In addition, the monsters in this movie are so funny and fake, not scary that it just makes you throw something off the screen. Last but not least, the end has ended terrible. I don't want to give it away if you are really strange to see that junk. OFF ALL COSTS !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not rated (but should be R) for Nudity, Profanity and Mild Gore.
