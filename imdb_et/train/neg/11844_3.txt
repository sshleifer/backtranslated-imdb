Anyone who is a 1920s jazz infant, a 1920s dress, Charleston and ultra-swanky yachts (like me, everyone reads) want to like this movie. But the sad fact is that everything is there. The plot is banal and obvious, mostly acting horribly or playing on the far side of the competition, and when the whole thing is there, it's not much left, but an impression of mirrors and smoke. This is a beautifully made bad film.
