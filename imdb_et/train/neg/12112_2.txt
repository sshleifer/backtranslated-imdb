I can't believe I wasted my time with this movie. I couldn't even name that movie. It was so bad to suggest anything. <br /> <br /> I like low budget movies and strange cocks, but it was boring for me. Poorly done and bad behavior destroyed it as curious. You have to think about what these people thought when they spent the money on producing this movie. I don't know what I was thinking to look at it to the end. I recommend this movie to no one. How did they release it? Was there an audience that likes this movie? Must be because you find it in almost every video store. But why? <br /> <br /> It is worth forgetting. <br /> <br /> If you like bad movies, that's for you.
