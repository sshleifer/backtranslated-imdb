(r # 97) <br /> <br /> This poor man's Pokemon (from what you want) has one good thing: the topic of opening. It must be the coolest dubbed music of the Japanese-opera-o-mean-the-young-fans anime TV show. Unfortunately, after opening, there was an example to add. And they just couldn't point out anything more interesting than people who speak louder, whose cards are better than the cards of others. Freud would have a field day, unfortunately I cannot imagine why every child would like to sit through an exhibition where the dialogue written by a thousand monkeys in five minutes takes 98%. <br /> <br /> "My Uber-Fantastic Doomsday Creature of Ultimate Doom will take your foolish Pyramid Diamond Animal in one blow! Don't you see that you have no chance of winning this battle, are you fools?! HAHAHAHHAHHAHA!" <br /> <br /> "Oh yes? Well, look at this! I use my Delta Times Pie Card, which destroys all your Power Munchers and makes your Uber-Fantastic Doomsday Create the Ultimate Doom's Destroy Beyond the Significance Attack! "You don't see it!" Seriously, that's all they ever show. While in some other dirty children's exhibition I was looking at the commercial phenomenon Pokémon (peeling the pets of each football mother), at least the monsters were politely summoned every time, "Yu-Gi-Oh" is just, in the silence of Roger Ebert's "Clockwork Orange" review in words, "normal talking and boring". Not to mention the long-standing (I understand that I am hypocritical here, just taking into account the record I wrote). <br /> <br /> This exhibition will last forever. I don't know if there is any plot there, and static monsters don't have the character of Pokémon. Even if it's not compared to my fave comic as a child, this show sucks. It's inadvertently funny, but not funny enough to see. Woe, sleep dense, dream of wet dreams.
