Does anything in this movie happen that is not predictable? I don't think so. Basically, the film is a cliché after the cliché and really nothing surprising. This makes the film extremely predictable and the film has a serious tension. So the thriller is not tense and unpredictable, but also drama, it's a failure. This is because the story of the film is very unlikely. I mean, it may never happen in real life, just as it does in the movie. So the film has a real temporary and reliability issue. <br /> <br /> It's clichés that killed the movie. It was sometimes stuffing. Everything is so complicated in this movie. The predator is depicted as a cool heartless, almost psychopath like a sexual frustrated boy and a victim as a naïve young woman who acts like he did not see any such outcome. Everything that happened in the film was so obvious and all seemed to be a reason. Like the sequence in which the "predator" affirms the "car" of the broken car. It must be one of the oldest clichés in the book. I knew what the film was trying to achieve after that point. I tried to look as if the teacher and the pupil really grew up in the eyes of other people. It was so incredibly obvious and cheap that I almost wanted to stop watching the movie. The film is full of moments like. <br /> <br /> The title may indicate that it is a cheap porn movie, but it is actually blessed for a TV movie. This means that everything is going slow and the film spends half of its time on character and unnecessary sub-pieces to make the film even more dramatic. <br /> <br /> I admit that Elizabeth Berkley is a pretty good actor in this movie. He makes some clichés and events sometimes even realistic. His Hollywood career, after Paul Verhoeven's "Showgirls" has appeared, is so good, so unfortunately he only appears in films and TV shows like this. It is a waste of his talent and he certainly deserves better. All other characters are disappointing. Corey Sevier plays a cliché with a real "untouchable" rich boy and the way the head of the spouse is portrayed is even worse. She looks more like a sexual frustrated predator than a movie's real predator. She is basically trying to have sex with her husband in every order. She wakes up, she wants sex. Before she sleeps, she wants sex. She gets home, she wants sex. It may be a realistic thing, but I don't know, it didn't really know that kind of film and general story. </p> <p> </p> For some reason, why should anyone ever watch this movie. This is predictable and consequently there is no relationship and credibility. Not a "terrible" movie, and it is definitely traceable one by one, but all the weak and cliché elements in the film do away with it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
