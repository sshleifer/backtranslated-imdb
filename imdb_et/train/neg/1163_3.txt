A moderately fragmented but terribly half-realized character study, exploring the different personalities of two college roommates: a talented but unqualified star in a basketball player and pot-smoking, female educator. We will never know why these young men are friends. They can share the confusion about the world and its place, but they don't seem to have anything in common. Jack Nicholson, who also wrote Jeremy Larner's manuscript along with Larner's book, does not introduce us to characters without clarity or to design scenes to help us identify anyone on the screen. Here are some very decent performances (especially in the central role of the newcomer William Tepper), but most of the picture is unformed (perhaps intentionally), sketchy or insecure. Bruce Dern plays a hard-racing basketball coach, Karen Black is an older, married woman, Tepper has a thing, and Michael Margotta is Tepper's troublesome friend (off-the-top performance). Nicholson cannot set sequences with any particular taste, preferring (assume) to let characters interact to dominate the film tone; also his script is not helpful and as a result it is unclear to whom we should express our compassion. Small, casual moments are working (supermarket fights between Tepper and Black, Dern visits Tepper in his dormitory, all court-imposed scenes), but the whole third picture is a scary mess. Hopefully, Nicholson equates all important b-ball games with a sexual assault, but he doesn't see the style in his craft (nor does he earn points for chutzpah because these events are dirty and ugly). If the director goes down the road, his motives must be questioned. Perhaps, when "Drive, He Said" ultimately made some powerful statement in the deal, the viewers could forgive the filmmaker for losing their decisions and taste. Unfortunately, being as close to being as enchanting as the rest of the movie is. * 1/2 from ****
