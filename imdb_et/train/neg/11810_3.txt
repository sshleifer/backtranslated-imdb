I noticed with some amusement that the final credit is thanked by Detroit PD for their participation. The police chief even has one line who plays himself (and boy, can you say he can't act). The reason for this is that the police first shoot this movie and ask questions later. I don't think PR would be a police force. In addition, it is your ordinary policeman and robber film dressed in a 70's racial angle. Alex Rocco is given a gratifying role to the policeman who cannot go ahead and is against a woman with mental illness. He will make up for it with the local whore. Hari Rhodes is his glowing partner who has a groovy wardrobe and wants to track down suspected trenchcoat wear. The film moves along the penultimate shootout, which makes no sense (why do people who are only abducting the whole police?). We see not only one shootout, but because we have four bad guys, we see four. Then there is the end of the turn, which should leave one guess what would actually have happened, but only left me thinking how stupid it was. Seeing that Arthur Marks was also behind Braindead "Friday Foster" and "Bucktown", I shouldn't have wondered.
