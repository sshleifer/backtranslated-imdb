After finishing the book the same day, I watched the movie, I knew what should happen. I had great expectations because of the movie's rating. The only reason I give this movie is 10 out of 10 stars that he was trying to be a movie. I have a few basic points about the appeal of this movie. <br /> <br /> ********** SPOILERS ********** <br /> <br /> 1. Casting. Jack Nicholson hardly fits Jack Torrence's character. I would never have chosen Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I imagined Wendy a lot differently. I see why they chose Jack Nicholson, smile, sharp eyebrows, but he shouldn't really look bad. He should look normal and he will become evil. They also make one of the worst film pairs. Danny was fine, but he needed more life. He acted as a droney. <br /> <br /> 2. Scenario. They cut out so many things that were in the book and added things. Some of the things that were in the book I was expecting in the movie were either erased, modified, or dealt with incorrectly. Some of the things that were in the book I was expecting (hedgehog, rust, elevator) were not in the movie and it was 2 and a half hours! I was very upset. <br /> <br /> 3. End. The end changed completely, Halorann died, Jack froze to death, Wendy could never hurt ... Overlook didn't breathe. The end of the book was so cool and the film was so terrible that I was apologized. Hallorann should never die, but Jack killed his ax. If they wanted to kill him, at least Jack should use a roque mallet. You've never seen an elbow during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> There are other things I didn't like about the movie, but there are things that were fine. The angels of the camera were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator (not happened in the book) was cool, but maybe I was too upset that the film didn't go to the book to be afraid. I recommend reading the book before seeing this movie. I thank Stephen King for actually agreeing to sign the contract so that Stanley Kubrik is no longer banned. I would never have done it, I would have taken all the rights that I could yell at him all day. I can't wait to see a 6-hour version, at least it has hedgehogs. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2/10
