That's what I found myself saying from time to time with this regrettable pretext for the film. First of all, the effects of your computer are absolutely delightful! These computer wizards really deserve to be behind. The rest of the movie, though ... <br /> <br /> No character is acting realistically, especially in the above-mentioned, third-decent work (I promise I won't give it away, but trust me, it's not worth the secret!). Lots of laughs in the film inadvertently, as when trying to explain that the invisible person's eyelids do not work. Please give viewers more credits than this !!! <br /> <br /> Some of the sexual aspects of the movie were interesting. What would you do if you were invisible? No one could catch you! These questions were dealt with in a more intelligent way in the classic The Invisible Man in 1933. Particularly, there is one scene of violence that is so incredibly unclear and not mentioned later. If more attention had been paid to it, Kevin's bacon scientist might have been a little more meaningful. <br /> <br /> Film would actually be much more successful than porn, because the assumption could actually be unique and interesting. But this work ... go for something else. Or don't live with the consequences! <br /> <br /> 3/10
