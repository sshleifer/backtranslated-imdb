I've heard this movie for years and finally got the chance to see it. The massive murder of cheerleaders in 1963 and 1969 eventually led to the closure of the camp. Until 1982, Bambi, a former student, opens it up for new recruiters, including Candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (judge Reinhold) and Sandy (Debralee Scott). One by one is killed by the killer until only one remains. This is when we find out who did it and why. <br /> <br /> Also in the movie, Tom Smothers has made a terrible accent as the Canadian Mountie, and Paul Reubens makes his Pee-Wee Herman schtick. The overall number of the plot is not very well developed and quite flat, but some funny scenes occur, namely the bad pie house and the strip poker scene. At the end of the day, it seems to have been shattered, which is a disgrace. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, it is good for about ten or fifteen minutes, the rest you can just move on. Maybe I'll get it on TV, but it's not worth buying.
