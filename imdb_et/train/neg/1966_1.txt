I was duped to see this movie after reading a positive review on another website and the guy was ma p.o'd !!! it took me at least 15 minutes to pull it out of the shelf. I didn't want anyone to see me. then another 10 minutes to build the courage to bring it to the counter and really use the money to rent it. I thought all my stress would cost myself until I got home and watching the movie b / c, I looked at the film as a pleasant surprise; what a joke! If you can make this movie in the first hour, your luck! b / c is not a movie until the horror. don't worry about this people, your better looking "dankness falls"
