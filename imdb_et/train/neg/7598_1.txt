Participating in diaries had to be embarrassing as filming continues as the film fails. Probably Cruise, Exec. Prod., I saw what happened and was much, much more in the last paragraph of the nude footage when Towne wanted to make up for the catastrophe he saw. (Maybe Cruise even thought of Titanic.) A few things: Colin Farrell can't get out of a paper bag. However, he is one decade of taste, a producer expensive and forced to avoid his embarrassment that he is not in his films. He has so many moments that he does not believe what he is doing, and you see it in his eyes. I think he would have been the best film actor, though not as rich or famous as he is now playing another banana for dynamic leaders who can act. A lot of money is being spent on period sets, costumes, cars, etc. and taking them as they came from a dry cleaner or car wash / wax. No one wants to see anything, it's worn out. Or dirty. Is it because the line manufacturer said the manufacturing designer is convinced that they didn't destroy things because then the company should pay for the destroyed items? <br /> <br /> It was a story of depression in the thirties, not in the era of musical Disney Broadway. How would it be black or right if Caleb Deschanel is your D.P. After all, it would have been a bit depressing to live as desperately as those people did in depression. More about Farrell. Did anyone for a moment believe that this man was a writer? H. L. Mencken on the wall; did I see one point in his eyes? Hayek and Farrell as a sexually dynamic duo? Sending a boy to work for a man? Maybe in a book I haven't read, there was a story about a older woman and young people. I can't get into the last parts of the movie too deep because I released it early. But the memory of the scenes I saw made me think someone was making a noir movie not too amusing. That's what Saturday Night Live has been like in the last ten years: not funny. (I thought I was thinking of Guy Noir's sketch, music and everyone.)
