Isn't it fun if the average scoos, who lead a miserable life, suddenly have some terrible magic with him, turning his life upside down and giving him some valuable lessons? This formula will never get old, right? This is such a sure fire classic movie! Just look at the big hits like Liar Liar and Big! ... It must be Rob Schneider's way of doing half-successful Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and following it with the animal. Since I've been following the plot through sarcasm, let me paint it more: Schneider plays a loser policeman who has suddenly been involved in a tragic accident, but has been rescued by an operation ... from an eye-catching veterinarian who loads him with animal parts causing him a horse as inappropriate time , run like cheetah, etc. This movie is somewhat more pleasant than other Schneider headlines (such as the second flat on the same plot of The Hot Chick), but it almost feels like they want the audience to hate it by choosing a reality TV star for a romantic stove (Colleen Haskell from "Survivor") and adding Norm MacDonald firewall. My favorite scene ... just doesn't exist. Unfortunately, nothing is memorable except the value of production. I want to finish this review by saying that small references to other movies in the movie may be okay, but when it comes to exactly the same lines ("You Can Do It!"), Then there is the word "milking". In fact, here is another word - "cheap".
