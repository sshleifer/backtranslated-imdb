Now, look, I'm not lying to you, but I got this movie for just $ 3.99 for a friend because he had Danni Filth, the singer of the increasingly popular "Cradle Of Filth" metal band. Of course, I was expecting violence and gore from my best, because that is what Filthi can imagine as a plot line. <br /> <br /> But dear god, I was so wrong. This movie bites, great time. Because it is a low budget film (haha, wait, do this zero plan), obviously there is no beautiful musical scores of the Howard Sterni orchestra and the special effects of Spielberg. No, it's all one camera, bad angles and bad blood scenes. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, if our star and violent whore, Mr Filth, kills violently. Grab the throat and spit out the blood, but oh my, it looks like a men's shirt is a pack of juice filled with fake blood. <br /> <br /> Cradle Of Filth Fans: You will hear two songs throughout the movie, but with camera corners and poor filming, they drag the overall enjoyment of the song DOWN. <br /> <br /> My last comment: Take it far. It's blood, gore, breasts and hey, even a dirty story to go with it. So if you like terrible violence, not near the votes (yes, then there is almost no word in this movie) then buy it anyway. But if dirty movies aren't your thing, beware of that. Don't waste your money.
