First of all, I have no idea how this movie came to the big screen. It's not even a low-budget SCI-Fi channel, it's just terrible. I and my friend, who love action films, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc, went to watch this movie to wait for this movie Transformers with dragons, frantic entertainment. Everything we had was useless and one and a half hours. CG wasn't as bad as I expected, but the plot with the actor is so frightening that it has been done. Basically, every 500 years, Chinese football comes from ridiculous giants. No, the plot is trying to be deeper than just leaving the holes in the plot, but with magic, and a very small actual war between dragons (rather big snakes), which is just ridiculous. The director tried to add a film that failed, a little humor. I and my friend laughed at the whole thing (with all five audiences) and we believed that we spent money on it. The TV's short trailer accounts for most of the activity, while the crap makes the rest. I've seen many B-movies like Reptilian, Cave, Spider and others, but I have to say if you want to laugh for an hour, look at it. <br /> <br /> Story: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I'm not drinking ... but it would have helped before watching the movie
