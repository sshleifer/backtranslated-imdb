I really don't understand how anyone could give this nasty movie more than 1 star ... How do you like a slow motion movie where all the animal abuse scenes are real? I don't even want to imagine the innocent and unprotected living beings they felt in awful moments ... Jesus ... What kind of "human" tortures them like that for no reason or just for money? ? I'm telling you that the director is either mentally slowed down or he's just a stone's "heart" monster. Or both. He really deserves to be cut off and live burning. and thrown back into the water, beaten the dog, the birds are thrown into the water ... <br /> <br /> This movie is more than terrible; it must be the worst and slowest film ever made, known as "Cannibal Holocaust" or something like that. I never look or buy this heartless monster. No one should watch their time, especially if there are many really great movies where all the scenes of animal abuse are staged. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, only a few people loved it. It is natural because it is the worst film so it was not successful. I hope it will slow down the director's realization that unjustified barbaric acts that are extremely cruel and violent for the REAL animals will never be praised and that he will staged all animal abuse scenes in the following films. I really believe that everyone can, but what they give! There will be a day when all the slow and cruel "people" will feel the same pain they ever caused to others. <br /> <br /> This is probably my only "negative" review. I don't usually comment on a movie if I don't like it, but this time I just couldn't stick. I had to tell the truth, because animal abuse must end!
