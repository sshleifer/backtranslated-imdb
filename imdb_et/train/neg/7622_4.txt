It can only be assumed that Robert Osborne is contractually obliged to express even the least attractive films in the TCM library, as it would explain to him during the resurrection of the "virtues" of this "charming" movie when I saw it on cable television. Seeing that any old film from IMDb becomes a "classic" status from a number of American amateur reviewers, I thought this film needed a fairer view. <br /> <br /> It's not your father. Buy around the corner. For all my accusations, "You have received an e-mail", it is still in the case of almost any perception of its relocation. For those who have seen the original, the errors are only more obvious. <br /> <br /> One of the flats Meet Cute sequences that I remember (sad hit with "humor"), this movie goes on the wrong foot and it never goes back. This "musical" qualifies as only one in the terminal sense. There's an instant blowing up of forgotten musical numbers, and then Judy's "I don't care", while her hands strike like a cramp. The Christmas song he sings in the store is probably one of his best numbers. Miss Garland was great in several music films, but here she seems terribly unsuccessful. Allyson and Judy could certainly not fill Margaret Sullavan's old part of the shoes. Van Johnson will also be lucky enough to be the second speed for Jimmy Stewart. Wires never reach Stewart / Sullavan or even Hanks / Ryan chemistry. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that knows (some) notes, but not music. It does not seem to understand why the original worked and even feels the need to add a possible love interest to Van Johnson's character to make things unnecessarily difficult. Replacing the original infidelity sub-block is a hackneyed chart containing an invaluable violin. It is almost embarrassing to look and feel like someone who has a DeLorean and flux capacitor pulled out of the third company episode. It's really just an excuse for Keaton's training. Even the scenes of great resolutions between romantic leaders have been wrongly processed. After seeing both movies, you understand why they called it "Lubitsch Touch" and not "Robert Z. Leonard Touch". <br /> <br /> Avoid this and knit original text or previous films by Judy Garland if you are not an iconic reader who enjoys it once you see a big star falling on the ground.
