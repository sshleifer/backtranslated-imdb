I really can't believe that this film is not the worst 250 in IMDB, it's totally terrible. When I first saw it, I remember talking to the college class and two more people saw it. We all said that the other class members didn't see it because it was so terrible. By the time we were done, some others wanted to see it just because they couldn't believe something was as bad as we said. Don't be like these, just go through it. I'm sure everyone in this movie would also like you not to see them in this movie.
