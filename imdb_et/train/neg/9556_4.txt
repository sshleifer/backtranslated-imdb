This movie is mostly chase and special effects. It is very weak on the plot. Most computer calls were just mumbo-jumbo. I watched it because I was a big fan of the original warfare movie, based mainly on computer facts and real computer terminology. This movie didn't have it. Most computer scenes were not only impossible and unrealistic for real computers and networks, but just flat. It's like it's written by someone with no understanding of real computers. <br /> <br /> The Ripli game was flat and was essentially just an arcade game. There is no real hacking, so what was it? The film was boring. Flat sequence.
