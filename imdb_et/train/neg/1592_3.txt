To enhance the drama of this delicate pregnancy and maternity department story, it has been created for a special "heavy case" church. The main story is Loretta Young; he is on a long prison vacation, ranging from murder. Do doctors save their child for their life or follow his wife on the contrary? Melodrama and feelings are dominant and they are not honest varieties. For example, in order to get things moving, this hospital has a psychological congregation next to the ward of maternity, which allows a woman with a hysterical pregnancy to steal children. <br /> <br /> Just enough laughs and sarcasm to be recognizable as Warner's movie, mostly from Glenda Farrell, who wipes gin into his hot water bottle when he expects them to have twins, his fears that he is now there law against sales. An example of his repartee: "Be careful." Farrell: "It's too late to be careful." Aline MacMahon is, of course, extremely authoritative as a head nurse, but don't expect her to be given a dramatic moment. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the movie is that seeing a child changes someone's food. Even because of obvious limitations, this film would have been better than it was.
