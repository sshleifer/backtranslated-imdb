I admit that I've seen Jerry Springer for five minutes. I don't consider myself a snob, but I really think I'm up to see what's in her show. You should try to raise yourself. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie as part of the social science event I was leading. I was told that this film didn't really have anything to do with Springer, but focused on the lives of those who appeared to Springer. Better, this film may have been a fascinating look at how the lives of these people are really pathetic. I testify that I knew the connotation of Connie (Molly Hagani). That's all he has in life. It is sad that he feels he has to go to Jerry to solve it. <br /> <br /> I really feel Molly Hagan appearing in it. Have you noticed that after this movie he is mostly in the role of "B" on television? I say this about Hagan. She is a very beautiful and intelligent woman. I have no doubt that he is very serious about his actions and is trying to play his roles with much empathy. The problem is that Hagan can't carry his own scene. He just does not do what he takes to play a leading role. His best work is always Angel "Herman Head" (an exhibition that was not great, but his heart was in the right place) and when he visited "Seinfeld" sister Roberta.
