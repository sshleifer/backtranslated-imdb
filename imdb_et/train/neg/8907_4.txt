I rented it on a DVD yesterday and didn't know it was a "character training" movie so I bothered to watch about an hour before it hit the Stop button. <br /> <br /> Even as a character research topic, I just couldn't get into this movie at all. Maybe it was my mood when I wanted to see something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but I was trying to get along, I tried my best to look further, but I gave up. The participants played their role well, but the global combination did not stay together to retain my interest. The only interesting thing was when the sergeant was stolen and he rushed to buy another one and painted it black to make it a police problem. I think this movie should have been titled "Who stole the Sergeant's weapon?" The scenes were well done, but put together, I felt robbed again to keep me steady to keep me looking. <br /> <br /> As I didn't finish it, I would say that renting this movie is useful. .. can be. For me, it was a pain and a waste of time to watch. I'll leave it to you to try, but that's not one I would highly recommend.
