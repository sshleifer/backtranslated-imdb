There is nothing new here. All the usual romantic-comedy scenes, even up to the airport taxi sprint to stop the woman flying. The only thing that saves it is showing Alison Eastwood and some of the smaller characters (blinking and losing Gabrielle Anwari) who are obviously fun. <br /> <br /> Turn it off when the couple is in bliss and you don't have to go through the inevitable plot pain.
