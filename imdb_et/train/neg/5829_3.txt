I watched this movie as previews of Matthew Barney's art exhibition. It definitely prepared me. The exhibition was almost skipped and again, probably it should be. <br /> <br /> Apart from the great result (Bjork) and photography, rich and colorful, content was mostly tedious and predictable. Gee, I really needed someone to wear pearls to find out what pearl divers were. The film was mostly a foolish mixture of Japanese cultural sciences and modern whaling technology, which was used for mowing / harvesting. The "peaks" of the movie with enough free shock to change your belly. <br /> <br /> What was the idea of ​​the movie? While others may argue that it is an anti-whaling work, it can equally be said to justify whaling. Personally, I think it was "flashing" by the audience of Barney's test with his anal, fecal, self-injury and cannibalistic fetish. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: If you really can't get to Barney's artistic feeling, don't bother to see this movie. The message is unclear, tempo slow and cultural references are embarrassing. If you are after a shock attack, you can better cope with many "Undead" movies or hunt for Hustler's old copy and take out a fecal-cartoon.
