I came to NEW PORT SOUTH, waiting for a replacement film about the Columbus School Massacre, similar to Gus Van Sant's ELEPHANT, and certainly a summary of the TV Guide, which says that student sociopath rebels against the system gave me that impression, but it's very boring film a little happens, consider yourself a warning <br /> <br /> The story tells Maddox, a high school student in Chicago, who decides to kick back what he considers to be an authoritarian regime. The main problem is that the character is written and his actor Blake Shields is unable to decorate the script. You have the feeling that Maddox should have the evil charisma of Hitler, Saddam, or Bin Laden, but he will never come over anything but a deceptive teenage teenager and it is impossible to believe he could rally the disciples. Your subtitle drops one manipulative authoritarian mode only to replace it with another manipulative mode is too obvious, which means that NEW PORT SOUTH is a completely convincing drama that is not worth seeing.
