I'm in for bad movies, but it doesn't go to NO. Despite what the Morons have said, it is not funny. I know comedy and underground movies, but it's so boring that the director / writer should forbid anything but the local cable connection EVER forever! To love the movie and comedy, it's a movie to despise. I may never get over when this job was boring and boring. If you like this movie, you are BIRTH as sober because there is nothing here. NULL! If you need to compare underground movies, check out "Kentucky Fried Movie" or John Waters. The film starts with defining the satire and I can't show anyone satire. The comedy rule is ... If it's FUNNY, you can say or do something, but if it's not funny, then you're not satirical, you're not nervous, you're just pathetic, and this movie isn't just funny. NULL!
