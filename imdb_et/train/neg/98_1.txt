I got this movie as a gift, I knew from the cover of the DVD, this movie will be bad. After watching it for more than a year, I finally looked at it. which pathetic movie ??. <br /> <br /> I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie, but for me it is unfair to write a review without watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Trust me when I say "this movie sucks" I'm really shocked that a bad filmmaker reduces bee funding to make this pesky movie. All you need is a cheap camcorder or a mobile phone camera. Of the 15 people who do not have the skills, a script written by a few drunk people. <br /> <br /> The reporter (Tara Woodley) in the fist of this ultra bad movement is supposed to be a drunken man reporting on the hunting city. He's completely harmless. They went to leave the abandoned house, but fortunately it is almost fully equipped and there is a bottle of liquid on the door. but should be a drunk man, but not all that seems. <br /> <br /> Then the alleged drunk man started talking about Tara's ghost / zombies. <br /> <br /> His stupid fists of flat stories must be the worst in history. <br /> <br /> His story <br /> <br /> Sgt. Ben Draper let one of his soldiers die because of total exhaustion (I think it will happen) after the poor soldier Wilson is allowed to sit. > buries him in a low tomb. <br /> <br /> But Sgt. Ben Draper is a big surprise. his wife / girl knows this and he and his lover kills Sgt. Ben Draper Revenge Private Wilson (next to the tomb soldier he sorted) The soldier wakes up his grave in the form of a zombie and kill them to take revenge on his behalf. /> The end of the twisting was so flat. <br /> <br /> Even if you like B HORROR movies, don't watch this movie
