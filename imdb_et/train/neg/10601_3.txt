This is the official sequel to the '92 sci-fi action thriller'. In the original Van Damme, there were several dead Vietnamese vets who lived as perfect soldiers (Unisols). That's it, I think, about a dozen years later, because Van Damme has a daughter for that age. Now, with the government in a secret place, he has no reason to train the last Unisol - codename Unisol 2500. As usual, something goes wrong: the on-site supercomputer (called Seth - like the "King Cobra" snake of the same year) goes crazy, takes the Unisol command and even loads your computer brain into a new super-unisol body (Jai White). We look at evolution in the next stage, people! Most of Van Damme's struggle is especially unanimous in the Unis (pro wrestler Goldberg), who just continues. Run him on the truck - Don't go! Shoot him down, burn him - forget! Much of humor is guided by how Van Damme is now obsolete and unclassified (he even gets gray around the edges). But even though he takes lickin ', he continues kickin'! Most of these queues are pretty imitations of the original flat, and although it is certainly not a hit on the gene, it can be consistently entertaining, especially if you're a wrestling fan.
