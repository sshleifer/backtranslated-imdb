Frankly, I didn't look at all the original jokes, but the scenes I saw clearly showed that the first intimidation was a great movie. so big that seven terrible sequences had to be done. they started "Howling II: Your sister is a werewolf". I got this uncle sometimes from my VHS movie when he gave away a lot of old movies he bought back when Atari was brand new. I just looked at it last night and it wasn't really a BRIGHT, it was just weird. I mean, the whole thing with Sybil Danning, who went in the two-way way of his two werewolves, was just inappropriate and quite distracting (but a bit hot), Christopher Lee wants to pull the dead karen as if he were a vampire, etc. This film was like Dracula and the mish-mash of the missing boys, except werewolves, because all Christopher Lee (played by Dracula himself) said that werewolves have almost all other vampire (betting) in the heart, garlic, the nightlife and the werewolf manager lives in TRANSYLVANIA). not much for the actors, but the worst was Annie McEnroe. I swear that at some point in the film I found myself rooting for werewolves to hang my throat because that damn throat had to always say. Anyway, the plot is pretty stupid and clich√©, so there's nothing to tell you, you could just read it in Wikipedia. By the way, the thing that really causes me about this movie is that it is ONLY a film of all seven sequences that are somehow related to the original (not counting Howling IV (1988), which was a remake of the original, or in other words, the same level) . so don't see this movie. no real horror, hardly werewolves and just terrible special fx. 3/10
