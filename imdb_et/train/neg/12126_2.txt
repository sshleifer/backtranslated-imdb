Here is another film by Diane Lane, where she deceives her husband. Is this the only role he knows how to play? This time it was set in 1969 and cheated with a spouse. I'm not so surprised because it's so predictable. Then his wife gets crazy and throws milk. I wouldn't be surprised when he slept with a dairy. I wouldn't be surprised if he slept with ice cream as well, because it's a very boring film. Then he says after some milk is thrown, and sees the blouse man again. Duh. Then, when he goes with him, his son pushes him. My mother always told me that I wouldn't put stones in the sack. This child's mother had no time to tell her she was too busy with the blouse.
