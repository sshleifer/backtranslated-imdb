This is a really strange movie ... First, we have a former US gymnast who is trying to change an actor (or something), and that seems to be the only role he ever got (which I still know) - and for the reason. Although it attracts enough interest, it is rather gentle and smooth. Second, we have ever used the sound effects WORST EVER !!! I'm not kidding. This alone makes the movie extremely comical, but it is annoying. And thirdly, while we generally have a decent actress (including a hot chick!), Actually a not-so-bad story and some cool visuals; Dialogue, combat gymnastics (fun!) and overall plot execution is weak. This film would have been barely better as an online TV movie (too bad Fox wasn't around 1985). This is one of those movies that is just bad, but you can't stand and even enjoy it when you get used to it, especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home in the late night TV and cable.
