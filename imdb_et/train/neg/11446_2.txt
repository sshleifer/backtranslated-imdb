My family and I drove to Underdog at night. And as bad as Underdog is (my four-year-old loved it), Hot Rod makes it like an Oscar-worthy material. The only thing that could have saved this movie was when Evel himself had come to retire to shine the face of Samberg to make this film. However, I admit that the soundtrack was good. I wasn't sure if the movie was in the 80s, but most of the music in Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I'd take it further. And just stay home and see the test pattern on your local TV channel. Or, if you're dead, look at it by watching people affect it.
