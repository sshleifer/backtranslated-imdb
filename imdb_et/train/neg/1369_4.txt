Amy Heckerling's second film, Johnny Dangerously, is a 1930s gangster movie parody made in the Warner Brothers tradition. Michael Keaton marks a medieval gangster who watches his life with heavy knocks when he tries a child trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has ongoing health problems. early by Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, Fargan plays a rival to Richard Dimitri Boyle as a criminal master and Keaton finally rises through the ranks. Joe Piscopol is a fun turn like Danny Vermin, yes, that's right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother, whose wife was Glynnis O'Connor, and Marilu Henner plays the Keaton minor. The film feels famously cheap, making it a television instead of a movie. <br /> <br /> The film starts off and slows down as expected after the first half hour. Because of the combination of dialogue and gags, the film has its own first half, but then it quickly loses steam and falls into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton looks at the landscape, making his best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are just unpleasant, not funny. Piscopo does "once" a little too much once. Several supportive parties try to fix a fort like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston Street Seller, Alan Hale, Jr. as a table-sergeant and Sudie Bond as a careless cleaner. On the other side, the tone of the TV show will develop and will never be lost. The closure using The The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism, like the movie "The Wild Of Clark Gable", which was previously seen in the film shelter. I think Heckerling should have been more familiar, because the target audience is certainly aware of The Roaring Twenties' actual 1939 release date. * 1/2 of the four stars.
