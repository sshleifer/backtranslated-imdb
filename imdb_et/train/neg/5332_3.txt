OK, portraying stereotypical "Indians" in this story is just a NOTICE. I agree that Elvis is pretty good here, but yes, his skin color seems to change during the film. I was thinking, OK, ... he was never FALSE in life. This is some of the most obvious brown "Indian" makeup I've ever seen. It's as bad as the "Indians" F-Troop and the old Hollywood Westerners played by Jewish and Italian American actors and not real native speakers! <br /> <br /> This movie is ok, but it is usually a flat story and a mediocre song like in all Elvis's later films. He just did them because Colonel Parker was in touch with her long-term film contacts to squeeze as much money as possible from Elvis! I mean "thank God" that Elvis stopped making movies forever after this movie came out. It is cool to see the character of actors Joan Blondelli, Katy Juradot, L.Q. Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this movie are. <br /> <br /> Burgess Meredith's "Indian" makeup is absolutely worthwhile. This is definitely a worse bunch. What were the filmmakers? Did Mr Meredith only do it for money? However, I love certain Elvis movies. For example: 'Love Me Tender', 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Viva Las Vegas'. I can even stand to watch my movie with future TV stars Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, "Life Change", where Elvis plays a city center doctor. <br /> <br /> Well, at least Elvis made some good films, but mediocre and bad are busy with good and good. <br /> <br /> I always love ELVIS! Thank you very much, thank you!
