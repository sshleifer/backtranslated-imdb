Full Towing. An unfortunate manifestation of a hypocritical, toxic culture ten years ago. In this film, the regret of pedestrians goes hand in hand with slavery with colonial subtext (an annoying redhead that feeds Shaka rice?). Also forget the historical reality. Did most of the Western slaves come from West Africa? American slaver easily grabs Shaka's handful of men? Finally, David Hasslehoff could no longer be uncomfortable. You can only think about how he would have been in the minisers? (Probably impaled). Minimization was excellent and it was regrettable that DH would have kept his hands unique and everyday. (I think he was in the process of creating this fiasco).
