One of the worst movies I've seen in shameful camera work, crappy filter usage, movie was grainy, script was terrible, I mean fire when predicted was a big battle at the end ..... <br /> <br /> some fighting scenes were okay i think .... <br /> <br /> some scenes were so bad it was comic ... like sorbo getting a horse and riding at the end ... lol i mean really .. horse? Oh, you can't forget how bad assassins roll around the same movie all the time .. I think they would be traced after killing the main witnesses and federal agents. .
