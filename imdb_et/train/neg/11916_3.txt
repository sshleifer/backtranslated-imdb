Yuck. I thought it was strange that their ancient book about churches was done with a script script instead of a script. Action is sometimes both apathetic and at other times so dramatic. Why would "demonico" kill two suspiciously silent doctors who helped him immortalize? Just for this heck? And really, it is necessary to show the Lilith motorcycle when it comes out somewhere. We get it! You spent a little money to rent a somewhat third branch rocket. That doesn't mean you have to show it all the time! The "belief" couple looks like an old Battlestar Galactica school with some last-minute changes. There is a scene where we introduce some people to the talk session for about 30 seconds before they are killed for no apparent reason and no importance. Everyone is an empty character. Forgettable characters and even more forgotten plot make this one of the worst films I've seen on the SciF channel come out. Stay away if you're not bad movies.
