After a long time in the room, looking for the remains of the Krypton planet, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth. He leaves Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) who married and has a son with Richard White (James Marsden). At the same time, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) primed an evil plan using the crystals he stole from the loneliness to create a new land and drown the US. <br /> <br /> After so many wonderful Superman films unforgettable Christopher Reeve or TV shows like "Lois and Clark" (and Teri Hatcher) or "Smallville", a great expectation was created for Superman to return to this version of Bryan Singer. Unfortunately, the terrible story is too long and boring, with many unnecessary parts, lack of emotions and overestimation with IMDb. In addition, the romance of Lois Lane and Superman is disgracefully ridiculous. Twenty-two-year-old actor Kate Bosworth is wrong to play the role of a mature five-year-old reporter and an experienced mother. Brandon Routh is two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays Clark Kent, a teenager in Smallville. The nature of Parker Posey, Kitty Kowalski, is actually a silly caricature. Last but not least, and despite being a terrible Lex Luthor, Kevin Spacey is forty-five years old, so older and older than the rest of the lead. The brief conclusion looks like a soap opera and is terrible. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Superman Returns"
