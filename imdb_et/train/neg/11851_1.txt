It was a disappointment - no nuance of the original. The Britons just seem to be able to make a truly amazing movie with no American version of domination. The original series combines horrible stories as well as the subtlety of performance, paying close attention to lighting and settings. I've been following the series several times and I'm still amazed. <br /> <br /> Just another bad adaptation to the terrible customization of Cracker. Capture BBC America or BBC Canada and look at such joy as dead, spiders, silent witnesses, and judge John Deed. Look at the original evil, look for "Wire in the Blood" to get a more truly underrated, elegant Robson Green performance. Hollywood must watch this actor!
