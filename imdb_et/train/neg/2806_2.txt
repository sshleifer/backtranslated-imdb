The worst movie. In principle, the US Declaration of Independence was replaced by a plasma screen and it deceived the security of the museum for several days. Eh- <br /> <br /> A plasma screen that theoretically works for less than 2 seconds while looking at the battery, assuming it is a small enough internal barrier to get the required current it wouldn't have. > <br /> It would be possible with ten large car batteries and inverters, but this system doesn't fit in the box. I'm sorry I'm an anal, but it's not even plausible. The rest of the film wasn't much better and I don't know why the budget could not be donated to charity or me.
