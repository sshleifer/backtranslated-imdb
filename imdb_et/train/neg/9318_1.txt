This is probably the worst film I've ever seen. Again, I made a mistake in buying a movie because the back side of the synapse seemed cool and the front panel also seemed cool (after that, and "Malevolence", which I also watched here, I learned my lesson). I love horror films that take place in the forest or in the desert or on the farm. This is supposed to be in the Texas forest, but was probably filmed in the director's backyard. Production was probably the worst I've ever seen. Participants were totally WORST. The story had nothing to do with this back cover. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other "mother and pop" stores that buy used DVDs and don't take it. How terrible this bad unfortunate apology for the movie was. I've seen some bad movies (like Troll 2), but it definitely takes a cake. I didn't think the movie "Troll 2" would be worse. The boy was wrong! Don't buy this movie if nobody gives it to you for free, but even if you haven't stuck with it, if you don't throw it, what I'm going to do !!!!
