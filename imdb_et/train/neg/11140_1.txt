I thought I was watching a scary movie ... and finally I smiled all over the film. In a scene where a person became a werewolf, I thought they were funny. In today's computer games, animations are ten times better. Low budget is a good comment. I recommend Wolf (1994) with Jack Nicholson for a good werewolf movie. It has good special effects, as they should be (a human being as a werewolf). If you don't want to laugh, I wouldn't want you to watch this movie. This movie is a joke.
