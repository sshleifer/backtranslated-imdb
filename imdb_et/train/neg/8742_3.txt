After seeing the movie trailer in the cinema, I thought it was the original idea for a thriller, putting it in a competitive world of computer companies. All the stars were another message that this movie would probably be good. But if I didn't go to see it in the first week of release, it disappeared after 2 weeks. I waited impatiently for this DVD release, so I bought it in a hurry to look at a pleasant night at home. Waiting at home was much better than film. At first, the direction is terrible. There is no point in taking it into account at all, and the director just forms part of himself, so he can appear in the film. I would not hurry to take her to work in the future. Secondly, Ryan Phillipe's leading role has been completely unsuccessful. Phillipe is usually a hilarious character, like for cruel purposes and on the roads of weapons, but it should be a bumblebee hero who he tries to portray as he slides when he runs and who has geeky friends, but he just can't see it right. Women's stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlan are not functional enough, but if they don't perform either, they're not close to their bestsellers. The only highlight of the film is Tim Robbins in his role that could have made him and his fiery mood and mysterious ways to drag the film. Finally, this movie is another one that fills a trailer with scenes that the movie does not see, and instead is only part of the deleted DVD scenes. Even more disappointing, even though some of these scenes are crude oil, they fill the story in important gaps.
