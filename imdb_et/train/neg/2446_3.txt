Rajkumar Santoshi, without any doubt, has directed the biggest movies and the largest box office hit on Indian cinema. You have these two actors in the same movie you have to do with Magnum Opus. <br /> <br /> Later, part of the movie you can do, that Amitabh Bachchan's voice is by another person who was assigned to his illness. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie wasn't developing the right character plus cinematography was good and one thing Bollywood should learn is that they should use visual effects only when it is needed and when Applied should be made with a big budget . The Script had so many bugs that made the viewer excuse for taking part in their phone calls rather than watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The new Comer shakes his feet well, but he couldn't work well, but if the film loses a lot of time, the story and the scene are math. <br /> <br /> Talented actor like Bhoomika Chawla has destroyed the movie as well as Sushant Singh. <br /> <br /> But every director has made a bad film during his career <br /> <br /> So watch it only if you are a fan of several Starrer Flop movies.
