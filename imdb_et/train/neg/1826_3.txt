I saw this movie last night, and even after a few beers the only thing that strangled me out was when I realized I was actually watching it. in one sense, it is inconvenient. UNfunny. I believe totally tiny tidbit about jack black sorry for making this garbage. I can't believe that barry levinson won't hit this first page of the script. Besides, I can't believe I looked at it for more than ten minutes. <br /> <br /> I gave it to 3 out of 10 * because I love seeing Christopher walking for horrible movies. the horse "corky", which is the only character of this movie, is actually completely ridiculous.
