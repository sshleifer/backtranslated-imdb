This exhibition is boring, flat and basically hangs on any kind of thing to make it "original". First: animation is so ugly ... Johnny is ugly ... and everyone's annoying. Twins look like Dexter Lab's teenage women Dexters and Johnny are almost like the more intelligent man Dee Dee (also from "Dexter Laboratory"). Second: Plots ... are painfully flat, making them difficult to track. The gags are dirty and nothing makes me a little laugh ... especially when he's trying to be funny. I only saw two episodes, but they alone turned me off. <br /> <br /> Third Turn Off: The whole theme song begins with the hanging sound of the "green idiot" of the green day. And although I'm not a big fan of this band, I find it really stupid to take the same opening module and make it fine to make it stand alone. <br /> <br /> Case point ... this is a big greasy ugly cage. 1/10
