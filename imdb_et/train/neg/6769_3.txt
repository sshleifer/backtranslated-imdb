Failure. The film was not just good. It has humor that 5-year-olds don't behave. Certainly, some parts were amusing, but most are not. Lindsey Lohan is a great actor (and a bad singer) and she should work on better movies. The movie should have been presented as a Disney Channel original, which is FREE. <br /> <br /> The only thing well done about this movie was music. Something like rock music by remade to brighten your day. These songs are so good. Especially Alyson and Amanda walking in the sunshine and Caleigh Peter's, Beach Boy song, Fun Fun Fun. <br /> <br /> 4 out of ten. If I gave it ten, 9 would be music and 1 movie. Not worth your money, but the sound is.
