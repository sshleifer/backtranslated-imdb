The manufacturers made a big mistake by giving Mark Lester, who was unable to act or sing in the title role. In addition to his very bad "action", all Lester's songs had to be duplicated by the girls. I don't know why they put him at all because there would have been so many boys who could have played this part indefinitely better and make their own song. Shani Wallis was too old to play Nancy, who was supposed to be just 16. The current West Endi version is so much better than the movie in every way. Ross McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time and is definitely much better than Jack Wild. It is clear that this old-fashioned music has received so many oscories after the beautiful events of 1968.
