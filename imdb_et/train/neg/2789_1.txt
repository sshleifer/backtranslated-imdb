Savage Island (2003) is a flat film. It is rather a home video that has a very minimal lighting and terrible action. Not only that, the story and the script were sad. I don't know why this movie is made. I've seen a lot of cinemas of my time and the ones I really hate are movies that make me angry. It made my blood boil. The situation was the best. If I made such a movie, it would have been short. Really, these idjits would not have been in the picture. <br /> <br /> Don't be confused with D.V.D. I'm a bad cinema watcher. But this movie is virtually unnoticeable. I don't mind filming D.V. but if you do what makes the movie enjoyable, no premature recovery of the tired restored movies (sans Wrong Turn). <br /> <br /> I don't need to recommend this disk waste. When you get into that rental store, it goes on. <br /> <br /> Movies that make you really angry will get automatic 1.
