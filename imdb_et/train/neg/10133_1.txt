If you are not a mentally ill or the hardest segment of the fan, you will tire this terrible apology for less than 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> A plot - even for a sea shield movie, it's just stupid. I mean not only bad, but hardly cohesive. <br /> <br /> Action - Incredibly wood. Literally seen better functioning in porn. Ironically, this film tries to get into the audience that the "lesbian love scene" deserves. <br /> <br /> Special Effects - Wouldn't look like a 60-year-old sword and sorcery. <br /> <br /> If you do not suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other treatments, do not make the same mistake as I did and buy this DVD because you are asking for an hour and a half of your life.
