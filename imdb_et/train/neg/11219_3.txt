It was a film about infidelity and revenge. A twin twin feels that his sister has something wrong. This film took forever to create a plot. Plot made several times. It was mostly weak. When the plot gets together, the movie ends. Laura and Ashley are twins living with a malicious father. Father seems to be in favor of Ashley, so Laura can blame everyone. There is a promise that girls will never be separated, but when they grow up, their lives go in different directions. Ashley gets to work in a canteen where she meets a married man, Barry. Of course, nothing can benefit from this. The fact that Barry was with tinnitus was a bad excuse to follow him. I was expecting this movie to improve and where somewhere would have a resolution, but it never happened.
