My grandmother took me and my sister to see this movie when she came out in theaters in 1998, and we were happy to buy tickets, popcorn and soda and walked straight to the theater and sat watching the movie. When it was over, the audience didn't listen very much, I remember I heard some people say they didn't like it at all, I didn't like it, I thought it was pretty stupid and not worth seeing. Eddie Murphy was hysterical in this respect, but besides that, the whole film was bad, I rarely smiled at the parts, I also remembered that other people in the theater almost didn't laugh. And what was really bad was talking to the animals, because the talking animals exist only in cartoons; I said that besides Eddie Murphy's hysterical twist she brings, this movie is not worth looking at, it's pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> I've seen Eddie Murphy in many movies and I thought she was funny about what I just said she was the only funny part of this movie, I haven't seen Eddie Murphy really "big "In the movie, Pluto Nashi adventures. This movie is not a movie I would really recommend to see, because apart from Eddie Murphy, this is probably not the case, especially because there are lots of talking animals! <br /> <br /> Rating for this movie from 3 stars out of 10 stars.
