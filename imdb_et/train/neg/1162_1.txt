I went to watch this movie at our college theater thirty years ago because I liked Bruce Dern Silent Running and Family Plot. To this day (sorry Jack Nicholson) it's still a dullest movie I've ever seen. It just went on and without a noticeable point and then - it just ended. The lights came and I looked at everyone's confusion. Was there a roll of projection? I've never wanted to know. All I remember about the film is that it was a non-drama about some annoying college basketball players and their coach. The most pleasant part of the film was watching a completely mystified audience. Fortunately, this exception was Jack, Bruce and Karen Black.
