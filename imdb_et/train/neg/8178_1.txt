Have you ever watched a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have passed and you suddenly realize that you have actually seen the movie? This happened to me with "Young graduates". The cover of a video box, if you find a video, is extremely deceptive. I swear that the two accompanying women aren't even in the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was either late in the decade to evaluate the finer points of this movie or ... just a nonsense junk. I strongly support the latter, but I think some of them have been working on combining this movie. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... plot. It hits. Let's see ... somewhere there must be a plot. No, I can't find it. It is pretty much about some high school seniors who work with drugs and speak a language that has expired decades ago. One of the female students is broken with her teacher. The teacher has a weak woman (whom she really refers to the icebergs) so she is receptive to the progress of the girls. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of racing and angelic dialogue and lots of spastic dancing. Our cat, BooBoo, was dancing high school kids. He looked at the amazing intensity when the dancers shook and shook the dance floor. It is nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this remnant. 1/10
