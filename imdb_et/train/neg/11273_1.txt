How can you collect such venerable choices of young British actors and come out with such a film? A terrible script, a distractingly passionate camera that has been terribly edited, mercilessly badly behaved. Only Rhys Ifans is trying to fulfill his role in life. Another painful proof that "different" is sometimes equal to "dreck". Why don't people finance their scripts in advance? Do yourself a favor: save yourself and do something else - like kneeling on your knees. It's less painful and more fun than this movie!
