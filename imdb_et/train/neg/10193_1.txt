With this film, Bunuel manipulates the viewer with the full feature of the film, clearly stating that his work is one of "objectivity". This is probably not the case. For one reason, many scenes that have been shot by pure chance are obvious settings (if this bad goat "accidentally" falls from the rock, you can actually see the gun smoke on the right side of the screen!). Secondly, concealing one of his important information: The people of Hurds were as they were for a specific reason, which is simply suggested in the film. That is, goitre, a disease caused by the absence of iodine (salt). This rabbit is the cause of their cretinism, and Bunuel had time to do his research (when he checked "cretinism" in the medical dictionary he would have found "goitre"), he might have told the truth about these people (undoubtedly). Instead, he constantly evaluates them with his film, tells them to "ketins" over and over, dramatizing action, setting scenes to create a spectacle, all very unacceptable to a documentary who claims to be all-powerful objectivity. Bunuel speaks in this movie all the time, leaving one word to the people he's filming. He speaks for them and YOU ALSO GUIDE. This piece is a mistake for its roots, ideology, and it is a real shame that it is considered a big movie.
