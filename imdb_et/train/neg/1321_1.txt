Richard Dreyfus is not a star here. He has about thirty-two seconds and what does Gene Barry do about this movie? No idea that the director was probably his brother! This is a movie that makes no sense. An unknown writer / director (the same guy) put everyone's talent on their scary uh ... work. I got a DVD for penny so I can't complain! But it's strange! And it makes you feel strange and not good. It was in the 1970s and it looks like the director was in a bad acid journey and wanted everyone to experience what it was to be in his head. It has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept, but like a scratched record, it plays a bug quickly. This is the "Manson family of acid". <br /> <br /> I have no idea how the other reviewer got everything they did with this movie? Maybe they worked there back? In any case, be prepared to lose 80+ minutes of your life that you never get back. Yes, it's so terrible!
