I've been watching this movie for some time, so maybe wait a little too much. I think both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer are good at what they do and were interested in what Dan Reed could come up with, but unfortunately it just didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the fact that the movie doesn't really understand what genre has come in and it doesn't impress the elements of drama, horror, and thriller, because instead of focusing on one and doing it well, it's a little bit of all the deals and the masters are not. <br /> <br /> The premise (like most revenge films) is simple, the couple will meet and go out, something bad will happen and they will get revenge, it's a simple formula and one of the many leaders has been professionally involved over the years. Fortunately, in this case, as Dan Reed thought, "It would be nice to make one of those revenge films going deeper, showing a more human side to all characters and trying in more detail into their mental state." .. "Wrong! There are also some basic elements, this type of film usually has a warning. Do not do it or it can happen to an element that adds tension, but there is nothing like that. It just happens, nothing happens for an hour, something happens <br /> <br /> There are a lot of real competition in this genre, and Dan Reed's hats are trying, I have no problem with his leadership, but at the time of writing ... I'd say next time he should stick to it the type of film he does, instead of trying to be too smart and he has high quality movie hands for him.
