Oh, to cry out loud, it's a LAMEST movie I've seen all year round, and I'm sorry that conventionally fantastic John Cusack even took part in this pointless, double Stupidity piece. When Unetu in Seattle has given what is the same message, though finer, somewhat more mature, Serendipity gives it a candle and then returns to its psyche for the next annoying hour and half. (And it's an hour and a half of my life, I will never be back, thank you very much!). It is bad enough that the main characters of this film are fourteen-year-olds with emotional maturity (in fact, I've been familiar with better fourteen years ...) except maybe Jeremy Piven, who was enjoyable enough. My first friend and I irritated incredibly for the first 15 minutes or a movie where Kate Beckinsale's character plays this annoying fool about the game that all senses the wind (literally). I told my wife that Rockstar had more intelligence and at least Rockstar's characters were not half-functional because the idiots were confused by this "Serendipitous". It is tedious to look at the protagonists who seem to have made no choice in their lives and feel they are nothing but the dolls and destiny of destiny. How totally tiring. I am sure that this film is more likely to be enjoyed by those who do not want to deal with the chaotic complexity of making more complex life choices and then responsibly living with consequences. After all, there is a film where our hero and heroine live happily only after they have regretted the lives of two people (namely their opponents), not to mention other relatives and friends. <br />
