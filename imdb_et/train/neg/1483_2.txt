I just gave it to ridicule 2 of this ridiculously titled comedy because it shows up several famous porn stars of the past. A group of tourists allegedly resting in Ireland, but actually in Canada, run a cannibalistic inbredut mutant on something or something, and the plot is more or less correct for HILL, which is EYES and WRONG TURN. The only problem is that if I do not spoil, there is only one mutant on the screen and it is not so impressive. This homemade film is about five years old. Some fun but foolish deaths help, but the film is strictly an amateur night and boring. The end is predictable and fatal. Not intended.
