The Hollywood Hotel was the last movie that Busby Berkeley led to Warner Bros. His leadership style had changed or evolved so that this film did not contain his signature aerial shots or huge product key with thousands of extras. During the last decades of the thirties, the big bands of the year recorded the biggest popular hits of the year. Swing Era, also called Big Band Era, is dated differently from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949. Although it is impossible to determine exactly the moment when Swing Era started, Benny Goodman's participation in the Palomar Ballroome in Los Angeles in late 1935 was definitely one earlier signs that swing was entering American youth consciousness. When Goodman performed his swing repertoire rather than the social style dance music his band had played, the audience went wild. It was a start, but since the radio, live concerts and word of mouth were the main methods of spreading the phenomena, it took some time before the swing changed enough space to produce the big hits that appeared on the pop charts. The Hollywood hotel shows Benny Goodman and his orchestra and Raymond Paige and his orchestra in the film show that the film industry was ready to use a change in musical taste (the film was only one and a half years in production or after the inclusion of Goodman Palomar Ballroom). There are some interesting musical moments in the Hollywood hotel, but with the exception of Benny Goodman and his orchestra "Sing, Sing, Sing", there is not much praise. Otherwise, the most interesting musical sequences are opening the "Hooray for Hollywood" parade and "Let That Be a Lesson to You" production number at the restaurant. The film is most interesting to see and hear about how Benny Goodman and his orchestra and Dick Powell and Frances Langford sing.
