Killer Tomatoes films have such a special humor - you love it or hate it. I like it personally, but in this fourth movie I feel lost. Tomatoes are not the same, jokes are flat, even the actors are not so funny. Because that's the only thing such movies should be - funny. <br /> <br /> Now, after laughing at the plot, it's annoying. They shouldn't really do the fourth part in the trilogy of Killer Tomato.
