In general, it is a good idea to keep at least part of the author's proposed tone or conveying concepts from the book to convert the movie, rather than ignoring the author at all. While it is clear that the director had access to and advice from Elinore Stewart's children, it is important to note that the children believed their mother to be a liar, enriching, strengthening their home's home experiences. The book describes his life on the adjacent farms of him and his wife on the large border of Wyoming; he crowns everyday adventures with his many friends and acquaintances, although they lived a dozen miles away. However, the film has made a normal attitude at the time it was made, depicting this woman's experience as harsh, unforgiving, and almost meaningless. Perhaps the director brought some of his experience of the Vietnam War to his film (as some movie enthusiasts have said), but it seems to be a weak excuse to take the joy and beauty of the entire book and turn it into a dark, unpleasant landscape with no friends or hope. Don't waste your time with this movie; read the book.
