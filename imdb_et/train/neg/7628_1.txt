Black and white film. Good photography. Trusted characters. <br /> <br /> Just terrible. <br /> <br /> I've wasted another perfect night watching a movie that others thought was "worth" and "very good". Here are some good deeds and the plot's back ground is good (it should have been done more), but it grows very slowly and never develops. It is based entirely on sex without much romance, with a lot of nudity. The main characters could have done more. If you are looking for something to look at with you, this is not a movie, and if not, you have difficulty sitting through it. Although this movie is long, it's just 1 inch deep!
