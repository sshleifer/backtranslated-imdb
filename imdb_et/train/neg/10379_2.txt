The film begins in 1840 in Japan, where a man cuts his wife and lover and commits suicide. It's a very gory, bloody sequence. Then it jumps to this day ... well 1982 exactly. Ted (Edward Albert), wife of Laura (Susan George) and their annoying little boy are moving to Japan for hubby work. They rent a house and - surprise! Surprise - It just happens that the murders happened! Three dead people are about like ghosts (makeup is hysterically bad) and make family life hell. <br /> <br /> Sounds good - but it's really hopeless. There's bloody opening and ending, and sometimes there's nothing. There is a giant crab attack that is just terrible! They look so fake - I swear I saw the strings pull one another - and they understand !!!!! In the first 20 minutes, there is a pointless genealogy (apparently just showing George's body), the other about 40 minutes later (but it was necessary for the plot) and a really silly exorcism to the end. The struggle between Albert and Doug McClure must be considered credibly. <br /> <br /> As an actor, Albert was OK because his wife and McClure were pretty good as a family doctor. But George - as always - is a terrible movie. He gives this film a much needed lift but can't save it. I'll give it to 2 just for him and the spooky opening and closing. This is a very boring film.
