I don't know where to start. The cast is full of people who have never done anything before or after. Debralee Scott is included in the cover boxes but is not shown in the movie at all. Writing is quite bad even for college movies. This is obviously a very small budget where one scene is in a corporate house with extremely unpleasant editing. <br /> <br /> Characters are quite typical for college movies - dude guy, nerd, black guy, harsh boys, boy with a musty girl, little town girl, etc. The Object Teacher is about what you are waiting for ... a medieval heavy-duty man who can easily be set aside. <br /> <br /> If you don't see the college slip, the remains will be clear. It's so bad, it's not even funny.
