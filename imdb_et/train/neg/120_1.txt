When I first saw the film, I quickly noticed an actor who played the role of Lucille Ball. The depiction of Rachel York by Lucyst is absolutely terrible. Lucille Ball was an incredible comedian with incredible talent. Think of the legend, as Lucille Ball has imagined how she was in the movie, is terrible. I can't believe all the actors in the world who could play Lucy much better, manufacturers decided to get Rachel York. He may be a good actor in other roles, but playing Lucille Ball is tough. It is quite difficult to find someone who could recall Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone who is a bit like appearance and talent. If you noticed the depiction of York in Lucy's I Love Lucy episodes like a chocolate factory or a vitavetavegamin, there is nothing in any way similar - his expression, voice, or movement. The stack playing Desi Arnaz is terrible. The stack doesn't qualify to play like Ricky. He is small and skinny, his accent is unreal and his act is unbelievable again. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar, they were not as bad as Lucy and Ricky characters. <br /> <br /> In general, the extremely horrible casting and story is badly spoken. If people want to understand the real situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest looking at A & E's biography of Lucy and Desi, reading the Lucille Ball book or PBS American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you'd like to see a docudrama, you'd be better off before you smile. Casting Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz before "laughing" is much better than that. At least a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.
