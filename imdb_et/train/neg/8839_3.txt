Nice experiment and good ideas (redemption of prostitutes, people helping each other, ...) but bad result ... The director obviously tried to mimic his French colleague Tran Anh Hung, creating an atmosphere that requires portrayal of Vietnam ... The only problem is that Vietnam has long disappeared and the "green papaya smell" was a historical background ... trying to create such an atmosphere (silenced sounds and slow pace of life). ..) nowadays leaves a sense of forgery. In addition, it quickly creates a feeling of boredom and the result becomes too obvious. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the action is taking place in Saigon or Da Nang because it is the place where Harvey Keitel, formerly a marine-life movie, was probably placed during the war ... But no one in South Vietnam is talking about very few people that actors show the Northern accent ... Seriously even bad for a Vietnamese speaker. <br /> <br /> An old poet lepra ... very doubtful (not a disease to people in their condition), a peasant girl who can read and write a complicated Vietnamese poetry ... ... even more doubtful ... <br /> < br />
