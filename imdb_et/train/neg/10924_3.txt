Watching the first 30 minutes of Oblivion's sand gave me great hopes. It seemed to me that I was for a cheaper version of Mummy. The setting was promising, Cecil B. Demille of the 1920s makes his ten command opus. It seems that by using the real Egyptian artifact for the film they fired old and terrible evil (are they not always?). Being aware of what was triggered, DeMille orders a complete set buried instead of tearing it out in the usual way. Hopefully it will be buried all the time. Then we go to the point where the team is trying to dig up the site (the first mistake of the movie, but hey, these period costumes are expensive and it's a Sci-Fi channel movie). The first observations we get from the Anubis monster are well done and this is the costume they tried, not the usual cheesy CG effect. The body count then begins. It was that film went to me south. The answers that people die in terrible and strange ways get a strangely modest response. When they realize that the ancient evil has been fired again and is dead, what does the leading man and woman do? They make a normal stop for "a man who knows the truth but has never told anyone". After receiving this vital data, do they share it with their mining partners? No, they stay at the hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant little conversation. Actually, I am not the most motivated person, but when I knew that the ancient Egyptian demon was open and killing everyone in sight and coming after me, I made little to solve my problem. After this oversized and meanless section, they get the Anubis monster destroyed in the usual way, competing with the dunes and shooting it with a rocket launcher when it stands on the pile of phosphorus granules. For a Sci-Fi movie, it was a nonsense that wasn't out of the ordinary. What paralyzes me is that there could have been much more than someone writing a proper script for it.
