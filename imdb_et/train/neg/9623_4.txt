Ben Stiller doesn't react so much. And he does it very well. He's very dependent on his comedy. There's something about Mary, she's standing on the hair scene just because Stiller tries to keep her straight face. If he is facing two other judges, he is the most unpleasant man in the room, but the scene is fun. <br /> <br /> Polly has a formula to break for hard-to-understand reasons. Stiller is surrounded by a number of comic talents. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines, too little. That said, Hoffman relies a little too much on physical humor - you know we're in trouble when they go laughing at jokes. A basketball scene where Hoffman's hams are completely overdue (although it casts a contradiction in the form of a shirt without an opponent that raises the smile - noticeably through Stiller's reaction). However, everyone seems to be in a bubble, the reaction is very small. Hoffman and Stiller characters could have played much more of each other. Aniston repeats his Rachael role, but Stiller is not Ross. This is more of a "Joey with Rachael Scenario". <br /> <br /> Polly is a rom-com by-attribute and it's a failure - it doesn't have a heart. You are not filling symbols. A little more work we could have had a deeper story, but in the end the film's failure to write is poor. It is worth checking out if it jumps on the TV in the slow evening, but you will not regret withdrawing cash to see it.
