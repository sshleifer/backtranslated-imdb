I watched this movie after seeing other IMDb comments, even convincing my wife that it was a "unique horror movie." I wanted to like this movie but couldn't. <br /> <br /> "Love Story" was good, but horror was pretty bad. If the story was just a young man who fell in love with a girl who suffered from parasomnia, it would have been a better film. <br /> <br /> The maintenance center stretched the religion beyond the boundaries, but was actually ridiculous. Your doctor ignores privacy laws and professionalism. The nurse goes into the room to feed a routine dangerous patient (without an escort) and falls into the tray and runs out of space without being obvious. Forensic patient (and film villain) is involved in a fully dressed standing position - probably for years? None of this makes sense. <br /> <br /> There were even some actors I have liked in other things like detective, but I still can't recommend this movie.
