I saw this movie yesterday. I rented a DVD from Blockbuster. Actually, I know one of the actors in the movie. I'm not saying who ..! (It is kept under diapers.) But I have to admit that it wasn't as good as I thought it would be .. Tom Savini? Hats with this guy. But it is a shame that he wasn't in the movie for a long time .. What a film is missing is an idea, script, sound, etc. It may sound like a good movie. it's not fun .. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm glad my sister paid Â£ 10 for renting 3 DVDs from Blockbuster. I chose it .. and I was disappointed. Anyway, thumbs down for me! Not my cup of tea! 0 out of 10!
