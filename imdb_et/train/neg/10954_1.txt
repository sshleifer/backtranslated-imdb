If there was a 0-star rating, I'd be happy to give it to this absolutely terrible trash. The fact that the actual summary is absolutely good and that if it had changed, it could have been great only that it was worse. Locking a group of people in the experimental chamber is a key task, but is EXPERIMENT TEST? Everything I can see is a number of unpleasant surfers and blondes who talk about music and culture that I don't know or want to know ... Problems are pathetic and stupid. The whole point of reality TV is to show REALITY. If you are challenging, do not do it by playing exaggerated foods and stereotypical cultural elements in "Friday night games". Make them a real challenge. And like earning a prize money, it's good if they actually earn it! These people are nuts. If only the exhibitions were better, the real idea would be brilliant. But that doesn't happen!
