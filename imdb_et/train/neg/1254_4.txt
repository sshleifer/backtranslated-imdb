I've seen and liked the original film and waited for it more than I did. <br /> <br /> GOOD: Effects and makeup are good. There are no complaints about scores and visuals, they are good enough and the performances were fine (Tim Roth was great, the other principals were good and a handful of supportive supporters with very limited roles). The action scenes were exciting and fun. <br /> <br /> BAD: Escape from the monkey was terrible. The characters go around, maybe somewhere in the middle of the city there are tunnels to escape. In addition, which evacuation route carries all bedrooms? <br /> <br /> The story was hidden as much as possible. I like the scenes of action, but the original deck had more meat for it, and it was more wrong. <br /> <br /> In the end, the ending was completely meaningless. Without any inevitable follow-up, there is no justification for this. <br /> <br />
