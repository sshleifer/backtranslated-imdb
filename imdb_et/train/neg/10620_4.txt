Despite some exciting (and brave) sequences, NBTN just doesn't go. There are explosive boats, murders, mass suicides, pathologists with body parts, and all kinds of classic mystery / horror scenes, but there is a long-lasting clean exposure between them. Everyone in the movie is bored. It's shameful because many sequences are considered cruel when it was filmed. <br /> <br /> Add "British" characters to it "too right" and feel like you're in the Sherlock Holmes movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, cinema is very common. There are many ways to take in the scenic scenery or the tricky steps someone draws into a huge campfire, but the whole thing is unimaginable and boring. <br /> <br /> Definitely just for fans of Lee and Cushing.
