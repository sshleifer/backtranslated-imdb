*** Includes spoiler *** <br /> <br /> I didn't like this movie at all. <br /> <br /> I found it amazingly boring and quite superficial, regardless of its importance and depth. planned topics: Considering that eventually we must die, how should we approach life? "Light," like Tom; "hard" way like Tereza; or should we find ways to not deal with this issue, like Sabina? How much is loyalty in the relationship? How much of our working life can be damaged in the interests of our loved ones? How much do we have to participate in the political life and social issues of our country? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I have not read Kundera's novel, but after downloading a movie, I will definitely: I want to understand if the story has been destroyed by movie customization (which is my guess) or if it was from the beginning bored after. <br /> <br /> I disagree with most of the positive comments that define the film as a masterpiece. I just can't see the reasons. I see a lot of mistakes and they have taken a sample. <br /> <br /> 1) Three main characters are thrown at you and it is very difficult to understand what drives them when making their choice. <br /> <br /> 2) "Secondary" characters are only for filling gaps, but they don't add a story and you don't know if they are really needed. <br /> <br /> 3) I didn't like the way Tomas was embodied. There's nothing good for him. He is so self-centered and selfish. He is not a man in any sense. But if his self-confidence fails and he understands that he is dependent on others and is emotionally connected to someone, I did not find the interpretation credible. his lifestyle in the communist country in 1968. In addition, the three main characters are very successful in their professions, which sounds strange. a) How can Tereza easily get such a good photographer? b) How can they do so well in a country where there are no economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed? <br /> <br /> 5) Counterfeit English spoken by participants is ridiculous. And I'm not even a native speaker. Moreover, the letter that Sabina receives in the United States is written in Czech, which I found very inconsistent. the movie was shot in, so it's not difficult to give the film to the feeling of Eastern Europe and, given the inner beauty of Prague, it's not even hard to do. <br /> <br /> 7) I found a sort of trivial to the end. Tereza and Tomas, who are finally happy in the countryside, far from the temptations of their "metropolis", far from the social struggles of their fellow citizens, die in a car accident. But they will die after understanding that they are really happy. So what? Would they be unhappy dead, would the film's message be different? I do not belive. I thought it was a cheap trick for the audience. <br /> <br /> 8) In a movie that is intolerably light, the only thing the director represents is the characters. You will see them for almost three hours, but you will end up with something. You do not know empathy, you are not related to them, you are there on your couch, watching the sequence of events and scenes that have little to say. <br /> <br /> 9) I hated it. stop the music in the restaurant "in the scene (some commented a lot). Why does Sabina have such a strong reaction? Why does Franz agree with him? I really don't see this point. The only thing you learn is that Sabinal is a very bad mood and quite strong What is so special and unique about it? <br /> <br /> After all these negative comments, let me point out that there are two scenes that I really liked (that's why I gave it to two) <br /> <br /> "Naked women Photoshoot" where jealousy, jealousy and insecurity of Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented. <br /> <br /> The second scene is the one that represents the investigations after the occupation. The Tereza pictures taken to find out what is happening in Prague are used to identify the unrest, I found it to be quite original and Tereza's despair and guilt are nicely portrayed. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a small chance that the film was t "tightly" designed so that "Tomasi Types" like it and "Tereza them" hate it. If that is the case (but I doubt it very much), my comment should be drastically reviewed.
