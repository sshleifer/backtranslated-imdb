I spent a couple of days dedicated to Ron Howard before I swear my work completely. Unfortunately, Lucas was so young that Howard is now so many Lucas. How else would you explain your attacks on disasters? Of course, her only useful film has been Willow. Everything else, including this one, is too superficial in surface treatment. <br /> <br /> Some spoilers. <br /> <br /> He doesn't even get half the intelligent focus like Peter Weir. No, bad Howard is so stuck with his Spielberg exclusion qualities that he is quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> Here is an old message: "Love conquers everything, even disease." Too bad for Howard that Lynch has already passed all the sub-text with more skill. Heck, even Disney did it better. Ron even goes ahead with the possibilities offered by imaginary realities. <br /> <br /> Howard's commentary track is just terrible. Don't even rent a DVD. <br /> <br /> Final Analysis = = Kinematic Dud
