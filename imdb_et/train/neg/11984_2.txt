Ugh! Another one that "hides with the cover" is the DVD. I expected at least bears, cats and such activities on the cover. I have nothing! Bad movie! <br /> <br /> I was forced to think about it all the time, so finally SOMETHING would happen ... no luck. <br /> <br /> Now, why did I give it. because of the landscape; otherwise suck. <br /> <br /> The child was terrible, spoke to himself (although I think they could not just run a movie of fool music and no dialogue at all) by making his flat karate stand on the tree stump, threatening the raccoon, rushing worms and (which is dumbass) who strikes the pus. And he will not pull them out lightly, because they would be like fish. At least a few times he fought a bear (weakly). <br /> <br /> What was the setback? It made the bad movie even worse. I wanted to see a film of survival, not some dramatic bs for a child suffering from divorce. <br /> <br /> What else to say? Well, maybe they should have eaten a bear or something. At least it would have been more exciting. People don't waste that time.
