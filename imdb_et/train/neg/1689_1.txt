Wow what to shoot! The fact that people think this film is scary is ridiculous. Special effects were like "Ring". Story? Was there one? I do not like. Just a bunch of pictures. The whole movie was boring, stupid, crap. I think there is always a market for bad movies with good marketing campaigns. But this is the worst horror movie I've seen for years. And this Buffy chick? Well, he's a bad actor! Like plastics like Barbie and the same talented ... No, wait, this would be offensive to Barbie's talents! I think many kids helped to be in the ticket office because it was PG-13 and if it was rated R, he would have bombed the IMO! Stupid movie!
