This fairly formal sword and flying fists is a decent early display of talented people by John Woo. Cinematic art is great and some swords are truly remarkable. Unfortunately, the film hits the dull story of the movie and the terribly low budget (check some of the set scenes when you doubt me). Nonetheless, it is worth seeing, especially if you can catch a letterbox.
