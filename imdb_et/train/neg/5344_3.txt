You remember the Spice Girls movie and how bad it was (in addition to the songs), their leader Simon Fuller (also the leader of this band) makes the same mistake when he puts S Club (my other favorite bands) on his movie. S Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley Mcintosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens (what happened to the seventh member Paul Cattermole) basically asked their boss for a break, they continue, and while they watch TV! Three of them changed, and vice versa, the parties discover that they are greedy clones of the scientist, and the other half just gets in trouble. Gareth Gates also plays as his own clone. This movie can be more than a Spice Girls movie, but besides the songs "Bring It All Back", "Don't Stop Movin" and "Never Had A Dream Come True", this is a reason not to see this movie. Not too long after the band's good sharing. Enough!
