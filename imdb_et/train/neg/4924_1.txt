This movie is very bad. It may be tough, but it is. It's really. Poor manuscript, the vampire ache of each book is used, and no compassion is given to the origin of the main character ... s.o. is Dracula. Previously, there have been really brilliant Dracula / vampire movies, but it doesn't even make it a "clumsy" nest. <br /> <br /> Take a look at people who seem to have missed a teenage movement, add a Dracula Lore drop and mix an amazing religious / surreal dream ... and you get a confusing movie - Dracula 2000. <br /> <br /> can't say anything good about this movie, as if it wasn't bad enough to be done first, they seem to have made Johnny Lee Miller's effect in English ... What is the problem I hear you cry .. Well, he's English, but he sounds like an American trying to make an English accent. <br /> <br /> All in all, you can tell your money (if you thought about buying it) or rent it out, see it and find out why it's as scary as Tellytubbies. <br /> <br /> PS Although La La is pretty scary!
