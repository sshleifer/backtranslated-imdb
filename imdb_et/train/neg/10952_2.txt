I hate how this film has no creative contribution. I know they're going to realism, but frankly, I just don't want realism. Realism is boring. If I want to see everyday life, I live. Tell me an interesting story and we're talking. I can deal with low production values, hell I'm a mammal with low production results, but at least some good idea. The direction goes only as far as grabbing the camera and walking a bit, but obviously I have to dig it because it makes things so much more realistic. Hitchcock said that drama was essentially a life where dull bits were cut out. I can only conclude that this is not a drama, not a long-term one. We see Rosetta walking somewhere, Rosetta working in a bakery, Rosetta eating a wafer, Rosetta carrying a bag, running Rosetta home, Rosetta walking somewhere ... it's not that much fun. There is no deeper meaning. I'm so bored that I started to look for some thoughts on life in this movie, but it's just normal realism, the company's most overestimated quality. I think I should love it, but come on, there's nothing.
