Even if you missed the idea that these boring characters personally showed all the important moments of the 1960s (ok, so Katie doesn't join the Manson family and no one died in Altamont), this movie was still incredibly terrible. I had the impression that "writers" just locked themselves in the room and watched the "Forrest Gump", "Wonder Years" and Oliver Stone's 60s films over and over again and called it for research. The critique of Canadian television called the "head spinning" of the first episode. He was right.
