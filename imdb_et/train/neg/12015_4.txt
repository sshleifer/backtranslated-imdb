Alfred Hitchcok is not my favorite leader, but imagine what he could have done with it! The plot has a lot of tension. John Garfield is almost always great and Raymond Massey is being thrown into the type. Nancy Coleman is not a very impressive leading lady, but the support is great and very capable. <br /> <br /> Yes, it will start to drop quite early. There are too many coincidences. And the important topic is trivialized because it is done a little more, eventually as a love story. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch Garfield, Massey and character performers. But that's not terribly good.
