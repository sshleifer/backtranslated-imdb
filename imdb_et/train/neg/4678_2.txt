There were some andrenaline kickers on this film, but this is an old story that can never happen. The Navy's protocols were never able to break so much that much less XO of the crew could ever go to the captain. I'll take Dr Strangelove every day when I want to see this plot. Sidenote - The US Navy did not support this movie.
