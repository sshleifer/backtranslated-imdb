An exceptionally terrible story that I hardly put into words. The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims ended, alive and well, only to kill again. There is a chance that I missed some important plot elements because I can be in a small coma when that child was. Scenes that never even appear on the movie are displayed in the box where the movie is presented. I was attracted to the promises of the generation of torture and the "drag-and-drop of sexy horrors". I feel it was a budget version and about a quarter of the movie was out. All good things are more likely. I got the PG-13 add-on that made as much sense as the end of the new “Apeside Planet” movie. Look at it with a friend and a bottle of hard stuff. You need it.
