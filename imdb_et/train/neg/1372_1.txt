You saw it on TV. I'm glad I didn't go to the cinema to see it or rent money. The film is completely predictable - from corrupt owners and planners to snaking cables. The plot is really weak and incredible - the avalanche expert guy hits a 20-meter bone-breaking avalanche (using the actual material) and all he has to do is get up and shake. Lavin hits millions of miles per hour and stops by the road dead. <br /> <br /> Some real avalanche materials are impressive and show their devastating power. But the agreement between the actual avalanche and the staged things makes the film even flimming. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, don't worry about it even at T.V.
