These 2 points are dedicated to Akshay Kumar's reasonable result. I know Bollywood movies don't want to be realistic, but PLEASE Walt Disney's production is more realistic than this plot. Dad is dying and doing what every good parent does ... his son with his PREGNANT husband. Some things that were too hard to swallow - 1. The cool pool in Priyanka's bedroom and go to the living hungry in the gardens in your garden ???????? 2. Akshay suddenly got a job as a stuntman, bitten by bitten dogs to just walk. This film is INSULT for our intelligence, which I really can't believe I contributed financially to the "people" who made this movie to see my family see it, we left the cinema frowned, don't leave yourself confused to see it take my advice and don't waste your "waqti".
