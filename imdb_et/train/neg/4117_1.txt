Two days after I saw this thing, I'm still embarrassed when I saw it. It's so bad, you have to think about how someone could write these letters, much less to let the public get rid of. Stilted acts as a leading man who looks like he dreams and Alison Eastwood himself is embarrassed. Action shows a low budget movie, which means that it is painfully bad. Content? Well, if you were 6 years old, you could have written this movie. Simple, idealistic and just flat.
