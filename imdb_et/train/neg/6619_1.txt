This is by far the worst film I've ever seen in the cinema! Could not wait until it ends. Even worse, he gets a 12A certificate, so you don't see anyone who's shooting, but the ground-sliding bodies, even the killing of Babban was cut off !!! Too many scenes were cut to bring younger viewers because I think the makers knew it would be catastrophic to flop! Amitabhi's action was great, but "Basanti" wannabe and the other idiot who plays Devgans companion can't even act. Devgan was wasted !! <br /> <br /> I wouldn't look at it again for free, and I recommend all the others who read it just the same as you warned!
