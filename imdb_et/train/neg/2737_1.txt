There is no spoiler in this overview. There is nothing to spoil. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, nothing; most of the clips show at least an attempt to tie the clips to the plot with somewhat weak stretching, but it didn't do it even. Clips, three lines that lead to the next endless clip sequence ... OK, so maybe they were short during production, but they would have missed this episode. What's not a waste of time? I'm not sure how it really happened. The choirs are usually much better at dropping the slings, but somehow it was over .... <br /> <br /> Thanks to the heaven they were back in form for the next episode.
