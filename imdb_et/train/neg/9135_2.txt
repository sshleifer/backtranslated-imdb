Oh, Sam Mraovich, we know you're trying so hard. This is your magnum opus, a brilliant example for the rest of us that you should definitely call the Academy of Motion Picture and Science (as you notice on your 1998 website). Unfortunately, it is better to keep silent and think stupid than to talk and remove any doubts. With Ben & Arthur, you do just that. <br /> <br /> With a lack of teaching or education, the film scenario seems to be strangely odd for us every new scene. It is such a crazy excuse for a story that can be the best ally of the movie. Ben and Arthur, badly homosexual characters, are trying to marry, so far to fly across the country to do it, under the shade of Vermont's best palm trees. But all this positioning is just the beginning of BLOOD. Then more blood and more and more blood. I mean, the last third of this movie must have at least $ 20 in counterfeit. <br /> <br /> The film is entirely technical. From music to editing, which consists of one fuzzy bass held on the keyboard, it is a wonder that the film even collects with whatever media you watch. It is so shameful that some decent amateur performances have been wasted here. <br /> <br /> No, Sam. I'm sure you've made this movie in five numbers rentals or any poor souls (like me) to watch this movie. Unfortunately we don't laugh with you.
