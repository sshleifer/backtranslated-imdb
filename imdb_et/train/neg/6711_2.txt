1993 was a year. It was a long time ago when Phillip Seymour Thomas won the Oscar. Who knew I would be extra with him in the movie? I was actually paying a fee for "My Boyfriend Back", shot in the suburb of Austin, called Georgetown, TX. The original title was "Johnny Zombie" (thanks to God that the producers changed in the heart!) I was in the theater. I hurried to watch the movie the day it appeared in theaters. It's more comedy than a horror movie. But ... for a good laugh, you could watch it. Something that is even dead in "Dawn of the Dead" or even "Shaun of the Dead", but the cheese factor is good enough. ciao
