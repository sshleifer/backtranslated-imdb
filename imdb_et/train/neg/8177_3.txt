90 minutes Mindy ... Mindy is tempted by boy Bill ... Mindy prefers high school dance ... Mindy jumps to Big Sur, trades tail "shepherd's bread", Mindy almost reaches rape. Ah, the joy of Crown International. You must remember that these movies are never intended to stop DVD players. They were made in a 90-minute atmosphere so that 70's teenagers would have a soundtrack when they got their Pintos and Citations. The lack of dissatisfaction and structure was not important for the original audience - they probably only tuned when the R & D on the screen matched the places on the parking lot. The film is really irritating when watching the story. It's much more fun to talk about it than watch it. My Favorite Immunity: 1) Bill and his friend engage with the teacher to find Mindy. Without changing luggage or underwear, they spend 2 nights sharing a motel with a teacher, as well as in real life. 2) After robbed and almost robbed by cyclists and after their innocent friend's "Pan" is maliciously beaten, Mindy and his girlfriend find their way on the unattended motorcycle. Mindy immediately brightens and stretches: "I'm going to Big Sur!" But again it is much more fun to talk / read than to sit.
