I can't believe how this film is uneducated. It's like looking at the police academy, except what is for people who have no idea what they are talking about, and ... Wait, it's a stupid robot that should be a sidekick. I understand stopping the unbelief, but it's just total stupidity. There is no plot for this movie. It's like watching someone pretending to be a doctor, throw in non-medical words as if they were employees of big medical institutions. In addition, people wear clothes that are not suitable for the space program. I feel like I'm watching the b-movie of valley-girls in space.
