Carl Monson, a Z-class fear filmmaker, was one of the most prolific directors in the field of low-budget gourmet. His films are full of inert gore, ridiculous actors, boring sub-plot and terrifying dialogue. The figure is murderously murdered by guests staying in a family house. Unfortunately, this movie is almost bloodless. You don't really see murders except shadows and some blood supplies. the pace is sleepy and the plot is quite uninteresting. competent, but the lack of disability and distortion remained disappointing. Excellent from 4 out of 10. Just be careful: don't mistake Monson's film Andy Milligan with equal weak blood.
