The geek of the deceased high school will enliven the scarecrow, which will revenge everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie is very disturbing for me. It has a great look, it has some good effects on the budget, some atmosphere, but good things can be short-cut short. Halfway I started moving forward and then through the DVD chapters. <br /> <br /> There are many problems with this movie. First of all, it looks like about thirty and yet they are in high school. As a result, you don't believe anything. The scarecrow, looking great, is not much farther. She says the stupid one lining and moving in a way that is more funny and scary. Is it a comedy or a horror movie? This is a problem that goes beyond the many liners of the dialog and sets. It seems that every clich√© is more than a hearty horror film. Sometimes I hope the film is for a very narrow audience, horror fans who want to mock the genre, not to embrace it. <br /> <br /> Despite the frightening monster, this is a movie that must be avoided. Even if you take it down under five bucks, you pay too much. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
