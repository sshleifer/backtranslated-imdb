Don't even waste your time, not to mention this piece for a dreck! How it is done is farther away from me. (I don't know why there are at least 10 lines ... I've already gathered this trashy movie, but, well ...) The show was terrible as they all need. The plot was weak, the end ... Feh! I think cinematography was the only thing that didn't suck ... well, maybe the sound was minimal. One good thing is that, if they could make this movie, even make money with it, there might be hope that some screenwriter with a REAL idea. So, you all take heart! The same goes for the actors ... if these people are actually paid, you can!
