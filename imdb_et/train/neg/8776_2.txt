Michael Keaton has never really been a good actor; In Tim Burton's Batman films, he always falls under the guise of his big villain. Here he celebrates as a widowed spouse who picks up radio frequencies that seem to be dead people trying to live ... <br /> <br /> Well, this should be a pretty shocking thriller, but it will be everywhere you are shocked. Because there are too many things that will reach unexplained, undetected and uninteresting. So, where is the shocking excitement when it first becomes such a bad film that WHITE NOISE makes itself stupid? Really bad behavior and terrible editing, this movie is nothing to watch. Michael Keaton tries to make the thriller come back, but loses his goal more than ever.
