"Friend", probably without a taste or class, suggested that I look at Ron Atkins' work. If it is representative of his work, I never want to see him. It is amateurish, self-confident, criminally puzzled and self-sufficient rubbish. The title "hoormangler" is an angry low-budget filmmaker who murders a number of whores. There is little nudity and some erections, but no element can save that nickel's arrow. Lighting is terrible, the dialogue is clean and mostly screaming and the direction has failed. I saw filmmakers of American exploitation during the recent Fangoria Convention. Atkins was one of them. He said there was something important about his work, but after seeing it, I see nothing about import. There is no style, and the terrible video effect (like solar power) only increases amateurism. Not so bad is fun. Avoid.
