Blair's witch-war movie, as much as Bwitch was! The title says everything, save your money and time and spend it on a good movie, such as "From time to time in America", "Shawshank Redemption" or "Enemy at the Gates" (if you want to watch a great "War" movie), etc. <br /> <br /> This movie, when it was a baseball team and big leagues, was the peak and single A was a rookie, then this movie was a high school ball. It was filmed as if it was a high school drama club that filmed his father's old camera. Of course they went to a hostile area (to make a movie), but I don't call it bold, here we call it the usual fool! It's mileage! Now look at it and then tell me what you think.
