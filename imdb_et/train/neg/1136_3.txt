The date of every thirtieth movie is dated, but if you only look at John Ford movies, it seems timed as others. The Grand Hotel is a relatively modern melodrama. There is always someone's fuss with Ford (Abe, Joads). There are always some difficulties to emphasize. Always a badly designed, uncomfortable and obvious script. This is no exception. It's just a fairly belabored device that gives feelings. And what Ford is doing here doesn't know it. <br /> <br /> What Ford is doing here does not give me recognition for Lincoln, but it makes me wonder how countries were still solved by perfect moral inhabitants. Ford continued with decent films. It's too late to be anything but bad. It seems completely wrong. <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda with a fake word is odd. And no one from Illinois would say "S" nor say "Shonuff!"
