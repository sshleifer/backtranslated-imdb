I have to tell you right now, I am definitely not the author of Bollywood films and I have only seen a handful. If you have never seen it, start with it! I really liked what I've seen until then, but I just couldn't keep it. I have to tell you that I couldn't finish this movie - it was annoying. Why was it so annoying? <br /> <br /> 1. The movie is labeled "Rambha". He is even more annoying than Jar-Jar Binks - which I would never have believed would have been possible. He is so # @ ^! # Annoying! He spoke with the voice of Falsetto and I think it was supposed to be comic. Instead, he just started to get nervous and wanted him to die ... slowly! His voice, his heroes, and discomfort - he just didn't seem to stick or dominate any scene he was - and he had to die! <br /> <br /> 2. Heroes had an amazing ability to lighten the AK-47 ball. I'm not doing you - there was a scene where a number of unarmed boys took the boys of a small army in their rifle of attack! And again and again, they refrained from taking one bullet and beat the robbers! This made Stallone's activities "Rambo II" everyday! <br /> <br /> 3. The film was so gosh-darn hard, your face and intense - it practically made my brain bleed! Just like the people who made the movie met! Crazy camera corners, INTENSE music and action, action, action ... this movie is clearly meant for a person who can't film a movie and wants almost 100% action. <br /> <br /> 4. The two main characters and their actions and motivations made zero ... nothing! <br /> <br /> Maybe if you are the most frightening and Bollywood fan, you can stand this movie, but for me, I see why it is in the infamous 100 of IMDb's north. Wow ... this movie is bad and heavily bad!
