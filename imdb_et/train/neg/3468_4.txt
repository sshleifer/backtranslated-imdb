The student filmmaker supports the class B actor (delectably diva-ish MOLLY RINGWALD!) To complete the horror film his mother (terribly boring Kylie Minogue!) Tried to do 12 years ago. This is a curious choice of plots, because all Aussie horror blowers know that the genre is unfortunately incomplete in female leaders. The film has this curse because Molly had to kill some murderer in the original set. But he's back because he needs exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people are going to die on the "set". Cut is an Aussie attempt in the modern "slasher", but unfortunately it doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table. In fact, half of Wes Craven's filmography of the 90s is hanging. A lot of movie-name-dragging la "Scream" (except what is Aussie's name-dropping - Jane Campion ... see how it's not so funny) and lots of "it's real" or is this movie "a la" New Nightmare. " Editing is bad, music is annoying, the effect is ridiculous, almost everything is bad about it. Luckily, the film may have a sense of humor: at one point, the well-dressed girl in the movie tells the owner of the house that they are filming, "Don't worry, we treat your house the way it was ours," to which she replies, "it doesn't mean to me, you You look like you live in a dump! "Ha! And Molly's ridiculous liners were enough to not regret it. "Do you have any diet coke here?" (when he is driving a movie profile in the car) and "Does anyone know where to buy a tofu?" (this is the first thing he did) and "Where the hell is my agent?" (oh wait, that's what I thought of him.)
