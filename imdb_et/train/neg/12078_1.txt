I slept 3 times watching this movie. Proven, it's Shakespeare and it takes a certain mindset to be interested or not. However, this film goes beyond any kind of barrier to long soliloquies and what is not, which can prevent many Shakespeare-based songs from being careless. <br /> <br /> The greatest obstacle to this production is the full level of character. Often it is difficult to distinguish between the character and the person who is. I think this movie is in English. Certainly, they could have been the voice actors who could have added a little more drama to these classical literary lines. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult to rate this movie more than 1, although it is based on prejudices maybe age and what seems like a very low budget. However, it is completely painful and boring. If you demand Hamlet, do yourself a favor and read the book again. 1/10
