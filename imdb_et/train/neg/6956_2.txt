Sorry, but every time I see a movie where a woman sucks a man and a man does nothing but hitting, the film loses all credibility. So the new (female) Starbuck immediately destroyed the plot before she even landed (not red). Dirk Benedict was so much more plausible than a sensitive hero than the new age Kattee Sackhoff - whose overturning is likely to be praised as "compelling, exciting, visionary, revolutionary" is a politically correct new call from today's review editors; but in essence it's just a tired, old woman's image with as many terraced houses as the biggest clich√© on the screen in the evening. I can give this series one more shot, but human cartoons alone will not miss me. As James Hilton repeated, "Story, please, give me a story."
