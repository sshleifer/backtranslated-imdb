If I could say that it was better than Gymkata, I felt at least that my money was not wasted. <br /> <br /> Then I saw Steven Segal dead on the ground. <br /> <br /> This movie should look like resurrection in MST 3K. When Santa Claus captures the Marques, Tom Servo's head may explode, wondering what this film can cause. <br /> <br /> There is a very good reason why Kurt Thomas never had a career in film. The writers of this dreck should be forced to wear discs every day of their lives, saying, "Bitch slap we! I was a Gymkata writer."
