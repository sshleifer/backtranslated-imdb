What stinkeroo it turned out !!! At one time, much earlier in his career, Linda Darnell was one of my favorites - no big shakes as an actor, but very nice and pleasant (especially in movies like "Zorro sign" and "blood and sand"), but when I saw this fright , the memories of his golden days quickly disappeared. The story is incredible and fictitious, acting secondary, supportive cast afflicted. I can't think of a smoother result if someone is compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray was supposed to be the most boring leader they could have chosen. This is accompanied by terrible photography (and I don't just refer to color!) Anyone with it must always show.
