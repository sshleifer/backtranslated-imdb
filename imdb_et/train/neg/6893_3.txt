I had great hopes for this movie. The theater monologue is great and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man with a lot of experience and knowledge about films. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of many Belgian films, but this movie is bad. It is absolutely incredible that actors who are 34 are suddenly playing roles with teenagers. "Linguistic games" were terrible and up. Nothing about the film seemed real to me. The end was too deus ex machina for me. <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed and I think I spent an hour and a half of my life.
