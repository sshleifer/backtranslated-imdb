The easiest way to describe this film is satire. Satire's goal is quite high, from the US government to the business world. Nor is it a treacherous satire, but rather silly. <br /> <br /> Think of this movie as a series of Kentucky fried movies, airplanes and police, made with a much smaller budget, not funny. I see how this film is the satire of the 50s and 60s of many sci-fi disasters. I see this film as a big impact on Tim Burton's Martian attacks. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple enough. Genetically modified giant tomatoes go crazy and start attacking people and cities. First, the cover is up and then it blows over the blown war. <br /> <br /> The sound of characters and testimonials in the movie: Lois "Fairchild" (Lois Lane Clone), very ambitious President Spokesman Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (FIA agent who has not worked after the swine bay), useless president ( who seems to be able to sign his name and attack New York), even intuitive congress, buggy marketing manager and Mason team, consisting of obese East German "female" swimmer, scuba diving, crazy World War II paratro and African-American hidden expert (hidden George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler and finally tomato). Did I forget to mention lots and lots of tomatoes? Tomatoes dressed in small tomatoes, giant plastic tomatoes, tomatoes, tomato juice and finally tomatoes are all kinds of tomatoes. <br /> <br /> In addition, you have a few musical numbers. They are not so good and seem to be duplicated. The best voice is the movie theme ("Killer Tomatoes Attack"). It is too memorable and you can finally break or sing publicly. Warn me. <br /> <br /> Most movies are quite amusing and show the absurdity of different real situations and various entertainment genres. I don't think I would be laughed, but mostly smiled and scratched my head. I definitely recommend this movie to fans of B and C films, but only for rent. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
