I couldn't wait to put this movie on my DVD player when I rented it. Then, after I started, I couldn't wait to get it out of my DVD player. In fact, I watched the whole movie. My wife and I waited and waited for something funny to happen, but nothing was ever funny. Such a box as it would be really funny. The prerequisite for the film is good. Ben Stiller is funny. Jack Black is funny. How did this movie stay? Well .... it won't miss! This is the most unusual "comedy" I've ever watched. Someone I have been thinking about was a little funny. It's just a very flat film. Trust me. Open it .... OPEN IT!
