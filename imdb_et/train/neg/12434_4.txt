In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed "planes, trains and cars", a fun and poignant comedy? the best thing he ever did is. Ten years after he has reused the Home Alone plot in another order that is not linked to other films, but is unused and sadistic. Four crooks? that's right, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for this revolutionary change! ? are electro-metal chairs, barbelled and blinded, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new baby is even less charming than Culkin. You think the departure of almost all the first players in the first movie would stop Hosses from fossilizing the same old routines, but the only surprise is that even he didn't turn home "Home Alone 4".
