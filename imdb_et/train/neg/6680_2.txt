Wow what snoozer. Certainly one of the worst films in the bacon. Bad action with a formative, if not incredible, script makes me miss the time I was wasting my time watching cable TV. I can't say much about it, basketball scouting goes too far to the person to whom it recruits, who happens to belong to the tribe that happens on the brink of war that happens (spoiler) with basketball. Rating: F +
