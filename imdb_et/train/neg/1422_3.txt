The original series of Lensman's novels is a classic genre. It's a pure adventure with some SF material (here and there) and I've always wondered why Hollywood hasn't literally filmed it because it's just the kind of thing they love: massive explosions, super weapons, uber-heroes, hero girl , aliens (great CGI potential), good versus evil in a cleaner form, and so on. etc. Instead (and keep in mind that I am a Japanese-o-ph and anime lover) we get this terrifying kiddies movie that robs the guts out of stories, mixes pastels and fools in Star-Wars (ironically, when the latter hangs from books occasionally) the whole thing to the "Thundercats" level. Kimball for seeing Real Estate is powerful (the image of a galaxy patrol officer and a second boy Lensman as a little boy). I just don't understand why the makers did it because they obviously had the right story and they could have made much more money (FAR!) By saying straight. It's not logical.
