This is not a bad film. The plot (building a new house seems to be haunting) is not bad, the mood is creepy and the actor is fine. The big problem I had was that, being familiar with Lara Flynn Boyle (Twin Peaks and other exhibitions), I couldn't get over how different she could see for her new big lips. I looked at them again. They look like your face! They make their look completely different (and not better). Mark-Paul Gosselaar, an actor who plays the Kimi architect who designs and casts his heart and soul into the house, does a good job. And Lara (as Col) is also quite good (but these lips!) The owner of the neighbor's house. His wife Walker (Colin Ferguson) is appropriately wood. There were also different characters living in the house. I especially liked Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and his wife Buddy (Stephen Amell), the first people to get into the house. Attempting to involve us in the overall neighborhood leads, unfortunately, because other neighbors do not like it very much. <br /> <br /> The President could not make the "haunting" house particularly exhausting for some reason. Other movies (such as Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House) can make this horrible feeling, but it just won't happen. The closest thing is when Col paints a house image. <br /> <br /> Another thing that didn't work for me is the plot twist that happens to architect Kim. Initially, he seems to be the victim of another house (he has sucked him into inspiration), but later he seems to have joined evil. <br /> <br /> Generally not a bad movie for horror fans if you can take your eyes off these big lips!
