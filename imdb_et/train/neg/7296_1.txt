Columbo's films have been down for years, this year it has reached the bottom. Peter Falk gives the same kind of provoked presentation and is so scary in this movie. As this series is normal, crime position protocols are outrageous, so reliability is always lacking. Brenda Vaccaro looks at the landscape and pulls the face of the pantomime, and Andrew Stephens is a pretty convincing wife. (His weak was hoot!) The script was numbered and patronizing it. They should never bring Columbo into the nineties, but left us all with a pleasant memory of smart plots, better scripts and sharp features.
