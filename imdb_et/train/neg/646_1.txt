I saw this movie randomly and this movie was an accident ... well it must be. The blonde women complained then disappear when disappear disappears, and it disappears from one place to another, then disappears and restarts, hiding.he was'nt even a super hero, so I don't know how he did it. cat and it's not hard to do. <br /> <br /> The old "mirror in the bathroom" is no longer scary because it actually stopped scary years ago. you were a cop villain, another cliché (played by idris with a very convincing American accent, he is from London) that the director had no idea and he made a cliché full of film and make a "scary move" that was frightening to look at COMEDY.
