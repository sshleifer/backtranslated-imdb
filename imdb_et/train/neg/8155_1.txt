I prefer Robin Williams in his more serious roles (eg Good Will Hunting, The Fisher King, The Garp). These are my favorite movies. But day-to-day, though well-functioning, is one of the worst films I've ever seen and certainly the worst Robin Williams movie (even worse than Smoochy's death, Club Paradise and Alladin). Every good story has its ups and downs. However, this movie is one giant. I don't need a good Hollywood cheese party, but I need nothing more than 90 minutes of complete and complete hopelessness. This movie reminds me of "Love Liza" (which is actually worse) because it seems that the only point in the movie is to see how far one person can fall. Answer? Who cares.
