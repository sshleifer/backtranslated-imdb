At one point, Violet (Lucy Liu) tells Cillian Murphy why she is constantly looking for an adventure. He said, "Because I'm on the road." This means that he cannot actually go on with his life by doing certain obligatory activities. Well, I think his reason and the way this film goes is very ironic. Because "Detective Watching" is a joyful boredom. <br /> <br /> Are any of these characters exciting? They have a geek who drives their very little video opportunity. He and his other geek friends usually get around the store and watch movies together, discussing them later. But Neil's life has been completely reversed when Violet walks into her shop. She is an eccentric woman who hides her little secret. Anyway, they decide to see each other after a date. The problem with Violet is the person who continues to do Nile's and can't really do anything normal, while they have the opposite of him. The question is. Are they finally in love? You bet. <br /> <br /> "Detective Watching" is the romantic comedy of the clich√© at its core. And they made it even worse than pretending to be something else. We know from the first couple of designs that they have a rather modest man who didn't take anything for himself. And then, Violet enters the scene, looking at everything weird and annoying. So, we know now that we are sitting in all nonsense situations to find out how they end up. Is it worth the wait? I would say no. <br /> <br /> As I said, they tried to give the audience more. "Tracking Followers" is trying to talk about dedication. Watch how far people go to achieve what they want. Finally, we knew that Violet's crazy things are all about how far they are willing to win their heart (or whatever). Well, I think it's totally funny. This movie ends pretty soon when they just said to themselves, "Forget this girl, this girl is a nut!" After co-operating with many big directors recently (Danny Boyle's "Sunshine" and "28 Days Later", Ken Loach's "Wind Shaking Barley" and some Nil Jordan's "Breakfast Pluto" name), Cillian has a rather strange selection of Murphy's movie one Broken Lizard comedian Paul Soter. In any case, he is not bad (as usual), but such a talent as an actor as he should not waste his time in such a movie. On the other hand, Lucy Liu is terribly terrible as Violet. His behavior is confusing. I mean, it's all over and up. Tony Montana would have been proud. <br /> <br /> The last, but no less important, thing about the movie is the totally irrelevant title. You just can't really connect a point between a graph and its title; and then you think it's not worth it. In short, "Watching Detectives" is a delightful film that you may have the opportunity to have on cable TV so quickly that you could not imagine. <br /> <br /> BloodyMonday Rating: 1.5 / 4
