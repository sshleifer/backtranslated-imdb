Where to start ?! . . . I feel ... spoiled! That's right, spoiled! I just spent 1.5 hours of my life, 1.5 hours so I could have spent more useful things like drying the paint on a so-called horror blow. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, not funny, it's not dramatic, it's not anything, it's nothing ... <br /> <br /> Its predictable, boring, tragic ... <br /> <br /> I can be a little tough here, but watch this movie and you will feel the same ... or ... no, don't look at it ... if you don't want to ruin yourself.
