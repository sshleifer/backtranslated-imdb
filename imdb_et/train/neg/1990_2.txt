It can be a strong candidate for "Halvim Flick Ever". Perhaps without John Hurt's presence it could be tolerated as a child's film. But the whole thing about TRAGEDY is that John Hurt, one of the biggest players on the screen, is losing himself in it .... I just gave him two points just because Mr. Hurt WILL ... I'll take eight points because he didn't run enough fast. As for the rest, they are just terrible. Janine Turner, as beautiful as she may be, cannot save her soul. And the leading player is for all intentions and AWFUL. If you can save this embarrassment, please do so. It's so bad that almost HURTS.
