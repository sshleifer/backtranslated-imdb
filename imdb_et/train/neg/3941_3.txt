This happens when you live in China and the local video shop works thinly in English headlines. You are blessed with the work that seems to be so, Romanian cinema. However, I think it has a real comedy potential. <br /> <br /> Spoilers follow technically: <br /> <br /> Although I don't think it really would jeopardize the joy of looking at someone, why the movie in the casino also has beach archery, even upside down. This mystery and many other congresses are out of desperate comics, perhaps when they are stuck in Bucharest. <br /> <br /> Allow me to wonder why people with a very good look will allow themselves to abuse such a movie. It is sad.
