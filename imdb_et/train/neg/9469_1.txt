Audrey, I know you really love the memory of Ted's husband, but PLEASE do your heritage and listen to his desires. Dr Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for very good reasons. We ask you to stop invading your stories, pictures, fantasies and characters. They get the powers of Hollywood and Broadway open. Tomorrow's children will stick with these hysterical and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of their books. <br /> <br /> It's really your asset you want to do. I just want you to consult others for a while. Save Dr Seuss. Thank you.
