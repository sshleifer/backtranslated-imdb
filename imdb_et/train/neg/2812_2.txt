I recently saw this movie at a film festival. This is the romance of a former alcoholic man who just came out of a major depression and a middle-aged woman working at the Employment Office (INEM). I found this story very simple and full of clich√©s, taking the "social" theme of the movie and making it a romantic comedy. The leading player did a good job, he certainly looks like an alcoholic man, but Ana Belen is not a working-class woman, she sees, acts and talks about a very high level woman. I mean, Ana Belen is playing herself. He does it in any of his films anyway. The whole scene of the movie was very bad. Photography is ugly, not using all panoramic relationships. The dialogue sounds completely written and dull at most times. The comic situations are typical of Gomez Family, but in this case they are not funny and solved badly. In my opinion, this movie is not worth watching. Only if you really love Pereira's previous movies, you can enjoy it a bit. Anyway I walked out of the theater because I felt like I was wasting my time. The filmmaker was behind the door. I don't know what a director feels when he sees someone walking out of one of his films, especially what's made for everyone.
