W. Somerset Maugham's of Human Bondage should be a classic of English. If that is the case, the film format must be lost a lot here. Phillip's (Leslie Howard's) entertainment to Mildred (Bette Davis) is so inexplicable that the scenario seems to be a post-breakup retention attitude from a human point of view. As a family lawyer, I've heard many such accounts; The man is humble and always correct, and the woman is a hellion who has no other purpose than to use a man. <br /> <br /> Indeed, if someone does not want to laugh at a socially prized filmmaker, this is an uncomfortable film to watch. Phillip even allows Mildred to bring a child of indefinite paternity, but the true highest point comes when Phillip promises Mildred - rage and now suspicious of peace - with his apartment's freely predictable results. Bette Davis was attractive for about five years of her life, but this period didn't happen. In fact, at the end of the film, he looks a lot like Baby Jane, whom he played thirty years later. <br /> <br /> I note how Howard's character is always dressed and well-groomed. This tells me that Phillip craves for middle class respect. No one could run fast enough with a Cockney accent woman. Phillip is a student for most movies; such a person would have been more credible if he had been younger and had an unpleasant look that would speak of low income and low self-esteem, often accompanied by student status - English Raskolnikov, as he does. And balanced, allowing Mildred to charm.
