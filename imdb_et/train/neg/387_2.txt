The question is whether at any point in the production of this film there was a script with any thought. Was the rough cut 3 hours long <br /> <br /> long and it was cut into inconsistent confusion that survives? <br /> <br /> Why should someone finance this confusion? I say that Tom <br /> <br /> Wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can with the dialogue and dramatic (?) Situations he has given. But <br /> <br /> characters do not come for obvious reasons, continuity is non-existent, and action, cinematography, and direction are up to <br /> <br /> give it courtesy. <br /> The choice of title, as it probably turns out to be wrong for someone <br /> <br /> to actually watch this movie.
