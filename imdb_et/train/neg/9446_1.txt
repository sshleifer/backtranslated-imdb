A totally terrible adaptation of the wonderful children's book. Raw and inappropriate humor, some frightening parts, and a bad glimpse of the mother's boyfriend wanting to send a boy to a military school to get him out of the way, makes it unsuitable for kids who are likely to want to see it, because they are in the book (3-8). Don't waste your money, time or good judgment.
