I am writing this review, having looked at it several months ago .... the trailer seemed to me enough to buy this flat apology for the movie. This is a complete joke .... and literally is spitting on the real classic that has been a previous horror like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974). A producer who played Brandon should go burgers and serve fatty hamburgers .... he may not even be good in hell! The illumination was a bad bad bad and a big movie of outrage, not even seen by the actor's face. I don't even remember the rest of the cast members who are sad really, bad that they never do anything to impress you. It's all the time I waste this review. PLEASE stay as far as you can with this trash, even if you get it for 25 cents, don't do it if you buy at least a piece of rubber. br /> <br /> If you want high quality, low budget fun, much better than that ... then check out Jeff Hayes' movie .... because it takes talent to do that fear and the kid is it! <br /> <br /> I gave this 1 star only to cover art .... this is the only thing worth paying for the so-called "movie" <br /> <br /> -Rick Blalock
