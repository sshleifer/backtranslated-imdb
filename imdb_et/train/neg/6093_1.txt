It must be a WORST movie I've ever seen. I bought a DVD and it didn't work well, the DVD worked well, its just a movie wasn't really so bad that I don't think the participants haven't worked (or before deciding). There is no real plot to talk about and a real horror. Production values ​​are garbage even for a low budget film, which makes it difficult for the microphone to hear some external costs due to wind. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was such a bad film that the viewer thought it would not improve (which has been an improvement), it will become a porn. There are only two lines in the film that are funny, both rotating around the transvestite prostitute. (Although they hardly watch everybody for 76 minutes) <br /> <br /> With regard to DVD marketing, I feel deeply deceptive. I mean, I read back, I was expecting it was bad: <br /> <br /> He chose his weapons. He chose his victims. She chose her nose. She became a girl! <br /> <br /> But I thought it might be funny. The case also states that it has been digitally trained, I would like to see it in advance, the print is so grainy that you can use it as sandpaper. The case also says that it is an absolute disgust with the film WHAT'S IT? to say buy a "bad taste" instead of it is a much better movie and is funny too, this is Peter Jackson Director LOTR in it.) about what they have done, please post here as i know to find out if there is a worse movie or if someone in this movie has ever worked hard to learn to act
