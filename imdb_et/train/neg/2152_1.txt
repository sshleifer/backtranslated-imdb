this movie is trying to be tremendously clever and Tarantino-like <br /> <br /> <br /> before you try it, but you need strong movie basics. they include good sound, editing, configured design, etc. <br /> <br /> lets you speak the sound of this movie. absolutely cruel. I've never been more annoyed with the soundtrack before we talk about low budgets, movies in Chile, and so on. Let's remember that these days' desert sound is much more achievable than it ever was. everywhere. and more information about techniques can ever be available. <br /> <br /> The sound of this movie is just bad. Especially foley is inappropriate and inappropriate, the atmosphere is just as terrible. I heard at least four loud clicks during the movie due to poor audio editing. the sound inside the car is awful, closing the car doors is terrible. The lady's song sound is wrong. Foley is either overboard or just not there as the sound person just bored and gave up. the rooms are wrong. all of this is wrong <br /> <br /> and nevertheless, creativity constraints don't let you go, while trying to boldly make the movie smart. for example, aquarium sound is used in the next street picture. we hear the sound if we don't have to. audio editing is preceded by visual cuts. every trick is used in the print, but the foundations are not in the editing process - we have scenes with smart jumps, we have time zones, etc. etc. all these techniques are perfectly imitated to a low level. <br /> <br /> In general, the mix is ​​mixed, the sound is crap. and so, the movie is nonsense. how can a lot of fundamental mistakes be considered for prizes and high praise? Chilean film new wave? the best creative outputs Chile offers? I hope not, and I don't think so. <br /> <br /> My theory is that Chile's more selective and better talent ruled out a movie like a plague, perhaps because of its risqué content. the film is also likely to have received so many unjustified critical accolades from so-called world cinema enthusiasts with the same grubby reasons. they will most likely rejoice in this trashiness. Of course, film critics rarely pay attention to technical details and quality. <br /> <br /> This movie is a garbage. it is all foot and pants and never worth 6.8 rating. the movie has all cheap tarantino output quality, new wave inspired porn!
