I just finished a book about Anita Loose's work and a photo of TCM Magazine in MacDonald's costume of her angel appeared (impressive wings) so I thought I'd watch this movie. I wouldn't have heard of the movie before, so I had no idea of ​​it. I thought it was cute to start with Eddy like playboy and MacDonald as a secretary he doesn't know. The scene in which she appeared to the costume party in her simple angel dress, with a non-cooperating halo and wings that wouldn't survive, was really pleasant. I was even in the movie when Eddy sleeps and depicts him as a real angel. But after a while it started to break down for me. Eddy remains "rest of sleep" with the rest of the movie, so it's all a dream. Whatever happens from there is not really important, because he just dreams. The rest was pretty little and pointless. I had to force myself to stay. And the final number where MacDonald goes from a musical number to a musical number in some madness in hallucination was just cool. <br /> <br /> Eddy was "awakened" earlier and the original story continued, or he was really married to the angel I think it would have been much more interesting. I wanted to see more of his real character. <br /> <br /> Musical numbers were not really musical enough. The first few songs were good, but MacDonald's jitterbug number was like a nail plate. Absolutely wrong with his operative voice. However, Eddy and MacDonald can shine, showing what the real stars were.
