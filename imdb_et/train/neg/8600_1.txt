In all with low budget history. this movie must be one of the worst. True, there are some humorous aspects of the film, but in general it was just terrible. I just don't understand what a person couldn't get out of. I mean, they have to be one of the slowest beings in the world. The only part that is worthy of this film is the slip that tries to bite the human finger. It was quite fun.
