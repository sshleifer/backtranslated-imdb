After watching waking up, I pointed to the conclusion that the director and screenwriter Joby Harold woke up to laugh at the spectator, because the film is full of ridiculous elements. absurd and ridiculous elements (for example the hospital coincides with the spirit of the main character ... did the doctor's ghost leave it on the floor?). The concept of this film is a bit brilliant, but all the holes and absurd things on the plot make it a stupid and crazy movie. Except for the great Lena Olin, all the actors are performing bad performances. Hayden Christensen has zero expressions and the same applies to Jessica Alba. The extraordinary actor Terrence Howard has a role for him.Awake makes a laugh at the spectator. It's so ridiculous and full of absurd things that it's impossible to take it seriously. My suggestion is: leave this crappy movie.
