A boring, predictable and interesting story about a person polluted by a chemical substance (Weller) who goes across the country to find a former woman and children; in the meantime, he kills everything on his way with just one hand. The doctor (Hurt) and the young reporter (Natasha) are trying to stop the man on his dangerous path. The film does not have the original assumption, but although it may be much better. The end result is just a movie that has no intercourse or sharp moments. Even good cast is completely waste. I'll give it 4 (four).
