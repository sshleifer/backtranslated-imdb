Power rangers are definitely the worst TV show in the history of the United States and a completely ridiculous line of plastic toys. <br /> <br /> This totally dreaded TV show is far from being entertained. <br /> <br /> It's just the worst show ever made, with terrible actors, dressed in multi-colored spandex gear that looks absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The owners of this exhibition should be ashamed because there is no meaning for redemption. <br /> <br /> Today's kids should try to see better exhibitions like Toy Story movies instead of this garbage.
