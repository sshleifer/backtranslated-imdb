This amazing waste of money is a film-based proof that rich and famous can be as stupid and wasteful as politicians. Tennessee Williams (silly) and Joseph Losey (dead-handed) and Taylor-Burton-Noel cowboy project - this project that has been filmed on a cliff-island in the Mediterranean must be a sure-fire winner when presented to Universal in 1967. year. The result is so absurd and tedious that it almost believes. Visually, the film is remarkable, but it is the force of nature that has promised a set of setup and real home use. Taylor, Burton's sleep sleeping, loony dialogue, Noel Coward, laughs at himself, a ridiculous story and plot equipment, and an absurd costume just irritates the viewer. BOOM is a shameful waste of money and talent and clear evidence that famous famous people can be idiots like the rest of the planet. Not even fun. Just terrible and crazy shocking waste.
