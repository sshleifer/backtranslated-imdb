I don't know what Brady's kids are. First of all, Barry Williams publicly says he has sexy with his TV sister, Maureen McCormick, then getting to know her TV mother, Florence Hederson. Then Susan (Cindy) Olsen makes music a bunch of movie films. Then Mike (Bobby) Lookinland gets in trouble for drunk driving. Finally, Maureen (Marcia) McCormick and Eve (Jan) Plum could have a little bit of a generation. Now, Christopher (Peter) Knight is engaged in a beautiful younger model in the early 1920s, which was his "Surreal Life", which was originally fun to watch, and now they are married and in a very unstable and hostile relationship. . The last episode in which he put a bunch of naked photos with another naked girl to give Christopher a guest book for his birthday was not a good step for him. And he treated it in a very mature way, just by picking up and leaving. I think he always worshiped his all-encompassing need and now he will finally accept it. And I hate to say this, but I think he's abusing him orally. How he tortured him on the engagement ring and how he did it for every little thing. He also speaks openly about flights with other women, and it is obvious that he sleeps with her women and men, which is not something every self-respecting person should do as someone already married. If it were a man who speaks to his wife like this and goes out every night to have fun with other people, everyone would have traveled behind the woman. Why it should be different. What started with a cute little drunk with another reality show flourished with a huge disaster. Adrianne, as beautiful as she is, is like another Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, who probably need some treatment because she cries like a child over so many stupid things. I am sorry for him, but Chris has to get rid of him because he is a good man who cannot afford such humiliation.
