I read that "My soup girl" appeared in the low season of Peter Sellers. When I watch the film, I am not surprised. Nothing happens in the movie. It seems that the presence of the seller and Goldie Hawn should help the film; this is not. The whole movie seems to have just been filming randomly what happened without scripting. Maybe I haven't seen every movie from medieval and older people trying to be hippies, but it does give such movies a pretty bad name. <br /> <br /> All in all, both sellers and Hawn are much better off movies, so don't waste your time. Pretty worthless.
