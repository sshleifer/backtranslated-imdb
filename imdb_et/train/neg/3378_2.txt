By the time this movie was released, I had seen 4 times in Chorus Line's production and had been unexpectedly waiting for the production of the movie for a long time. My wife and I were in the box office before the movie's opening day. It was not just disappointment, it was a stomach in the stomach. First, the story "moved outside", so it contained scenes that were not theater boundaries. These boundaries are a great part of the story of meaning and influence. <br /> <br /> Second and Third Together (Set Your Order): One of the original songs with a dynamic dance number was removed; A story that was not in production was added. Say what ??? I'm confused! <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie 2 instead of one is my admiration for the talent and hard work of performers. I have now seen the 6th stage of Chorus Line and did not want to see it 6 more times before I die. It is wonderfully written, with great music and conscientiously true stories. If you want to see music that includes a great "cattle talk", I recommend it all. If you want to see the story of "Chorus Line", watch it on stage.
