Lorne Michaels proves once again that she has no film production. <br /> <br /> You would think that after such a terrible flip "Superstar", "Roxbury Night" and "Coneheads" begin to realize that maybe he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to movies (and many claim that he does not know what he is doing on television). In an attempt to make feature films from a sketch that greeted them for the third time, SNL had no idea. <br /> <br /> I like Tim Meadows personally and I think he would be good in a good movie. It is a shame to see a talented man who is wasting a movie that is unlikely after an unlikely situation, and it all limits it to a terribly bad song and dance picture. All laughs are here because the movie is so bad, not because it's funny. <br /> <br /> Well, at least we can be grateful that there are many other tired SNL characters who never have made movies about them. Too bad it made it on a big screen.
