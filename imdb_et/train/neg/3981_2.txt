This movie really does not start or end. And it is really incredible. Mary-K and Ashley should be on the Internet working in the post office of an Italian fashion company. But for some reason, they are placed in a 5-star hotel (conveniently located across the street from the Coliseum), and all the other trainees they work on are as unusual as the model eyes they are. One of the things I found in this film is obviously how one of the twins can't reach the guy. I think they tried to twist their normal plot a little. Good test.
