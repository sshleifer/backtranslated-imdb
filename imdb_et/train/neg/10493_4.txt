Hard movie to categorize. I never gave it a 110% concentration, and as simple as the plot appeared, I couldn't tell exactly what exactly did what the American FBI characters did and what their roles were. Nor could I take Irwins seriously as a movie if their lines and scenes were all in his show style, not working. <br /> <br /> This is nothing more than to show the worship episode of Discovery TV, where there is a predominantly insignificant subset that just seemed to be on the way. But as every Irwin show is always worth, this film is also worth it, but not on Christmas Day. Speaking of it, I'm also better off than here. <br /> <br /> High 4/10
