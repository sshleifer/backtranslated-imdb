ALL FOR LOVE (if it is titled weekend) is a romantic journalist with Captain Saint Ives's French officer, Napoleon's army, who has been arrested by the British and imprisoned in Scotland, where he meets and loves a young girl visiting prison. There's also a story about the murder. <br /> <br /> I am honest and admit that the movie was not taken too much, because I am not a fan of many timings and fans. somewhat episodic, but I say it is done by everyone involved and got a good cast with Miranda Richardson, Anna Friel, Richard E Grant, Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs. Designing a costume, as you can expect, is also great <br /> <br /> I'm very surprised if this movie gets no complaints after sending BBC2 in the theater. Captain Saint Ives is in a prostitute bed where the nipple is fully exposed and there is a scene of French prisoners that includes full front male nudity, not to mention a place of murder where blood is clearly visible. You really have to worry if the BBC planners have any idea what they are doing
