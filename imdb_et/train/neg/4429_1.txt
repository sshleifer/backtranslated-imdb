Which piece of stupid piglet. <br /> <br /> I don't even waste time on evaluating any point in this show. It's not worth the time. One comment I make is - why get such a DUMB, inocular doofus, to be a star?!? <br /> <br /> There's not much more unpleasant testimonials about the deteriorating mental state of networks than the fact that FOX has said he doesn't produce John Doe (a decent series) but brings back brain-dead fingers like Joe Millionaire another round of American cell brain killing. <br /> <br /> FOX has lost it, IMHO.
