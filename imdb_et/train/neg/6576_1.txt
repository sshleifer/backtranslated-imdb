I disagreed with the comments that said it was a good movie. It's a completely SUCKED movie. I mean SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. The story is strange. Mia Kirshner turned the innocent girl into a party-catching chick for no convincing reason. In addition, all the actors were too old for college students - college students saw about 30 years old - you get the rest. I only looked at the first ten minutes and started looking for sex scenes quickly. all sexual scenes are flat, hurrying and most importantly not at all frontal. All sex scenes are ridiculous, considering how many clothes they had. Do it yourself - put it down and save a few dollars. Conclusion: Story - 0, Sex - 0, Action - 0, Score - 0 out 10.
