As a long-time fan of the entire Star Trek series, I found this disappointing episode and I don't know if using liberal "setbacks" with Will Riker's exploitation, both positive (and largely romantic) and negative (a lot of pain, and the death of a team worker) was money a sustainable device, as well as many of their "bottle displays" (episodes where all scenes take place in the company). Diana Muldaur (who also appeared at least twice in the original series) deserved a better final appearance than her character, dr. Kate Pulaski. Loyal viewers (in the world of Star Trek, are there other types?) They were also short. It was the last episode of the second season; so the "not bang" season ended, but "forged".
