Zombie Review # 3 <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Few movies are actually "so bad they're good" and Zombie 3 isn't just bad, it's terrible, undeniably bad in so many ways that maybe you need a whole new language to describe them all. <br /> <br /> More than that, it is a film credited to Lucio Fulci, that even his standards have no coherence, meaning or reason. However, we cannot blame Fulc because he was not actually led by him, but by Bruno Mattei, who is not even Fulci's sense of style to wear the film. Mattei seems to have brought a little film but an amazing failure. <br /> <br /> So I'm ashamed to tell you how much I enjoyed every valuable Zombie in 3 minutes. It has no redemption properties - due to the lack of thin characters, a weak story and a lack of filmmaking skills in a well-known genre, Zombi pushes out 3 boats, but doing so is even more fun than Nightmare City. <br /> <br /> "Action" begins when "Death 1" gas is stolen from a military base and damaged by escape. Who is the thief, why did he steal it and why did the US military think that creating a cannibalistic legion of living dead would be a good idea? All these questions and other things do not correspond to Zombie 3. <br /> <br /> After the hotel has been hidden, the infected thief is crazy about all of his growing green blemish by the army, who somehow foolishly decides that his body is the best way is its burning, sent to the "Death 1" atmosphere, resulting in ... zombie birds! Who then attacks people and makes them zombie people !!! (if zombies are cannibals, why don't zombie birds just attack other birds?) <br /> <br /> Then we will meet our "heroes", the horny GI trio and the girls' burden. They also have a few other men, but they are not important - no one is important here. It is difficult for you to push to remember someone's face, not to mention their name, or to find a reason to take care of them. Finally, they are hidden in the same hotel as a thief ("a week ago this place was buzzing with life, now it's a flop!"), But Undead can't be accessed. <br /> <br /> The point where you are completely sucked or you have turned off a fucking thing. The script is so terrible that the world's biggest actor couldn't save it, so it's just as good as having the worst - and not just human characters, the zombie here is all-time low. There is no consistency in the behavior of the zombies - somewhat timed blur, others are totally fighting fists or competing with machines, not to mention the zombies that still can talk (a trick that gives the movie its TWIST ENDING HORRIFICATION). They die on the chest (rather on the head) and even strike a good left hook. How can a zombie be pulled out ??? !!!!! In fact, the emphasis on doing badly done 80s often resembles the V episode. <br /> <br /> Zombies also spend a lot of time hiding unexpectedly poor juice in a couple of weeks and passing through their fears. They are in bushes, garages, houses, roofs, water and even pregnant women. At one point, the zombie woman follows up the stairs. To kill him and eat? No! To push him into the water, these zombies and their crazy sense of humor! The limbs are hacked, the wounds eat green rot and there is a lot of meat eating and people get their face in there. There is nothing that would fit with the original eyeball holes, but if a bad make-up is your bag, you won't let it in your bag. , as really bad, or final cooling. Zombie 3 gives the original radio stations genomic twists zombies crossing the actual zombie DJ! "He's gone over his side!" our fleeing hero crying before we begin to fight against the Undead in the aftermath that unfortunately never came. <br /> <br /> Zombie 3 is a garbage - it would not be a loss for the world if every print is destroyed and all records of its existence are deleted, but somehow I feel that my life is richer to see it. <br /> <br /> Did I say richer? I was thinking 88 minutes shorter ...
