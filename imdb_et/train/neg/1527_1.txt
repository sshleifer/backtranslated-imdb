If you really want to waste two hours of your life, do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Review TV shows. 2) Find the movie "Men in White". 3) When "Men in White" is on, sit and watch. <br /> <br /> And that's it. After two hours of fraud, terrible (and not funny) references and anything that may have been done with the smallest production values ​​in recent times, two hours of your life have been wasted and you wonder why. br /> <br /> Why did I do that? I was stupid enough to think this movie might be good. But that was not the case. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are old enough to remember Power Rangers, you may encounter some familiar faces during the movie. Probably saving on production costs, Saban (who also produces Power Rangers) decided to freely sprinkle old movie costumes from everyone's favorite sticky toy spinning franchise throughout the film. I watched quite a few old monsters of the episodes I saw when I was a boy, so I think at least one could say that it has some nostalgia value. <br /> <br /> But if you want to see the true power of Ranger's monsters, look at your Power Rangers. It's much better than this garbage. (And it says something!)
