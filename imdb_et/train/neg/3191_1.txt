There are films that are terrible, and there are movies that are so terrible that they are considered to be long unforgettable and invisible. There is also a lot of confusion and bad things (not just cheesy stuff; you know what I mean). What is the result of bad movies with such dirty content? Why, "ultimate justice", of course! <br /> <br /> Remember "Mitchell?" Joe Don Baker was the star of this movie and Joel and Bot were riffling this "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Now this time, when Mike took Joel's place on the Satellite of Love (but with the same bots), the trio MST3K received another Joe Don Baker movie "Final Justice". Of course, many naughty things I mentioned were removed for television, but I still want to watch this episode (and also "Mitchell") because what Joe Don "hates" the most? Why, nothing more than the "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> P.S. If you have a large number of large batches near you, make sure the unsaved tape is saved! LOL It happened to another user!
