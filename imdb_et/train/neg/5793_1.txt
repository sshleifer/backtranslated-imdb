It was really so bad. Parallel (graciously!) Short-lived "Dirty Dozen" TV series that played with Ben Murphy and were made at the same time (also cheap in Yugoslavia). <br /> <br /> I was embarrassed by the majority of this movie - and especially Telly Clay. He was too old and greasy (pushing 70 when he made the garbage), and a reviewer who draws parallels with Telly's Greek and John Wayne's "The Green Berets" adds a lot to it. Other reviewers have pointed to some of the ridiculous generations that this anti-cellulosic crime contains, so I won't repeat them here. But I add that I am surprised that somebody has not mentioned a ridiculously little look that Savalas carries with his large, swollen head. <br /> <br /> I am also surprised that the trajectory of this movie in IMDb is estimated to be 4.7. <br /> <br /> I'm worried that this is "1" across the board. If you want a good example of why the death of a franchise to death is really a bad idea (especially 20 years after the original) - look no further than "The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission". <br /> <br /> Awful - Avoid !!!!
