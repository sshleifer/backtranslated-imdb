For some strange reason, the film world is in fashion. Somebody makes a movie about killer sharks, maybe the oceans of the film world are giant squid, killer octopus and every amber. The man is spoken by the bachelor of hell, who is a coward or hell or a babysitter in every film player. When a big Hollywood company produces a large-budget FX-blocked blockade of tornadoes, other filmmakers jump over wagons because they don't have the budget to pull it out, they won't stop them. EXAMPLE TWISTERS is an example. What I did to the television film is that he is trying to hide his budget deficit by interrupting ad breaks. Every time a tornado comes up, camara locks up with the frightening expression of the actors because they scream such things as "Oh my gawd it`s doing it" and "Run for your life", then the screen disappears black, saving manufacturers the need for special effects budgets. Unfortunately, twice the budget had to involve better participants. The cast is by no means bad, but they are unimpressive and lack the skills to carry a film that is characteristically driven. Where's Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need them? <br /> <br /> And the last word in it is the TWISTER clone ..... Yes, NOTT appeared a few months before TWISTER, but TWISTER was Hyped for several months in the Summer Blockbuster of 1996 and NOTT has this hurry , which makes me believe it's done and released to associate with TWISTER.
