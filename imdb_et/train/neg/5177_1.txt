It's so bad, so very bad. Operation is the biggest joke in history. Don't even bother to see it, I did it in 20 minutes and it was finally the same disappointment as in the beginning ... I really don't understand people's taste, I'm a horror movie fan and I am not demanding but I have a limit! Perhaps this quarter was better than the start of Hoast, but that is the case. So I suggest that you don't waste 15 minutes that you can watch. I mean, monkeys are better off acting. And with the older role the big brother is just terrible. Do they not pay for C-films? No, I have to say that this is not the first time I think the horror movie is bad, but it is one of my ten films and it is the vampire portrait, the Cabin by the lake, The Hoast!
