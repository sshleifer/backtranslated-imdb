Chris, a child of a moral family who is a loser who works in Kate's newspaper (Christine Lakin has now succeeded in the now awesome "Step by Step" show from the ABC TGIF structure), finds that he is just a pornographic empire from his biological parents. She loses sight of what true friendship and love are and blah blah is some other pointless. He also has to fight against his uncle who wants to control a family business and a horrible lawyer (aren't they?) A bit below the average teen comedy that steals better teen comedies (just opening is a GREAT American pie), puts you on the head with morals for all sorts of opportunities, and wastes the only talent he has (Wayne Newton, Lin Shaye, and when I really starve, Martin Starr "Freaks and Geeks" and Justin Berfield "Malcolm in the middle"). It is not exactly bad, but it is far from good. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Some Extras Get Topless <br /> <br /> My Class: C- <br /> <br /> Where Did I See: Starz on Demand (Available until September 29 )
