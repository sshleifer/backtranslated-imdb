It was a disappointing film for me. It came to me in a clipped set called "Classic Film Noir" which was a gift from someone who knows that I usually enjoy movies made in such a style (I demand that noir is a style, not a genre). I don't think it's a movie at all. It seems that these days there is a tendency to label and market every black and white B-film made in 1947-1955. There is a persecuted male protagonist, Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb) and most of the film's activities take place indoors. These are almost the only elements I saw. There is no common paranoia and no real reason why Ed Cullen should give sympathy. Jane Wyatt was overdressed and convincing as a femme fatale. I don't want to spoil this movie for potential viewers. But I would be interested in what the other movie twins say about it.
