I usually try to build critically well-criticized film criticism, but I can't believe it went past the script stage. Dialogue is terrible, acting very annoying, the accents are just awful and the direction and pace is at best dirty. <br /> <br /> I don't remember the last time I saw the movie pretty bad. Joseph Fiennes, as he is, can just kill his career as quickly as possible. <br /> <br /> Doctor Moreau Island was not inferior to this garbage.
