I still can't believe this movie. They got so many incredible things in it that it is hard to believe that anyone wanted to do it. <br /> <br /> The story is a joke, but in the sense that it is funny, but rather not a story at all. How can you mix up messy comedy with a robber, a prison movie, urban conflicts, sex jokes, and an FBI agent? You don't get it. I watched this movie and thought, "Is this really Marlon Brando?" No, it can't be. (5 minutes later) Is this Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando is true. (5 minutes later) It can't be Donald Sutherland. (5 minutes later) No, not Mira Sorvino. This movie is too bad for everyone. (At the end). No, no, no, it can't be Martin Sheen !!! Not 10 seconds of such a movie. Then it was over and I am down with my nerves. So much good, oscar-winning, usually convincing participants so stupid, stupid, terrible film. I seldom wanted to know how they came to act in this area. They didn't get so much money. <br /> <br /> Just just an incredible silly idiotic movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 1/4
