Phantasm .... Class. Phantasm II ..... awesome. Phantasm III ..... erm ..... terrible. <br /> <br /> Although I would like to keep this movie, I can't easily. The film seems to be "sold". The first bad signs come when the video initially has trailers from other films (which others didn't). Also too many pointless characters, exemplary examples of a boy (who is a cracked blow, funny at first, but soon you want him dead), a woman who uses karate to fight for balls (erm doesn't work or shouldn't) and bloom zombies they do there, have no connection with them with other Phatasms). There is also a serious shortage that runs around. <br /> <br /> The only good bit is the beginning of cracking and of course Reggie B. <br /> <br /> (possible SPOILER coming) <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this movie seems to be II and IV Filler, because the extra characters will eventually end so that it can continue to the fourth main IV. <br /> <br /> Overall, very disappointing. 3/10
