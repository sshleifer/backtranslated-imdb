In fact, it has never been. I'm not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to rebuild the 1940s screwball comedy. Which intermediate sabab! None of these people come close to Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn etc. And today, today's audience is not so receptive to such a muck. Writing is trivial. Hackneyed plot is a razor thin and obvious. There is no chemistry between drivers. It is interesting that Julia Roberts seems to think she is a reincarnation of some of the "reuse of the Hollywood golden age". This is the effect he is trying and will not achieve once again with Richard Gere at Runaway Bride.
