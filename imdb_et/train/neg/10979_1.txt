The words can't start to describe how this movie is terribly terrible. I wish it was "so bad that it is good," but that is not. It's just boring, inanimate and boring. It's so bad that I couldn't even laugh at it. The only person who is less charismatic is the director Brett Kelly, who, according to a true statement of violence, threw himself out of male lead. They both look like relatives, sister and brother. <br /> <br /> Gal, Sherry Thurig, is an observer. Anne-Marie's complete opposite - attractive. This girl is tall and willow and can act. Although you can say that he is holding back. <br /> <br /> All actors stand out, especially supportive man, Mark. I've seen less wood in rainforests, but it's better than Kelly. Why should Kelly show her actors? Is he really such a bad director? Everything else has been well summarized by everyone else - none. The children are kidnapped and Kelly is stepping in to solve the crime. I know how he felt about stepping in, how I felt when watching my movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I was trying to get my money back from the rental store. This is the home theater that the director's friends see best (and if you are looking for them, you will see the same friends who gave the positive signs of the film).
