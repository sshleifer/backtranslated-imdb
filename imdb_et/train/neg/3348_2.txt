The Haunting version of 1963 has been one of my favorite horror films for years, so I expected it in 1999. It hardly seemed that any follow-up could overcome or even equate to the original masterpiece. Unfortunately, my concerns were well founded: this film smells. <br /> <br /> I don't know what people in this movie meant. Jan De Bont, who seemed to be very upbeat when he was driving great speed, was doing so badly (or even worse) as he did with many hypotheses "Twister" and "Speed ​​2: Cruise Control". "Hey Jan, Cinematography? Liam Neeson is enough for his doctor-pretending-be-a-sleep-psychologist - I don't think he's capable of really getting bad, but even he doesn't get a flat script and a weak story. Catherine Zeta Jones proves once again (as he did in "Entrapmentis") that he does not have the ability to act on the material transmitted to him, and that the female leader who made it big in the "X-Files" episode, seems like Eleanor, asleep, dreaming. this blonde guy, no matter who he is, is more of a wood than ridiculously weird statues that are woven around the house. I don't think he will change the expression once in the movie. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS AHEAD) <br /> <br /> The reason why the first movie worked so well is that we are never sure whether the house was truly haunting or whether the manifestations were the result of Eleanor's precarious mental state. imagination - other big horror movies like "T he Changeling and The Blair Witch Project. In this updated version, of course, we get tons of CGI ghosts, which basically (in front of a weak script / plot) make the movie completely uneven. F / x is not even so large considering them by ILM. Frozen breath seems particularly fake. The impact of the undervalued Peter Jackson movie "Fears" that I saw just before was much better. Children's wooden carvings, which should look horrible, just see the fools (especially when they scream) and CGI monsters have nothing to write home. Instead of alleviating the writing of bad behavior, bad direction, and bad news, the effects only add to the confusion of the movie. <br /> <br /> Some particularly foolish scenes: when the three other characters penetrate Eleanor's bedroom and none of them seems at all surprised to find a huge scary demon in bed. The scene where Eleanor "sees" the house's former lady, hanging from the rafters ... the acting here is especially bad. And last but not least, a bit of inadvertent fun, where a wooden blonde man says he scares what should be greedy, jumps on the furniture and starts to go to the old, bad boy's painting. house. In fact, in this scene, we get satisfaction, because a second after the attack, the Blond Guy pulls the old ghost into the fireplace and gets off the smoke right away. It was the only part of the movie I enjoyed. <br /> <br /> All in all, stay with the original 1963 The Haunting. 3/10 stars.
