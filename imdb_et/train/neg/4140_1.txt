As you may have heard, there is no real fight between vampires or zombies in this movie. Then one might ask why the title suggested such a thing, but in fact it is appropriate, because there was no point in doing anything else about this movie. There was no story or plot, just what happens. The action was incredibly bad, worse than the safauts commercials. <br /> <br /> Not only was there a battle between vampires and zombies, but I think there was only one scene with zombies. Their formation seemed to have been implemented by an 8-year-old girl. The scene was completely random and inappropriate and there was one of the characters who fought off the zombies with a hedge trimmer (I am not funny), but they used the chainsaw sound effects. <br /> <br /> It was undoubtedly the poorest film I've ever seen in my life. The only fact that I wouldn't speak fully of the person responsible for producing each film is when I found out that it was produced entirely by 11-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Indeed, even when I criticized me for Offer here, I would recommend watching this movie only on the grounds that it may be the worst film, and that's why it's quite comical. Even just reading this mistake, you should keep it entertained.
