If John Waters had written and directed the "1,000 Corps House" after having repeatedly hit a heavy-duty head, the result would probably be something like "Blood Shelter". It's a little entertaining in the first half of the year, but then it's sort of a peculiar, constant, screaming lips and people doing things for each other's genitals with electric carving, cutlery and tongs. Susan Adriensen (Sno Cakes) is incredibly annoying and Terry West (Elvis Bullion) is almost as bad as she does in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about "Blood in the Shade" is that most of the viewers don't forget it for a long time.
