I used to be an avid viewer until I personally spent a long cold hour helping to build a home for the White Family only when I saw the house house a year later. All the beautiful stone arrangements have been removed, the excellent stone stone on the pavement and the front fountain has been removed, all the pine trees and pecans are cut off, the sprinkler system is ripped. Now it looks like a disaster area. They no longer live there ... they live in "the city" and come out just over the weekend. This sick person thinks of all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma donated to these people and saw the result. The story we all saw on television was not entirely true ... not all the things you see and hear.
