Why did I waste it for 1.5 hours of my life? Why was this movie even made? Why am I even commenting on this movie? <br /> <br /> One reviewer said this film looked at patience and it wasn't for everyone. I can't figure out who this movie is. maybe, after beating the acid, SOMEBODY, SOMEWHERE can look at it and make some sense. It is inconsistent, it is not experimental, it is ordinary and simple garbage. There is no plot line in the movie, just when you think you have something, well ..... you don't. <br /> <br /> I think that the finishing touches to the film have a certain finality (look ahead), the viewer gets a glimpse of what may happen. I don't think I will put a spoiler here, not that it is important. This movie is another movie in the world.
