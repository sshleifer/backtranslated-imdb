Joe Don Baker is ... Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, a foolish, sweaty assassin in a stupid cowboy suit that Roy Rogers would laugh at. Somehow he still has a sign, probably because he lives in Texas, and in any case they have law enforcement. <br /> <br /> This greasy loser is the sheriff's deputy near the Texas border. Not surprisingly, he was once a Texas Ranger but got out because he seemed to think the law was his own personal collision ball, which he played at his discretion. This includes the shooting of suspects over the international border in Mexico, the beating of suspects, fraud against weapons, threatening women, starting a fight that could have been avoided and able to get the life of a child at risk during the process. he promised he would help and protect him from killing just so he could get out of prison, and so on. etc. This man makes LA policemen similar to saints. <br /> <br /> When his partner is killed by a couple of Italian assassins, Joe Don's character will migrate them and kill one of them. Then he will take to another Italy at the request of Mr Wilson, who rightly thinks Joe Don will be shut down for a long time. During the record period, he loses Italian and, during the process, receives a Maltese cab from the holiday. It's just the first of many deaths and the great destruction Joe Don leaves behind the trail when he hits Malta, looking for Palermo (an Italian assassin). <br /> <br /> So the part of the mobius strip begins with a film where our hero is arrested, a lecture from a police chief of Malta, goes out and causes more problems, is arrested, a police officer lectures ... and so on and so forth. Until you want to blow your brains with Joe Don's ivory hand and do it with horror. <br /> <br /> Joe Don demonstrates his use not only for the first time in Palermo's escape, but also for the next boat ride he goes to just one punch. Then he gets to Palermo after he threatens a woman's clothes. You hope that Palermo will torture her into the basement she has put in, but no one she threatened would come and get her out because she promised to protect her. His throat is immediately cut (a big surprise) and Joe Don flees to the night. <br /> <br /> And here you hope he could sink (still another) on the boat. But even the ocean does not want him and spits him on the shore, where he is cared for by a poor Maltese family (what did they ever do?) Returns to the city where the police were arrested, lecture by the police chief ... arrrgghhh! The female police officer who sent her will release her so that they can go to Palermo. Why did he do something that the brain is dead to destroy his career for the big bitch that is next to me. It's just a bit harshly puzzling. <br /> <br /> They will go to the villa where Palermo hides and start shooting. Joe Don cheats and kills Palermo. He then speaks of the big and dazzling last line of the film: "The big one has my mark. Can you get it for me?" Thank you for the immortal line, Mr Baker. It goes into the history of the film, the most literate, amazing, wonderful, last line ever spoken by a movie-close character. Certainly, it will fall from another character. Bravo.
