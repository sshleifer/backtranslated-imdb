Although it is not a "great movie", it is something that is worthwhile and memorable. Like another movie commentary, I saw it in childhood. It has been thirty-three years since 1952, but I've never forgotten the story or its ridiculously clumsy headline. See if you have the opportunity. You feel like a small town life buzzer as it develops over decades. More than any other film, this is the "progress" of the historical drama of the beginning of the 20th century. It is sufficiently involved in the young viewer and is quite memorable for the parents. What's more, it is easy to enjoy characters and watch their passage over time.
