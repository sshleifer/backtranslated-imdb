"Home Alone 3" is the first home video film that does not contain Culkin's main role and the same villains. However, the plot is very similar to the original "Home Transfer" movie. Instead of two comic villains, we get three or four of them. This movie contains some traps, but it also has a long scene with a remote control car. Exciting humor is also consistent, but the young boy and the villain are unable to influence this film. (Not intended.) This film does not offer anything new or different than the previous films, and it really is not a warm, holiday feeling or sublot that the other two films were. This is more pure comedy, but it couldn't make me laugh because the characters didn't do it for me. I don't recommend this movie; it's pretty boring. If you are looking for a comedy good holiday movie, check out the original film "Home alone".
