The film begins with the Earth's people who discover that their rocket was not lost to Mars, but was just outside the planet in space. When it is received, one of the team members is sick, one is alive and the other two are missing. What happened to them, the surviving member says a setback. <br /> <br /> While on Mars, the team apparently attacked a whole host of very stupid eyeballs. Strange, though the kits were pretty good, the monsters were among the smoothest in the film. In addition, production used realism in a realistic test of a process called "Cinemagic". Unfortunately, this wonderful innovation just made the film look quite cheap on the surface of Mars and the intensity of redness practically turned my eyes into bleeding - that was bad! Despite the cheese, the film had a somewhat interesting plot and a good message about space travel. Look for genre lovers. For others, you can find the whole thing quite foolishly - see for yourself and decide. <br /> <br /> Although today's standards are not particularly good for sci-fi movies compared to movies. while watching this movie, watch this movie closely by Dr. Tremayne. She looks like dr. Quest a bright picture of "Jonny Quest" comic! In addition, he sounds and acts like him.
