I'm sorry for all the fans, but it's a useless movie. Action is bad, even from a tree, it moves over the fear factor early and doesn't work exactly. I think it was supposed to be twisting in the end, but it was just madly confusing. What the hell? The guy who killed everything was a yacht? Please try again. <br /> <br /> Its hardly original and it's not particularly good as a straight slasher. And it says something. <br /> <br /> I think somebody who made castings who wrote the script and who thought that idea should be mercilessly fired and deported. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. When someone puts it on the party, throw the plate out of the window and put a good horror film like a mutton or shine.
