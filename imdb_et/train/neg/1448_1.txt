Having grown up in Texas and less than 15 miles from what used to be Gilley's, I can tell you that this movie is nausea. Most Texans don't live like this movie shows. The plot is weak and fake accents are fun and reinforce the stereotypical reputation that all Texas have in drinking beer, honky-tonkin, rednecks. Terribly fake Texas accents kill me for that. True, most of Texan's accents are related to Texas, but these people overdo it. You will not get anyone from New Jersey and Osh to Texas accent. It just doesn't work. John Travolta should have been in disco-dance or in the 50's. Debra Winger was more convincing than Wonder Girl than Texan.
