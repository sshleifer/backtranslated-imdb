Since the release of "Christmas Story" in 1983, Jean Shepherd's story about his alter-ego, Ralphie, has become a real classic. "My summer story" is still a narrator on Shepherd, but it has absolutely no charm and characters are not close to the original movie caliber. <br /> <br /> "My Summer Story" is basically mishmash mediocre and just not very interesting stories that contain hillbilly neighbors and fighting tops. Charles Grodin, whom I usually love, is extremely unlikely to play in his father's role (Darren McGavin is more original) and his character never seems to be forced. Kiernan Culkin is a poor substitute for Ralphie and the little brother is all forgotten here. Only the mother seems to be worth it and maybe it is because she wakes up with a craftsman's raft if she strikes her luck too far, where there is a free supper. â€œ<br /> <br /> Most of its stories are insignificant and stretched paper-thin. One can turn to highly unwanted, but as a "Christmas story", it is very bad and is not worth the time of most people. 2 out of 10.
