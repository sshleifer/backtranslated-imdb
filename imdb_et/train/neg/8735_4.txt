This movie promised me off. It seemed like a movie Jaws when Hopper told the mayor to close the parks when Roy Shider told the mayor to close the beaches. They didn't both say in the summer! But the box says Hopper has to go to the killer and think. But he really doesn't do anything too interesting or exciting. I am not even a little convinced that he and his partner have police experience when they are in the office, thinking how they will deal with this case. They just say let's do the police work and solve it. And with all the old men who have pool marks. I didn't even believe they were mob bosses. And then the boy who doubted that the boy who chose on the cell would start to find the killer. With his $ 100 discount and he thinks his Di k is the size of the school bus. Come on, what dirty lines. I thought he would hit him with a baseball bat like in other films. I got this movie and didn't buy this new one. I suggest you skip this movie. Oh, and it was funny to see the microphone in the place where the hopper goes for coffee.
