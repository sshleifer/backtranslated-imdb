When I first spoke in the morning, I thought, "Finally, some entertainment." It was a little funny during the week ... But we have to face it, these news reporters (if they can even be called) are WAY TOO OTHER "playing" time. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought Jillian was breathing fresh air. But seriously, this woman does not have the least number of journalists. He is very unprofessional. He will continue to interrupt Steve when he starts to inform viewers of a certain news report. It's just really annoying that I can't watch it anymore. <br /> <br /> Jillian is not a good journalist. Hell, he is more of a celebrity who loves fame. So he immediately becomes a celebrity among the celebrities he should interview. He's not very professional and maybe he sees his relationship with celebrities more important than just a just insatiable journalist - and that's all I can say about him. <br /> <br /> The (disappointing) show also has more entertainment news than the necessary news about the world, the government, the US, or something that benefits and / or serves the public interest. They also focus on the sensationality that everything they talk about becomes a commercial product. On the other hand, reporters in this field are interestingly accepted ... <br /> <br /> I believe that "good day LA" is for young teenagers and celebrities and it is certainly not for people who really care about the news. <br /> <br /> NOTE: (I would really like to look at KTLA. But sometimes they try to get some fun. They are still a bit bored. serious.)
