This movie is terrible for God. None of the quality of this movie. You think gore would be good, but it sucks. Impacts are worse and acting when you call it is the worst I've ever seen. This movie was obviously on a camcorder and probably works on a budget of about $ 500. If you want to watch a good Zombie movie than watch Dawn from the dead or the day of the dead. If you want to watch a good cheap picture on a video of Zombie movie, but it is better to watch Redneck Zombies. Please avoid this movie at all costs. It is unobtrusive and pointless. You have been warned. I have nothing else to say about this stupid movie.
