Regardless of the recognition of the DVD cover of the borrowed DVD, this film was disappointing. Yes, it is much more realistic than other warfare films of mud, boredom and frustration, but unfortunately we have to think of it as this movie. There is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous. It's not that a good war movie needs a battle scene every five minutes. One of the best World War II films, "Twelve Clocks of High", is very few. But it compensates for the splitting dialogue and the psychological tension. As an exception, "the story of G.I. Joe" is a short battle segment (titled "City Siege" on DVD) that takes place in Italy. It is true that it is one of the fastest developed and convincing military scenes of war films. But unfortunately, watching the rest of the movie is not worth highlighting. Another shutdown is Pvt. Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, who is meant to be "romeo" but who comes out of pervert. By contrast, Sgt. Warnicki is a man who is sympathetic. As he tells Captain Walker (Mitchum) when he voluntarily stays with another patrol, "Every step forward is a step closer ... home." But this last step? one patrol too much? directs him to the spiritual edge. It is too bad that the rest of the film does not justify the other touches in some other way. As for the depiction of Meredith on Pyle, it is practically clever.
