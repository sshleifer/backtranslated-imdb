Even with a bad movie, there are usually some redemption features that can be said yes, it was terrible, but there was that performance or part of the script or that special effect, it was just terrible. The operation was ridiculous, the script was terrible, with many inexplicable breakfasts referring to Tiffany, and even special effects were at best dirty. It was a very bad movie and what even Drew Barrymore wanted out of history. See this if you want to: a) Suffer from harsh self-inflicted pain. b) See how bad the film is. This is one movie where I can use the clich√© to "ninety minutes of my life, I'll never get it right!"
