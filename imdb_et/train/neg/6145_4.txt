Although I had seen in the 85th "Gymcatat" of the theater, I could not commemorate anything from the plot except the vague images of Kurt Thomas who ran and fought against the stone walls and the end of disappointment. <Br>> <br /> After reading some other reviews, I accepted a newly released copy of the DVD to re-enter Gymkata world. <br /> <br /> It turned out to be one of those films that were produced in the 80s, which go straight to the video. Kurt Thomas, the star star of the movie, who was Jonathan Cabot, recruited blue to enter the "Parmistan" nation to enter and hopefully win "The Game" - a suicidal bleeding sponsored by Khan, who encourages his people to shout what sounds like "Yak Power". The mission's goal is the Star Wars defense system. Jonatani has practiced Princess Rubal in martial arts, who never speaks or leaves the house. When you are trained, it will try to blend with the locals by wearing a blue and white light red sweater. Needless to say, Cabot finds himself running and battling his life on the streets of the stone, on the way to the fate and the game. <br /> <br /> Star, Kurt Thomas became ill, Director Robert Clouse, who looks like this, was never out of stock. The so-called script is just that incompetent side. See other reviewers for many carts. Dreadful cities have some good moments, but in the end it is destroyed due to poor editing. End ... meh. There is still a good adventure here. The Hong Kong version, which has more visceral measures and faster pace, may even be pretty good.
