I tend to like feature films. I also think that Hope Davis is consistently good at work, so I had great hopes for this movie. These hopes were soon intermittent. <br /> <br /> The main mistake in this movie is direction. There are many scenes that are the sequences of dreams. The film often uses Denis Leary's character Campbell Scot's character as an alternative to the ego. It doesn't work for me at all. It would have worked better than a game than a movie. <br /> <br /> There are also problems with the plot. It is important that the characters in the movie run and end at the point where they started. I did not feel that the characters grew up in the experience depicted in the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, editing wasn't good either. Extremely boring in the middle of the movie was a very big sag. <br /> <br /> Except for the action I felt constant, this movie failed in almost every movie theater.
