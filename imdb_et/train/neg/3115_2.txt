I rarely write a negative review of this site, but this time I felt it. The night listener is undoubtedly one of the most obvious films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There was nothing in this movie that had ever happened - I didn't care about any characters, didn't buy the whole mystery type on the plot, don't care how it ended. There is nothing. <br /> <br /> There is no comedy, no action, no excitement, no relationship, nothing. Highlights are (spoilers missing - nothing to ruin): a man who climbs through a window, a dog house that grabs outside a hotel room, a car that goes over some rough ground and drives a beep. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed "One Hour Photo" and hoped Williams would have a similar misfortune, but unfortunately it was seriously let down. What's even more disappointing is that I'm sure there's a good movie somewhere - the idea was interesting and I should have known the sympathy for the characters, but it just didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> I can even give it 1/10, but this result is reserved for manufacturers
