This game was made by Sega. Having done it, I didn't expect much, but I didn't expect that spam. For starters the camera corners work against you in this game. Motorcycle is your chance to move. Motorcycle is the worst part of the game. Every time you enter something you just hold and you don't move. You never let a bike or a wreck on this subject. The main character hardly speaks, although he has the right voice. Graphics are terrible. You drive through your bicycle trees. The camera makes it impossible to fight against the enemy. This game would not even be worth renting.
