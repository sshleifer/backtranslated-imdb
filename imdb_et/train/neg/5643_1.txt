I have 2 home entertainment stores and I've seen a lot of time with bad movies, but it was so bad that I forced me to register here and comment on it. How bad was it? Let's just say that Sofia Coppola had earned Oscar for performing in the race hall III as compared to Giada Colagrand in the film. Her lover has just died one month before her arrival at the "Rubber House". When he is there he finds that he has deceived his relationship, but no one seems to be registering with him. During the day, she starts a relationship with Leslie (Dafoe), a house janitor. Although she is married to Dafoe's display, her scenes related to her were cold and unresponsive. <br /> <br /> If there was a plot, I missed it. Even Willem Dafoe could not save this movie from an amateur, cinematic attack.
