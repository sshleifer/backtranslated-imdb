I read some passionate comments about IMDb and thought I'd give this movie a look. Disappointed. On the plus side, men are good and some interesting photos, but as a whole, this film can't convince. It seems to be full of self-conscious importance to try to say something meaningful, but to fall short and the whole picture is a convincing confusion. <br /> <br /> This is one of the films classified as Noir, which can be defined as follows: <br /> <br /> "The film is characterized by pessimism, fatalism, intimidation and cynicism." <br /> <br /> Well, this is the story here: 3 losers stumble upon each other with their collective problems, including mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, indebtedness, etc., and together they agree to abduct and cross each other. <br /> <br /> It would have been a much better film than the story was more about robbery rather than the typical shortcomings of the robberies. I thought the female driver was out of her depth and reached an amateur actor. <br /> <br /> Although some good moments, I ended up feeling I had wasted my time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
