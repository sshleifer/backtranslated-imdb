"The Giant" is one of the most boring, rather long Hollywood competitions that has ever been. Many scenes seem to be completely counterfeit and without energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean are wasted in this great Hollywood production. The central idea of ​​this film, which a grazer ever drilled in his land, is absurd and I know it because I'm from Houston. A couple of scenes, especially Dean, serves Taylor's coffee, redeeming this otherwise boring movie. A much more accurate and interesting idea of ​​how modernism changed Texas's ranches, see "Hud" (one of Paul Newman's major performances) or "The Last Picture Show".
