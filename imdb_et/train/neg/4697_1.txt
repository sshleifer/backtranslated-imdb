Okay, I saw a covert preview of this stupid movie. First of all, the film is so erected and not real, they all work. They can't sing. They're too full of themselves. It's terrible. Yes, kids like 8 to 10 can enjoy, but it's really stupid. I mean, they say their head is a child. And there is a recording mark fake. Its stupid. Don't look at it. <br /> <br /> As for setup and control, it's not so bad. This is a lovely documentary, but it documents a stupid thing. <br /> <br /> Look at it only if you don't like good music. It is also very horny. It's not even tasteful. I hate that ... but it's really a junk.
