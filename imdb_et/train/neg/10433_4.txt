Fighting scenes were great. He loved old and newer cylinders and how they painted them on their side. It was the end I hated. I was disappointed that it was land, but 150k years ago. But to travel all the time just start? Are you kidding? 38k people who fought for their existence and when they reached paradise, give up technology? Not possible. Of course they eat paper and food, but it's over. They can live like people again. They have only one good doctor. What are they going to do if someone has a toothache that has never given birth ... yes. No one would have made that choice.
