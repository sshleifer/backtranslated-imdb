I will give this movie two stars because it is beautiful photography. Otherwise, these are mainly clichés and stereotypes: mountain areas are either a foolish white trash of fanatic religious or looted racist or wise white Indians. Indians are magical people who move without sound, may disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to animals, and read thoughts at great distances. And so on and so on. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, I was still thinking about the idea of ​​the film (except for showing beautiful pictures of mountains, log houses, forests, a selection of animals, free spiritual mountain houses and passionate people in church). <br /> <br /> The plot touched many questions but did not thoroughly investigate any of them. It was not a story of growing up during depression or of being orphans or fighting against identity. He tried to be all those things and other things that made it superficial and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Although the film was supposed to be a Little Tree education, we learn about it. He briefly summarized the history of his people (who were brave and stoic) and the distillery demonstration; tried his hand to cut wood (where he failed) and whiskey (literally); learned how to read (and perhaps write) using grandmother and his dictionary - and that was the case. He probably didn't learn much while he was in school because he was locked in the attic. <br /> <br /> But grandmother and grandfather and Graham Greene's character ensured that the Little Tree eventually became a very spiritual person whose main purpose as an adult - after that and I paraphrased here, "riding with Navaya" and "pairing with a few" - was catching up with "grandmother and grandfather and Graham Greene" in heaven (not like girls dating, marrying, kids, or the like). <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to find a grandfather's trade attack. Why all things still have to be whiskey? To prevent the "drunk Indian" stereotype?
