I will not go and give them my 10 bucks, which I went and bought the original and the best of the fourth season. At least my kids enjoy it and can watch it without worrying about what they see. I have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and rather look at the original. And he thinks Jessica Simpson is actually a terrible daisy, which she thinks she looks like a bitch as a daisy duke. These shorts that he may not wear at all. And when American Pie has something to do with Duke's SHAME ON to put this nasty line on sex. This in itself should have been the film's R-rating. The only good thing that can come out of it is a summary film with the originals. Let's all hope. So the people who went and saw the movie see how it should look
