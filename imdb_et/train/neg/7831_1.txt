With your companion MASTERS of HORROR, NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES you can only look at the absolute zero of this genre that started with the TWILIGHT ZONE and OUTER LIMITS. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of the problem is that it doesn't interest the relatively adult audience, rather than targeting TENs who are able to count only body-bags and hardly that. And so the harshness of the king, and the king is harsh. <br /> <br /> Stephen King is just illiterate? in general he has Bart Simpson's ability to tell. Because she can't read her only inspiration, the movies are true. <br /> <br /> Indeed, cinema is not a bad place to start because it has usually escaped the "realism" attack. However, these movies are just a rumor, not a thing, and if you want to write, you need to dig deeper. <br /> <br /> Of course, only PICKMAN had a close acquaintance. But even in this case, it should be clear to each bachelor's degree that vampires are not Dracula and Lugos. <br /> <br /> At least AUTOPSY ROOM FOUR is a clear sign of what's wrong. One can almost imagine the pathetic dolt sitting at his desk trying to get something out of SCARY. <br /> <br /> Don't forget that you are trying to accurately describe the horror of the system that it is an integral part of. a stupid stupider, but trying to come up with a scary story for his little brother. Suppose you were paralyzed and people thought you were dead and you started to open up, as they do with their autopsy! Wouldn't that be great? And this, boys and girls, is a story. <br /> <br /> What is Characterization? Oh, yeah, he's one of those suits who never knows life, you know, and it's too late, right? And he screams? well, they can't really hear him, you know? he says he's going to sue the hospital, but he's no longer a big shot, you see, lying there (or it does, I never remember) and everything. And he thinks, "Oh, please, don't cut me off and it's terrible, lie (or put it) like that? Isn't it a great story now? You know I read somewhere that it can be a snake bite, I think this was the great medical agency Agatha Christie. What was the name of this snake again, oh yes, BOOMSLANG? he's got a ring, isn't it. <br /> <br /> Make it PERUVIAN BOOMSLANG! except that BOOMSLANG is afrikaans, you! But how can you really say that the target group is kids, not just mental deficiencies? It's simple: no sex. <br /> <br /> Well, there is, but it's what we saw through breaking through the door of our older bedroom, contemporary filmmakers are very different from the erotic aspects of the genre, the monster, the female victim, the rigging. has really left, is behind the SM club and fascist creed e that people with sexual preferences are by nature evil. <br /> <br /> Despite some size, King Kong is well aware of what Fayga Wray should do. Freddy Krueger can kill him. <br /> <br /> And since it does not have a real title, does it have to be tortured for the first time? in no way what would irritate her, you understand, because it would irritate our puritanical feelings. And so, fear and romance simply become unpleasant and psychopathic care. <br /> <br /> Our hero is seeing it as a rubber fetish and can only be tempted when someone touches you with the one you know there. you know? rubber gloves. And that is what they use in autopsy, and how they discover it is actually knowledge. <br /> <br /> Of course, this author is at the height of his inspiring powers. Too bad, they cut it out because it can be in the age of fifty!
