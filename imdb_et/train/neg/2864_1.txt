This movie is so bad that it just doesn't let reality. Filming is at best a classroom material, the behavior is pathetic and the director should forever be left out of filmmaking in any form. So bad that it can't even be seen as comedy like something shown on Showgirls. The only thing this DVD was going to be was the cover design. <br /> <br /> All I can write to those who haven't seen this accident is to make yourself a deserved advantage and don't waste your time and money on that piece of garbage. If you want to see comedy movies, there is a lot of value in this area than the trash can.
