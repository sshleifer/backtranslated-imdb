A cordial attempt to bring Elvis Presley to the modern, but despite the sexy little shower scene and the pseudo-Playboy magazine sub-site, Presley is surrounded by the same old boy, worshiping clich√©s. Woman chooses E.P. up on the beach and continue to take over his life - and he doesn't seem to care! Dick Sargent is exhausting in the other sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) Are trying hard when Elvis's two bosses (you see). Some songs are pretty good, especially "almost in love", but if you want to see a relaxed, hyper-comedy-comedy comedy - look elsewhere. When Elvis and his Fatal Attraction get together in bed, there is actually a wooden plate between them! Get real. ** from ****
