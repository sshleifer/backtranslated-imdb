This film shifts from 4th to the first without disturbing the 3rd or 2nd grinding device to the delicate, b-film finish. The initial con is just the best and smartest part of the movie. It's worth it. The scene in the bath with Harlow is so fast that you can forget it. Certainly, it is not worthwhile that Robert Osborne in his TCM intro has this bad mediocre confusion. There is no real conflict, and all characters of this characteristic society are sacred - especially incredible, Al. I don't know if he has a job for me in Cincinnati?
