Of course, my first opinions on this film were bad. I had been waiting for a scary, dirty, bad entertainment, a ridiculous special effect movie. What I got was not really that bad. The special effects were terribly terrible, but I found the movie quite interesting and the script was actually pretty good and decent. It wasn't a bad thing, and I generally enjoyed watching this movie. It's still a pretty bad movie, but it's not entirely worth it, as I thought it was, and I'm glad to know that this movie was able to do me, even if it wasn't so good. In general, this is a film that should be avoided, but for me it was not as bad as I was watching.
