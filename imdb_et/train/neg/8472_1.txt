The film opens to Julian Sands, on his back, a black kitten, who flows into the waiting mouth, where he keeps it, about two feet above him. It was so provocative and I thought, "Here we go! Good vampire movie!" <br /> <br /> And then he died. It was literally the only scene that captured the imagination. After that it was slow, uneven. I was very disappointed because my previous experience with Sands was quite enjoyable. But this experiment was obviously wrong and the scenario was much desired. <br /> <br /> Even the questionable force of Julian Sands could not record the ship of the already drowned movie. <br /> <br /> It sets 1.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
