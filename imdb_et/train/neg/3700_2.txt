because this is the only way you don't think this film is a waste of time and money. The new version of "The Sky Can Be Waited" (which was at least worth watching) is a bad excuse for romantic comedy. This is more of a tool to give Rock some time to the film for a comedy that can't play well on the big screen. Especially because his jokes should generally be from the body of an old, fat, rich, dead man, but they have been shown to come from Rock himself. Because he insults black and white, chemistry is all wrong. Film is not funny, poorly photographed is weak at best. Go for "Heaven Can Wait" and live Rock video and you get in front of the game.
