If there is hell, it includes a screening room where GRAND CANYON plays an everlasting loop. We hope that the presence of so many wonderful actors - Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker - would help offset the presence of Mary McDonnell (whose repentance is to watch her films forever). . But not. They probably injected other participants with serum from McDonnell. The whole thing is conscientious, overcrowded, offensive (if you're deaf or you know someone who is, be prepared to boil your blood in a ridiculous TDD scene). GRAND CANYON is full of unpleasant, independent people, but never gives us any reason to understand / understand / understand or even tolerate them. With rare exceptions, they are inadequate losers for a better gene fund. There is no plot to talk about, no character development (these people will never work out), some breakthrough results, and the most architectural text ever encountered on film. Best of GRAND CANYON? Its title. This is one big movie from the movie.
