Although I have to admit that I smiled more while watching this movie than the last few comedies I saw. The budget must consist of exchanging pockets of participants. Production values ​​are so low that they actually made it fun. Reminds me of the Robot Monster, which consists of a gorilla suit with cardboard diving helmet. <br /> <br /> In one scene, an unhappy victim gets his hand and foot off. Geez, hard to believe, but the Black Knight scene of the Holy Grail was more realistic. I was wondering why the victim didn't start shouting "No one went" and "It's just a meat wound I've had worse". It was one of the funniest scenes in the last year. <br /> <br /> The Gladiator / Demon was also a seam. The good result between a cheap costume and the boy's geeky look was a hysterical outcome. <br /> <br /> A movie that is bad enough to be watched. Similarly, you see a slow motion car accident on the film. <br /> <br />
