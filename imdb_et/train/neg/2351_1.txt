I have no idea how someone woke up during this show. The action was tooth-fisted and amateur, the story was old news, and the plot's development (or lack of it) was always less than half way down the eyelids during each episode. It's all about saying this because it really lacked any substance. <br /> <br /> How can you like this mess? It's a stupid fool, it's an insult to your intelligence. I don't even know how to explain it yet ... It's like some of you strangely such a junk just because you like the way some actors look, or because of any mad reason you haven't seen the same formulas in tens of examples a million times before. <br /> <br /> I just forget it. This exhibition sucks and fortunately it has disappeared forever. I want them to work with O.C. last time.
