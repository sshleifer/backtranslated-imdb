I just saw this movie yesterday ... I can't believe the comments on this site. Those who give it over one star must be Buffy fanatics. Well, I'm the first-order Buffy fan, but I know I can see it. This movie is terrible at every level. Technically, much of the time you don't know where you are in this movie, even within one scene, jumps to POV as crazy without reason. No logic in cinematography. Emotionally, the gloomy gloom is gloomy and tries to be a psychological thriller if it's just confusing. Falling an unpleasant look in your movie is an inexpensive way to convey the "atmosphere". I ran with this patience long before the last action, but I had too many friends who turned off their MST3K reefs with their friends. Since the departure of Buffy, SMG has had two successful films, even if membership of the "Scooby Doo" list can count. Gellar is a good actor, but he (or his representative) can't find him. And Mr Shepard, if you have a problem with paying a mortgage, I'll send you a few bucks if you promise you won't see such a movie again! (Also, the legacy of Patsy Cline should be defrauded!)
