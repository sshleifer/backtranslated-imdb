Although 3-D animation (highlighting the exhibition) did well, most of the other elements gradually fell. Just like filmmakers thought it was "triple, so we don't have to work on developing this plot or character." And the fact that it's a children's film is no excuse. The public is directed to three-dimensional characters (Shrek, Nemo's father) as much as three-dimensional graphics. The only dimension that was one of the main characters was the two-dimensional Scooter, who spins the plot from time to time with his fortune to eat everything visible. <br /> <br /> And the absolute kicker? The end of Buzz Aldrin's appearance appears (after viewing the very robotic comic version of the same historical figure) and destroys everyone's good time by calling the main characters of the movie "pollutants" and declaring that the situation on the screen was actually impossible. <br /> <br /> ??? !!! ??? Do you just want to tell the kids that Easter and Santa Claus do not exist when you're at it?
