I just can't get some big room in this episode - that Miranda is so spectacular and there's something so ugly that would make you mad. Someone here commented that perhaps this is the frequency of light waves or something rather ugly. Miranda is just a jerk. The episode is slow, inconsistent and too talkative. I do not understand why Kolos is an ambassador - why is the Federation not just a fucking Medusans? I like one part when Kolos talks about Spock's experience of loneliness. In general, I love TOS, and even on the flat, I always tune.
