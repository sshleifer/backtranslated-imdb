I'm glad that IMDb people could decipher the genre of this movie. I had a suspicion that he was trying to be a comedy, but since it also seems to be in a dark and festive melodrama, I wasn't sure. For comedy, there is an astonishing lack of even the slightest sense of humor - until the end of a ridiculous "twist", which confirms what is a complete waste of the film at all times. It's hard to describe just how amateurish COURSE really is. Did anyone who participated in this film know what they were supposed to do? In fact, it is worth looking at how you can look at the screen quietly with loose disbelief, how terrible it is.
