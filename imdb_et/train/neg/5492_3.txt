Disney people have a lot to explain. First of all, why did anyone think that this less-sitcom material would ever be a decent film. Kooky's 60's teleplay, a unique idea for Martians among us was not yet given to complex X-Files treatment. Some green men's visions have long been dispersed by ET, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and ALIENS 1-3. <br /> <br /> The charm of each property was mainly due to the late Bill Bixby as Tim and Ray Walston as an unpleasant visitor. Think that the Marsa has an antenna, it seemed modest. Now, it seems positively idiotic. However, Christopher Lloyd's Uncle Martin sports metal extras. During an earlier shooting, the signal from the television station Tim must work so that we should think of "martian"! When you last saw a TV with rabbit ears, builds it? Disney does not trust the strange or interaction with the special effects that this flick has on young people, which includes a talk time called Zoot! Yeah, you read it right - Uncle Martin's Spacecraft speaks. He should be a real fun cut! Figure again. I have stretchy socks that are more funny than Zoot. Every time an operation refers to (and it remains), the computer graphics are put into play. Timi plays here with friendly Jeff Daniels, who can't (or can't) do anything to save this floating confusion. Zesty Christine Ebersole brings some comic enthusiasm to her work. Even Ray Walston hurts himself into the procedure - all without results. This alien visitor is dead on arrival. <br /> <br /> Continuous talk about turning the screen when you turn to the screen only gives me the hope that the JEANNIE movie I DREAM does not contain any talking harem clothes. I'm praying that Samantha's BEWITCHED cat wouldn't have lines. I live in fear that I love LUCY - the film is proud of the CG Conga drum called Bongo. <br /> <br /> Michael Eisner! Mickey Mouse - Take me to your leader.
