Back when Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were mercury, a hot-tempered, high-power Hollywood couple, they filmed this (almost) scene-scene transformation from the 1972 Steve McQueen-Ali MacGrawi thriller, associated with flying twosome. It worked almost for the first time because McQueen was an extreme living creature - even a stone quiet and tired, you could feel his watch hanging, his cage magnetism. Baldwin is not in Steve McQueen's league, but he has his own charms and this is probably a more versatile actor - if so, this is not his attribute presentation. Basinger is good and definitely good, but James Woods is artificially hammy in a silly mob-magnet. The sub-block of the former partner of the former partner of Baldwin was intolerable in 72 films, and here it is even worse. As far as the action plans are concerned, they are rather old hats that cause surprise: why even make the original again? ** from ****
