It was a total disappointment. The action is not bad, but the production was just so bad that sometimes I felt I had to stop it, but unfortunately I did it and I was able to shame this poor movie a bit. That's okay. when you are at with black moral plots and don't forget to watch a movie that misunderstands Whitman. If you want to go to the fancy story of cheese.
