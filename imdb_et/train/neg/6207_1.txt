This film does what I would look like an emotional rape. The film was said to be quite confusing among Cannes critics, but for me the last scene was just a pathetic attempt by a novice director to notice. Violence, violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue) is hardly the voice of the debate. <br /> <br /> Good man's good metamorphosis, but restless boy against malicious rape is practically non-existent, while the rape scene (which is the "dragging" of the "Clock Orange" rape scene, an exaggerated version) is intolerable and I refuse my aesthetic values commenting. There are some things that an artist should not try to achieve his goal. At least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Measuring: Shockingly Brutal, Rebellious and NOT TIME EFFECTIVE. See "Clock Orange" or "Le Pianist" instead.
