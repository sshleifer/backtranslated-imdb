Unlike two other current games in the USA (Deal Or No Deal and 1 vs. 100), it is too slow to show this show. <br /> <br /> DOND and 1 vs. 100 can get away at a slow pace because games can change at any time - or stop. The action taken by each player poses a risk, the prizes are wildly changing and it is difficult for players to leave a significant amount of money. Excitement is usually well used. <br /> <br /> Show me the money on the other hand is too slow. If you have a question and it is obvious that the player knows the right answer, you can be sure that nothing will happen in the coming days. The pace of this show would be revealed by the right answer FIRST, and then the player has chosen a dancer instead of wasting time with Shat, talking about what happens if the player gets the wrong answer when we all know that we all know they are right . Random dance is a filler that actually feels stuffed. Too much time is wasted, even though it is not enough ... and the fact that players cannot give up the game early will ensure that much time is wasted. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I have no interest in shaking Shati's viewing, especially right after dinner. <br /> <br /> I am a lifelong fan of the game, but even I had a lot of trouble during that hour. It needs big changes or early retirement.
