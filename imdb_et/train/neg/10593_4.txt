The infamous Ed Wood's "classic" plan of 9 cosmos depicts an outrageous alien who calls humanity, "... stupid! Stupid, stupid!" I have to say that in this trial, A-film would probably be this film, a ridiculously silly sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> Falling Mr. Star by Jean Claude Van Damme returns to his original movie, Luke, a former universal soldier who is now working with a really good universal soldier. When Van Damme was too big to highlight the role of the first two stages, he was too small to do anything other than the fourth in the Universal Soldier series. So, probably worshiping under the breath, he strikes and scares and strikes a 90-minute explosion and carat shock. You will find a lot of meaningless violence, but I would recommend that you look at this brain when you look at this thing at your door. Otherwise, you have to forget where you left off when it ended. <br /> <br /> Luke is more and more called universal soldiers after a truly genuinely evil computer, called Seth (makes HAL like Ghandi), makes all other universal soldiers evil, pointless killer. Of course, this is what these things are for, but in that case they kill their creators, not the "enemy", so this is the problem. <br /> <br /> I love the foolish logic of this movie. The logic that believes the supercomputer creates a body that looks ashamed of Michael Jai White is this movie. The logic that says Seth's creator is a blue-haired cyber-stereotype, which lets clich√©s more regularly than Old Faithful makes steam. The logic of fighting karate in combat contains two characters that hit ten separate glasses on each other, for thirty minutes on the screen. <br /> <br /> The film also has a daughter of a dangerous character, Bill Goldberg wrestler, a wrestler hidden as a universal soldier, and the romance that is so dirty, I have to think that the novelists were really a good thing. And when that movie ends, it ends. Not one minute after the huge higher finale style explosion there is credit. There is no epilogue, no where they are now, no final kiss, just explosion, hugging, over. Even the creators want to get out of this as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Although this is not Plan 9, USA: TR is a silly little action of excitement that would be fun for the full-fledged Van Damme fans who really know their hero's new depths. Do not see a serious stomach.
