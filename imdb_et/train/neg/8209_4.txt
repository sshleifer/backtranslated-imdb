Nevertheless, the other reviews worked very well. Brad Pitt is doing quite well with the annoying, unpleasant Austrian climber. Other activities are good. The story could have been riveting, but somehow, it will be lost - no matter what you have ever understood or taken care of for the characters you have shown, so a story that could have been quite dramatic will not be pulled by the audience. <br /> <br /> Beautiful scenery and cinematography, a remarkably dramatic real story, important events that shaped the world we live in - but I couldn't, try as I could, get myself involved in that story. Like a hopeless Brad Pitt fan (I consider him to be one of my generation's fifth major participant), I waited for the love of this flick - and it was still cold for me. <br /> <br /> It may be if I can't do it myself, but I'm inclined towards the creative end of this movie - direction, scriptwriting, production, editing - somehow they lost me. It is a shame because it could have been wonderful. <br /> <br /> Good acting, dramatic story, beautifully shot - it should have been great. It wasn't. Probably worth a look, just to put your thoughts on it - but don't wait too much, and maybe you're not as disappointed as I was. Mostly missed me.
