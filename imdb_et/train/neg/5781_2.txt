Roman Polanski has made many, many different films that are unusual. His fame despises me. As a high point, except for Chinatown, nothing seems (I haven't seen "Knife in Water" or "Tess"). Any contribution he has made to the film has been made more than twenty years ago; his work is just embarrassing, safe and / or boring (Pianist, Furious, Oliver Twist, Ninth Gate, Pirates). <br /> <br /> R's Baby must be the end of this agency. out. It is a luxuriously produced and fairly high concept for the 1968 horror film (never showing a baby). But it's just a misunderstood horror juice. It is all beautiful that the plot line becomes very early (Um, thanks to its finest-destructive title) and in a clear day you will see the end of a few days. It didn't support my interest. I think that regardless of what this film might have been, it is completely out of line with the 1960s version, which was feminine. Farrow is such a chronic confused, helpless waif / housewife. His weakness is excessive ... he irritates extreme. There are no real ideas ... to consider anything except the damn mother. <br /> <br /> Dakota has barely used it.
