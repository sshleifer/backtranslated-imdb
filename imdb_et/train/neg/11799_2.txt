It could have been a good episode, but I had to just turn it off. The British representation was terrible to look at. Do filmmakers have feet in the UK before filming? At least a foot in England? I don't think any British person would have had such an emphasis on the comedy of a royal family! Also, two English sons ... I don't think any English boy has acted, spoken, or dressed like any English boy in the British people's history because of Prince William and Harry's public perceptions. American filmmakers .. The UK has more than one country. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland .. means more than 1 culture! I can deal with some stereotypes, but it was so bad that I couldn't see it. Fire seemed cool!
