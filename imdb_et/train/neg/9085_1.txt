One of the worst films I've ever seen. The action was terrible for both children and adults. Most characters did not show little or no emotion. The lighting was terrible and there were too many confusions during the shooting of the movie (in the river scene where they just destroyed the ship, there are 4 pictures; the sheriff and the father in their boat in the evening; by the river, and doctor, Beatrice and Simonton go off the boat at night, but not in the evening.) The best thing in the film was probably sheriff, Cappy (though the pulse sensor * is an unnoticeable slip). Whatever this thing is, when people die, beeps * that Cappy is dead, he is still listening to the beeping, and when the nurse extra controls his pulse manually, it again shows the pulse and then he finally dies. To be honest, it is not worth even for children. You can also look at something good like Lion King or Toy Story when you see something you remember.
