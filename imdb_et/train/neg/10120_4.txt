This Hitchcock film is a little similar to his later films and looks much more like a very old-fashioned moral story. The young couple gets the legacy they believe they make them happy. They spend money traveling around the world and living in a very hedonistic existence. After a while, the excitement begins and the couple begins to exist and have no meaning. But not where, when they are on a luxury trip, the ship will sink and they will lose everything - and in the end will be much happier because they now value life! What an odd, silly and talkative movie! Personally, I would like to inherit all this money and find out if it makes me unhappy! <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are relatively poor compared to later products - poor sound quality and relatively amateurish film. acting.
