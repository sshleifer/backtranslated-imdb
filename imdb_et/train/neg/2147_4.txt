The original is a relaxing watch with some really memorable animated sequences. Unfortunately, the result, though not the worst DTV sequence, is completely out of spark. <br /> <br /> The biggest drop is the lack of a story. Like Belle's magical world, characters are spoken with several vignettes. The magical world, though slightly better, still manages to share the story. We see mice working between Vignettes and I personally think Jaq and Gus are the redeeming values ​​of this movie. <br /> <br /> The first vignette is the best, Cinderella's habit of being a princess. This is best because the mice were the most funny here. The worst vinyl when Jaq becomes a person is sometimes cute, but there was no imagination. The last vignette, when Anastasia fell in love, was also lovely. The problem was that I couldn't imagine Anastasia being Cinderella friendly because I kept her out of step. It was also broken by a rather ridiculous sub-block of Lucifer who loved PomPom. <br /> <br /> Random music was very pleasant to listen to; beautiful Tchaikovsky-inspired original melodies. <br /> <br /> The characters here were the strongest. Cinderella had lost her sincerity and a lot of original probability during her care, although she was wearing very beautiful clothes. The Duke had some really funny moments, but they couldn't save the movie, as well as Prudence and the King. As I mentioned, the mice were the redeeming values ​​of the film because they helped to bring the film to the brilliance. I also have to say that the animation is colorful and above average and the voice action was surprisingly good. story. 4/10 for mice, voice acting, animation and some beautiful dresses. Bethany Cox
