Oh boy, where do I go with that? Herendous functioning, weak plot, stupid deaths, nonsense nudity ... <br /> <br /> It's not entertainment ... it's hell. <br /> <br /> Hell. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money, time or life on this evil moon. <br /> <br /> It's just ... god damn this movie is terrible! Tom Savini, WHY?! Why are you wasting your life on this mess? This movie is not worth it. I'd rather break up and crush my head against the wall than watch it ... this sinful act again! <br /> <br /> Please take my advice and leave f! @ K away from this elephant. film. No, you know what? I shouldn't even call this thing a movie! Just stick to AWAY!
