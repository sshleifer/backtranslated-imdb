I am an actor, producer, director and what I say is facts. This project was the worst film in the history of film making. From producer to director and editing the so-called film is a joke and I mean BIG joke. Why did Blockbuster release such a mess? I take my job very seriously and this film is an insult to my profession. Did the director try to make a bad movie? I do not belive. I saw bad Zombie movies, but it takes cake Coffie and all fucking on the table. This movie sucks! I really hate to talk badly about other filmmakers because I'm myself, but please consider starting another profession. I respect the fact that you stopped the movie, but I have to ask you, "You smoke," I think of the men's girls, the scary zombies you were thinking. For the whole people, if I could have voted zero, I would have. CROPS WITH FILM HISTORY!
