The film is of key importance that Jobson seems to have forgotten - he has the opportunity to talk about the story, showing it to you. You don't have to think about what they think about the audience because they see it. The activity here is confusing with some of the most daring quotes that are triggered by the unsuspecting public - the prose of a delicate fifth former purple. And it should be unnecessary because they are good and some beautiful pictures. Maybe Jobbo knew that the basic story needed a bit of support. And he may be right, he lacks basic credibility: The 70s Edinburgh wasn't exactly full of beautiful brains for girls who wanted Velvet Underground and a soft spot for a passing soci. Too clean and new-looking clothing, which character is carried by the intellectuality of cod, which tries to associate it all, is too tasty.
