How is it possible that no journalist or critic has reminded us of the similarity of this second better Flemish film "Congo Express (1986)"? Congo Express also has some characters that are unrelated: Jean (de Congolees), Workman, Two Taxi Driver, Street Singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels was not. This should not be the reason why grace to bring script errors (if there is a script). The joke (the only one!) From the ice in the fridge is taken from this great Flemish movie "De Witte (1934)" where De Witte puts too much salt on the potato. There are some accidents in the movie, but there is no explanation after that. Tom Barman is delivering a film to us, which is an experiment that is a TV movie than a movie. One more way for the Flemish cinema.
