they have sex with melons in Asia. <br /> <br /> okay. First of all, I doubted it, but after a glance I changed my thoughts and finally I was convinced that they had sex with watermelons, dead or alive. of course not safe for sex. (terribly ugly) leading man makes this corpse after it all in the mouth. Ever Heard About HIV? I think not. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is mostly boring, but also incredibly disgusting. indeed, in some parts it became so disgusting that I couldn't take my virgin eyes off. sex with dead people! how hard is it? and what is the message behind it? we need water, we need melons, do we have to die for sex? Sorry, but it smells!
