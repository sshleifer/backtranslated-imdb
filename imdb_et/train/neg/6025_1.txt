The left is such "we know what we know, because we know" a movie that Christians (and most other naive persons) need to help them feel what they "THINK" and "BELIEVE" (not "KNOW") know. right. But at the same time, I feel bad for little boys because it's not a well-made film. It doesn't help any messages. I work in a video store and I know that the only reasons people saw this movie were because they were religious and they thought it was. The land that sees that they know what will happen in the future is wrong if they don't think they know they don't know. I have had enough (but only after I have had too much) those people who walked with my nose in the air, thinking that movies with semi-talented TV actors mean something to me. <br /> <br /> Please, if you love yourself, stay away. I refuse the details of this movie (not because AI did not see it (because I did), B-it was too shocking that my atheistic myself (because it wasn't) or CI wasn't really nothing bad about this (because I'm doing it.) The reason (which is a word that no one helped to understand this movie) is that I want this movie out of my head, I want it to be done in my head, I want me to watch all this from OPEN MIND from my head, I want a message that Kirk gives you so proudly and unsuccessfully at the end of the movie. I just want the things I had in my head BEFORE watching movies there, something that is directly related to this movie swim in my head OLE OUT! My peaceful rage ends. Sorry that someone in this world went to the theater to see this movie about what could happen in the future (but no) if they could have given seven dollars a plus for every human, that they can't "believe" that is real, maybe perhaps what is. LEFT BEHIND ZERO (out ****)
