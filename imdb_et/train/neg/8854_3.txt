We had a free weekend at STARZ and I turned on the station to see what was there. It was this film Howling II: Operation was terrible, but the eye candy was great. Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as the above-mentioned eye candies. I smiled at the very few scenes I saw. My friends wonder why I never want to go to horror movies when they see this movie, they know why. I would like to laugh so hard. <br /> <br /> Just a Few Words: Reb Brown, who had been playing Ben White, had been playing captain for an American-made movie Marsha Brown was an inspiration for Mick Jagger's "Brown Sugar". Mick has a very good taste for women.
