This movie is really terrible. terrible because it is a 84-minute waste of your life. Special effects are so terrible. Action was not convincing. <br /> <br /> This is about a crocodile that attacks the viewers as they film a documentary about "surfing the blood". Blood surfing is when they surf around sharks, but it becomes a terrible lie when a 31-foot crocodile breaks there. Sharks don't seem real. The crocodile is even worse, and it becomes even more pathetic when they are made out of the creature, but the crocodile stops and two females are flashing. Deaths are fake and pirates are just about to fill the time. <br /> <br /> A pointless, terrible movie that's not worth it!
