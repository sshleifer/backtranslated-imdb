As for movies, it is quite pleasant. Entertaining characters, good dialogue, interesting story. I would have really liked it if I didn't get upset enormously when I look at the perfect disrespect that shows the city where it is set up. <br /> <br /> Glasgow. Scotland. However, each character is English (except for a friend of Seani who is Dutch). Scottish accents are only briefly heard in menial workplaces and roles. As a Scottish woman (& as a viewer who loves her "real life movies a little bit more of real life"), I really don't think it would be countless to use a myriad of talented Scottish actresses ... or at least become English speakers who could put together a decent accent! once a meaningless attempt to use the word "wee" did nothing more than develop further offense.
