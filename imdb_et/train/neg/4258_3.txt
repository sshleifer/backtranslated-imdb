I would give it 3 instead of 5 if it was at least for a while ... When I first saw it, it was just what you could expect from a job that is not based on the artistic abilities of directors. but for idealistic or rather, I would say our (Kazakh) government's idiotic habits ... It is a disgrace because "Qazaqfil'm" was photographed with nice movies when it was not honored by Shaken Aimanov's name, but it was actually running it. Movies like "Konec Atamana", "Kyz Zhibek" or even "Aldar Kose". However, after Mr Aimanov's death, the production of high-quality film almost dropped dramatically for almost a decade, although there were very few films produced. At the end of the 1980s, however, Assa was shot, a film in the first organized criminal group in a big country, a year later, Mr. Rashid Nugmanov shot the film with the co-star of V.Tsoy, the same actor / singer, at that time, he was already a Soviet / Russian rock legend. "Igla" (The Needle or something) was completely new, someone called the wave of the resurrection of the period or the new Kazakh film. Unfortunately, we do not have high quality films today, our directors take pictures of French and Japanese financial support, so the films are not for the public but for professional critics, some of them appreciate at international authors festivals, but very few of them become commercial assets ... and back again. to our "nomads". Such films are usually unpopular due to large aspects. The same consequences for Nikita Mikhalkov's "Siberian Cyrillic" about the Russian tsars, which were also taken on parity with foreign partners, I think they were French or British. Nobdy liked the fact that even in the Russian public it became the main topic of comedians and comedy shows like "KVN". in my opinion
