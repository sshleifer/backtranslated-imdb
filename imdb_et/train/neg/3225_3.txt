Children love dinosaurs. This is somewhat part of their culture. But they have time before the land. Original. At least this film had a heart. That's it. This film is simply pathetic. Just because kids love dinosaurs doesn't mean you can capture some old story and show it to the kids. This film has no plot, the whole assumption is stupid, and it's more by numbers. Not as the soul of Theodore Rex, but it is a light year to land.
