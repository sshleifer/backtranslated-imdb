It is hard to imagine that everyone can find this short as their favorite when they have seen most of their shorts, but I know that humor is very subjective. I've seen all of their short short short (IMO best things) and I found this one of their weaker efforts. shorts and one feature. They were very popular and their boss Hal Roach used them constantly. In addition, it was a time for testing the writers and Stan. I'd say it was an experiment that didn't really work. As someone else said, it doesn't play its strengths. Too much dialogue and plot. <br /> <br /> The best part of this for me is to a large extent an improvised sequence where Stan is Agnese's servant and the great Thelma Todd, who talk about "the girl." <br /> <br /> If you really want to see boys in their most creative and funny story about Blotto or Brats from the same year. <br /> <br /> They made as many short short times as I think they might be forgiven for some less than short shorts. They made a total of 108 films. Very few (except those made in FOX) had direct failures but some. Brother's hospital, me and my pal, the lively ghost, the upper part of the latches come to mind as essentially weak. But others I find something strange in almost all of my short pants. Quite a record in my book. <br /> <br /> If you've seen and enjoyed all the other shorts, check it out on all the tools, but I'd bet that it was memorable for Stan. and Babe.
