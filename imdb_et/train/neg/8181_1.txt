I went to watch this movie (actually I went to see family portraits containing clips + 2 other short films from Douglas Buck) at Mar del Plata Festival (Argentina) ... I just couldn't see it! I had to cover my eyes after the first half of the cutting moments and look at my eyes each time. By the time it was over, my belly was upside down and I felt the light was heading. I had just left the cinema a few minutes after a short start (BTW, of course I wasn't the only one who left the room). WAAAAY was too violent for me and disgusting! I am impressed by the many brave people who really loved it. I just don't know how to love such movies! This shocking and bloody and terrible picture I saw pulled my head like two days !! I also try to analyze the story (my boy saw it all and told me about it) and I just don't think it makes sense. I mean, this amount of violence and things does not mean anything to try to shock people. And that's not, in my opinion, a good reason. In this movie, there is absolutely nothing I can say: "Well, at least the" x "thing was good". But, well, I think you never understand such movies.
