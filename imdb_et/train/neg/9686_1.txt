The writer / director Peter Greenaway quotes his title as a higher master of artistic buildings in his last practice of an uncomfortable self-perception of 8 ½ women. The film follows a prosperous English language and its son, who are seeking sexual satisfaction, because they attract and extrude women (think how much) to join their collection of personal collections. <br /> <br /> Think about the possibility that this assumption might be offensive and the opportunities Greenaway has made. Female characters are little more than the two main characters fetish directory. There's Kabo obsessed with Mio, the ever-shrinking Giaconda and Beryl, who have some farm animals. Giulietta has no legs and she is using a wheelchair, she is "half a woman", can I get it? Greenaway sharply denies all the charges in the misogynia, but if not, what is it? <br /> <br /> The film continues to eroticize everything and everything related to Japan, continuing the topic of snoring at the 1996 film, The Pillow Book. But where the cushion was erotic and graceful, 8 ½ Women just shine and exploit. The work of Greenaway is tasteless and arrogant in this fetishism, and the only person who can watch it is the authors themselves.
