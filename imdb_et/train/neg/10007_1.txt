This movie is at best mediocre. Angie Harmon is as funny as a hammer bag. His hungry behavior "Law and Order" is carried over by a failed comedy attempt. Charlie Sheen is the only one to come out in this terrible comedy. The only positive thing to get out of this mess is the marriage between Charlie and Denise. Hopefully this effort will produce better results.
