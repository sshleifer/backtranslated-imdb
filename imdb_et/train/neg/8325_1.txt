I just saw this movie last night and I was someone who had very low expectations, still frustrated. The most obvious mistake in this film torture is that the main point (who is awake during the operation) did not have the result of EI. It would have ended in the same way. So, what was that? Who knows. This surgeon also had 4 offenses against him and did not think people would ask if the patient died on his desk? Leave me alone. Jessica Alba is completely talented and Christiansen is almost as bad. The whole thing was just ridiculous from start to finish. I'm pretty sure if you feel someone is cutting your chest with a scalpel, it would be more painful.
