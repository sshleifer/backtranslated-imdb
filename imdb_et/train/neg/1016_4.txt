The film itself is not too bad; many comments have pointed to obvious shortcomings in the script, but this is traceable. What really gives me a runny nose is that people like Justin Timberlake even get movies and movies. I have to admit that I had never heard this man's name before looking at it, but as soon as he appeared, I was just annoyed. The voice is nonsense, the face of Legolas has been hanging badly, the posture is horrible and it is unable to coordinate all three correctly. I said I was glad when he jumped out after the disco, because I was hoping it would only be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. Too bad I was wrong. These two and also LL Cool J provide very decent performance and are the main reason I give it. <br /> <br /> I see a lot of upcoming movies with a little Timberlake ... and can't believe it.
