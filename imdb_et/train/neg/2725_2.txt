Chesty Gringo Tel Cooper (Frank Cooper) is a US-Mexican "Border Cop". He serves as a father's show to a young immigrant Danny De La Paz (like Benny Romero), who wants Mr. Savalas to be the best man during his upcoming wedding. Savala is tough, but the boss Eddie Albert (Commander Moffat) may be tougher. Tough is what you need to stop the smuggler Michael V. Gazzo (like Chico Suarez). Alliances can be streams. <br /> <br /> If you find the opportunity to hear "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas" to say they are repelling, you should avoid "border". If not, you may not have a "realistic" cow slaughter status. Although not worth much, Mr. De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (like Leina) are stealing an exhibition. <br /> <br /> Piir (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Saval, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
