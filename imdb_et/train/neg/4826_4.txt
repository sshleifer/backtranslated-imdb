I see what the director was trying to do, but he was left unmarked. The main actor was really good, but relocating your moments will take you out of it. The camera works, ie the lighting and the exhibitor is an amateur that I could forgive if the direction was smoother, but it wasn't. The sound was a bit off and it also takes you out of the movie. I see that this director would look a little better in the future, so it wouldn't be right, but wouldn't wait for a DVD movie almost 28 days later or anything, keep your expectations low and get more out of it. At least it was only one and a half hours. Oh yeah, and other than the driver, where the action was pretty bad when you ask me. But I'm a movie snob, so pay for it.
