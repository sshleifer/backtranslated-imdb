A sort of family parody that mixes "officer and gentleman", "heartbeat ridge", "full metal jacket" (and undoubtedly other movies I don't remember now) into a pretty boring film, with some bright spots. Gags are always where you expect them, and Damon Wayans lines are well predictable. As I said, unfortunately this movie will not surprise you ...
