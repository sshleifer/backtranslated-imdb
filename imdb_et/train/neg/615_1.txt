I have to say I like horror movies I've never seen ... but it was just pathetic for my gory taste. I am used to the usual, intestinal types ... but this particular film was flat. The action was terrible (however, the lumpy (any kind of) one-time lining was cute). And the sequel, Scarecrow Slayer was even worse! Yes, probably when it first came out, there was a huge rave and people liked it. But when films such as The Ring and Emily Rose exorcists come out, such films make such films as Scarecrow seem childish. If you just want to pass the time, select it! Special effects are fine. But when I saw it was a low budget movie, I see where it comes in. It reminds you of the "Corn of The Corn" movie. Independent movies ... mostly. So if you want to see a peacock who kills people with corncobs, or a sequel, then 2 scarfs that go, these movies would be for you.
