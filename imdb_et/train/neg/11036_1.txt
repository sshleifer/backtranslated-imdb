It must be the thinnest TV show. This is probably the escape of Jim Belush and all his bad films. His brother sucked all the younger brothers. I hope that this exhibition will be canceled and not spoken again, except for negative use. Jim has to retire or something. Please let them go in the air. When I joke about this show here and look out for the toothbrush. Id would rather take the devil himself if you look at half an hour of this programming. I still don't understand why the exhibition is still in the air and working. We all know deeply that we want to shoot our TV screens when we see Jim's face. Finally, no more.
