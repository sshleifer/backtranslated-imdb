DR. SEUSS "HOW GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS / (2000) ** (out of four) <br /> <br /> If you want to see a holiday film that inspires your seasonal alcoholic drinks and continues the traditional Dr Seuss classic fable, you won't see" Dr. Seo "How Grinch Stole Christmas." If you are old enough to read this review, you are probably too old to enjoy this movie. It includes a lot of colors, creative product development and imagination, and costume construction, joyful load noise and characters make up the real inhabitants of the fabulous village of Whoville. Unfortunately, the positive elements of the movie end; the rest of the production is nothing more than an excuse for Jim Carrey to break the screen during the evil stapling, all at the same time through a far too wide scenario with nothing to do. <br /> <br /> Many people know this story about how the ambush stole Christmas from Whoville, so I don't waste my time writing down a detailed review. I say, however, that the story of the film is performed in three main works; tube and hill, Whoville festival and Dr. The average evolution of Seuss' vision that robs his Christmas middle. There are many familiar names here, but there are no familiar faces. Like Battlefield Earth, I just can't see why manufacturers would hire expensive actors just to make their identities protected by unknown makeup and costumes. Nonetheless, SNL Molly Shannon, like Betty Lou, Bill Irwin's wife, later plays Lou Lou, a small Cindy Lou father, played by Taylor Momsen. Jeffrey Tambor is Mayor of Whoville, Anthony Hopkins lends his worshiping voice to a film narrator, and Christine Baranski is a lonely loser of Grinch. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers are trying to add the singularity of the story by adding unnecessary sub-blocks and focusing too little on Cindy Lou. The scenario of Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman seems just like everywhere in the film landscape; director Ron Howard focuses little or no, and the scenario is predictable, too broad and natural. The only characteristic character here is Grinch itself, all the other characters are plot dolls, formless and uninteresting. Dialogue is redundant and too harsh to be anything but pathetic. Example-Grinch: Oh, my mind! <br /> <br /> The film's redemption factors go to talented product developer Michael Corenblith, costume designer Rita Ryack, and a wealth of makeup department. "How Grinch Stole Christmas" is a very good-looking product. Kits and atmosphere created by filmmakers are detailed and imaginative; It's like an audience visiting the world like a dream. Whoville's people are plastered with makeup so we can't tell the actress that they are humorous. Though I dazzle, I can't really make it out because they've looked at an expensive technical department in their place. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey is one of the actors I can talk to. His production is what almost destroys the film itself. He is too egoistic, like Grinch, too exaggerated and comic to make the story recognizable as Seuss. Surprisingly, although some funny moments are due to some funny wise sequences, Jim Carry does not have to laugh at stupidity. It's almost like a movie was written specifically for Carry to play his part. This factor directs the film to a wild but meaningless comedy that is just a light shadow of the original Christmas classic "How Grinch Stole Christmas." <br /> <br /> After this movie, historians should check out a late author, Dr. Seuss, to go over his grave. <br /> <br />
