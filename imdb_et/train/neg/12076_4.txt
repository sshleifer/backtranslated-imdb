You all know the story of "Hamlet". I do. <br /> <br /> Well, the phrase "to be or not to be" (not the speech itself) is so many times over the ground that it is not very interesting (actually it wasn't so big) to get started. In FACT, I find that "Hamlet" is a good but greatly overpriced game. It's not even the best of Shakespeare: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo & Julia" are ten times better, "Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Othello" are not too far away. "Macbeth (tap your desk out of your drawers, fixes the lashes, OW!)" Not so bad. There are many others that are better than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I do not comment too much on the movie, rather than completely subtracting the terrible MST3K episode. <br /> <br /> All right. . . Mike and the bots won the card game, they can choose the movie. . . they call "Hamlet," Pearl sends them, yadda yadda yadda. . . and prepare the most boring MST3K Sci-Fi episode (indeed, I haven't seen any CC). <br /> <br /> While "Dr. Z" bloodstream makes this viewing episode terrible because it is not really a movie, rather a casual, spliced ​​with scenes (I am reminded of Mike's line "Future War": "Maybe "It's a short, meaningless movie anthology"), a lot of SOL Crew a got a lot of good cracks. The same cannot be said here. <br /> <br /> The reefs are gradually falling, the host segments (par usually) are in the best middle and if the film itself (which is not so bad) is actually better (I mean than a quality movie, not a camp, like "Space of Prince ") as its MST3K version, you know that the show must be bad. I laughed (the last time I saw it several months ago), oh, maybe eight or nine times. I tried and tried to lure me - but I just couldn't. Only a casual line, like "Hail Queen Dilberti Boss!" (and if it is a more funny line of episode, well, ahem) - and randomly, I mean every ten minutes - maybe even me. The second time I tried to look at it, I didn't even laugh at some of the jokes I found before, and just gave up forty minutes before. <br /> <br /> Film is not terrible; this is the only German version of Hamlet. The actors are good enough, and while duplication is not the biggest, it is not in itself a reason to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Hamlet"; THREE, yes three for MST3K. <br /> <br /> PS: WHY WHY WHY WHY, MST3K!
