When the film begins, the narrator warns us that sculpture is so scary that you can die to scare - and if that happens, free burial is guaranteed. Well, I don't think anybody has died of seeing this movie, but some may have died of boredom. SKRELING SKULL is a kind of film that makes Ed Wood look good. <br /> <br /> Very loudly based on the famous story of Francis Marion Crawford, SKULL is a wealthy but nervous woman who marries an unhappy man whose first wife died in a mysterious situation. When he is installed in his home, he is tortured by a half-wit gardener, a poorly executed portrait, a peacock and finally a skull that rolls around the room and causes him to scream. And for his credit, actor Peggy Webber screams quite well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, his ability to do this is the highest point in the movie. The plot is fairly transparent, at least, and although it is really okay, the script is terrible and the film is so intrusive that you're ready to scream yourself. True, it only takes about sixty-eight minutes, but it all seems much longer. Add a truly terrific print quality to it and there you are. <br /> <br /> There are so bad movies that they have fun watching. It is true that SKREAMING SKULL has a couple of carts - but the film drags so much that I couldn't work more than strangle up from time to time, and by the time the whole thing is over, it rolls by itself. If it weren't Peggy Webber's cry, it would be a sure treatment for insomnia. Give her something. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
