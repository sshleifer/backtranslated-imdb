There is no artificial value in this film that deserves prizes. Well, it doesn't deserve the audience. Ironically, one of the prizes is cinematography, but frankly, camera movements are the least worrying. Every frame you feel you get a "full picture" is like someone "cutting your view" from the edges. The story is pathetic. I'm honest, I couldn't watch the whole movie. Most of them were breastfeeding when I saw the military keep their barracks and one of the soldiers was drinking alcohol. These and many other similar scenes reminded me so much about Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> Take my advice away from this chick.
