With the same title of 1998, Michael Keaton's children's comedy was condemned because it is a dirty special effect, but compared to what Screaming Mad George has been baking for this horror comedy, they are positively annoyed. The killer snowman seems to have been made of polystyrene foam and his hands look like excess furnaces. What they probably were. Cast on puts this thickness in this parody with dozens of other (much worse) films and Paul Keith, as the city doctor is especially memorable in a small but fun role.
