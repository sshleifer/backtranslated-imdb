When I saw this "documentary", I was disappointed to see Serbian propaganda once again. Although Serbia and its nationalist policy are the main cause of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, it is not mentioned in this "documentary" by Bogdanovich, whose name tells us that he is Serbia and his film that he is far from objective. This is one of the lies that the Milosevic regime pushed. All others are guilty only of the Serbs were the right and the victims, although most of the war criminals who were caught in The Hague are Serbs, although the Serbs have committed a genocide against Bosnia and attacked Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia. UN.Breakup Yugoslavia could not be avoided because the Serbs did not want to release their nationality to a federal government in Yugoslavia, so that SLOVENIA, CROATIA, MACEDONIA and Bosnia were forced to defend their interests as independent states. is interested in an objective documentary on the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the fact that the documentary is not so. You should look at "Yugoslavia: the Death of the People", the Made by Discovery Channel and the BBC.
