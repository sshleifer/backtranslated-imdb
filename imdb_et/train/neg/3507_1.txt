Maysles Brothers reached a low point in human communication with this film. Remember that those who used words like "a masterpiece" when watching this movie did not happen to these Maysles just to lead the Hamptons and to film some eccentric people. No, if they found the two bad pathetic people they had to finance their project (and imagine what they sold to people for money). Then they got together with two extremely vulnerable women. There are no meetings or real consent here. These criminals smiled at Maysles, kissed the ass, did everything they needed to collaborate with Beales and then exploit it as cruelly as ever. I would like to think that these husters sometimes had a way of thinking and guilt. However, the film making process, taking into account pre-planning, actual shooting, and then editing, took a lot of time, and their purpose was not to include provisions about what really is associated with Beales as a human being. The film worst for people. Because over time, the reputation of these films has been seriously stained, what they did here. Their reputation as a person is disastrous. People remember them. Grotesque.
