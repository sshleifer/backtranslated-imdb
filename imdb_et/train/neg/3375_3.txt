Hi, All, When you saw "Sing in the Rain", you remember the dance of Gene Kelly. You also remember Donald O'Connor's dance number, "Make" laugh. "If you saw" Royal Wedding, "you remember Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling. When you saw" Jailhouse Rock, "you even remember the king's own choreographer's title number. <br /> <br /> It's missing here. There could have been some numbers of strokes in this presentation. The closest was Chuck McGowan "I can do it." The mere fact that you have some talented people moving together does not make a great dance film. Richard Attenborough was guilty of this failure. and it would be good. <br /> <br /> Calling people who participate in Broadway production is not entertainment. Michael Douglas would be just as badly cast as he would be in the West or in comedy. Michael Douglas in the movie where we see him yelling at someone we'd like to be bullied. It doesn't work here. <br /> <br /> Of course the cast was good, except Michael. if d anyone should have thought about how to film it. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
