I'm a big fan of Troma, but I can't figure out why they bought the rights to this movie. It's so boring that I felt like I was watching for 3 hours. Some people who say in the plot summary, "but what does Satan not know that he is stuck with distracting tourists" Well they didn't know him in the movie, but I did. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays Satan, I like a bad movie, but it was just boring.
