This is a typical low budget confusion of the 1970s. It should be docudrama about team hunting Bigfoot through Pacific Northwest. Every character is a stereotype, from the Indians to the cowboy. Action and narration are a complete joke. If you hope to see a lot of bigfoot materials - hope. There's not much, and what you could do in your backyard with a cheap costume and camcorder; it would look better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that I don't like the low ticket price of the 1970s; I do. It is that it is both bad deeds, bad signs, bad story and not excitement that you just can't enjoy. It does not fit in the "as bad as good" category nor laughs at how bad it is without the help of illegal substances. This is mostly boring film material for people who hike, hike, ride and watch wildlife. There is a great assault that is completely stupid; Supposedly our friend Sasquatch throws the climbers down when they shoot their rifles back. By this time you are rooted in big legs to lower some stones on the filmmaker's heads and stop the whole thing.
