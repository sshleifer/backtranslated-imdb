Pop-ups represent some difficult hitters in the local and regional film and television world. And yet, they can't save that movie. It has so many things that are against it - over-action, too melodramatic, bad script, inconsistent direction; and too few things for it - decent music, good cinematography. This comment is mainly for everyone who, after watching this movie, throws all the local movies in one basket and says that all local movies are bad. Please do not decide the rest on the basis of this movie. This is a romantic feature film. My hopes were high when I bought the ticket and my hopes were put on the film in five minutes.
