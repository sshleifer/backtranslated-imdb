This review is based on a duplicated Shock-o-Rama video that was released in 2002 for an unwelcome world. How bad is it? It's terrible, which is what "1" represents on the IMDb scale - but it is much worse than that. It is nice to imagine that the original German edition can improve things - comic English copying is not funny at all, but really, it is one of the worst genre amateur movies you probably see. The film's zombies are so slow and awkward as ever, and they don't seem to have the ability to speak or think anything but their next meal. However, they are also intelligent enough to work with chainsaws and malicious to find out that Western taboos related to genitals undoubtedly revive their dinner table conversation. George Romero's dead time put the zombie people who maintained social cohesion; Here, the zombies are nothing but an empty canvas for the unimaginable imagery of director Andreas Schnaas. Without any redemption of social value, and worse, completely absent from entertainment, Zombie '90 is a bad joke for anyone who wastes money.
