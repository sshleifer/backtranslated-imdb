It was a terrible movie. There was no story. First off, if they couldn't explain the blood and gore (the only good part) ... they threw a foreigner! I hate if directors (or any) ideas run out and blame foreigners! Watch this movie if you like. But don't say I didn't warn you. Two Things: How could Vinny say "welcome" if she didn't have a language? I regret that Mr Jones did not play a greater role. Another thing that made me mistake, why did we show Vinny Jones cooking and cutting it and taking the blue liquid, then they have no role yet. Why not? I don't like to show anything and it has nothing to do with the story. In short. Bad story. I'm not wasting my time - I'd like to have mirrors tracked.
