Alone in the dark, one of my favorite role-playing games. I remember spending the whole evening on the computer screen, trying to escape from this mansion and actually being amazed at the times when the monsters came to surprise charge. Now, remember - I'm tired of "computer game" movies. I don't remember any successful story in this new Hollywood genre, although some are fun enough to be seen. And yet, I'm so big a fan that I couldn't resist. My logic was that if the film had a graph that was so similar to the game, it would be OK. Man, they were 90 minutes (which looked like 300) in my life that I never get back. If I had this opportunity, I would have gladly spent them on reorganizing my socket drawer. It's not even "so bad in this funny" category. You would think that even Christian Slater was a little more meaningful than joining this stink bomb. Now, Tara Reid ... I'm not complaining about her presence. But if this is the sex life in the chick's head - which I fully understand and support (hey, I'm a man!) - I've seen more of my body at press conferences. <br /> <br /> There is no plot to talk about. Don't waste your time to give it to you. The credibility of the story falls below: “I have not had sex pr. With Lewinski ”. Action is just a few notches above "Street Fighter", which by the way, being one of the worst films I've seen, would recommend it. Kids, I recommend the Video Game. It has a much better story, action and much more excitement. As for the film, here's the spoiler - it's TEXT! Wait for the porn version.
