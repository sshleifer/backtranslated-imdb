It's a pretty boring film about a scientist who creates a teleporter device and gets terribly confused when he uses the machine for transport. Simple plot before flying and others. Not only can he get confused, he can also disable people with disabilities. What's really stupid about this film is that we think the place where this man works is against him. He can probably make a million to whom he works, but the head of the institution is trying to sabotage his teleporter at every step. Finally, the projected person flows three people for no reason and goes after those who have wronged him.
