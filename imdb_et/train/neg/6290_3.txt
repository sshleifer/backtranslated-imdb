Recap: Ron is going to marry Mel. They are deep and loving and confident that they are compatible with each other, even though they only met a few months ago. Todd, Ron's brother-in-law to be so happy. She is afraid that marriage is a threat to her mild work in a family business and decides to organize Ron's bachelor's evening. But his real plan is to make Ron's compromises, get evidence and break Ron and Mel. <br /> <br /> Comments: should be a classic comedy, but it's not funny at all. This is mostly a show of puberty and a pretext for minors to show little clad women. In fact, in some ways, it is almost impressive that many can get in there because they are everywhere. Unfortunately, this is also a sign of a movie that cannot support itself. It just isn't good enough. <br /> <br /> He still has three redemption points, or actually three actors worth a better script. This is the head of actor Josh Cooke, who can actually understand common sense. Sara Foster, I know, has more talent than making such films, and Emanuelle Vaugier seems to have much more talent than this film. <br /> <br /> What is suspiciously deficient is good jokes. In fact, bad jokes are too small. It's not just funny. <br /> <br /> 3/10
