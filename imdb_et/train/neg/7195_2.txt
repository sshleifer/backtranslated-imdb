Disney did it again. The company that made "Magoo" and "Jungle George" has made another movie that is hardly similar to the drawing on which it is based and retains the original spirit. <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" was one of my favorite cartoons when I was young, and the existence of this movie could have been a dream. Now that this movie is there, I was seriously disappointed, even outraged. <br /> <br /> First we have characters. <br /> <br /> The gadget has its own gadgets that made it an original comic (with its well-made special effects) as such a fun character, and even has some original gadget naive, but now it is more competent and expected to settle the crime itself, when Penny and Brain are just watching. /> <br /> Penny has little to do; although he played an important role in the comic, discovered and stopped the crime, and sometimes seized these MAD agents, he is now simply introduced and forgotten, even though he at least gets into Claw's base. <br /> <Br /> Claw is the movie version of Dr. Claw, who was a pretty bad, dirty man who wore metal gloves and sat in his chair, with a hidden view of his face as he struck his cat and watched various crimes. Now he is just a man with a hand who has no secret behind the character. <br /> <br /> The brain and the crazy cat are in the movie, but are relatively insignificant. <br /> <br /> Even a small part of the comic is not spared in this muscle. The famous expression "Wowsers!" it was mysteriously changed to "Wowser" and Gadgetmobile widget now looks different and talks. <br /> <br /> There are even product approvals everywhere. Why Yahoo! advertised on the label? Why are Gadgetmobile buttons for M&M or skitles? <br /> <br /> Copy fans hate it, others may be able to find a movie below par., and when all is said and done, this movie is another attempt to make some quick bucks at another old show.
