There are bad movies, terrible movies, even boring movies ... I get the most look and finish, not this time. Avoid it like a plague, irritating music all the time, terrible editing, comedy, it's more sticky than a novel mug ... My missus wanted to look at that thinking that would be legally Blonde material or something observable, but never better than average. female film. The first time he asked me to press the stop button. <br /> <br /> Girls, well, they weren't very good at starting (Denise made Starship Troopers and Wild in OK), but you've sunk in the mug. I feel like a mug that spent 30 minutes on this ... Pamela Anderson is almost unknown after her face. <br /> <br /> Please take my advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen and brain cells by telling you the full length of your screen.
