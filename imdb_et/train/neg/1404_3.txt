Arthur Askey's great comic was how he communicated with his public. His juvenile jokes, foolish songs and dancing dances went well because he managed to engage the people and pull them out of the wall of the world. The lack of a lively audience was a special disadvantage for him and he was never quite comfortable in the movies. He has his moments The Ghost Trainis and his character Tommy Gander is tailored to give his talent the best, but Askey's speaker was to be welcomed. <br /> <br /> Askey's support film is not strong, it includes regular co-star Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as an odd honeymoon couple; Linden Travers goes over "mad wife". Also on board is Peter Murray-Hill, married to Phyllis Calvert as a nominee leading person, giving a partially gentle reading and leading woman Carol Lynne, who turns to an equally precarious performance. Literary actor Kathleen Harrison leaves a parrot-loving woman who gets into the brand of Dr. Morland Graham to steal the movie effortlessly.
