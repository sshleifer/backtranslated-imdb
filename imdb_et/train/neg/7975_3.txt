When I was sitting in front of the TV watching this movie, I thought, "Oh, what Alfred Hitchcock or even Brian DePalma could have done!" Chances are, well. It starts intrigue. The British Parkman (Collin Firth), living in Los Angeles, marries a beautiful, insecure brunette woman (Lisa Zane) whom she met in the park only a while ago. Then, one day, he disappears. The police cannot find any documents he has ever found, and Firth is conducting his own search. So far, it's okay. Just as he gives up, he turns to his wife's best friend (Billy Zane), and they stumble with the former life of LA's drugs, nightclubs and bodybuilding, and then in the history of his mental instability. At this point, Firth's life is in danger and the film breaks down. No Lisa Zane's past characters are far from interesting. The film is moving slowly and there are very few actions. Missing drug money is a sub-block, but it's just bursting. There are no intermediate, stapling sequences or intercourse. Just some dull beats and a lot of chattering with boring characters. One thing worth noting is Lisa Zane and Billy Zane brothers and sisters, but they're never together in the scene. At the end of the movie, you get distracted by not knowing what might have been and trying to stay awake.
