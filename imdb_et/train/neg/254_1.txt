Ah, Bait. How do I hate you? Let me read you. 1. You are trying to be funny, but you are bright and enjoyable; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to throw. 2. Try to be dramatic, but incredible; The woman is moving terribly, and the "bad boy" looks like Bill Gates and is as scary as ... well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine Bill Gates trying to intimidate someone with a gun. It doesn't work, is it? Maybe a lawyer, but not a weapon. Not suitable.) For Jamie Foxx, just looking at him to try a dramatic and cordial dialogue is ridiculous and makes me want. 3. You try to be packed, but you are dim and you drag too many times. And when the action is warmed up, the camera's tripod needs to be lost because the scenes are absorbed more than the Blair witch project, and I find myself nauseous and again wanting to cheer. 4. You are trying to be a good movie, but you couldn't, you couldn't, YOU RESPONDED! I'd rather walk barefoot over the Sahara with a pack full of beef and not water, no sunscreen, and only Meryl Streep. This hell would be more pleasant than one minute spent watching all of Bait's way through an idiotically written story where Bill Gates is a bad guy, and don't even talk about the massive bomb that has just been driving off CLIFF in Jamie Foxx's characteristic car but somehow succeeds Escape ... just kill me now or do the right thing and let me never need to ever watch this movie.
