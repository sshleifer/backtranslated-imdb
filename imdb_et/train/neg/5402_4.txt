This movie is so incredible; - The whole assumption is bunk; The fact that a serum killer (vampire or otherwise) can fly around that is lost and killing as many people as the movie means is ridiculous. The Vampire himself would not see Bela Lugos' film inappropriate. Most practices are so wooden that the participants need to be dried dry. I'm looking forward to a day when someone makes a movie about Steven King's novel (except Stand by Me if possible). This film suffers for most of Stephen King's films - lack of money used for "special effects", poor players, terrible characterization and dialogue. This film is cheap, sticky and fails in everything it tries to do.
