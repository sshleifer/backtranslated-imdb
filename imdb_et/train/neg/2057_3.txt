Sorry to go against the stream, but I thought this movie was unreal, boring and too long. I was tired of watching Gena Rowlands a long hard battle with her and the crisis she was experiencing. Perhaps the film has some cinematic value or it is an important step for the director, but I would have liked to miss it for the value of pure entertainment.
