What happened to this movie, so that it ended as a mess? Just one year later, "The Breakfast Club", a brilliant film with many of the same actors as "St. Elmo's Fire" (who, by the way, saw and acted more like they were still in their former school words) but without a handle or a discipline in their roles. <br /> <br /> Whether it was management or writing because it was the same person (Joel Schumacher), it must be both. Opera Phantom, "Phone Cabinet", "Time to Kill" and Two Batman Movies, "Batman and Robin" and "Batman Forever", from Good to Great Leadership. it has no genes, something worthy of comedy, and it is very far from being truly valuable in life. <br /> <br /> Example: character Wendy (a rich little girl with a heart who does good and helps the less lucky Mare Winningham played) shows Billy (a troubled slut who cheats her wife and her girlfriends, drinking too much m uch and he has no order in his life that Rob Lowe played enough) that he is still a virgin. Billy really looks like a challenge and a possible conquest, but Wendy is "not ready". Wendy, actually not so prepared, it's hard to believe she's in this fellowship. Later the story, when Billy, whose wife has left her, took her child and married another, has somehow drawn some strings of her life together. Billy leaves in New York, deserting and giving up parental responsibility for her child's daughter, convincing Wendy that her virginity would be the perfect "gift of leaving" for her. And Wendy, who works as a social assistant for crushed families, seems to be not a gradual despot at all. Leave me alone. One thing he can only give once gives him to the loser who leaves his family and friends? Schumacher frames this scene for a wonderful and moving moment. <br /> <br /> Many more examples exist when there is a complete interruption between what is real and the value that is aboard the ship, and the actions look like a round. br /> <br /> I think some may say "it was 80s" but I remember that in the "80s" men were responsible for the children they were married or out of. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is so bad that it is so in sync when it's really valuable and right. <br /> <br /> As for the technique (not the story), it was terrible. It's divorced and looks like a 3-hour movie, modified for 1 hour and 40 minutes. Transitions and jumps over time just don't make sense. Pick what's on the floor of the editing room, put it back and the movie will probably flow much better ... but it's still a terrible movie. since 1986 (he must be) or maybe he was over head when he came to write St Elmo's fire scenario, or maybe this group took over and went his way - that's what I really thought happened.
