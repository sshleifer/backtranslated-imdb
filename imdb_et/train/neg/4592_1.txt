This movie made me very angry. I desperately wanted "scientists" and without seeing the filmmakers in the process. Very, very painful to sit. Sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way. Little good information on brain function / chemistry and quantum theory is lost on the sea of ​​a new aging horse *. The worst criminals were the crack-pot charlatans Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza. Mr. Dispenza tells us that most people live mediocre and clearly show that on the other hand he lives on a higher plane. Even the ideas and attitudes that I agree with in principle are presented in such a difficult hand, clumsy, superior, pretentious and sermon, that I felt the desire to take them away. I think it made me so angry, the fact that they have taken the deep deep aspects of proven scientific thought and violated them with their new age hockey. Much of this is due to the implementation of the concepts of quantum theory in the macro world. Marlee Matlin's dramatic parts are suitably amateur and cliché-driven. There is a lot of deep wonder in the life and the universe of real and well-established science.
