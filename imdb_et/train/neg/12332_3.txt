The film looks like paper. The romantic comedy, where a frantic lover is pulled into a smuggling thriller, should be a generic cross-breeding gold, especially with its excellent romcomic pain. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid Lawrence Kasdan will just give his two stars a lot of rope though and they will go and hang themselves. The Adam Brooks script can be guilty, but wait from the right Kevin Kline for A Fish called Wanda. Instead, the two ping pongs are far apart and the unlikely growing romance has ever been satisfactorily satisfied because one of them is round and striking in France. <br /> <br /> Jean Reno is friendly with - the heart and I think he wants him to be a star-a. Remember that she went on to make their pink panther remake (s) so she might have been there ... 3/10
