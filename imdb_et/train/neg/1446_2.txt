The film is an extraordinarily long story about a classic novel that cannot fully capture the original adventure spirit. Amazingly, American Patrick Swayze is the British hero Allan Quatermain, despite the obviousity of his citizenship. <br /> <br /> The film continues throughout Hollywood's story by changing both the plot and the characters to better match the approved mold. The film can be predicted all the time, even for those who are not familiar with the story and who are suffering from some extremely bad behavior and a terrible frustrating struggle. <br /> <br /> All in all, the horrible addition is already a bad set of films based on King Soloman's mines and the legend of Allan Quaterman.
