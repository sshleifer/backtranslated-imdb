Here are a few previous comments about the numerous clich√©s in this flick - and I fully agree with both the characters and the dialogue. <br /> <br /> I read Elizabeth Berkly's terrible performance in the equally horrible "Showgirls" I've never seen - and her performance, though not terrible, is barely up to Lifetime's worse price standards. There was no deep hint of his character, but he would probably not have been. If so, it would have left the film completely unbalanced, because no sign, performer, or depiction was in depth or charisma - no trace. <br /> <br /> Treating the initial attack by attacker Liz after his instructor had hit him in the hall was ridiculous. Also, his wife's initial reaction and advice (Forrest Gump, attacked by Jenny's boy in his car, offering more realistic, intelligent action, and hell, he was a mental challenge). <br /> <br /> Smarmy, a sensible lawyer (apologize for the redundancy), a father who lied to his father, did in fact make something obviously worthwhile: he was both ridiculous and annoying. His lawyer was a more unknown nerd, who was also unknown to the profession. <br /> <br /> Finally (and frankly, I enjoyed this part), the police was such a set of unknown oaks that rather Barney Fife, without Andy, depends on all his law enforcement and investigation in your community. I know that most real similar police officers fall to a slightly higher level than most of the symbols in the "Law and Order" series and others, but the bucks in that level seem to have ultimately found some "story" fascinated by Josh that he was his teacher "victim". This scripted presentation containing the story was even worse than its overall result in the basic guide. It was something of an accomplishment, like "F" - "F-minus". <br /> <br /> This whole flat situation should have been solved - in real life - in about 15 minutes after a realistic meeting between teachers and school authorities involved with the spouse. But then it would have ruled out a dramatic drama and left a one hour blank movie on the camera. <br /> <br /> But the writer (s) proved their end to make them even worse. When the situation was finally "solved" and "justified", it was all achieved in about 45 seconds, without mentioning what action might have taken in the "real world" of the criminal and his parents, or whether they could have found any way of redemption. <br /> <br /> This is a 2 * presentation; another "*" because it has some "charm".
