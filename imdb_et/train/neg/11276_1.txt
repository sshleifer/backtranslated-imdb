I'm not wasting my time writing something beyond the aspect of every movie inexplicably bad. This has been done many times in great detail. The start of the plot was a very uninspiring, wide-ranging guy / gangster-by-number of chefs, which was very quick and descended into the very perfect generations. Anyone pretending to see masterpieces hidden in this terrible confusion is just a joke. It is now 7 or 8 years after I watched it in a 1 week movie before it was pulled out, but it seems to me to be the most terrible movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I only make these comments and the only reason I saw the movie is that I have the fun of having my brother Eddie appear in this audience's scene as another "heavy". It was his hands, which pushed Rhys Ifan's face toward zippo more easily in a "Russia" bar (it was actually filmed in a former Butin holiday camp on Barry Island). My brother had no way of doing things - he had recently joined an ancillary agency and it was his first part. Having seen the film, it turned out that no one needed action. <br /> <br /> I remember there were about 8 people in the entire cinema - and that was just a few days after it was released. I've never heard of another movie that was so unpopular and disappeared so quickly - and right. If you were thinking of renting this movie on a DVD, I would rather put your two pound coins on fire until they are red, and then hit them in the eye sockets. This is probably much less painful than watching a movie.
