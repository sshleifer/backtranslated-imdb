* Can include a spoiler? * Just mentioning Crispin Glover is enough to send some geek panties to the cluster. His landmark appears back in the future when George McFly has put him in American conscience. Recently, he has tried to regain his subconscious culture with Bartleby and Willard. <br /> <br /> This time Crispin has made a 76-minute cheap dada movie. Sometimes it reminded me of genius, while it was almost offended by me, but not because of its content. Content? What is this? is a movie where on one side of the film all the participants have Down syndrome, which gives him a sense of thought. The other half of the film includes Crispin Glover, Adam Parfrey and a brain-paralyzed man. All this seemed like what John Waters was trying to do with Desperate Living, and at the same time feeling more successful and unhappy. <br /> <br /> Half of Down's Syndrome has many killed works. This is a guy with deeds and ends with one kill. He is also tortured by a number of other people and grasshoppers. She falls in love with 2 girls, one of whom is sex with the graveyard. He's also falling with a friend who is tempting him. <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover is the head of this exhibition in the strange half-interior set. He is something that controls the man's mind, and the brain paralysis of man is sexuality. Well, she at least masturbates in explicit scenes. There are other "shocking" shapes made humorous, such as the Nazi Swastika, which went to Shirley's temple and black faces, saying they were Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> In the rest of the world, the tormentor is still engaged in the killings of killing and beating other people. They beat him with stones and so on. Later they beat the minstrel after the trial. <br /> <br /> Back to the interior, Crispin Glover is still the master of your set and is trying to control everyone but can't fail. <br /> <br /> What is it? is less meaningful than Dr. Caligari and has more than a transient style. The clusterophobic spiritual space is very similar to the way that Dr Caligar's no-wall kits knew claustrophobic. They also had some dialogue that was an absolute mess. And all this was packed with humor with absurd images. <br /> <br /> The problem is about 20 minutes of film ... maybe a little more ... What's this? the pictures end. In the next 56 minutes, we will continue with the same set of images, presenting only new images in the form of an absurd puppet theater. The film seems a bit more like a film that tries to push the envelope into offensive and taboo images. He tries to get the audience to look and confuse. The question is, however, that for a 40-minute movie it is quite different. <br /> <br /> Even worse than cinematography, the set design and everything else seemed very cheap and almost unplanned. It seemed like "OK, that's how we can do it and get on the road." It didn't look interesting and was quite boring. Dr Caligar, on the other hand, had amazing cinematography and framing. The difference between the two is quite amazing. <br /> <br /> Rating: C
