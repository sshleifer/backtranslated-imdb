A real disappointment with the great visual master Ridley Scott. G.I. Jane talks about the first female woman who has gone through the hellish training of the Navy SEALs. Training is the hardest and hardest thing to do when the instructor tells the story of O'Neil played by Demi Moore. There is no specific message or point in this movie or I could not achieve it properly. It may be some kind of statement about women's rights and abilities, but it all falls into tired scenes and foolish arms at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> I really don't understand why Ridley uses so much to increase the last weapon battle mentioned in the desert?! It seems so stupid and irritating and almost amateurish, so I really want to know what the director saw in this technique. When I look at my latest film, Black Hawk Dawn, there is nothing wrong with the scenes of the battle (which are many) and they are very intense and skilled. G.I. Jane looks ugly and is nothing but stupid and pointless shooting and killing. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, the worst film by Ridley Scott and there are no significant touches known by this great director. However, I'm glad to see it in widescreen format because there are still some great scenes and Scott's abilities, but these are very few in this movie. <br /> <br /> Frustration and Something Compared to the Classical Its a talented driver (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, alien and so on). So I'm forced to give G.I. Jane 4/10.
