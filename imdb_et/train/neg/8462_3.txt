"Bullfighter" was made in 2000, but it is published for some reason in the video 5 years later. Interesting why? Could it be: a confusing story, incomprehensible dialogue by Oliver Martinez, and annoying editing? It must be. I think the plot was a mysterious journey by Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacque (Oliver Martinez). They meet many nervous characters and also avoid some evil ones. The film looks good and has a lot of style, but it doesn't. Most movies, trying to stay fine, do not pay attention to the development of the unanswered plot and the weak special effects. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by this: Willem Dafoe is the biggest in this two minutes.
