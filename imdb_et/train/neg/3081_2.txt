Good sadness! Although I still claim that Manos: the hands of destiny are the worst mental torture, Hobgoblins came terribly close. It ... this ... thing offends the audience every opportunity. <br /> <br /> At least movies like Space Mutiny and Future War can be enjoyed in mst3k, it was a trick to go through. I was literally tired on the couch. This thing managed to embarrass me alone. <br /> <br /> Even if you are a tough MST3K fan and you have seen every experiment for your mission, think twice about seeing it. <br /> <br /> It's so bad.
