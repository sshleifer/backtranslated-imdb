I don't think you'll get that much worse. Put together the bad actors, the fake limbs and the three foolish stories and what do you get? This B-course nonsense excuse for the film. <br /> <br /> The first story shows the quality of the bad video right now, and acting is simply very pathetic, especially when you bring a grandmother of 25 years with grandmother usually over her grandmother's bun ears. Plus, the man is fine, but the woman is pretty ugly. "You look good!" NO! The werewolf was the best of all three, but I'm still not impressive because it was all a bad costume. The woman's face later was good enough for halloween but not for werewolf movie. <br /> <br /> The more stories you go, the worse. Next, there are two lesbians who are completely ridiculous. "I also want a werewolf" "How do you do it for me?" It was stupid to say. You asked for it now! The werewolf doesn't even talk about it ... its a rat! <br /> <br /> The third one makes no sense ... almost forty-five minutes of running and boring narration make this story and the whole switch thing didn't make it interesting. Bored! <br /> <br /> Music, yes, bad ... who couldn't even hear that it was stupid. The effect of the animals was either a rat or a pig that was stupid. Couldn't they use lion sounds? Guess, good movies are using it. Well, i = f enjoy B rates that are good for you. I got this movie because I'm a fan of hardcore werewolves and I buy all the werewolves movie and watch it more than once, but just me. If you prefer good, don't waste your money. I ask you!
