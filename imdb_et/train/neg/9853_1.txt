I think most everyone wants to believe that there are extraordinary things, and this film does not see any restriction to make full use of it. The presentation is very interesting, well presented and the graphics are modern, but from a scientific point of view it just doesn't work. Hydrogen filled bladders? These Mack truck sizes would be useful. And then there is a constant catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with fantasy, just don't try to really exclude it. Some people always misunderstand. All in all, the movie is entertaining, but I found myself constantly saying, "Oh brother, what is the burden ....". If you want a FAKE documentary, look instead for it as a spinal cord. Or at least turn off the sound.
