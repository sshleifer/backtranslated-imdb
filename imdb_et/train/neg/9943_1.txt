Covering a man with a scary pellet gun would make him like a martial arts film. (Hardly) <br /> <br /> I think the real title of the movie is a Trojan warrior. (Trojan is a US trademark for condoms) This movie is full of homo eroticism. If you like this stuff, this movie is not so bad. However, consider these points: <br /> <br /> There are numerous close-ups of the actors' nose and pants, (one scene even includes all the actors whose pants are upright). colors like lime, peach and red. From the film artist's point of view, this movie is a dropping queen! Several scenes characterize each other with extremely close signs that sometimes touch when they talk. The hero also loves cousin women and every other man in the movie tries to kill him. Is there a message here that filmmakers want to convey? <br /> <br /> Should I get into scenes? (Yes, someone's private parts get one fight.) Scenes of martial arts are short and unimaginable. There are no fancy things here, but your usual moves that you would see in old Chuck Norris. There's also a car chase that may be the first LOW-speed movie to track.
