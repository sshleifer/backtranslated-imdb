I was able to hang the first twenty minutes of this low budget movie. The most conspicuous absurdity was that while American detainees in the North Korean military camp were allegedly suffering from strong food and medical deprivation, they go without swimming, shaking thin and filthy parks and sleeping on bare floors and - forget permanent torture - they always succeed sportily tempered hair exercise. Except for seeing a suitable oyster, Harry Morgan, as a major army, is simply terrible in casting and acting. Ronald Regan does not seem to be stuck in depicting one character and instead creates a schizophrenic amalgam of earlier roles. Mostly Caucasian cast depicted North Korean camp officers could have been forgiving, but if allegedly Russian officers, acting as Korean advisers, carry around the knitted Nazi uniforms that were full of jodhpurs and jackboots (the obvious costume department circulating around the Second World War) and Hogan speaking of heroes to shareholders like General Burkhalter, it is just six kinds of silly. Don't waste your time on it.
