Martin Kosleck's peculiar charisma brings a certain belief in the character of a disappointed artist. He sucks his dialogue with a strange reality, making sculptor Marcel a convincing person. A real person manages to meet a real person rather than a typical B-film cable. <br /> <br /> The story is something to write home, and many scenes are boring. What makes it work is strange chemistry between Koslecki and Rondo Hatton as a dwarf. The Koslecki-speaking, philosophical character is at odds with Hatton's low-key monosilic approach. Creeper's character has not evolved much further than the main monster, but Hatton suggests untapped opportunities and makes you think about your back story. <br /> <br /> This movie was a lot at the Shock Theater when I was a boy, so I have some nostalgic love for it. For those who enjoy the forties horror films, it is worth seeing once.
