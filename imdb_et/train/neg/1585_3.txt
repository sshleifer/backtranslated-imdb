::: SPOILER ALERT ::: <br /> <br /> Soooo, Arnie is really a good boy, but after an incident where some fight in a helicopter and some revenge, he sends him to a prison (or rather a camp). He escapes, but after a short time he is caught again. This time, it comes to an amazing reality, where it should run for some time with different boys from harsh boys and eventually die. But we all know Arnie, and we all know he's tougher than even tougher boys. <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie, being an Arnie fan and everything. At the same time, "Running Man" contains too many bugs that will bother me. For example, the Arnie fight in a helicopter, where a shocked audience gets a brief summary of the incident, with 5-10 different camera angles. This means that the military helicopter where Arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras that filmed crew members, one of whom is one of the team members' eyes Arnie wins. <br /> <br /> There are other mistakes, and the plot, which theoretically seems to be very interesting and innovative, works for a while, it creates a kind of fool and unreality, where it drops. <br /> <br /> Functioning can't really be said to be better than al par, with Arnie playing a leading role in making average Arnie performance. The rest is poured out without being particularly good or bad. <br /> <br /> Special effects are OK without impressive effects. <br /> <br /> EVALUATION: 3/10
