King Maker is a film about the real (citation needed) events that occurred during the Portuguese occupation in Indochina. <br /> <br /> Although the costumes and the artistic direction are commendable, the film still cannot impress the viewer. . Particularly, it was extremely bad. Some actors are trying to tear down and the accents, both actual and false, are extremely irritating. The story was also too stupid and too stupid to be true and it seemed like a lesson in history. The film was not even able to capture such a regal and century-old air, and it seemed like a botched attempt to make Elizabeth's Asian version. <br /> <br /> Final say? Costumes and artistic direction give the film fresh air, but the filling was extremely poor and the actors couldn't even give natural emotions. In short, this movie sounded more like a script.
