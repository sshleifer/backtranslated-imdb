Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others are on this film. It's a curious WW2 movie and it's a statement about racism. It is worth checking out to understand that movies reflect how we feel about the issues that arise, not the time they represent. That means it's 70's movies, not 40 years old (WW2). However, there are some seven black black men in good scenes, led by a white captain who tries to catch the dam. The story focuses on the captain that these men are soldiers and not just a service company. There is a scene that could be a movie about a civil war and not a WW2 movie that reflects what the film is about. Black Lt gives a German woman a cheeky butt and a white captain gets irritated. I enjoyed the film's curiosity from the stand because the stars and the genre were interesting to me.
