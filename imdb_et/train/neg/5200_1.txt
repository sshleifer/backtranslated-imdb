This movie is very bad. I've seen better movies. <br /> <br /> There was some tension, but not much to jump out of your chair. It starts slowly with tension. What's not successful. At least when you ask me. Although at some points or moments I have to say that it was a little funny when people shot and how they fell. <br /> <br /> They should have done it like a Scary Movie, so it might be a better movie. Because I watched only a piece of film by skipping scenes and it was boring through the movie. I have to say I was dreaming of watching this movie, so I can definitely say it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time even thinking about doing this movie, besides when it is already. Somewhere very dusty.
