This is one of those dramas that are so bad that it almost hits a very funny point, the script is absolutely terrible, the direction is terrible, it illuminates purely the armature, the only thing that makes it so bad that it is good that sound design is good is just quite bad; it does not give the story a tense effort, but does not destroy at least the calls. Problems of continuity of the seasons of the entire door. Last but not least, it is terrible. For professional production, it is very familiar with the university's media project, which you must apologize for, to the detriment of anyone who had to write their names on it.
