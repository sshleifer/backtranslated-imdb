For such a great classical story, Grendel was disappointing. As a writer, I blame a script that did not have completely dramatic tension. The club story is useful and would have created a new literary classic. For some strange reason, the heading fell early. To know it in 21 days, tells me, "hurried" and it shows unfortunately. Now we have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I'm talking about FX, I can withstand CGI, but the script must be rock and it was just too slow, spartan and lacking in drama. I blame it for the actors, but ... because I know I write more than acting, I choose my colleague.
