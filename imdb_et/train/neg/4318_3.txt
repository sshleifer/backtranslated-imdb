I thought it was one of the most depressing films I've ever seen - others are Christmas holidays and JACK FROST. All three movies are about death. If you like to be deeply depressed, watch this movie or some other. In this film the actor is good and some landscapes (except people who die) are cute. But I'm worried that a clinically depressed person can accidentally see and make a movie! Despite the end of "happily ever after", much of this movie is a sudden disaster that follows another. And for some crazy reason, I don't want to look at a Christmas movie (I know it sounds crazy - it's no longer an eye-catcher and you feel sad about what the holidays are anyway?). <br /> <br /> For a more uplifting experience, try the forgotten HOUSE without Christmas TREE, George C. Scott instead of Christmas CAROL or Christmas Carol - if of course you like to be unhappy.
