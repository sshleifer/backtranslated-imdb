It was never a meaningless experience in animation films, but it certainly cannot be admired if it tries to be good. Along with Dreamworks animation and computer graphics, this is a mustang, later called Spirit (Matt Damon, giving the first person's story), and his journey through the old western borders. Basically, he was born free from all other horses in a beautiful countryside, then he was kidnapped as a saddle-hug, he could throw away anyone trying to drive him. But when he escapes from his cage, along with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), they make up two friendships, oh, and he probably has a little thing on Little Creek's female horse. Finally, after some new escape that the Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men are pursuing, and the ultimate leap over the devil, Little Creek lets go of the spirit and also releases his female horse and runs to his homeland and their horses. Also starring Chopper Bernet is Sgt. Adams, Jeff LeBeau as Murphy / Railroad Foreman, John Rubano as Soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin Joe. I was waiting to see the horses in this movie, but it turns out that it's more like a Dumbo thing, and Bryan Adams songs aren't the most interesting, but it's not a terrible movie. It was the best animated contest for the Oscar title, and this Golden Globe was named Bryan Adams '' Here I am '' Best Song. Okay!
