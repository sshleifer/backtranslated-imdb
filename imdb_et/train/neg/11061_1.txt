Curiosity led me to this "masterpiece". Unfortunately I didn't rent it, I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this movie is that it is not so disturbing. For the reasons they know, the filmmakers showed the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. Are you kidding? The man gave a new meaning to the term "finger lickin" good! And with all the flash setbacks and flash forwards I had a story after the story. All in all, Jeremy Renner's performance was not too bad. You can get him "S.W.A.T." to catch where he plays a dissatisfied exporter. Anyway, I'd appreciate it as 1/10. It only got 1 because Renner was so. There are a lot of books and TV documentaries that do much better work to cover Dahmer's crimes. Avoid this.
