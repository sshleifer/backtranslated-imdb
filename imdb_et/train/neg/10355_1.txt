I loved this book because my 5th grade teacher read this class years ago. And I've read it for all my 3rd and 5th grade classes over the past 18 years. The film was said to have been made in the past, but I would never have found it. Well, my students and I were so excited when we heard Disney had brought Madeline L'Engle's excellent book to the screen. <br /> <br /> When I watched the film, I had the greatest hopes. When the movie went, I became more and more reluctant. They were badly involved! Never had my favorite book-movie adaptation so fallen. I understand that movies can't be held in the book, but they don't have to change things for that! Most, if not all, exits from the book were completely unnecessary! <br /> <br /> I kept my opinion first and just listened to my students about the film. Well, it wasn't just me. Almost everyone felt the same way - cheating out the great story Madeline L'Engle had so skillfully created! <br /> <br /> Why did they wonder if Aunt Beast looked like a starwars movie in Chewbacca? Why couldn't Calvin's hair be red? Why didn't a lady with the right nerve-like clothing have such a clever name on her name? Basically, we all thought - why change almost every detail? <br /> <br /> I've always dreamed of the wonderful thing this book does. I'm still waiting for this movie. It was wrinkled in Time only in the broadest minds. I'm writing to Peter Jackson and I'm trying to convince him to do the job!
