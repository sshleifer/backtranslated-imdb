It's been loooonnnggg time because I saw this comedy, and I forgot the idiot it was. I easily place it in Elvis Presley's two or three worst films. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, a semi-indigenous Indian bullion, who returns home to Arizona and breaks down where his family lives, and where his friends love the night party. His parents are played by Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado and his old Indian grandfather is Thomas Gomez. None of these three offer anything essentially, comically, or otherwise. The government has invested in family members but they have no pull. Elvis can only sing some very valuable songs, and this is continued by a young boy-crazy gal and his perfect mother of weapons. It's just a real mess, and the spoiled environment virtually smells of manure and doesn't make it much easier. One thing that makes me think is that Elvis seems to have a real time in the movie. It is hard to believe that he was so upset that he had made so many mediocre films.
