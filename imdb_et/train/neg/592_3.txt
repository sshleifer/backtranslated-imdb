This logic goes straight out of the train window in a British horror movie, which is located on the London Underground and usually marks a trusted Frank Lion Run (Run Lola Run). Dreaming in an underground station, just wake up and find that he is locked and finds himself "somebody" or "something" who has the killer's intentions. <br /> <br /> Plot holes and disbelief are great and there are very few moments that are actually nervous / scary, but many that are just normal. <br /> <br /> All in all, there is an unpleasant film that should remain under the ground forever and benefit us all. The only plus point here is the involvement of the popular veteran actor Ken Campbell, who has done it better? it even includes "Erasmus Micromania"!
