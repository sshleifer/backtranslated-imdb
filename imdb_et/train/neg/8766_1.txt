I should all warn, saying that the movie should not be viewed. It is incapable of honoring such a magnificent way that it is a memory of almost brave men. The special effect was terrible, I did not expect the director to fully appreciate military technology. How can a machine gun, which usually burns at 600 rpm, speeds to 1/10? How can soldiers go ahead when the grenade explodes in front of them? How can people survive when there are artillery shells that are 20 meters away? How do artillery shells come down only on both sides of the road and not on their own? I was screaming. There were regular dialogues like Ye Bhi kisi, bhai hai, self laath mat maro and Pakistan se jyaada musalmaa to raise me and LOC cross-arm kare ye mera hukum hai. The least to say is stupid. <br /> <br /> What Shobha De had written is true. The director worked without a script and shows. The film does not flow. One battle does not progressively move from one battle to another. It is just one armed force after the next, without being bound by the general scheme of war. Explanatory scenes are terrible. The commander of the military is not convincing. Even worse, the filmmakers had cut the film material indiscriminately for a four-hour movie for 3 hours.
