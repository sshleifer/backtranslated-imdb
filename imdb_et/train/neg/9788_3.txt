Not that I do not like children's films, but it was a tear of redemptive qualities. M.J. Fox was the perfect voice for Stuart and the rest of the talents were wasted. Hugh Laurie may be amazingly funny, but this film is not an option. It is sugar-coated sugar and hardly an appeal to anyone over 7 years old. Instead, check out the game story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek. 3/10
