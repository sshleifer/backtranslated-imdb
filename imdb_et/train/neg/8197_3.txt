I just saw this movie today and I have to say it's a mess. I love Vince Vaughn, but he gets more annoying that funny here and the film is more than less passionate about the 80s classic "Santa Claus", but at the end of the camp or bad Sheena Easton's song. The story is the running of your family's black sheep in a family who comes back with their family for a holiday, but in northern Poland it's set up. Of course, Fred (Vince Vaughn) is a family who comes home after a series of backs that include his girlfriend (Rachel Weisz, who is in the role of companions), so she comes home to her parents and successful brother Santa. Claus (Paul Giamatti) and nervous high bellows follow a bit of sister competition and a bit of anarchy that threatens all the power. If you think you know the end of this movie, I think you would be right because it's predictable on the mountain. As for the actor, Vince Vaughn plays the same loving loser he always plays, but this time he gets more annoying than he likes, Miranda Richardson plays Mrs Claus, but the role is more than one remark, Elizabeth Banks plays as Santa's assistant, but she is not A lot of character at all, apart from the neurotic joke and poor Kevin Spacey, basically reaches the same person he plays in "Glengarry Glen Ross" but a little more anal. The only two actors who are dignified with this film are Paul Giamatti, who brings true sincerity and warmed up to Santa, but sees the film as a bit embarrassing and you can't blame him and Rachel for Weisz, who can do much more than most of the main roles It is a shame, because both Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserved much better than what the script gave them. <br /> <br /> To be brief, this is a big disappointment.
