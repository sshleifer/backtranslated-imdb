The songwriter Robert Taylor (Terry) is "dizzy, potty happy" and does not directly see the rest of the world Norma Shearer (such as Consuelo). "He makes the sun shine, even when it rains," explains Mr. Taylor. But Mr Taylor gets his throat when he goes near Mrs Shearer. Finally, Taylor announces Palm Beach at the Shearer frequencies, "I Love You!" Shearer brushes him off because he's tied to George Sanders (like Tony). In order to settle gambling debts, Shearer Taylor hires to represent "his cardboard lover" to make Mr. Sanders jealous. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie calls for a clear and relevant three-word review: "His Cardboard". This is most remarkable than Shearer's latest film appearance, one of the world's largest stars, "His Who Will Catch" (1924, playing the second Consuelo) for "Women" (1939). To be fair, it was probably a Shearer film that MGM believed would be seen by viewers. But this part has become uneven. <br /> <br /> Taylor and Shearer were better off "escape" (1940). Had Shearer continued, he would have become a better actor than a "leading lady"; apparently he was no longer interested and definitely did not need any money. Taylor has a great scene where he talks to Christina Rossetti, "When I'm dead, my dearest", threatening to jump from Shearer's balcony, as George Cukor has instructed. <br /> <br /> **** His Cardboard Lover (6/42) George Cukor ~ Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor, George Sanders
