It should be a great movie ... Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson are two writers. Mike Nichols leads. Uh uh. It's boring, boring. Nonsense and predictable! Slow and determined! <br /> <br /> This is a cookie cutter "boy meets girl, boyfriend marries girl, boyfriend thing, girl leaves boy's story." Now it's the original concept! After two hours (was it just two? That seemed to be the sixth.) I wasn't sure if it was a comedy, romance, tragedy or soap opera. This was done in 1986. I'm sure we all did things sixteen years ago, so we'd rather forget. I hope that the damage to Streep et al's reputation will begin to improve and that the master will lose the emulsion. This is not a bad picture. It's just so good.
