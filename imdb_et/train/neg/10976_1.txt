A terrible movie that should be independent. It needed something addictive about it. <br /> <br /> This totally unhappy movie deals with the Irish people's interaction. Did they try to imitate the wonderful movie "Crash?" If so, this movie fell completely. <br /> <br /> There's just too much that culminated in a small one that runs around and throws stones into buses and cars that are probably causing chaos. <br /> <br /> The film is too inconvenient to work. One woman loses her husband after 14 years when her younger sister lootes the defendant. This causes the former sister to become a bitter joke and walks in clothing that is not to be believed. The older sister also becomes nervous but soon finds romance. <br /> <br /> Then we have 3 losers who buy masks to rob the bank. Obviously, robbery goes awry, but there is no penalty for punishment. Perhaps the punishment should have been for writers to fail to create a single film.
