I tried to watch it in the cinema when I was five years old; I've never been the same. Completed to the brim with medication-induced images hidden by the usual devastation of your average shelter, this film is not human to color, especially to children. <br /> <br /> It starts innocently enough for a poor guy who destroys (wait) his classmate's drum by putting it on his head; yes, putting your HEAD through it. But be afraid, my friends! He's a quick comforter for his wretched flute that is weird, I'll give you, but still acceptable. <br /> <br /> HOW: The film breaks the combination of Ozz's wizards and where the natural things are, but loses all the "warm and cloudy" aspects of both books. <br /> <br /> So this seven-legged yellow Barney's relative interacts with this poor boy and puts him deeper into despair. br /> <br /> And add a pleasant number of terrible themes, a carnivorous boat that was previously kidnapped by a grandfather's girlfriend and doped dragon dragon, to be mixed. br /> <br /> The strangest picture in the middle of this chaos is the villain, rightly "Witchiepoo" (?). Of course, he has his problems: what is obviously a plastic mask that limits his facial expressions to deal with bones whose gas level seemed to be the lowest in the most inappropriate moments. As a result, one of his favorite wines was a nasal dive into a body of water that separated Pufnstuf's land from its degenerate, decaying habitat (I don't know where I would have lived). To conclude, this movie is scary ... <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that has similar effects to your audience, it's for you. Enjoy.
