I love a good war movie and I fall into the category "been there, done it". So I would like to think that my review is accurate (IMHO). Having just watched this movie on DVD, I can definitely say that it was a trash. I can't recommend this movie to you. <br /> <br /> It started with me, shouting on the television, saying, "You're not doing it," etc. But I soon realized that a little bit of work experience would be an obstacle, so I was a little cool. But on the opening track, when the trailer wheel fell, I felt disgusted that this film was predictable ... I was right. <br /> <br /> EOD scenes just didn't. I just know that the military crew had some of the most pathetic rebellious command line or remote control on the other end. So much so I left my head scratching all the time. Then just when you think you know where the story goes, the Humvee boys are out in their desert. One of the most valuable messages to entertain the theater against some SAS wannabe contractors. <br /> <br /> The sniper scene was just so ridiculous. It didn't make sense at all and made me turn it off. Then they pulled it so long that they really tested patience. It started with a "contact right" and quickly went up the hill. If you had a British accent, you shot it, but if you were part of the EOD team, maybe you were a big shot and saved the day. Then as you thought it was over, it goes unexplained for a long time without adding anything at all. You just have to look and ask why it's not over yet? <br /> <br /> Then we had a scene where they just hit each other to laugh ... another scene where you just wanted to stop it. It didn't add anything to the movie. <br /> <br /> Then, just as my life seemed very dull, the headmaster went outside the leader to share someone. This is the most ridiculous scene I've ever seen. It was all logic and the ability to write a good story ... it was pointless and terrible. I still don't understand why they are wasting this time. Then I just watched him run through the busy streets that returned to the camp. A subtle comedy :) <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that this story is all about the show without making decisions what it wants to be. I thought it was a silly illogical EOD scene, but then it was left by tangents who tried to be something else. But as hard as he tried, I missed death. Everything I wanted was the end of it. It was a dirty set of stupid scenes that were mixed with a stupid, pointless, action (ish) scene. <br /> <br /> There is no way to recommend it. Maybe my work experience has been damaging, but even the naive must understand that it just doesn't make sense. The only thing this movie is stupid is the artificially high IMDb rating ... which must be a 24/7 post office PR team who seems to be using this website as a way everyone thinks it is good. Sorry people ... it's not just! <br /> <br /> Not recommended ... it just carried you.
