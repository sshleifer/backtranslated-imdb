Only the secretions of the glands - and please do not ask for more details - from the young virgins can keep the aging body and spirit of the elderly old amateur hobby woman fresh and youthful. Because, like most people, except those involved in medical research, virgins rarely give up their secretions, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) organizes their robbery and preservation. He does the mining himself. <br /> <br /> What a big cheese ball is a prerequisite for a low budget horror movie. If The Corpse Vanishes has no Havart of horror, the usual limburger leaves an interesting aftertaste. <br /> <br /> Of course, the actress is almost terrible, except for the actors with whom luckily to play the crazy dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played the master at Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); his crazy brother, Angel (Frank Moran), who grumbles a lot and has a fetish hair for virgins; their regretted mother (Minerva Urecal); crazy woman (Elizabeth Russell) who sleeps with a soft coffin and, of course, a crazy doctor (Lugosi). <br /> <br /> An enterprising young reporter, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters), is following the doctor because it is a strange orchid with a particularly sweet smell that the victims had suffered. When a doctor and his wife invite Pat to stay overnight, the terrible storm will break right away. This clue tells us that some robbing violence will enter. Since it is well known that all unmarried young women in Hollywood were virgins, Pat might have unpleasant surprises. These include dark sections, a tough laboratory where virtually dead viruses are stored, a cellar mausoleum, and then a direct threat to Patricia's own glands secretions. When he lives, what story he has to give his editor. <br /> <br /> If you try this wet form of Velveet (and why not? Don't be better), do not meet Bela Lugosi, whom he holds here. He had a great influence on Drakula (1931), but my favorite film is The Black Cat (1934). Like Dr. Vitas Werdega, he is a sad, ironic man who protects his two young friends. When he finally takes the scalpel to Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff) and starts to live, ah, well, that's a great scene.
