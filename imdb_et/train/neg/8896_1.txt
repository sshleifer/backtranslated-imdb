I saw Brigadon on TV last night (September 12, 2009). I am 61 years old and I have movies as long as I remember. I can really say that Brigadon is standing alone as far away as the worst film I've ever seen. Shares were shameful. A local kids club would have brought better kits. The characters were so wooden that they probably made a dry rotten for the tears of those patrons who had failed. It is to be hoped that the stars of this film were hidden thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment they had to bear as a result of seeing this film. Its war owners should make a very good service to mankind and destroy all copies of this movie.
