Anyone who has watched Comedy Central at midnight in the last few years has apparently seen ads for this movie. I first saw ads for this movie in 2001. It seemed that it might be funny, but I didn't start calling the number on the TV screen and ordered it despite the movie. I thought I was waiting for the movie to be rented in Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> A year and a half later, I was in Tower Records and "less than $ 20 on DVDS". a copy of this movie. Seeing that the DVD was only $ 6.99, I decided to buy it. I got home, I put the disc in a DVD player and waited for the laughs ... and I was waiting. The laughs never came. <br /> <br /> I should agree with almost every other comment when I say this movie was terrible. Sick, desperately tasteless and poorly written and guided, BASIC KOMEDI MOVIE is a terrifying garbage, and I think it is the worst film ever. No star.
