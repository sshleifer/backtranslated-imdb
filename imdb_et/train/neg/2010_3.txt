Oh, that's a movie - I thought I waited too long to take the dog out. I can't believe I looked at the whole thing. I think I had been optimistic about it getting better. Terribly divergent dialogue, pathetic action and totally unlikely events. Like Toby's mother who hung herself while Col was going up and in a 24-inch ceiling with no chair, counters, or anything around her motionless body, she could have used it to step into a little girl who played the daughter of the last family, was the best actor of the whole movie and the first pair of puppies was near. The main feature is potential, and a good script and director can have a serious horrible flick, but this version is unfortunately not. I'm getting more scared when I open my electricity bill every month.
