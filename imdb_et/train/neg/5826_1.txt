Slow and nice pictures changed each other, sometimes with tedious music (you know Bjork) in the first 75% of the movie. If you didn't have enough sleep, this is a good time. <br /> <br /> But the film director of the last 20% decides to bring the idea of ​​revival, reinvestment or otherwise through S & M images: "spiritual lovers" cut each other's bodies with a knife. For me it was very disturbing and actually made a general impression of a mixture of abstract art and contemporary Japanese mystery images. <br /> <br /> The operator and manager are big but weird. <br /> <br /> Not at all.
