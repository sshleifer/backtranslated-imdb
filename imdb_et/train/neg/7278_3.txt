This barely traced film was a bit of a challenge to sit down. No segment is good, but at least the first one was lightly amusing and somewhat imaginable in the middle. The latter was just brutal, and after two weak comics short pants, the third was really painful to look at. Even under the low standards of the National Lampoon movie, it seemed especially boring and joyful.
