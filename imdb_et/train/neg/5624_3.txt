In his short 40-year earth, Jack, London, managed to make as many adventures and incidents as possible. This 90-minute film, which is said to be a biography of human life, but obviously fictitious, does not even reflect the surface, and has remained very mature for today's retelling. Here, Michael O'Shea depicts one of his first roles in London and his performance is so harsh and sympathetic. He's not a problem here. Neither young nor very beautiful Susan Hayward, who plays her future wife, Charmian, whose biography in London is the "base" for this film. The life of London has so far been divided into a series of episodes that the film is going through in the meantime. So we have short incidents with London as an Austrian pirate, seal fuel at the Bering Sea, gold processor Yukon, and correspondent during the Russian-Japanese war ... definitely colored events, but hardly given anything like that. depth. And Alfred Santell's direction (he also led one Susan's first film in 1939, "Our Leading Citizen") is at best inadequate. Tightening such things is a very poor quality DVD with a printed source and a hissy sound. Perhaps for me, this was the best DVD add-on for film development: a catalog of all Alpha video clips featuring hundreds and hundreds of full-color movie images. We just hope these movies are in better shape than "Jack London"!
