After leaving TV's popular "The Andy Griffith Show", Don Knotts boldly tried to play stardom with a number of comedian but matin√©e comedy cars. Unfortunately, the "reluctant astronaut", which has been filmed cheaply (like most Knotti movies), is much worse than its others. Don plays a small town schnook who arrives at Astronaut's training camp ... but not as a space travel candidate - they want him to be his new caretaker! Some may say that the weak satire capitalizes the fresh fever of the Americans for a new technology era, but the flick is really just a tiny apology to keep the troubled children busy. It goes well with the OK setting and nostalgic places, but it is becoming more spiritual and idiotic. * from ****
