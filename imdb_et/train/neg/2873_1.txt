This movie has a wonderful brunette called Danielle Petty. She has excellent green eyes and is on the first few scenes and last scene. He's the only thing in this movie that's not modest. It may not be the future of an actor, because such a film is an offensive disaster that kills a career. <br /> <br /> The film has no suggestion. It is not a good horror movie or a good fake journalism report, or well done. There's no skill in producing it. It's like a bad student film. The story's terrible elements don't make you sick, it's the fact that it's so badly made to get you sick. I'd give the ZERO stars if I could.
