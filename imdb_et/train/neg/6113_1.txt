I screamed my head because seeing this movie was my first film experience that has been around 13 months old. I remember it was incredibly bloody and it made me angry. I watched it on TV a few years ago. A big mistake - the actor is wood, the plot doesn't exist and the film lacks values ​​when the 23-year-old R & D is what you're doing ... 0 / ****
