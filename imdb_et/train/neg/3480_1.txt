This movie is terrible. TERRIBLE. One of the worst movies. I can't even imagine Gigli being worse. Previews made us say "NO", but then we were looking for something that is now in the center of the bright gate, we decided to go ahead and hit. <br /> <br /> STUPID USA. <br /> <br /> Affleck is NOT an actor. He is a picture and can be blown up by explosions, but even Bruce Willis didn't get "Die Hard." If he removed his shirt and ran around the bad guys, it would be a comedy. <br /> <br /> The best part was Catherine O'Hara - she's always good. Gandolfin flops again (if it wasn't Sopranos, he would wash it up) as he did in "Mexico". </p> has any motivation for his actions. <br /> <br /> DO NOT EXCEED ALL COSTS OF THIS MOVIE.
