What the CEO does in the producer's film. When I remember correctly, this is the person who raised the financial support for making the film. It may be noted that in many films with Sean Connery, he is also an executive producer, meaning that Connery himself raised the money because he is the main player. Unfortunately, it should also be noted that a large number of films, featuring Sean Connery, were able to raise money because he is a big Hollywood player, usually a sign that when the credit is deemed to be the executive producer and the film the same film itself nothing other than a constellation whose story / scenario is not scratch <br /> <br /> PROTOCOL follows a saga of one Sunny Davis, a kooky bimboesque cocktail maker, who saves visiting dignity and receives a reward that has been made a top diplomat . Probably? When things are progressing, Davis (who has problems putting together the two sentences) has found himself in more extreme and less likely situations. Hawn, who is also the film's executive producer, do you understand what I'm talking about a story / scenario that's not scratch?
