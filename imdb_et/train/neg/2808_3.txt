The stars of the 1980s TV and TV series (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley, Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel among others) are a story about a photographer who has dreamed of killing his models. Of course, models and other people will start to die, causing all kinds of complications. <br /> <br /> Overclaiming is not a very good thriller enough for nudity and violence to get R-class but not good enough material to generate real interest. It is best described as a film that gave the Cinemax an alternative name for Skinamax. I really don't see this point of view unless you need to see that there is every slippery thriller. (I must also notice that this movie is full of smoking, so it becomes ridiculous when someone comes on)
