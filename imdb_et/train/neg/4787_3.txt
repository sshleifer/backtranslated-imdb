This record is definitely interesting for serial fans (like me), but it's mostly incomprehensible. The plot is confusing, as is the continuation of the sequel. Some prominent effects are certain, but we will never know what this really means. <br /> <br /> Try to see the "NC-17" work printout containing the re-rated gore. "R".
