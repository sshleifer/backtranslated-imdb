It's a cheese. If all you want is a video game that includes what looks like straightforward sequences of action from your computer, the movie was too cheap to actually make special effects, that is. My friend and I really had a great time to see it because the theater was mostly empty and we could get a little heckle. This movie really requires heckling. <br /> <br /> Plot? Was there a plot? OK, some foolish colleges or later types are called "rave of the year" and go to one of the San Juan islands ("If they'd only been back in Seattle, they would have survived." Almost.). They get there and everything is gone, and the site is somewhat broken (but hey, the barrel is still full!). With the help of a sharp old captain and a Coast Guard woman (who only acted a little less harsh - and a little less well - than Cynthia Rothrock), they fight a lot of zombies (some that spit acid), get rich legends, and mostly kill. That's it. <br /> <br /> It is not quite BAD or Demonicus, but not much and better than Severed (they are kind of my own alpha and omega for bad movies - the first is bad, but fun heckle, and the latter is just too bad to look more than once). On the other hand, if you expect a video game as great as Resident Evil, then run !!! run now !!! <br /> <br /> OK, some real big questions (without too many spoilers): Since the 18th century Spanish ships got to the Pacific Northwest ????? Why is someone in the Northwest Pacific smuggling arms and to whom - CANADA, to shout out loud? Why is the Call of Unnamed (oh, sorry, it's called "isla del muerto", shya, right) in the San Juan Island - and outdoors, however, this is the PACIFIC NORTHWET. Rave has about 30 people - the "rave of the year", my sin. <br /> <br /> Happy thing with lots of hatchets. Many of them. They have everything. There must be a hatchet point of sale nearby. <br /> <br /> Finally, when the movie started to play a little "parody" (with nudges I know what you did and jaws), it didn't carry it close enough. <br /> <br /> OK, in the end - if the introductory comments (over the votes, not less) randomly say that one of the characters gave up his boyfriend to focus on his fences, be sure to have some fences at the end of the movie. Not a good fence, but a few people hacking each other with swords.
