it must be one of those films where the trailer is 50 times better than the film itself. I first saw the trailer in 1991, it seemed good. Because I've always wanted to see it, but I could never see it, but I could never find it ... ... today, yes, 14 years later. <br /> <br /> just say I was so disappointed that it was unrealistic, I knew it wouldn't be an Oscar winner, but still hoped it would be a fun non-brain movie in the form of blood sport. Unfortunately, it wasn't, it is Pooh <br /> <br /> which is all American rock and role music, and the actor was so bad that it was quite scary. <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes were garbage and look fake. <br /> <br /> This DVD only cost me 5 pounds and I believe I'm over 7 pounds. <br /> <br /> Now I'm sad because I know I'll never get that hour and a half back.
