Oh, my gosh ... I thought CBS primeime TV shows were the worst things Gerald McRaney appeared ... <br /> <br /> Four people are crazy trying <br /> <br /> on the computer. That's it, don't rent it. <br /> <br /> I saw it under one of its many titles - "Hall Matter" and it is <br /> <br /> perhaps one of the worst movies in the last memory. Other reviews are correct, it's terrible. Never have so many settings on screen, NO. Cast is terrible, the direction <br /> <br /> is terrible and the script is terrible. I can't stress how terrible it is. <br /> <br /> Avoid being smallpox. <br /> <br /> It is rated for physical violence (PG), some weapon violence, soft <br /> <br /> some violence, and some adult situations
