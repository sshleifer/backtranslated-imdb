This movie is stigmatized, unigeneral rubbish. I sometimes like romantic comedy. Good viewing is like eating ice cream. It is not something you are doing all the time, but the experience is so pleasant that you can ignore how useless you are. This movie made me wonder how stupid I was to leave my whole time sitting. All this screamed cheaply. It seems that these films at certain points over-exposures are that it is so washed. It also boasts of CGI and flat sets. <br /> <br /> Writing was dirty. I know that you can usually wait for some plot problems in the comedy of a screwball, but you don't usually care because you're laughing. This movie is so strange that you are actually sitting and wondering about unlikely coincidences and totally unbelievable behavior. The events were placed in a movie to move symbols from one scene to another or to exhibit. Of course, all this movie works, but you shouldn't notice that it happens. Inelegant. This is the term I should use. <br /> <br /> There was hardly anyone in the movie who was really pleasant. I don't care about whoever came with when they all stayed away from me and I didn't have to listen to them anymore. Why would the only really pleasing character in the film, Paul Rudd's character, have anything to do with the totally damn, despicable, control mechanism played by Eva Longoria? Also, almost all of the characters involved consistently chose the solution for each situation. Straight man pretends to be gay for five years, just to attract (and swim together) with the woman he is attracted to? The best feeling-good moment they came to was, was the lucky ending of the same score, where he and Ruddy were equally annoyed by the wrong, kleptomaniac sister? Bell Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive, attractive women. Maybe they find something better to see on the roads.
