Oh dear, honey. I started looking at it without knowing what to expect. I couldn't believe what I saw. There were times when I thought it was comedy. I loved how the government's plan to control a terrorist act is to fall into the air of a man who is unarmed and expects him to seize him and flee to a missile pack. If only that were really that easy. I have finally found the film worse than "Plan 9 From Space Space".
