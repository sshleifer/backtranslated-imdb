This movie has some of the worst things I've ever seen! Some scenes are original, such as nails through the floor. This nail trap catches those bad guys. The rest of the movie breaks down when you go. I can't believe this movie isn't even 100 movies all the time. I also can't believe there are queues! The next movie I want to watch is R.O.T.O.R. Would R.O.T.O.R be really much worse than that? <br /> <br />
