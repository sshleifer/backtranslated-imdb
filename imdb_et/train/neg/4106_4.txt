For me it was almost unthinkable that this film was a bust, but I was really disappointed. Having been a witness to Pekinpah's Cinema for years, I found this DVD, drastically reduced, for sale and thought it was worth it. Opening some of the credits offered to Pekinpah fans is cutting between humans and animals, but here we have a non-sedentary ambient noise that plays in schoolwork when a bomb is planted. Fantastic relationship. When Perps, Caan and Duval ride to their next mission, Duval Cann has a bomb that his last night had an STD found only in his purse when Cann was intimate with him. The resulting laughter is fantastic and is clearly respected by Brian Depalan's dress to kill, at the short-term expense of Angle Dickenson. The problem with The Killer Elite is that after opening the credit it falls on the film. Even bringing me to Alfredo Garcia's leader has a stronger output value, a bold call to anyone who knows what I'm talking about. I use Pekinpah's credit as additional lecture material, but when they are finished, turn off The Killer Elite.
