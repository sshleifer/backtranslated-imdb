I give this marriage for 3 years and it stretches it. Adrianne Curry is a messy mouth, spoiled, controlling, picking and her sexual past makes me laugh. He tells Chris that he has a picture to protect and avoid striptease clubs. She married her. Chris has a low self-esteem and a different timeframe. I have nothing against Adrianne Curry, but this combination is never happy after the end. His mother said he was an old cock and thinks it's his last attempt to restore his youth. Here are 2 very good people who are going to divorce. I don't think his old "Brady Family" fits into his new life. I see them out. Chris said his friends were more important than his family. He supported him and was with him.
