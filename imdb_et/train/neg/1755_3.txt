This film is not a stranger and also shows some warmth, but ultimately, this effort is too small and too focused on drivers. There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with her entire screen time, but she takes too much beam over the rest of the cast. Another problem is overloading the script with clich√©s. A daughter who falls out of a collegiate college, an older woman who has a hard time getting a good job (and first comes to a rather humiliating job), is a sliding network manager with her executive toys that move over content, a journalist who is not really wrong, ie they are all firmly rooted in reality, but together they are just too much and leave us too much deja-vu and too little surprises.
