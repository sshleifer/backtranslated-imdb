To sit, how awful The Shield is, you need to write pages and pages so it's enough to say it's a bad management memorial. <br /> <br /> "When the directors go", it should have been the title of this production. Indeed, the directors should tell the visual style and the story of their work, which postpones the story. <br /> <br /> How does the camera continually shake and play "style" with a zoom lens? How does this story postpone? Of course, "editing random numbers" is a mess. Obviously, it just turned into a random cut. <br /> <br /> I think it's too much work to do good editing. <br /> <br /> Well, it made too much work for most people to watch Shield, one of the slowest mortgages and unintentional shows.
