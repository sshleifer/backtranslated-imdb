Believe it or not, I have my own DVD from this "movie" that I bought from Walgreens for a big big dollar. I'm still not sure if it was a well spent dollar or a somewhat wasted dollar. <br /> <br /> Pretty amazing set and costumes. Obviously, they were making a lot of thinking and effort. Sets are very Mexican in styling. I liked them a lot. And Santa is impressive. One of the most impressive mooseid moviedomas. <br /> <br /> I think that the original intention and purpose of this film was to make the audience for children something uplifting and joyful. But somehow it's pretty puzzled. In fact, I've been stunned when it has failed. <br /> <br /> It may be English dubbing, which makes it so uncomfortable and strange. One of the reasons why I prefer to make movies in the original language, and the use of English subtitles for dubbing is often an inadvertent oddity. The voices of the sons were dubbed at least with the actual sonic voices, not with the women who tend to be children who tend to sound very, very strange. <br /> <br /> Did you know that demons carried in hell are making their free time dancing ballet in their eyes? You didn't want to? I didn't see this movie watched. One learns something new every day. <br /> <br /> Is this movie really worth it? Now, it's tossup. I can't recommend it to anyone with a good conscience because it's quite disturbing in its odd way. But this involuntary odd is what makes it worth watching. You decide what you are going to do. I can't ... feel uncomfortable about myself, seeing that the demons are constantly on the ballet movement. Now, it's just wrong ...
