Reiterates the darkness. What happened to the great Barry Levinson? He led two of my all-time favorite "Avalon" and "Diner". He also had fine films ("Rainman"), but always gave something interesting ... so far. I think the worst thing you'll ever say about comedy is that it's boring. "Envy" is a boring definition. Never was a big fan of "Dumb and Dumber", but just that movie is terrible. Perhaps all 2 things are - if you can pay attention for a long time. The best part of the movie is to play a title song similar to Redbone. If the film had been written for both song and song, it would have been acceptable. Rachel Weisz is a great actor and I understand that they all want comedy (even Julianne Moore), but there is one weakness in the real world. SNL's cast member Amy Poehler is his usual top if he is a French French track. The film's disaster is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first job kills with some promises, but after that, their chemistry disappears because of a bad script. This script is like most of Jack Black's character ideas - not a bad idea, but no hope of success.
