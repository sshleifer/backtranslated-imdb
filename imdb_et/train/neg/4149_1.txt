Oh me though. Where do I start? The father is not old enough to be a girl's father. In the first 5 minutes of the movie, he pushes it into the camera. The preferred exclamation in this film is "Jesus Christ !!!". Zombies are agile, stupid and few and far away. The motives are completely incomprehensible and there is no narrative. People "rush" to their destination on jeeps that drive at 3 MPH. The world seems to continue to work normally, but they should be the end of the day. Breasts appear after the breasts. Such an approach would normally give redemption, but the rest of the film did not give me any interest in the future of the breast or humanity. There's a dog for no reason and thin, orange blood that changes the stomach. General and Speech "Close f ** k up!" is the only redemption function. As for the rest, I sincerely hope that I heard they had done a decent thing and killed themselves.
