If the BBC first showed this game over 30 years ago, it would have been something different over time. So some people would have found it scary and special effects could be impressive? <br /> <br /> Looking at this day and age, it doesn't seem so scary any more, even special effects can leave much to be desired. <br /> <br /> Could the train really be allowed to pass RED LIGHT through the dark tunnel? I don't think so ...... but if you look at this game again, you will notice that the first train that enters the tunnel runs right through the red light! (maybe it's dickens time)? <br /> <br /> You will also notice that the footpath leading to the signal box is very steep and in poor condition. Certainly, Signalman would have climbed up or down several steps to climb rails with handrails. (I can't do that, but I notice such things) <br /> <br /> I don't take anything from the actors, both Denholm Elliott (signalman) and Bernard Lloyd (passenger) gave great performances. > <br /> I'm not sure what's going on ...... I thought it was a ghost, or what ??? Does anyone really understand this rather confusing story? (Well maybe I'm the only one who doesn't) ??? <br /> <br /> In summary ..... <br /> <br /> The game is in a great atmosphere, great character. This day is not so scary and sometimes a couple or not very confusing and they have quite unusual signaling practices. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading.
