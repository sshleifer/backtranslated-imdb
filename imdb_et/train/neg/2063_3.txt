Listening to the fun of this movie, I rented it at the end of the video shop at <br /> <br /> and after 75 minutes I laughed 3 times. This movie, which is fun with television, is a disproportionate mess. <br /> <br /> The jokes are falling, humor deals with the problems of the 1970s that are no longer relevant, and <br /> <br /> jokes go too long (almost like the new SNL moves in recent years <br /> <br /> Yes, Chevy Chase is in it, but maybe it's just <br /> <br /> about 1 or 2 minutes. I liked it was very <br /> <br /> dirty and had nudity, but wasn't it funny ? <br /> <br /> Do your own and rent a Kentucky Fried Movie that is far away <br /> <br /> a higher film made
