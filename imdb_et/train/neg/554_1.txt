This movie is terrible. The scenario is bad, the script is mediocre, and even sex scenes are worthless. The excitement and intrigue of the original film is completely missing. This film is filmed in a dark, shady and monochromatic style (la "World War"), which is so disappointing for the beauty of the original text. Greg Morrisey's butterfly features one facial expression in the film. There are no revolutions and turns of the original plot; few that exist are just antimicrobials. The only highlight is Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell, which continued in that order, but it is not enough to overcome other shortcomings. The only thing that should be done "basic instinct 3" would be if Michael Douglas agrees to join the pain.
