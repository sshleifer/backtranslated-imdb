I felt this movie started well. The action was on the ground and I felt all the characters in the scene, although the real family was not fully revealed. We never got enough information about Dad to really feel his pain because of all his involvement or Tobe's hostility. I mean in one scene that you see her admiring for the density and the second scene she almost takes her head off. Another problem with the movie was that it was just loose and lost all the focus, and I asked it to just end. Any such long-term statement and painful end should never work for only 7 or higher levels. Let's look at the overall quality of the movie experience. In this film, the end is so bad that I seriously considered going out of the theater. This movie pulled me in and spat me out.
