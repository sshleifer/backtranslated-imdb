This program didn't do it for me, although I'm a fan of the genre. The main disappointment that deceived me was that there was no scene that was not characterized by the main character. It made it a bit two-dimensional and gave up before the program ended. <br /> <br /> I was hoping to leave my criticism there because I am not a film critic, but IMDb's instructions show that you need to put 10 comment lines. He reminded me of Hudson Hawk, the main character in every scene, and I hope the writers of this program can use more diversity to interact with viewers. I have no doubts about any cast and team talent, it's just that after looking at things like "wire", I've been waiting for great things from the police book.
