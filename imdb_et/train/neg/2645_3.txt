The final bond between Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald is basically a complete failure. The script is weak and has been poorly presented. The movie doesn't just have a life. Eddy and MacDonald would have been better when they made their final movie concert by singing nothing wrong with just about everything else in this turkey that is too hot.
