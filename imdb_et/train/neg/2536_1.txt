My wife and I finished watching BÃ»su AKA Booth. During some part of the movie, he's tall. I really wish I had a fuck with him, but it is unfortunate that the protagonist's voice is so loud and furious that I was unable to sleep. When our main character speaks, I want to hear Regis Philbin and William Shatner singing karaoke. He also has no redemption qualities. I hoped he would hit the bus in five minutes. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, I love the Asian Cinema, but Booth is very irritating and full of scenes that really make no sense at all. If you want some good Asian cinema, check out A Tale of Two Sisters or Into The Mirror. Avoid Booth like a plague, especially if you have frequent migraines.
