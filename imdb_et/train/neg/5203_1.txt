I have seen poor movies of my time, but it comes up! Why oh, why this movie is made? There's nothing here. Please trust me, slide the switch off and destroy the copy of this movie. There is a primer ... that can take about 5 minutes to appear in the camera. This is the main problem, a story based on a "real story" (mmm ... any), not in any way an 80-minute padding. That is why we have to sit over an hour to see how people are moving around. That is all! Nothing happens in the first half of the year, except you look at someone walking in the shop ... and then three men walking through the wood. This time could have been spent on character development, but not. So there is no connection with the people on the screen, so when they start shooting, we don't care less! In fact, I was in the baddie for the movie to end! In addition, the camera's work is truly awful! This director / editor / writer / producer, Ti West, is a garbage. I hate a guy, but in fact, his work pants! These dotted close-ups are constantly on hold, and then one-time walks around people - I'm sure he thinks he's smart, but the results are so dull. How's this man out for the next cabin fever movie? Finally, the actor is also scared ... that goes for the film as a whole. Keep your peace of mind, stay in this total volume!
