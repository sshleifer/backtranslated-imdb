I rented this movie the other night, because neither my girlfriend nor I had ever seen it, even though we had heard a friend of the "great thing". <br /> <br /> Now I have my conservative views, but I knew that it would be completely liberal when he was leading it. I thought Michael Douglas played a popular, liberal beloved by the masses before the film began, and his troublemaker would be a cumbersome conservative opponent. But I thought that where the political statement would begin and end. <br /> <br /> OK, the plot was strong: one president belongs to the lobbyist. OK, this is the potential that I thought was quite fun because the plot was unique. But then the film became a liberal information market. The film changed more about arms control and environmental issues than President and Sydney (Annette Bening). <br /> <br /> There were many ridiculous spaces in this movie: 1) This character is the six-figure lobbyist of Sydney who is "closer". Could it be easier? He was constantly inaccurate and seemed to be scared of everything. Hardly "closer". I am selling and could not "shut down" selling glass of water to a thirsty dying man. 2) Second, is there something more ridiculous than Richard Dreyfuss who is playing the right fanatic? This is Hollywood's most liberal man and he plays the right-wing ideologue. Leave me alone. I liked how he took his conservative character and made him as bad as possible. <br /> <br /> 3) Speaking was just ridiculous. The line "I'm a proud card carrying an ACLU member" was a joke. First, none of the Presidents recognized anything like this, being an active member of the ultra-group. Second, why even bring something like that up. You just sold over half of the film's fame, which is moderate or conservative. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot was excellent and unique. I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice for president. But the film went from "movie" to the left-wing political statement, so the film failed. <br /> <br /> This shame shows that Hollywood has destroyed a large plot to force its political views to the audience
