I watched this movie in DVD format. My copy may be affected, but I was disappointed by the lack of a DVD menu screen. I say that my initial reason for watching this movie was Claire Forlani. While having fun, I feel he has not met my expectations, which I have found in my other films so far. I was just as pleased to see that Ark was humorous. The other two actors I wasn't very familiar with were not able to compare their activities, but they were also quite enjoyable. In my opinion, acting is the only good quality of this film. The story, although some might say a little convincing, was not the direction. I feel the main problem is the script and not the direction of this movie. If you enjoy some of these actors fairly, I recommend this movie, but I will leave it alone.
