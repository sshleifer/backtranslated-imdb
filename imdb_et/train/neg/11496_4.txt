Manipulated / manipulated documentary from one of the darkest places in Guatemala. depicted as a fun, secure ... but sad place for sex workers to play in a football team that has been put together for no more than a week! the main focus of the documentary is to prove that society "displaces" such "workers", even though for these poor women there has never been a solution except that the people who documented it made them "stars" (like the title) say so) in return for using it to make a documentary similar to this reality. but it has its own documented reality, but unfortunately it has nothing at all. I would not agree to see it again; but I would recommend it only for general cultural purposes.
