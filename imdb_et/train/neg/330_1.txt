I wanted to hit the TV. Tracking it was torture. I hated it. Never look at this movie. Terrorists are annoying. Adam Sandler is annoying. I usually like, but not in it. I wanted to break a DVD. This is the world's most irritating film. The comedian he's jealous of is unpleasant. The only funny part is the rocker, whose black teeth get all the girls. It was so irritating that I wanted to hit the TV. DO NOT RECEIVE THIS MOVEMENT, WHY YOU WANT TO RECOMMEND. If you even like Adam Sandler, don't buy it. It just hates you. Benefit yourself when you see it in the shop, hide it to put all of it out of danger. It's a waste of $ 1.99 that I paid for it.
