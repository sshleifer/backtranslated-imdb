After watching this movie, I was honestly disappointed - not by actors, story or leadership - I was disappointed with this film ad. <br /> <br /> Trailers pointed out that the battalion "chose the third exit" after the transfer or death (Polish information was even misleading that they were able to choose between their artillery or the killing of German weapons), they even translated the title incorrectly "wrongly placed battalion"). That's the hard spot and I bought the movie. <br /> <br /> The disappointment began when I realized that the third option is to just sit down and read the corpses, followed by sitting and counting the corpses ... Then I began to think "hey, this story can't be so easy ... bet that this clever officer will find some insidious ways to save his troops left ". He didn't want them, they just sat and waited for something. And so it was. <br /> <br /> The story was based on the real events of World War I, so writers were not able to make the most of their imagination, but even thought that I found this movie really indisputable and even a bit boring. And as I first wrote - it is not the fault of actors, writers or directors - their marketing people have raised my expectations beyond the level that this film can cope with.
