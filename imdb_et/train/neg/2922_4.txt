Take young people, real people, put them in an exotic place, put a couple of bad boys, whether two guides find romance for a couple of difficult breathing scenes, create the most common plots, then work out a happy ending for everyone (other than three or four who were murdered, of course) This is a classic (and successful) Harlequin Romance format. It's not very good, but it's not very bad, like most of the small yellow pockets. And things in Budapest are especially interesting, even if they didn't use a wonderful old train station (designed by Gustave Eifel) or showcase the city's famous thermal baths.
