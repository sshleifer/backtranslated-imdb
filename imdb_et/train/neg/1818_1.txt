Connie Hoffman is very beautiful and occasionally attractive topless. <br /> <br /> That's it, people. The only reason to even watch this movie is 70's. These 70's sexual exchange periods are sometimes entertaining due to their age (burnt pants, big hair, Zapata mustache, etc.). It is not like that. <br /> <br /> The script is bad, the actor is bad, the direction is bad and the idea of ​​a senior citizen's romantic leading person is exceptionally bad. <br /> <br /> The title that implies sex comedy is extremely misleading. <br /> <br /> I heartily advise you to avoid it like a plague.
