so ... it's really sexist and classicist, and I thought it might not be in the early stages of the movie, as when stella tells steven he really wants to change himself and start talking in the right way and he says he won't change. well, he certainly changed his voice, and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit. what at first seems to be a love story is really a social arrangement and women as mothers. the end of the film does not make her a hero, it makes the whole thing sad. and its sad that people think it makes him a hero. maybe it's a movie comment that people should take away. Positive reception reflects constant patriarchal currents in social conscience. yuck.
