I can't believe that the same man drove it to the crap and Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 was innovative, fresh and well written when it was badly worked. <br /> <br /> This pile cannot even claim this. It begins with the defeat of Dracula at the end of Dracula 2000. Then you ignore the story that describes what happened after that. If the narrative had been properly followed, it would have been somehow a good follow-up, but Craven decided to go for the style of his older films, which had no good connection but the main name of the villain. <br /> <br /> Even Dracula played an actress differently (going from dark to Dracula 2000). <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you stick to your taste in the movies.
