No wonder Pamela Springsteen refused to become a full-time photographer; it is a much better idea to be behind the camera than one. Although this film is not an interesting element of it (hell mullets, etc.), they outweigh the shortcomings. First, it seems that the murderous adviser, Angela, seems to be about as old as the campers. An older, more threatening camp leader would have done a lot for the film. And then you have murder scenes. The budget was probably too low to fill most of them properly (no penalty is foreseen), although the sinking of someone else's outbuilding is certainly original. But in general, there are many movies that are more sensitive / fun to spend an hour and a half watching their lives.
