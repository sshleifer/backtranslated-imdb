Buck's role Kahnina reminds Bob Barker (The Price is right) who drives the country in the same way as his show. But there is much more to break this turkey and burn it. Kurt Thomas, as a "hero" with a baby, shows some acrobatic skills, but no ability to act. There are some spooky moments (mostly in the village of Crazies) and some lightly impressive martial arts sequences. But every given Ninja movie gives you much more entertainment and you don't feel guilty of laughing.
