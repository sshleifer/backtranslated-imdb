I have no idea what that stupid plot from San Francisco was, but apparently they need to take out any drugs they take and put their analyst at risk - NOW. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a plausible story when you think the alien abduction order is "believable in Life in Brian". <br /> <br /> This movie is a little more than the left pipedream. If the US and the USSR abandoned their nuclear weapons, the result would have been to remove the only real obstacle that kept them from dealing with the two wars. Bad, like Korea, Vietnam and other era wars, they were "proxy wars" to fight for the direct involvement of superpowers. <br /> <br /> This film makes me think how realistic it was for some high school kids to go to a hunger strike against nuclear proliferation. As someone would say, "Mr. President, some kids don't eat Drastic High!" and Ronald Reagan would answer â€œMy God! Right. <br /> <br /> Like this movie? Wouldn't it be better for the Soviet Union to collapse because they couldn't build their massive weapons ... wait, it happened!
