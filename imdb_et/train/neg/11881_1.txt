This movie is nothing like "Office Space" except for the premise. Office space was fun. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone because I never laughed at the movie. Mr. Cornbluth's self-conscious raids are becoming more annoying than 15 Jason Alexanders in the same room. If you decide to watch this movie, use a free rental or check out someone else's house to leave if necessary.
