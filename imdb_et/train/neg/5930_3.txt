Hey, <br /> <br /> If you intend to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen, try doing this from Leonard Cohen! It's just enough for Leonard to hate the viewer who is wondering why they are listening to these other singers (some of them questionable) talking about themselves. Puleeze .... they seem to refresh their diary entries in junior - who cares about what is Leonard? Guess what people, if you "do something" worth, may make a documentary about you. I found a particularly offensive paradox for U2 members as it would increase the credibility of this movie - NO. Leonard does not need Bono or Edge for his spirituality. It would have been nice if filmmakers had embodied their spirituality through the film. Gee, what a concept! I give Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker the covers of Cohen's stories - the rest of the performances were drilled and some were intolerable. <br /> <br /> Cohen fans, don't say I didn't warn you!
