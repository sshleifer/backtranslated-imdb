Very few positive movies about it. <br /> <br /> First, it is zero speed and is not positive in any drama. <br /> <br /> In addition to being remarkably slow, it seems the empty acre is dedicated to using the same material again and again. I lost the number of times I saw it "night" at night or in a cracked area. <br /> <br /> He also has a major mistake to think that if the audience does not know what they are, it is more confusing than just confused. So, without signs of sudden problems, marriage is not what it seems to be, despite the impression that it is good. We think that Jacob is probably the worst farmer in the universe because he seems to have no time on the farm and seems to have bought the land with a totally useless acre. Beth has the key to a book store? There are many other issues, some of which have been resolved later in the movie, much later, in fact, too late. <br /> <br /> And per acre. Horror filmmakers point out that big uninhabitable objects are not intriguing in nature? and even if they are meant for a great acre, they do so. <br /> <br /> There is also a terrible lack of legitimacy, as Beth (the best performer followed by Jefferson's cop) suddenly seems to be accused of being under the sun just because he is a "drug." <br /> <br /> The complete field of 10 minutes and plus games (whether it was indexed) or six months old is a badly written scene after a poorly written scene. Bad plinky plonk "horror" music does not add to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Often bad movies can be amusing but not empty acres that are just bad.
