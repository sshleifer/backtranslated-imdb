I think if you are in sci-fi and horror, it may be interesting. Action was fine, but not great. Two pregnant girls should be fifteen, but they are probably played by older actors who were twenty-one at that time. The plot is okay, but the story jumps a bit, leaving one assumption whether you're in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to use the speed of the twine between the two. The Catholic Church is depicted as a secret sect to explore the events that only happen to those of the faith. What if two girls were Protestants? Are Catholics Cared For? That's why some of those who lived. Who knows, one day, the Catholic Church may even learn what the Bible teaches. If you forget it, don't feel like you've lost something.
