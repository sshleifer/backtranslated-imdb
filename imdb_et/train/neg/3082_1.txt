Good Lord, what did they mean? !!!!!! Here's your spoiler warning, though I don't think it's really important. You can't see it in the trash anyway. <br /> <br /> A group of trolley travels through a series of really stupid people who are going to really fool, try them out and make the dolls harder by letting them live their really stupid fantasies. In other words, this thing is really stupid. <br /> <br /> Knowing that it must be bad even if Mike and Bots can't save anything! And they don't! I know some of these lines were funny, like what to add to the character "HIT" and hand comments, but geez, it was pretty dang sad. <br /> <br /> All I can say DO NOT REMOVE. It doesn't deserve your eyes.
