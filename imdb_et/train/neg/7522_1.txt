Wow ... where to start ... chose $ 2.99 for this Big Lot. It's three bucks that I never see ... ever ... and why? I'll tell you. An hour and fifteen minutes of boring, boring, boring conversation and college angst, which seemed more suitable for a lifetime movie than a boxed horror movie. (Do the marketing droids who have shaped it burn in eternity in hell). Make sure that it is a little cheap gore (not even a good gore in mind ...) and a twist of the plot at the end that goes somewhere and makes no sense. Amazing, terrible, terrible ... <br /> <br /> Were there any redeeming qualities? Well, on Joe Bob's Briggs scale, six breasts took part, but it's hardly worth my three lost bucks. Without them, it could have been a Sci-Fi to say two or three in the morning ... <br /> <br /> Bmoviefreak
