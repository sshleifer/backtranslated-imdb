I looked at the unrated version of this movie and realized about 30 minutes that I never got back. I tried to finish, hoping that the dialogue would improve, martial arts seem to be realistic, the special FX seems really special. I was so wrong. I love Horror, I'm a complete gore hound. I think some of the eighties splinter clips are big times in the film world. But it wasn't done in the eighties when this film came out in the early eighties, it would have forgiven the fax. It was not that there was no protection. Dialogue is terrible because of so many bad lines that I was bothering about writing rather than torture. I don't like Hostel, ever, I thought it was overrated, over hyped, and I felt like some main characters, but it looks like a beacon next to its size. The back of the Live Feed lid allowed a twist that you never see, I'm still waiting for you to promise.
