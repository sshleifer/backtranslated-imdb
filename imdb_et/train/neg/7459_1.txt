please save your money and see something else. this movie was such a piece. I didn't want to go, but I had to think I wanted to laugh at least once, NOPE. no one laugh, it was terrible! Chris I never get after that great comedy and "night in roxbury". this film is absolutely obvious, it has no intelligent humor at all and it repeats time and again. listen to me and get so far from this movie as possible!
