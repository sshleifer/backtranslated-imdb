What a bad excuse to make New Zealnd Movie. I'm ashamed to call myself New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing New Zealand satellite TV (August 2006). A lot of local soap stars are cast. The ship is in real life one of the islands that fly every day between the two main islands and even have a corporate logo (dolphin) in the whole set, including the ship's funnel. The ship should be a cruise ship / ferry between the US and Mexico. It has obvious signs of rust and old age all over the place, but it should be a luxury ship that is on its first trip. One of the scenes shows the snow-covered borders of New Zealand's southern island for God's sake! Must be a very cold time in the US / Mexico area! The story is weak, action is weaker and New Zealand / American accents just don't work. I hope that New Zealand's taxpayer contributed to the cost of producing this film, and that was a waste of money that was better spent on real production. I know there are high school kids in New Zealand who could shoot better with their mobile phones. Goof: There is a truck that has a mark on it and they kept the Taco company signature on the door of the truck, presumably to look like it was American. But some of the badge is on the top of the tagging - you think they would have noted it as props when it was confirmed. I'd like to go ahead, but it's not just worth the effort.
