Ira Levin's Broadway smash barely hits the bones of meat, a mysterious plot that has only a few tricks and twists, but nobody is worth it. Frustrated writer Michael Caine prints to steal the work of a brilliant young man and wear it out on his own; his evil plan may include the murder of talented sons in Caine's arms. The first act in which everything is embedded is astonishingly dead, because Caine does everything the actor can do to keep pace. Dyan Cannon is disgraceful because his wife (he is too clever and wise to pass on) and Christopher Reeve (in the middle of the movie) seems to be extremely uncomfortable in the role of a better writer. These three characters and Irene Worth's cumbersome neighbor are so unspecified that what happens after the structure is hardly ever registered until after the second act begins. The direction of Sidney Lumet is static and fuzzy, the design set is not convincing and illuminated and the final is a complete disaster. Participants will fight the script with some content, but with such thin material we can see all their tense efforts. * 1/2 from ****
