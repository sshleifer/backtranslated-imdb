This movie was so bad that I had to move most of it fast to get a good bit. Hah, what good bit? the only value was the end (those who saw the movie know what I mean). I thought a lot would be expected of this movie, like the underworld, who meets Freddy and Jason with the dead threshold, but what I got was a mess. The story was forgotten, the lie was misused, and what was the director when he did. It could have been great, but I turned out to be the most boring movie I ever watched. OK, what if T and A were nice a bit, I was after gore and I was bitterly disappointed. Don't wait for a movie that's good, but if you want the horror of bad cheese, check it out and see how the horror movie should be done.
