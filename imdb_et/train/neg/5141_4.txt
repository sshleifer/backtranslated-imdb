In 1914, Charlie was an amazing year for Chaplin. It was his first year in films and appeared on more than 30 films! Although most of these films were not very good, they gave him the opportunity to develop his screen person slowly. However, this film still had the character of "Little Tramp". Of course, Charlie looked at this part, but his character was still lacking in sweetness and dignity, which he later developed. Instead, Chaplin often causes no reason for people to see, kicked, or do anything else. <br /> <br /> With this very light movie, it is interesting to look cast. Although not familiar today, Chaplin, together with Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain, celebrates all the exceptionally popular stars with Keystone Films. The problem with this movie is that although it has some nice scenes, the plot seems very vague and improperly developed. Chester and Mabel reached the racetrack (a very common theme in Keystone productions - this must be close to the race track). Charlie and Mack show up and sneak in. Mack pursues the police while doing this, while Charlie strikes Chester and steals his girlfriend. Finally, the police take Chester and Mack away for no apparent reason - leaving Charlie with Mabel (who did not seem to be Charlie's nervous behavior). <br /> <br /> If you are not a huge silent comedy buff or film historian, this is a very forgotten movie that is only important for Chaplin's development. What he and other actors actually do on the stage, but which is not unusual for a regular film, is not very funny today.
