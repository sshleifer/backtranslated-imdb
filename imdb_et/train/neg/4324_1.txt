The horse Griswalds won the T.V. game show "Pig Poke" at the main prize and everyone flies to Europe where they succeed in another foolish disaster. Of all the ridiculous, uncomfortable lakes that make money, it will win a lot. Harold Ramis' 1983 film was worse than average because the misfit family went on a terrible "holiday" in all countries. This time Amy Heckerling ("Look Who's Talking") roles that turn out to be a catastrophic "comedy" that will irritate you more if it makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> Dreadful and you don't know why Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo like this dead race, because even Anthony Michael Hall and Imogene Coca had the idea to reject the offer. Even the omnipotent Michael Palin is unable to raise the procedure to any level that could be called entertaining. <br /> <br /> But as unthinkable as it may seem, "European Vacation" was successful enough to justify another! Certainly, it would not be as tolerable as this. You know, I haven't seen an exhibition of the National Lampoon that was worth the effort. <br /> <br /> Monday, December 26, 1994 - T.V.
