Undoubtedly, this is one of the worst films I've ever wasted on money! The plot is erm sorry, did I say there was a plot? The more frightening moment was when ..., fast can't think! The best special effect that I hid under bedding was ..., speed can't think of it. You knew who the killer was right from the start. There was nothing frightening about the whole movie, in fact, there were only two uncomfortable bits when you saw the baby sister, Misty, in the shower and when you saw Sister Toppan take her top. This movie should only be seen to get an idea of ​​how not to make a horror movie !!!
