This whole movie should have lasted 45 minutes - maximum. Although this is an interesting concept / theme, this story did not develop. When the original idea of ​​a brave (stupid?) Bomb disposal expert (cowboy?) Has been introduced and it happens to the movie very early, the rest is repetitive. The characters were not studied and the location and policy aspects were ignored. It was a nice understanding that the violent difficulties in such foreign environments are facing, and the difficulty of distinguishing between a friend and an enemy. But the way the unit stretched faith! Individual performances were good and special effects were sufficient, but not sufficient to overcome the basic lack of content.
