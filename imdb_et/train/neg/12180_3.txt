This movie is absolutely terrible, but sometimes it can be fun, though this humor is totally involuntary. I don't even think that a ridiculous idiocy would convince a 2-year-old that filmmakers were trying to hit the story. On the positive side, however, there are a lot of humor with some terribly inanimate parcels. For example, "Wow, Lady Hogbottom has a giant rocket hidden in her backyard!" It gets worse (and even more fun), but I save you. <br /> <br /> Operation is generally ridiculous. Most children's roles are kind of cute, but not very plausible. On the other hand, Annie is quite terrible. Adults do not take their roles seriously, but it is largely good. If they had tried to be credible, the film would be even worse. What is hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> Once you have passed the crappines of the movie, there are virtually some outstanding moments in almost non-crappiness. The scene where Lady Hogbottom's son runs away with the maid is surprisingly fun, although it is a tedious drop in the police. Butler character, though very small, has sunlight that almost, but never quite penetrates through, the darkness. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie caused me physical pain. Nonetheless, the couple had a redeeming portion that made it almost traceable without starting internal bleeding. Based on its good parts alone, the film would be about 5; unfortunately, it deserves another movie. 1. So I give it 3. <br /> <br /> It's pretty generous, I would say.
