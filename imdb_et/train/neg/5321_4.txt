An unforgettable musical comedy that tries to marry artificially when the top rock 'n' roll-off explosions are suburban feelings in the suburbs. The result is a dirty-dated mish-mash that does not match any audiences, but at least keeps their parents involved. <br /> <br /> A quick look at writing a promo on the back of a video output should be content content. Tom Ewell is a drunken agent who plays so few cartoons that he almost waits for him to "hey honey, I'm home!" Blurb sites "so funny" during the seven years of itching. "It sounds almost like an excuse. Which other film sells itself that the leading player was something else? It's like" so funny "seven-year itching" ... but it's garbage in it ". <br /> <br /> Mansfield, a beautiful girl with rumors of 50-inch assets, is unfortunately a good cellar Monroe with all the rotten octopus operational and comic timing. Her wooden delivery with Ewell's double-shot OTT makes this comedy partner Hell For its part, it sells to us: "[Jayne Mansfield], whose most obvious talents are the cause of many of the biggest laughs in the movie!" As you can see, the film that was sold on the idea that its lead is a big boobs is the most complicated. there are men who literally fall over, their glasses crack over Mansfield, etc. Only the nightmare of the Freud powder overflow casts doubt on his "U" certificate. <br /> <br /> players are chosen to be the most adenin. Do you really care about Eddie Fontaine's offer: "I love your eyes, I love your lip, they taste even better than potato chips" in the song "Cool It, Baby"? MOR is leaving only the little Little Richard, but is forced to sing some of his father-friendly songs in four minutes. And how do all the acts sing without a microphone? The catching satire in the industry is broad and childish in its concept. <br /> <br /> Technically, the picture is quite advanced, with special effects (including ghostly Julie London) and deluxe (which now looks smooth and actually reminds of the red colors that bleed and fake, toning the painted film). However, the direction is not remarkable and the sound quality is also quite poor. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's so old. The time the men still smoked on the screen made the poor cute childrens' comments, and the black servants could only eat and dance. (All this happens here). Yet there are some similar hot, African Queen, Ben Hur, and many many more in the form of films from that time that you can still enjoy today, so the "good at that time" argument doesn't really stand up. Her Heart Girl Can't Help It is a cynical and patronizing attempt that does not carry careful control. 4/10. <br /> <br />
