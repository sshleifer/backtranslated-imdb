Assuming it doesn't come straight to the video output, I have to say that this title is in any case void. If you're not bored with a good, well-executed movie, that's it. I saw it last night at AFI Dallas, and I left it just 20 minutes just because I didn't care (about the plot, not about the director's insult ... it's uncomfortable). If you can see only 5 minutes in the movie (excerpt, broken window before the shot is fired ... and then the window breaks with the first picture), things go bad. Let's just say it's just an indication of future things ... unfortunately. <br /> <br /> I will save you all the details, but it is a sub-parameter in every sense, even the half-acting Michael Madsen is disappointing when you expect him to be half-empty. And the rape scene ... Christ! "Escape and Take It" should never be used in rape. EVER. <br /> <br /> 3/10
