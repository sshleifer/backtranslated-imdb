The story of LOST MISSILE is not bad at all, but unfortunately this story hits the middle and excessive film footage and bad special effects sink to the sub-parameter level of this movie. <Br /> <br /> The film starts with a rocket heading towards Earth. The panic is that it strikes the land, the Soviet Union manages to direct the object. However, this may not be good, as this seemingly unmanned ship has a steam line that destroys everything along its way, and the ship is now in a low orbit on the planet. In other words, every passport is followed by death - what can kill us all! So, the task of the US scientists (led by a very young and barely recognizable Robert Loggia) is to design and plan us to save - and especially in New York, which is on its direct flight path! Unfortunately, they can't save Ottawa (I've never been there, so I can't tell if it's a big loss), but thanks to good old American know-how, they can finally destroy it as a destroyer! <br /> <br /> As you can see, the story is not a bad idea and quite original. But so many old radar constraints on old combat aircraft and boys' mechanisms can be a bit old and it seemed like cushioning. Generally, a decent, but hardly inspired film that the genre's extreme fans want - all others see it at their own risk.
