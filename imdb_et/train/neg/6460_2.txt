* Can anyone tell me where is COMEDY? !! <br /> <br /> * (Charlie Sheen) is a very weak comedian (Thomas Haden's Church) looking so weak (with her!) and the whole thing is so thick. <br /> <br /> * They tried to make a living comic book that turned out to be a superb comic, and it wasn't even funny? As a plan scene in the bathroom; it was so good with its cinematic imagination but nothing more than PAIN! <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland ?? His relationship with the girl ??? <br /> <br /> This is actually the kind of work they did just to earn it and make money, but it became such a crime if it was robbed of us who were so low on a piece of art and entertainment. there was absolutely no entertainment. ALL! <br /> <br /> * Well, it would have been surprising if it was a big production and Brandos starring in the golden years on the REAL star. <br /> <br /> Sheen family here. Just be aware of it! <br /> <br /> * Anyone who wondered about this movie or -God Forbid-loving it! Then you need to go directly to therapy before you become more dangerous and injure someone else! <br /> <br /> * (Brando) is undoubtedly a genius, but no movie! And he didn't want to be here, he'd definitely read it! But the main big problem is that no one else has worked on this matter trying or wishing to be a little time wise or even good !!! (Sorry, I'm crying now! Movie torture is incredible!). <br /> <br /> * There's a scene where (Brando) hits his shoes (Mira Sorvino)! It was so realistic! Maybe she saw herself inside her, so she punished herself for being in such a mess! <br /> <br /> * Billion Time: It could have been better (or worse!). The scenario, up to the train, was nice and I imagined they were fleeing to get chased, like the other (Smokey and Bandit), but (Brando) as a sheriff. In fact, any of these chimeras was gracious than what I watched! <br /> <br /> * Why did this masterpiece not receive the Razzie Award? Want to believe me that the movie is lower than that? I do not think so ! This is a situation where the Razzie instructor has to win for his own negligence! <br /> <br /> * Martin Sheen is here as a guest, maybe to support his son, but ironically, his father is like his son! and why is it so! Well! Because I hate Martin Sheen, maybe more than I hate comic films was not as good as his ambition! <br /> <br /> * This is not a comedy movie, NO .. This is a horror! and I just hate horror films, especially those that are propagated as a comic! <br /> <br /> * Is it a good name? Hmmm! Well, it's compared to another Marlon Brando monster movie (Dr Moreau Island - 1996) (Casablanca) !! PS: If you still want to know what is or is just bad, ugly and very ugly in this movie. Ask for your last prayers and see it. Will God help you!
