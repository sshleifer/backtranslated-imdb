When you enter this movie, you know that this is a film with six laboratory technicians with an invisible maniac. So you think who lives and who dies right now. Survivors will find out exactly who you are waiting for, so there are no points on the plots. <br /> <br /> And if you're not sure if it's a B-film or a movie that just happens to be a lab story with a story, William Devane plays a part: an instant B-movie status. <br /> <br /> The start of the movie is promising. The lab introduces an invisible gorilla who is becoming more violent. Oooh, predictions. The best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again. Great special effect. The same thing when they make Bacon invisible. <br /> <br /> There are a few bare boobs, really flat dirty joke and enough space to testify to giving this movie an R rating that he doesn't really need <br /> <br /> For the thriller, there were no surprises , unless Shue does like a MacGyver in a freezer, which is more "Whaaaa"? OK, there is one surprise. Then Caine (Bacon) comes back to the lift shaft last time. It was a surprise, but only because you were tenting, 'Noooo! You're already dead! Stop the movie! 'Speaking of television screaming, I did everything in the last 25 minutes. "Put your f # @% ing goggles!" Instead of putting their infrared goggles inside to see them, they try all the other tricks in this book (fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems ...). <br /> <br /> True to the end. But the special effects were good; this is the only reason I give it 2/10.
