Despite being (a) intelligent, (b) important, and (c) interesting, this film is fortunate to be graciously gracious. The script makes little sense, the whole idea of ​​a sad-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strange, and John Lydon shows us all one movie in the room, why he should never let go of music. His performance is one-off and irritating. The only positive thing to say is that Harvey Keitel can do a good job. His later poor lieutenant would have shown how bad the actors might act, but graciously his power here is modest.
