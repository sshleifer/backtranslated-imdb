I've seen the movies of the werewolves on the right in my time, but it takes the cake. More comedy than horror, "Full Moon High" puts cheese "c". The quality of the star of this movie is not bad. Just how it was done just sends downhill rolling. Adam Arkin plays Tony, a 50-year-old American-American high school footballer who doesn't get older due to the bite of werewolves in Transylvania. The most disturbing part of the movie was the violin player. He drove all the batty! Ed McMahon plays his ultra-conservative father who met his own ball. Alan's father Alan plays a shrink that doesn't seem to be at the top of his game. After all these years, Tony seems to be very inappropriate because of the attack, and then he gets the chance to catch his country. More laugh than blood, this movie is just the beginning of the 80s, "Teen Wolf" was better than that! 1 out of 5 stars.
