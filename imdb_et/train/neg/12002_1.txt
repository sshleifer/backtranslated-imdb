This is a sad sad film for people. I sat in the theaters where my hair left, and I want to break the chairs in front of me, because the film shook scenes with a second glow. And there were the people who got rid of me with laughter, which made me wonder what kind of movies these people would have to watch to enjoy that horse **. <br /> <br /> Nikkh Advan has six tracks with no plot and interesting characters. The scenario is boring, apparently he was drunk while writing this movie. These stories have not been strongly held. Nothing new, nothing to hold the audience and dialogues that would have heard a million times before. One of the stories is that this couple is unable to have sex, because every time they want it, disasters happen. I mean seriously, is this story really necessary? He's not funny, not creative, but proves that Advan doesn't know comedy. The second story (which was probably my only interesting story) is based on the man's infidelity, and it ends with a flat-old sat-savitri pat-parmeshwari crap. I have no idea what the Salmaan-Priyanka plot was. The plot had no question of being a plot. He can't take Karan Johar's movie because he has to marry Salman? Why can't she marry her and still take a movie? or do Advan and Priyanaka want to prove to the world that it is true that female actors cannot be successful if they are married or that they should not act in films when they are married? With six participants in the film, apparently, Advan cant produces the film all by himself. So he fully uses such sponsors as the Times group, shamelessly promoting his Filmfare magazines. And also some jewelry brand which women in the film absolutely seem to adore! I'm coming to IMDb to give him the worst rating and I'm shocked to see the film's praise. It just goes to show the bad Bollywood situation and how the star has hit the fans. Fans like movies like Salaam E Ishq will continue and worse likely to hit it.
