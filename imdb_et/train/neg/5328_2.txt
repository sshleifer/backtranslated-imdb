It seems that Susan Seidelman has had a decent career with a couple of top-notch credits under her belt. I'm sure he was bouncing back on this movie, which seems to be his admirers. I'm not one of them. <br /> <br /> I've seen better action playing high school than I was at Smithereens. Such a plot as it is involved with young Susan Berman, who is ambitious to make this music in the world and ready to do something to get there. He even rejects the sincere advancement of a young artist who lives outside of East River, playing by Brad Rijn. <br /> <br /> Young Mr. Rijn helps to cope the worst in the film, actually one of the worst-performing work I've seen for a long time. No wonder he's gone nowhere. <br /> <br /> I say that the Seidelman camera camera is good at capturing the places of the familiar East Village, where the film was mostly shot. But his work with his living performers didn't work. I'm not sure he had so much raw material to work with. <br /> <br /> Look quickly and you will see very young Christopher Noth before law and order and having sex in the city as a street hustler. br /> <br /> If you like punk rock, you can sit around for a soundtrack. I'm leaving for Bing Crosby.
