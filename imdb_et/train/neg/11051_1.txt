A frightening movie that includes Canadian D-list Canadian actors who seem so self-conscious that they are in the camera, that their performances are too melodic and quite forgotten. <br /> <br /> This movie is poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly targeted. It's inseparable, incomprehensible and odd - but not good. McDowell does a great job he has given, but it is the only one in this movie - he has a really bad story and script. It's not even funny at camp. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen Van Pelleske acting in a reliable manner yet, and even sub-characters like Eisen (with his nose, with a fine voice) say we're a lot in Toronto, not on Africa. <br /> <br /> Didn't the director see the "creature" look like a jazz dancer in an alien suit? The struggle between the blue flash bolts and the Pelleske 'magic orange (due to the lack of a better word!) Is obviously due to the bad actors who do not have a choreographer covered with fully derived special effects. Was there even a director in the editing room of this catastrophe (not a good kind)? <br /> <br /> Learn from the mistakes of others ... don't even waste your time on it, you won't lose it as I did. I have nothing to say about this cellulose waste.
