OK - Cons First: Mandatory "70s Alligator (All Right, Correction - Caiman) With Fixed Limbs Changes a number of miniature underwater shots (adult reptile compared to boat size) using a toy alligator that is turned around in a toy's wide illuminated water - even in night-time shots ! <br /> <br /> Unlike most of the primitive-killing-exploiting western movies, superstitious natives move to skin **** and begin to disguise holidaymakers at this time without reason. Nobody abused natives - exploited, but not far from abuse. After all, it was one of the natives (a supermodel spoiled by the taboo during the full moon) that brought them the curse of the river-demon correctly? <br /> <br /> Holidaymakers are easily annoying (notable for the symbolic old soul / slightly godly-little-girl-who-takes-a-shine-to-heroes you often see in the 70s) far from what deserves a violent death - if they weren't your next door neighbors, think about you. The couple are actually killed as a heroic - remarkable that none of them performs the role of sidekick. There are only two straight villains in the movie, so the demise seems more arbitrary than cathartic. <br /> <br /> The queue in which a giant thug falls and scarves thirty tourists in less than five minutes is likely to hit you inadvertently. <br /> <br /> The point where the natives decide to wipe out the surviving western countries and practically say "hey, you're not so bad, excuse me last night" because they blew up a monster lizard - do you shake your head when bright music comes in hits. You know, a local military dictatorship destroys a village **** for tourists with a roll of credit ... <br /> Pros: Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. You all know why you're interested in this movie, right? I thought so. If you're a Bach graduate, recreate the DVD by NoShame movies early this year (digitally remastered without any real additions to speak, aside from a manager who violates the current state of international film distribution). <br /> <br /> The hero is not half-bad, far from the idiot (always plus B-films), and the cynical little boy offers the most comical relief. <br /> <br /> Look at it, but get it cheaply!
