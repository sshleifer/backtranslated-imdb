From the moment Christopher Lee puts a couple of punk sunglasses on and tries to sneak into a punk rock club, you know you have a smelly hand! This film had potential. Under the sludge there are scraps that could have been a decent film, if not interesting. But the final product is a real mess. In addition to free nudity and some very attractive women, Howling II is under the wind, a ridiculous pretext for a horror movie. Christopher Lee gives him a nugget of credibility, but even he can't raise it above the resurrection. <br /> <br /> Having ever seen any other movie in this series, this critic is forced to accept the value of being a real continuation of the first part of the events. Let's start at the funeral of one of the original characters, and in the first ten minutes we find ourselves in Transylvania, with a small group of heroes ready to fight between werewolves. The film is quite well occupied and there are not too many dead spots. Activities are there; it's just not filmed. One bright spot is the music of a band called Babel. Although their song is played quite often, it is quite memorable. <br /> <br /> The problems in this movie are great. First, it is worse than bad. Christopher Lee is good enough, but that's where it ends. Two cases, Brown Brown and Annie McEnroe, are almost missing what you want for such characters. Writing is wretched, editing is superfluous and the direction is amateurish. There's a couple of nice special effect tricks, but the hair ones who are far away are considering them. Sybil Danning is nice to watch, but his actor is less satisfying. Judd Omen looks at the part he plays, but his voice and acting are not convincing. Much of the dialogue is in an incomprehensible language that can be Latin. <br /> <br /> I liked the general idea of ​​the story. I always enjoy stories of true believers to fight the seemingly invincible forces of evil. One scene where a small group of good men trickle through the dark forest and let a bunch of werewolves accumulate is even exciting. Something similar. Perhaps a bigger budget or a better director could have made the rest of the film more convincing. 3 stars out of 10. <br /> <br /> The Hound. <br /> <br /> Side Note: Since this writing, youtube.com censors have still not completed credit for ripping Sybil Danning. Babel playing the song several times! Catch it when you can!
