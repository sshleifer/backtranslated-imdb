I have to say that this movie is Mork and Mindy, when I look at it, when I got chills, I even noticed a little. When this Korean boy, whose spiders in his neck, began to hit people, I was like my father's Asian people smelling and sucking because they eat dogs all the time. Somehow back, Chuck had a somewhat terrible force and lacked the intelligence of a normal non-robotic person. Some people would compare it in their earlier days when it was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of the Christmas area. This movie is so bad that I put my new baby in the box and left it in Mr. Norris's mailbox. He can raise my boyfriend, I will not let him in the world where he thinks Chuck Norris is a karate expert Ill let him see what this cage is like in life for the rest of his life.
