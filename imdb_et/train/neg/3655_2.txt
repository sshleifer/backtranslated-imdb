Oh, I think it can be one of the most exciting movies I've ever seen. I'm serious, it's one of the best b-movies. The first proof is that it is not a $ 5 DVD. Oh no, that's the main thing for it. I got it from VHS, from a local video store full of ex-rental videos. His name was Mayeda, he was sent on an epic journey around the world to acquire 5,000 meat from the King of Spain, while at sea the violent storm swallowed their precious gold for the purchase of weapons and almost lives Mayeda must fight with all probabilities to survive and secure his beloved Japanese destiny. "Then it is said:" A multi-million dollar seasonal ethical adventure from three continents "<br /> <br /> I've seen another movie. It wasn't epic, and it was definitely nothing more than a million dollars. No," Shogun Mayeda "is really only English Mayeda (Sho Kosugi) crazy adventure. He is not even Shogun really, but it is not important. It is important that he makes a very cool impression that John Clee's recharging to one of the castles in Monty Python and the Holy Grail and his ability to go serious Awesome. <br /> <br /> The biggest thing about this movie is the Sho Kosug Engrish accent, which may be missing from almost everything that makes a good movie, but does it with some of the most exciting features offered by coolest engrish accent. And honestly, do you really want something else? You could move the "Shogun Mayed" fast and play the last line of Koshu again. Awesome. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - So very fun.
