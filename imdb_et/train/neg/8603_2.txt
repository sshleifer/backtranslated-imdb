It could have been quite an entertaining film, but rather it is with other droplets like leeches and Rest In Pieces at the bottom of the cinematic food chain. If they had played this flick-in-cheek, it could have been a very fun movie, such as Re-Animator or Dead ALive, but Juan Piquor Simon plays this tongue-cheek on the spot, but more often. <br /> The prerequisite for this movie is the small community that is limited by mutated slugs. Near the sewerage network, there is an abandoned toxic waste dump, which mutates the slugs into aggressive, meat-eating monsters - albeit monsters that move slowly and can be put under their trigger. The Health Inspector Michael Garfiled and two associates are the only people who seem to be ready to fight fools, but the sheriff and the mayor think they are crazy. The climax is a laughing attack - involuntary - that makes you scratch your head when a fool (actors and scriptwriter) is a blast destruction scenario. <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (No new base Simon seems to play gore elements in language-in-cheek, but dialogue is straight. If Simon worked with smart script - one with plenty of one-liners and eccentric characters , it could have been a cult film). br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (You won't be shot here. We get a lot of explosive chest cavities, as well as a big bang in the middle of an Italian restaurant. Blood and intestines that many spectators of horror movies enjoy are in full swing. also the dead bodies of the people who have been picked clean, and the many hungry scenes). <br /> <br /> MAKING: $ (Wow! Michael It seems Garfield knows this script is smelly and he shows his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how embarrassing it is to make a movie ndeavor is Kim Terry, as her husband, does enough work, though she does a bit beyond her-face-face-to-you-screaming. "Teenagers" were all terrible actors - no exceptions. Man, this movie could have used Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs !) <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$ (Two teenagers can sleep before they are sent - a badly done scene - a horde of hunger that both men and women are nudity).
