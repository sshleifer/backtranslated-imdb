Today, I found a rental for VHS "They all laughed". It was really old and very usable VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on this cover: I was called by Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specifically Dorothy Stratten, the price was very low and I I decided to risk and buy. Searching for IMDb and User Class 6.0 was a great reference. I watched "Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and ??? wow? four stars! So I decided I could not waste more time and see immediately. Indeed, I just finished watching "They all laughed" and I found this very boring overpriced movie. The characters are badly developed and I spent many minutes understanding the story of their role. The plot should be funny (private eyes who love women they are behind) but I have not laughed at the whole story. Coincidences like a big city like New York are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra is an attractive and very seductive man whose women fall against him as if they were Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney. Ultimately, the major attractions are definitely the presence of Playboy's midline and the year-old Dorothy Stratten, a spouse, who was murdered by her husband after the release of the film and whose life was shown as "Star 80" and "Death of a. Center: Dorothy Stratten Story"; sexy Patti Hansen, the amazing beauty of the future Mrs. Keith Richards; always wonderful, even fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song "Amigo" by Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like it, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the late 60s and his fans call them "King". I only keep this movie in my collection because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Muito Riso e Muita Alegria" ("Many laughs and good luck")
