Again I took the opportunity and rented it in a bag. Settled as a horror tape, there was no scene, no scene that was even scary. NOT ONE !! Of course there was nudity, but all lesbian activities were a bit old. I think this can be the saving arm of the movie? And Dan, which is a tedious ass bag !! Right from the start, I knew I was good at how good sister Dan first spoke. And was he supposed to be scary? What a laugh! All in all, this movie is terribly awful! How the hell can such movies do? If you want a movie with some somewhat excitement, don't rent it. This movie is as exciting as Teletubbies.
