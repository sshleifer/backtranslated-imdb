Ronald Reagan and a number of US soldiers in a North Korean military camp. They are tortured ... We learn North Korean Communists are bad people ... We learn American beards very slowly during the day of torture ... <br /> <br /> I tried to suppress it, but eventually I broke this movie with a laugh . It was a scene when Mr. Reagan came to the Communists to say he wanted to be on their side. He then asks for the bottle brand. Next, he takes the drunken companion Dewey Martin, drunk by the rocky cold queen, to get sulfur to cure Mr Martini's hangover. Of course, the North Korean Communist guard is as stupid as they come. So, the drunk disturbs the guard when Reagan goes to get something in the drawer next to a number of empty boxes. I'm sure his boxes had to contain something; But, of course, Reagan causes them to shake enough to show they are empty. You have to laugh! I think the "prisoner of war" is mainly turning to those who worked it, family and friends - otherwise it is wasteful. <br /> <br /> Prisoner of War (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest, Dewey Martin
