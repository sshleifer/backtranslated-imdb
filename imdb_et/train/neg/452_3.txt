I watched this movie about a love project. Please tell Nicolas Cage to find out what he would feel about his character, and read the lines he says again. My life can't go on ... I accidentally cut off my hand ... my brother was close. Probably his fault. And when there are happy cuts, it was a nice man who takes care of his mother sad and alone. No closing, bad script and not enough small characters. Save yourself if you don't want to laugh. Costumes are made appropriately and the accessories made a fabulous job. I'm sure it would have been a fun movie, but keep it more from the genre, I can't recommend this movie to anyone I know because it's not an intellectual film. It's not a chick flick. It is not strictly romantic. And I can't show kids because of sex and the issues they follow. All in all, it's just not a good flick.
