In this strange shortage of apocalypse, the world suffers from the double plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to be too concerned about this in the Z-Class film because it is less similar to Sheridan's Le Fanu's famous novel than my mother's lasagna recipe. The eternal escorts are still in the petrol stations, and doctors still make house calls, and assisting police officers are still showing radiator fluid just when you need it. Plot and I use this concept loosely, involving a father and a daughter who is trying to get into "all" whose daughter has disappeared, in the church, to kill a vampire who happens very comfortably with his father and daughter. I have to admit that a moment or two of real humor is found between great or unintentional sense of humor. The film also has enough nudity to keep fourteen interested boys. Anyone who is older, beware.
