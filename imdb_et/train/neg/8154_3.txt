The long list of "big" names in this flick (including John Mills everywhere) didn't convert me to the extent that I couldn't judge the movie from its true values. It's full of stereotypes, cartoons, and standard scenes that are humble to air-to-hero to hard foot-to-rack flyer. The song was such that at one point, about an hour before the end, I thought the film was over: pick, rising crescendo, big bloom and finish, then silence, but then the movie continued! I didn't find any real story, random writing, but smartly pressed uniforms, and inherited a little ditty with Jean Simmons (pre-nose work). I can't say that this image has some ingredients that make the movie big. I found this maudlin, mawkish and minor.
