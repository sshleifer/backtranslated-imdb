Holy shit. It was the worst movie I've seen for a long time. All the performances are good, but there is no plot. Really! No plot! A number of clowns are talking about this and that and it's your movie. Ug ... The character of Robert Duvall is senile and asks the same people the same and repeatedly. It will serve the same answers over and over again. I'm pretty sure this movie came to six because people think they like it. A good performance with famous and well-respected actors, but the real complete work is steamy turd. Well, maybe it's a bit deceptive, because the steam rising from the fresh pile sounds a little like something and in this movie, NOT ACID! Sack
