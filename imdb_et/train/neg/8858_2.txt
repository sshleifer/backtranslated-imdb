Ben's out-of-town policeman is convinced that his sister was brutally murdered and wants to bring his killer to court, but Stefan, who believes his sister was a victim of werewolves, is approaching her. So Ben, his sister's best friend and Stefan are traveling to Transylvania to end this evil. <br /> <br /> This is an incredibly terrible class B stuff and I was wondering how it would even be released. This makes the original "Howling" look like a masterpiece. What was Christopher Lee's thinking, because it must be his worst power I've seen. <br /> <br /> This real cheap movie was wrong, from Annie's real teeth and wood performances to McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (not forgotten by Lee), cheesy fashion (these sunnies), cheap and flat special effects, poor use of lighting, humor ... when there was no 80s music (some movies focused only on playing some unknown band), werewolves, a vision, and a tiring story with a firm and tedious dialogue. I thought it would be so bad that it would be terribly funny, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Positive were the location of the movie and the settings that seemed great, but it's about ... I actually add Sybil Danning's short removal scene. <br /> <br /> Final credits that the band plays during strange editing of their crap-house song scenes, which I ask, why? <br /> <br /> A terrible piece of confusion, but at least it's not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
