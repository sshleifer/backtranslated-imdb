Here we have a movie that doesn't quite succeed in any way if the film's failure is possible. Terrible script, weak performance, amateur management, ridiculous special effects ... it's just a terrible movie. Not to mention that when you get to the end, you realize that the whole thing doesn't make sense for licking. After spending the whole movie thinking what is going on in this world when things are finally explained, you realize that the story is built on a foundation that is ridiculously impossible. In one of these outrageous "cables explaining the entire movie" sequences, it is said that our villain has done something that cannot be done simply and that makes no sense at all. Oh, and after that we can see that there is a certain opera. I'm sure Drew Barrymore wants to pretend that this movie has never happened. If, for some godly reason, you are ever tempted to sit and watch this movie, I suggest you take the time to hit your head for 104 minutes. It would be a much more pleasant experience than sitting through this garbage.
