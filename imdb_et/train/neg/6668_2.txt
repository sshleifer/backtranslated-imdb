The longer this movie went on, and it seemed to last forever, the more irritated I changed, as to be honest, the waste of time through its complete mess. How can people make such films or finance garbage for people? Don't be fooled by the relatively high ratings of IMDb because it just proves you can fool some people. In this picture, the main players are obsessed with weapons, so it's not hard to figure out how this movie will ultimately unfold. America will never realize that the rest of the world finds it odd how US society has such a lame and deadly "armed culture". Anyway: <br /> <br /> The main actor depicts a loser who flees into a fantasy world with a city street trafficker. He comes across a family of two corrupt grandchildren, a teenage girl and a boy; Take care of a strict single parent who can't barely cope. Cowboy has seduced a teenage girl or vice versa, and an impressive boy is probably taken from the loser madness. <br /> <br /> Cowboy always spends on unreality and depression. The loser who prefers to go to the beach will live and then break into his family because he is too lazy to make money legally. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: <br /> <br /> Who wants to look at a sad failed loser in a fantasy world that has a desire for death, or indeed a poor family who isn't really much better than a white trash?! <br /> <br /> This movie is useless with Drivel. <br /> <br /> It only saves you the lowest possible character by listening to music: <br /> <br /> 2/10.
