Where do I start? By the title of this movie, I was expecting some authenticity, finally I was heavily down. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or Lili Marlene's song, but it is a story of Hollywood (or the centerpiece of making your own movie) based on some real reality. I should have had a clue when I heard a heavy English accent that gave the film a German introduction; Blood red text (title, artists) should have had another clue. The story has evolved (Lale was not Rolf Liebermann's parents abducted from Switzerland, there is no information that Liebermann helped smuggle Jews from Germany, the original song was recorded outside the NS regime's control, not under control, a record station was played in Vienna, while leaving had left near, etc.) costumes are weak and incorrect for schedules (SS-black uniforms used every time border posts are deployed, they are routinely used after the war, etc.) are characters stereotypes (tempts the club if they were virtually impossible ). Don't waste your time.
