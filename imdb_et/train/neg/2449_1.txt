Bashki should be congratulated for trying to change one of the great English fiction works from the movie and defeating it stupidly. The animation was bad, the characters looked ridiculous, the music was overwhelming and the film was the first book and half of Tolkien's masterpiece. I still remember that I saw it for the first time because of my frustration and film. Now, I understand that every attempt to convert a book into a film is simply a failure in many ways, simply because of this tool, but this film, regardless of the source of the story, is just plain pathetic. Bashki can do much more.
