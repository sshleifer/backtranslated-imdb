Bingo is a game, it's a name. It is rarely the case with a flare-up of fear that is equipped with half-burned conspiracy theories, the Puritate Pride and the new era. Most of the story is placed in the Peruvian jungle Cristian resort Viciente. Think of Tolkien's Rivendell meets Star Trek's planet Baku, home to non-mysterious but surprisingly narrowly-minded culture, love and peace followers. Thanks to the terrible behavior and sticky production project (the mysterious healing "energy" rainbow-colored visualization is particularly nervous), "Celestine Prophecies" looks like a recognized "Twilight Zone" episode of the 1980s. The factual errors in the history and nomenclature of the Church are numerous. I can't believe Hector Elizondo agreed to be part of it. Maybe it was done without his consent in the Bowfinger style. May the Lord be gracious for the director, scriptwriter, novelist and poor souls who see the movie or read the book.
