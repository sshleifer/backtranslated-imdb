We laughed at our head. This script is so incredible that you either go to CNN or go to sleep. <br /> <br /> My father was a sea captain for 30 years, he couldn't believe in his eyes when he believed his movie. <br /> <br /> During his official experience he once stood over the ship, captain drunk 3 bottles of whiskey / day and (sorry) ** on his desk. Of course, it was not a nuclear mission. <br /> <br /> For example, a fire in the kitchen, a fire is the most important of any ship, nuclear or not. Giving a drill at this time is just a Hollywood script. When the captain is arrested, he is arrested, you take all your keys and open the safe where the weapons are stored. It is kept in a well-kept room for a few minutes. He can't escape, it's like a prison. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that my dad also had a dog on board, but we can see how Hackman lets the pee pee. It's never been done. My father cleaned all the dogs wherever he was. <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington are making the three stars that this film is credited with, all the rest are bulls ** t. <br /> <br /> If we know that there were 23 more people living in Koerskie, this film gets a bigger dimension. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real thriller for underwater rentals: Thas Boat. <br /> <br />
