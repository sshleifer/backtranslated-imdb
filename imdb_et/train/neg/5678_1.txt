It should be one of the worst, if not the worst, movies I've ever seen. (I couldn't look at it all the time). It is purely and simply non-violent in the interest of it, and a ridiculous story only adds weakness and incompetent filming. Sick. And only suitable for those who love the distortion of mania. After killing hundreds of men, women, and children, Seeds end up trying to kill some policemen who finally get a hint of their whereabouts. He was sentenced to death by an electric chair and remains wonderful. He was buried alive, digging his way out and wringing revenge on those who pulled him away and switched the switch. Needless to say, there are more terrible murders ...
