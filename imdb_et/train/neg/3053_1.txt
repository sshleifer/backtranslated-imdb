Wow. Who Ever Said Edward D. Wood Jr. did not affect anyone? This stack of steam faeces is a perfect example; it makes "violent years" like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" makes Keith Richard's worst setbacks like my first night-time emission. I have had nightmares, you know, awakening and sweating of balls that never go near the visceral terror that Santa Claus discovered about the apparently pure soil of being. But I can think of some parties where this film could actually go well. Also, if you are looking for a perfect example of Santa-Satan's dichotomy on a VHS tape, look no further. Don't watch this movie because I have been told that the MST3K version is now available. Move to Satan, here is "Santa Claus".
