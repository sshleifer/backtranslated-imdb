1/10. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you don't think you just wasted 2 hours of life when you see the role of credit. I honestly believe I can make a better vampire movie .... and I don't know anything. The only thing that doesn't wonder (heavier than a vampire) is Jason Scott Lee ... his character is at least a bit cool, he has a mystery and beats a little butt.
