Even in the case of cocaine, it is pathetic in the 1980s. I do not understand why someone would want to waste cellular, time, effort, money and audience brain cells. If you are going to do a comedy, make it fun. If you want to shoot such a trash, keep it yourself. If you are going to release it like this: DON'T !!! I mean, was that a joke right? Someone please tell me it was a joke. please.
