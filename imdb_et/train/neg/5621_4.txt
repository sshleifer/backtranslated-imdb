I'm an uneven skeptic and agnostic, so I waited to enjoy this movie. After I look at it, I honestly believe I could have better documented myself. Its arguments seem to be just four false sources (despite having been on IMDb's credit list, I didn't see Richard Dawkins everywhere), it is shipped with harshly ridiculous amateur computer effects and it doesn't even make the slightest event seem impartial. The narration is a pierced, almost unstable Christian spirit, destroying any chance that the film can actually change one's mind, not just the preaching of the choir (i.e.). Although there are some interesting discussions about Jesus' historical debate, the intolerable grip of the film strikes when he begins to live strongly in a Christian school that the director attended as a child, an institution that apparently frightened him psychologically because he was committed to him. Although TGWWT probably had a small budget, it was still possible to make a wise comment on the very questionable roots of Christianity. There is definitely a skeptical lack of meaningful religious documentary on the market, and this film could have been declared empty. Instead, the director decided on our intelligence against this trash, which eventually seems to be some kind of therapeutic exercise for him. It is too bad that his Christian upbringing traumatized him, but he does not have to subject the audience to his coping mechanism.
