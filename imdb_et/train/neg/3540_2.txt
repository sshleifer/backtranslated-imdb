Guy Richie's third right film (which does not contain divine horror "Swept Away") is a sophisticated action thriller associated with gambling, gangsters and chess. The fans of Richie's earlier efforts hate the revolver as much as I did, twists and turns. Richie stalwart Jason Statham plays the newly released Jake to ridiculously call Dorothy Macha (great for OTT Ray Liotta), but ended up with a couple of other drawbacks, one of which is Andre 3000 rap outfit Outkast who throws him and us to the audience several red herring, all of which become extremely annoying. The high point of this movie's confusion is a bit in the restaurant where the dialogue turns up, Revolver is a faulty job that isn't really terrible, but Richie's the best, but that's still a lock, a spare.
