I enjoyed the movie very, emotionally, intellectually, and visually. It does not contain violence or sex, drugs or special effects, and does not need them once, with attention to the words of vision, story and wisdom all the time. <br /> <br /> But: [1] some foreign language accents made the dialogue difficult to hear and understand; [2] is unnecessary excessive use (especially the F-word, which is the only reason why this film was rated R). [3] The film is balanced with humor and emotions, but most of the emotions that keep you in the film, except for the last minute resolution, are unpleasant, because the excessive long-term dysfunctional response of some characters is gone, lives too long in the depths of bitterness and depression. [4] I do not recommend this movie due to a 5-second background event that did not include the side-characters it applied to one bit or the movie - it only switched me to the movie and caught the brain through the movie and later: mother of the main character who are the views of German parents, watching old WWII movies, "the secret roots of the Germans." If the Nazi war won, there would be no local color or art. I don't know any Germans today except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place when the Nazi World War II won.
