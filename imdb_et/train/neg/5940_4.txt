Look, I read and read these comments and there is a lot I want to say, but I'm trying to get it short but clean ... <br /> <br /> First of all, forget all the bad things the movie was made of. How did it not show anything about Notorious, and I agree with most of the people here saying that it was "Hollywood", I mean, what did you expect from the real life story? When people wake up and see that u will never find the true truth about 2pac and Biggie ... It's all covered and buried deep. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm not against 2pac or Biggie I love both of them, but 2pac and Lil Kim DID in this movie will definitely be embarrassed ... <br /> <br /> Next, for everyone who says that film is awesome and can't see the truth whether u are too blind too see it because u think u know something about BIG or you don't know anything about it at all and u love this Hollywood teen movies. Use your mind and look in the clouds ... There's a lot you could say when it comes to this topic, I didn't say 60% of what I have to say, because it's a very broad topic, but I can only say about movie I that it might have been a bit, I mean much better done. But still I'm just one person who gives my opinion .... There are no hard feelings ... <br /> <br /> Look, I love hip-hop and I live for it, but after that every person in the movie a little bit of intelligence can see that this is not how someone expects to live. Do everything with respect to 2pac and BIG, like all other artists who do life like it should turn to another page, because u ruin the youngsters .... Bring the wrong message to the kids and that is: not going to school, but living in the streets, drawing and Just Gripping Paper .... <br /> <br /> True hip hop is expected to be love and intelligence, be smart and all. I know many of you think I'm crazy, but that's just my position. Look, I might be wrong and Im not saying it's a bad movie, because even though I'm 17 and 18 in hiphop, I still don't know anything about 2pac or Biggie, no matter how many articles I read a lot I support them and listen to their music ... Like most of you, everything. Only those who were very close to them and the killers know is the truth behind it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I want to say that all Biggie and Tupac fans and family are two men. is the greatest of all times, no matter how they lived their lives, but PLEASE FUTURE, HOW WE ARE BETTER, LEARN AND ANYTHING, ANYTHING THAT YOU ARE ABOUT UNITS THAT CAN NOT BE YOU, IN THIS END. .IT IS NOT HOW TO GET NO MONEY OR GAME AND HOW ALL WILL BE HAPPENED IN THE WORD, WHEN ALL AND ALL EAT THE LOSS, THEIR BODY AND THE HIGHER ... PEACE AND LOVE YA ALL !!!! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, LEFT EYE, JAM MASTER JAY and others who are making changes in this world !!
