As someone else mentioned, this strange prologue begins to kill a little blonde girl. Then the main story: the photographer (Gaffari) and the writer (Shepard) meet randomly and ride into the mountains. First of all, they spend the night at an inn, where a slightly deaf landlord becomes more and more irritating to the audience by Gaffar. When they look for refuge in the mountains again and they are kindly invited to an old lady who seems too hospitable to strangers (Hansel and Gretel, anyone?) What's going on, I leave it bold for the viewer to solve because I certainly couldn't t. Now, I like Eurohorror, and it would have been better if only Artigot (writer and director) had tried to tell a logical story. Background (Pyrenees?) Is an excellent and intriguing place for mysterious and hidden events. Green peaks can easily hide supernatural forces and those who command them. Photography is great. I want the whole thing to make sense. You can watch this movie at archive.org.
