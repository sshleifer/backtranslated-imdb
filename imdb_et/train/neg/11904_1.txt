The end of violence and definitely the Million Dollar Hotel hinted at the idea that Wenders have lost their vision, we can say powerful stories through a moving picture card. Many countries abandon the coffin, I fear this is a very unimaginable, apparently sentimental and clich√© film. The characters are perfectly flat and stereotypical, and are the best amateurs in writing, plot and direction. For the first time for a while, I was impatient for the film to end so I could go on with my life. Uncle's war-torn delirium, a patriotic abstract looking directly into the sky in the city ... it just hit me as easy and pathetic, barely a filmmaker who ever did some compelling magic on the screen. What happened? I'm afraid that the days of experimentation, perceived writing, and interesting filming options have long been behind. We hope that he will find his inspiration again ... At the Toronto Film Festival where I saw the film, Wenders was there to introduce him. In the absence of total humility, he offered us the following: "I hope ... no, wait ... I know you will enjoy the next two hours." I'm afraid he won't get any more wrong ...
