as an actor I like independent movies, but this is the best amateur. <br /> <br /> Boys go to Vermont for civil service when plane flies over palm tree - did leaders know palm trees are not in Vermont? Tears yes - palms no. The same applies to the wedding service - again a nice palm tree. <br /> <br /> When the boys leave VT, they probably didn't get a ticket to any of the larger airlines because the movie that was filmed is Federal Express. Did they send over the box overnight? Come guys with little details like this separate indi movie totally amateur. <br /> <br /> Christian brother is much like Arthur's bleached hair and tribal band tattoo. Both should be switched. <br /> <br /> The little characters are ridiculous and they are moving in awful. <br /> <br /> Applause for directors who make a gay movie but pay attention to their locations and next cast
