This movie is so bad that it's funny. He celebrates Scott Backul as a coach, but it doesn't matter, a big black man who plays base 1 is important. First of all, he must be at least 75 years old but still play a small league baseball, and secondly he starts off on the film, although he can't walk, let alone run. Trainer Backula moves him perfectly first by pointing out that if he tries to run him, he will stay in the same place for too long. At the end of the movie, Backula shows a more excellent coaching strategy (SPOILER), tells his star player "downtown" to hit home runners, clearly looking at "downtown" as a good move. He hit home racing and won his team's game, a juvenile team who played Twins, who was the main group in the movie. Now that only Royale's manager Tony Muser would be the smart trainer as Backula and tell his players that they are just running home, Royals would never stop the race, not to mention the game.
