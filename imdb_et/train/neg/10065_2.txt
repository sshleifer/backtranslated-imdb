Much worse than the original. It was really * painful * to sit down, and it barely kept my six-year interest. <br /> <br /> Introducing some of the new Pokemon is a bit interesting, but the storyline is particularly thin, dialogue is still bad and music is mediocre. Instead, watch TV shows - it's much better.
