I had to show this actor to find the board of this movie because the title is now unexpected love. It is not really worth looking for, but I did not feel both leaders and wondered why they were leading the lesbian flick during their life cycle. Everything is pretty restrained and you don't really get the idea of ​​who these characters are, as a viewer, I couldn't invest emotionally in the talk. I don't think I'm a target audience, but I'm not sure who it is. Everything is muted and soft focus and earth tones ... nothing is very interesting. I had a great interest in seeing two women look, but it is so discreet that I was disappointed. Hire a personal best.
