I mean the word "pedestrian". Film producers seem to have forgotten something interesting. Faith Domergue can do it better. He should be a mysterious, revolting Cobra goddess who has broken love for Marshall Thompson (there is an idea whether?). Instead, she's a common housewife of the fifties, and one movie she's wearing all over the film makes me think they shot it all early in the morning before faith was her coffee. As for the rest, they are all so "all-American" that the result is ridiculous. In Val Lewton, it is considered more productive in Cat Cat. I think the "Cobra cult" should actually be titled "The cult of contractual obligation". Why else would so many otherwise talented people behave like this because of slow moving, predictable and derived failure?
