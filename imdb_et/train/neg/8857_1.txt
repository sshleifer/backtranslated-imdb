This movie is very bad, so bad that even Christopher Lee can't save it. The poor story is an even poorer script, and just a bad direction will transform this truly eye-catching horror film, the prominent part of which is that it is the only horror film I can honestly say that I've never looked again. This garbage makes the ninth outward surface like an oscillating material.
