I tried it during testing. All I can say is: What ... hell? This movie plays about as smoothly as Mickey Mouse, which reads the script for "Scarface". It is odd if you make the slightest sense; and even if you leave your brain in the car, the movie is still strange that it is not even funny. <br /> <br /> Plot Hunter Steve Irwin is trying to "save" a crocodile containing a CIA probe. CIA comes after Irwin to get her probe back, Irwin hurts them for poachers and puts them to "stop". <br /> <br /> This is all the story there is; the rest is the extraordinary light of Australian culture ("Didja it dat?" and "Crikey!") and strangely choreographic sequences. At one point, Irwin confirms the speeding RV and the knife with a CIA agent. Yes, that's right: Steve Irwin's knife fights with a man on RV. Be it your ridiculously bad movie guide.
