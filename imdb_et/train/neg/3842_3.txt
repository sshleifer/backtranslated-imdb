Our teacher showed us this movie in the first grade. I haven't seen it. I just looked at the trailer. Does it look like a first-class film? I do not belive. I was so scared by this movie as I barely watched it. It was mostly a scene where Shirley McClain cut this little girl in half, and then there was a boy with a ketchup! I was puzzled by this movie. Today, 20 years old, I probably don't know. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe toddlers shouldn't see this movie, although it's a PG. Be aware of the possible results that this shows for children. I don't even remember what it was, once enough!
