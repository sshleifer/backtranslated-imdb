My God, was it "to convince Lola to run" persuasion? It was terrible. It is bad enough that the "screenwriter" (and I use this concept very loosely) cut and pasted the dialogue from one symbol to another, often out of context and in a hurry: but Anne Elliott, who runs to Wentworth, is staying in the place. At the end of the pieces was abomination! Austen must turn to his grave. No respectable young woman would have been so cruel. And an actor who played Mary? Fears. Needless to say, if the rest of Austen's remake is bad, they will turn off a new generation of observers. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the perfect version of this (otherwise) wonderful novel, get a version of Roger Michell's 1995 featuring Amanda Root (whose expressions alone can speak) and Ciaran Hinds. That's great.
