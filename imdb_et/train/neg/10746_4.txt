Who could have wished to continue Bert I. Gordon's legendary bad trash movie "Food of the Gods"? Someone, of course, but director Damien Lee thought it was a good idea, and he put together a late sequel, one of the most superfluous movies in the horror history. "Gnaw" is just another name because the device moved to a typical 80's location (university campus), and the cheap and cheesy gore effects are also an excellent illustration of the 80s. This script is hung with clich√©s, terribly written dialogues and plots of plots that have not been so stolen from other (and more successful) horror classics. Neil Hamilton is a good two-legged scientist who deals with routine rodent breeding tests to make a fellow citizen. Because of some incredibly stupid animal rights activists, large and harsh rats are fleeing quite a bit on campus. After a good old tradition, which began with Spielberg's "jaws", there is a terrible dean who refuses to admit the problem, though the seriously injured corpses are turning everywhere. During a hysterically grotesque peak, the rats invade the opening ceremony of the new sports complex at the university! "Gnaw: God's God's Food 2" is terribly bad and so very fun to watch! The characters make and say unimaginably stupid things (such as shrinking into the sewer-armed time, when they know they are infected with rats), it is scary and there is a really odd order that includes a hero who has growth under the influence of serum! I don't know what Freud's theory would be like? There is a satisfactory amount of gore and sleaze and ?? should it be said? music is surprisingly atmospheric. If you just don't get enough of this junk, the mutated rats will have quite a lot of creature functions, like the Italian schlock movie "Rats: Terror Night", a modest 70-year-old "Willard" Lame "Ben", 2003 "Willard" remake starring Crispin Glover and surprisingly good recent rat films once famous by directors Tibor Ticaks ("Rats") and John Lafia ("Rats"). Go crazy!
