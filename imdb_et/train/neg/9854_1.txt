This documentary (or I should say mockumentary) is a great example of how ridiculous people are when they have something like that. Honestly, I hate cryptoology. It is consciousness, it just destroys. However, there was something positive about the visual effect (the dragons were beautiful), but some of the information contained in this marble was completely false and it is really disappointing because it came from the scientists, so this is why it deserves to be 10 and not. it would be a hydrogen idea: It is true that, according to Chemystry, hydrogen is produced in the stomach, but it is not possible to do so in such a proportion, so in this case, you need a good explanation of what happens in the dragon's stomach. There are many substances that are hydrogen in nature, but not necessary for such an animal to fly, and hydrogen does not show anything, so it is impossible. In any case, the idea of ​​platinum is actually worse: it is more difficult to find this element than gold, and I cannot explain how dragons depend on it. It's ridiculous, they present dragons like creatures with little chance to conquer the planet Earth, but at least explain why they died. Probably the cryptologist's invitation is scientists themselves, but they are not. People like they say it is like this mockumentary and, worst, some people buy them. But I don't think a person who cares about science believes in dragons after he looks at it. These fake scientists are wasting their time.
