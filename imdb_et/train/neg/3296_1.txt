The old TV shows seem to be the norm in Hollywood today, but this disrespectful, humorous, do-you-kiss-your-mother-to-mouth-foul language, rip-off is a dirty middle finger all the Duke of Hazzard fans on the Mason-Dixon line north and south. Bo and Luke Duke's opening session, which makes Uncle Jesse a six-layer (not appearing during the show, as it would put boys in prison for a password-based violation), Uncle Uncle Jesse quit smoking. Georgia (Uncle Jesse was a moral compass in spite of his previous sixfold ways) this frustrating waste of the film is an insult to the open face. I can't tell you how many parents I saw and remove my kids from the theater for the first 15 minutes of the movie when they realized they were terribly deceived. The original Dukes of Hazzard were the basic moral values ​​of the family. The original Dukes of Hazzard were the children, Hemi's powerful, fun, that the parents did not have to worry about teaching their children the seven words of George Carlin. I have read comments that show that the show and the film are nothing but racist. These responsibilities may be correct for the film. These obligations are false in terms of ABSOLUTEL. The exhibition, if at all, was about getting together and being friends. Hollywood has finally opened up to our contempt for us, Yankee, Rebel, or else who still believe in glory, loyalty, trust, family, and the right thing, even if it's not a popular thing. Hollywood has finally brought out its conviction that those of us who are heartfelt are foolish, uneducated, brewers, unpleasant mouths, trash bins that buy the garbage they want to sell. Promote the Hollywood elite that they are wrong. DO NOT MAKE THIS MOVIE. Boycott sponsors. Fill in the Warner Brose email and snail mailboxes with complaints that we don't recognize them by destroying one of the biggest T.V. Save your money and buy a DVD from the original show, but what do you do? DO NOT MAKE THIS MOVIE
