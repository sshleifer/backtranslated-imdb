I have been a supporter of Hal Hartley because I saw my short "Surviving Desire" in high school and even then he was still stuck in his searingly brilliant "Henry Fool". But this 10-year sequel is not only unnecessary but disgraceful. <br /> <br /> After a blind and quick start, "Fay Grim" is divided into pseudo-intellectuality, everyday boredom and ultimately unjustified - and unwanted nihilism. And it's just a plot. <br /> <br /> Most of the new faces are as frivolous and poorly developed as the film: one particularly flat character comes halfway through the time we spend with the infamous Henry Fool, and this is his only scene in the movie! <br /> <br /> Fulbright, Jeff Goldblum's agent, seems to be the only bright character (well-known by Hartley). So how does he leave? ** SPOILER ** By bombing a dead car, making it an easy-to-natural Hartley's most violent film, and toning everything up in a movie that's been wrong all the way. <br /> <br /> For other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or Grim?), not to mention Fay himself ... well, I'm not breaking my fate because the movie does a good job of it itself not busy yet another godawful canted angle that gives an amazing impression that Hartley moves back to Auteur crappy film student). <br /> <br /> This piece is a complete disaster, a terrible mess that isn't even funny enough to rejoice in your confusion. Instead, he spontaneously pulls his director's usual fun hipster prescriptions in the "real world", one of the slickest and more meaningful than he needs, but not nearly ugly or thought to say almost anything. In doing so, Hartley monitors all his memories of the people and the wonderful world he originally created for them. <br /> <br /> I've rarely been in movies when I think "leaving Las Vegas," which grew at least behind the fresh new characters before we destroyed them, instead of ignoring the already beloved characters. <br /> <br /> Grim, indeed.
