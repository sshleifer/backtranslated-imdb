Well, I can finish the question at once: "What is the worst film ever made?" This is Fury's flight starring Steven Seagal. Of course there are many good bad movies, but it takes the cake so it takes it so seriously. <br /> <br /> This is a film from Romania that tells us how far Romania has to get along with Bollywood. It also tells us how Steven Seagal has been completely without the intellect and talents. This movie is so bad that you literally get spoiled after you look at it, and you have to fail in the shower corner and cry, knowing that nothing makes you clean again. <br /> <br /> It only appeared on video (I can't imagine why) and I suspect that employees who had to make a DVD had to wear protective equipment and get regular advice.
