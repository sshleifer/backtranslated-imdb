Oh dear, oh dear ... <br /> <br /> For JM fans, it was a nail coffin until his A-list Hollywood career. After the girl couldn't do it, Wayay Bus, Burglar, and Rock Hunter seemed to be one of the hottest stars in the city of Tinsel. Nonetheless, stubborn disclosure and appearance of Mansfield aside, namely cheap Euro loans, remained until Fox could give up his contract as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a terrible waste of all time, except for Suzy Parker, the only thing in this film that is bad enough for the material. Many people blame the poor Jayne and his lattice on the bad revenue of this movie at the ticket office and, while he is hurt in this film, he can do the best with the substance. After all, Cary hardly puts a fire on the screen? After a handful of very good dramatic and comedy Jayne turns 10 steps back as a serious actor, agreeing (just for Grant's appearance) to portray this enchanting, idiotic threat. His Alice character is a complete cartoon, and although he looks good enough to eat in a boiler suit, his looks are nerves on the film. We all know that Jayne could do as much as it is, and here he is around the parade. Real shame. <br /> <br /> Watch this comedy. It's more depressing than funny.
