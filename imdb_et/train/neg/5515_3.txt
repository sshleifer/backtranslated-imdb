There is a lot to say about this cartoon; The backgrounds are rich, richly painted and full of beautifully made art deco details. Animation corresponds to the usual timekeeping standards, which are arguably higher than modern ones. But I find it annoying for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> Music: This is definitely not standard for Scott Bradley. Although this should probably be the "Great Gatsby" setting, it is terrible, sleepy, repetitive, and monotonous (repetitive and monotonous are not the same as Beethoven's 5th Symphony). Since most people (including myself) tend to close their eyes, there is a lot of visual image that the average viewer can't. <br /> <br /> Story: I have no secrets that are not already in the plot - good, city bad. This time is both an animated and a common theme in live movies. It is a misplaced nostalgia for an idyllic idyll of a rural area, which today is reflected in a similar nostalgia for "values" that have never been.
