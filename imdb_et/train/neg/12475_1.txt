I don't remember the movie except once. Not only that, but I was with 7 friends and we all wanted to go. An interesting plot, characters made of clay, violence without meaning. I don't care how good the guys died; I don't care when the bad guys got it. Fantasy and magic were put on thick liver cancer and there was no coherence. In short, good entertainment if you take eternity in hell.
