- The movie opens with a meteor that falls into the lake. It is not known to locals that there is also a dinosaur egg at the bottom of the lake. The meteor heats the lake, making it a giant incubator. You thought the egg hatches would release a dinosaur that would continue to terrorize the community. <br /> <br /> - What a complete garbage. It's not that I mean stop-motion clay dinosaur, it's all my movie that disturbs me. Operation is cruel. The dialogue is completely ridiculous. Comic relief is nothing more than comic. There is no logic. Any similarity between the "scientists" and the actual researcher of this film is purely random. I could continue the eternity of the bad aspects of this movie, but you get that idea. I think this "MST3K Worthy" disaster is quite safe.
