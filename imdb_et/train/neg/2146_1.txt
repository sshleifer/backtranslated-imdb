I just put it out here, it was the worst sequel to the classic Disney movie I've ever seen. In 1950, Disney released what I am as one of my greatest films. Now take some great songs, add a bad plot that resembles a lost TV show. "Put it together and what do you get?" Crudi's biggest load I've ever seen. When I saw it, I thought it was for Disney all the time. Cinderella should end, "and they lived happily ever after." not this garbage. This film does not deserve such a sequel. I thought it would be like "Time Wrestling", which was moderate, but better than that. Also, what do we care about Anastasia? He changed hands like Iago, but it didn't help anyone.
