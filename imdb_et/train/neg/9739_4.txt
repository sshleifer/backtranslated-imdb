It is not so much that SPONING COMBINATION had little chance. Indeed, only the explored title phenomenon is quite intriguing, and at least in the opening half, this Tobe Cooper strives for entertainment only in the 90s horror. But somewhere between Brad Dourif's re-re-playing and overly complex plot, this future thriller will lose its way. <br /> <br /> Dourif, which is here before his built-in spooky fan base builds, is the average man Sam. Of course, the average boys will not stay on average for a long time in horror films, so after seeing a well-crafted vision, we see that Sami's different parts of the body start to burn. Soon he will also blame other people, a lot of Cynthia Bain's unplayable gal pal Add the amazement. <br /> <br /> Although the movie's title refers to a fire-happy monster, director Hooper decided to make Sam an unwanted killer. This approach gives the film an extra human depth that would not otherwise exist, but it also prevents us from really scaring the human flame. We're left wondering if it would have worked better than the straightforward criminal-anti-all efforts of the area NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. <br /> <br /> SPONTANEOUS EFFICIENCY is a pretty nominal effort when everything is said and done. It brings a call to fans of Dourif and those who do not get enough of the 1990s horror, be it good, bad or sometimes, but only on a slow night.
