Trying to compare or represent this "fresh", like something "Hitchcockian", is an out-n-out attempt to mislead Hitchcock fans to destroy $ 7 $ ... Weak Operation Weak Story Weak Script. <br /> <br /> No real relationship, no excitement. You're waiting for all the weakness of this movie for a big profit or even for any reward ... You were wondering what the hell it was. <br /> <br /> And please enough to move to make "alternative lifestyles" HIP and politically correct! ... I can't recommend it to anyone ... Did I mention how weak it is? Williams did a better job than Peter Pan and Mork. But these were many more innocent times ...........
