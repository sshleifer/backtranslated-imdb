If you've ever seen an eighty slip, there's no reason to see it. Originality is often not one of the strongholds of a strong cinema, and this is something that this film is seriously lacking. There really isn't much to say about Pranks, so I'll do it quickly. The film was one of the 74 films included in the DPP Video Nasty list, and that was my only reason to see it. The plot is followed by a bunch of children who stay in the dormitory during Christmas. When they're in Slasher, someone decides to start taking them out, and that will lead to one of the most mysterious mysteries ever seen in the movie. The fact that this movie was on the Video Nasty list is odd because, despite some gory scenes, this movie is not corrupt or infringed by anyone, and gorier slashers than it (for example, Friday 13) did not get banned. But then again, movies that are much less nervous (such as a witch who came from the sea) are forbidden. In any case, making a movie is the best thing, because though the audience really doesn't care about who the attacker is at that point; it's pretty well done. All in all, it is terrible and frustrating that even the fans who are struggling will miss it.
