<br /> <br /> When I ignored some uncertainty, it was actually a pretty decent horror / monster. So, I will give you some good points first: - The dragon was quite convincing, especially when he hit the tunnels looking for lunch (a hint: he likes people). - It was quite unstoppable and after a weak start I got pretty well. - Sorry to say I was a dragon rooting - he was probably the most convincing and consistent character of the movie. <br /> <br /> Now for incredible things ** maybe some spoilers **: - If you had been hunting for a fire dragon in the 1100s, would you put a barrel with your weapon in your cave? Duh. - A female character with the whole American name, blond hair and a clear Slavic accent, trying to pretend she is Spanish? Ah? - A leading scientist whose Slavic accent can be cut with a knife and is allegedly born in Chicago, USA educated? - Military helicopter pilot who does his repairs to a huge transport broker who has no other crew, and is a skilled soldier and warrior? OKAY. Uh ah. I'm not even talking about the mark of my three different calls in 2 minutes when communicating with my base. <br /> <br /> It's still better than some of Japan's 60's, but not much. If we are happy, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2, though, of course, the end was open to this opportunity. Or maybe they will hire a real director next time. <br /> <br /> Despite everything, I gave it from 4 out of 10 flick. Add 2 more to rewrite the plot, and Dean Cain will be eaten in the first ten minutes. <grin>
