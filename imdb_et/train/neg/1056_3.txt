Diana Guzman is an angry young woman. The series of unsuccessful frustrations and traumas survives, he refers to his closest targets to his anger. <br /> <br /> When he sees violence and focuses on discipline, he knows he found his home. <br /> <br /> The film moves from there, as Diana learns the usual age lessons with successful boxing skills. Michelle Rodriguez is very good in this role, especially when she focuses on every side of the young woman's focused rage and fights not only with personal circumstances but also with rooted sexism. <br /> <br /> The picture may be somewhat finer for all young actors who are pale compared to older, more experienced casts. There are too many breaks in the script that reduce dramatic tension. The general silence of the film empties its intensity. <br /> <br /> This is a good picture to see once, to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complicated enough to engage her power. Its limitations prevent it from being placed in the category "look at it again and again".
