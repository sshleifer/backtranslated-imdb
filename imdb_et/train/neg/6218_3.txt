My thoughts about the movie, 9 <br /> <br /> It was not good, not good at all. Visually, it was great. I had the pleasure of pace, camera angles, etc. But the characters? Eh, sure. Fuck? It sucks. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed more like a new age than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and frightening. Science is not better. It creates a monster weapon that kills everything ... but "soul" has the ability to destroy monsters and bring life? Really? <br /> <br /> This is something that bites my ass a bit. Here is the CGI film ... created with science ... and they use it to give us the message that science destroys the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the clue to have one character, <br /> <br /> "Okay, so what now?" (or something similar). I didn't hear it too well because the crowd was up and stopped. It was "okay ... it was just hardly fun to sit here for the whole movie, but now let's get out of here as soon as possible!" exit type. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where you can't think of enjoying it. Just look at the visuals and finish your head. Any idea, "what's the point?" sucks you out of unreliability and puts you in the eye with a sign of longing. Okay ... SPOILERS follows. that is capable of creating a second, intelligent and robotic life. Evil people use it as a weapon. But the scientist understands that he is also guilty. She gave her her intellect, but didn't give her her heart. <br /> <br /> The machine goes to the collective ass of the humanity of Skynet and wipes life all over the earth, slowly falling down. However, the scientist manages to survive and create football socks. Anyone who has the soul of a scientist. <br /> <br /> Last, # 9 wakes up to know nothing about the world. He sees a strange device close and picks it up. He will meet another with himself, # 2. Well, # 2 will get hold of the machine 's last surviving robot. # 9 finds more than he does. <br /> <br /> They succeed. <br /> <br /> # 9 notes that there is a suitable aperture that fits perfectly with the device. She adds it and the machine returns to life ... pulling out the # 2 process. <br /> <br /> The movie continues with action scenes # 9 that are trying to rescue the busy compatriots of their souls. They will eventually destroy and destroy the machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends who go into the clouds. Then it rains and we see life back to the planet. <br /> <br /> Hunh?!? <br /> <br /> It doesn't make sense. None. Why did the devil scientist want to divide his soul into 9 homunculus? What did it achieve? Are they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why wanted?!? <br /> <br /> Why did he expect nine small criters to succeed if there was nothing else? Why not create another intellectual machine, but the "soul" to fight with the first hand would be at least what it would have known to have had a successful chance. <br /> <br /> Why did they have to let the machine suck the soul into the device and then destroy the machine and then release the souls to bring life back to earth? Why not just wait for the machine to turn off and live without all the other crazy steps?
