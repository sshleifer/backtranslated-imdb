I watched this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and well, I found it strange and totally pointless ... so I decided a little bit and got my hands on the 70's copies. Wow. what is the difference. The original was better. I would like you all to know that he was actually making a statement, its purpose was. The truly Christian public expressed their fear of paganism. If you dig it deeper, it will make comments on life, but I don't want to go into details, just to say if you were disappointed and want to know what it should look like in the 70s version, a little dated, but much better.
