I went into this movie with expectations, a leap that would be insightful and uplifting. Certainly it is more than a favorable band "Wilco." Advertising. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a lot of process and fun, "unpleasant and undoubtedly one-sided images of one band members." who was displaced by a prima donna singer / songwriter, a girlfriend of a fallen member, such as 18 years old, a gut-winning confession, saying "friendship had gone", and that horrible, encouraging story of how one of the Record Marks "hurt their feelings" when they destroy them, so the band immediately got 50 offers from other tags (oh, tension ... not!) They tried their best to look like a strain, but I suspect that all the smoke and mirrors caused a tragedy that didn't exist . It doesn't even take into account the long stretching directions, where we get a lot of our latest songs that are completely moved with us, without any story, understanding, or even decent work in cinematography. Tense attempts to emotional sincerity or a reasonable perspective on life made me sick to look. <br /> <br /> This band sounds like a group of small toddlers who are around to find the voice they do not have and I think they are the guardians of some kind of music that they certainly do not have. And I thought the music was sucking, and I couldn't even say that lyrics were understood because of the singer's mumbling style. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 2/10.
