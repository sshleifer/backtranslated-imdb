Rough and pointless rhinitis (bloody fluffy but fluffy). Poorly written, ugly and wooden dialogue. You don't care if the characters (even if the actors themselves) live or die. Little grace or charm, little action, little point in the whole thing. Maybe you are interested in some set and setup - these gaps between all building tiles can be true, just like life in life. The framework meeting is unnecessary and disturbing, and Hoppalong Cassidy's character is as boring as it is.
