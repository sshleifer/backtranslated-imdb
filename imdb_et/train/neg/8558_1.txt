This movie was totally terrible, I even feel uncomfortable by calling it a movie. This is a typical "mumblecore" film that has a zero plot and a bunch of nonsense, twenty something that collides, trying to "draw things out". I've been trying to give mumblecore a chance, but I honestly promise my just awful. <br /> <br /> I am not in cinema sync, I appreciate Dogme95 movies, Idioterne is one of my favorite films of all time. So I do not mind if the film is made inexpensively as long as there is some substance present. <br /> <br /> All in this movie is terrible, exemplary, written (or was it all improvised?), direction, but most importantly, everything else, camera work was just plain and simple mess. The camera was never logical, there was no consistency. I have to admit that I had heard that there was nudity in this movie, so I thought myself well, even if its terrible at least nudity (yes I know I'm a jerk). Well thanks to uber crappy camera work, you can never see anything and the things you see, TRUST ME - YOU ARE NOT A VIEW. This film made me want to vomit at many levels. <br /> <br /> The dialogue made me vomit, camera-work made me vomit, but most of the time the idea that this movie was praised by some legitimate critics, now that nothing makes me vomit.
