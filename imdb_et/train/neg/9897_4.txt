I found it a good time to pass on your time, but not to any historical value. The depiction of Cleopatra reminded me of a cheap soap opera. <br /> <br /> The twist of the facts is ... funny! She gave birth to her people!?!? O please ... Pregnant King of Egypt (especially this one) should not go from one room to another! They tried to call him God! And how they tried to murder their sister ... without describing it. <br /> <br /> Kleopatra was the greatest politician of his time. His decisions were based on nothing but his feelings and morals. He did everything just for two reasons: power and self-respect! He suffered in a family where he had to tear his survival, which he did very well. Something on his way was murdered (brothers and sisters) or seduced (Ceasar and Mark Anthony). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Octavian was too powerful to kill and over ... gay, to be attracted. So he was his end ...
