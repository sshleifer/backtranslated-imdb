Oh, man, when the low series had fallen like in 1952! This dumb thing is just a series that annoys Annie Wilkes (Misery). Not only do the heroes flee from the traps by adding scenes that were not in the previous chapter (and which may not be there - tell me that if the baddies blow up the disc in episode 7 to 8, they don't see the characters jump), but I think The series has a worldview recording. I mean most of this is stock footage! And not just from other series (probably all flying sequences come from Rocket's kings and cool "molten rocks" episodes 2-3 scenes come from Captain Marvel's adventures), but in itself! Episode 8 repeats the entire episode "The whole journey of the Moon" (which is probably the shortest, it is 30 seconds long and the characters never seem to be in the air of the Earth). And episode 10 is all the scenes from previous episodes! (Ever wondered why MST3K never made 10, 11, and 12 episodes? Well, they had to stop after September 9 that they didn't have to do the whole thing again!). <br /> <br /> Don't start with a scientific factor. Get ready to see the sunniest moon! And the men of the moon who can't breathe their world? What did they smoke? <br /> <br /> And if that's not enough, it's too talkative and the tricks (usually the best series) are little and far. Visually, I am the only one who thinks the Commando Cody bullet-shaped (or lemon-shaped) helmet is completely ridiculous? The Rocketeer way was cooler, no matter how bad the film (and the man, it was terrible). A tank-like vehicle is not much better, it seems that a bunch of kids did it for Halloween. The only positive thing I understand is that the actor playing the hero is good-hearted instead of the usual muscle mass (hey, everyone has the right to be a hero!), But then he's so unpleasant ... <br /> <br /> Not even worth nostalgia. See Captain Marvel instead. 2/10. <br /> <br /> (BTW, refer to the real women Lib pearl memorable bids section).
