This can be called a flop and it is also great! The quality is not related to the words National Lampoon, but at least leisure and zoo entries were fun, but this offer has to be the most unpleasant feature I've looked at to date. Ugh! The three-part story tries to parade clich√©s and stereotypes that have flooded Hollywood genre films that prove to be completely inaccurate and nervous. <br /> <br /> "Grow yourself." - The company's lawyer Jason decides to finish his work and share with his wife so that they can both grow and do what they always wanted to do. This is life, as Jason sees it and takes care of the children, but his decision to follow this path may not be right. <br /> <br /> Talk about lead, boring and stiff. Only real interest is the cute little performance of Diane Lane. At this point, it seems that the satirical element is something to actually offer it. Stupid humor is tense, flat and especially pointless. Peter Riegert's holds it in a very important position and Teresa Ganzel's bubbles play his role. <br /> <br /> "Success Winners" - After finishing the collage, Dominique Corsair becomes a stripper and rapes some of the victorious dairy presidents. For his return he is interested in the margarine industry and practically works on the "very" top. <br /> <br /> Probably the best of the three, but the competition wasn't too big. want to go more subtly with their sexual and power-oriented tone, but still they feel sticky and forced, the idea was hopeful and inventive, but endless stimulation starts to be thin and catastrophic dialogue is not humorous, but more often than not hunger - seductive Ann Dusenberry is pretty cold and manipulative all the time (even after a painful challenge) and loves it all very well. and Joe Spinelli's favorite turn. <br /> <br /> "Municipalities" - A serial killer who, after every murder, leaves copies of his driving license, is enthusiastically monitored by a naive young master and his old grizzled partner. But the young policeman learns that harsh is the only way to go when a couple meets one after another. <br /> <br /> Stupid! Oh yes. Of course, if you are planning something surprising, make sure that the laughter flows away. They probably forgot about it! Even during your 30-minute ride the boy pulls it! Robby Benson's mocking was quite amazing when Richard Widmark did very little as his partner. Christopher Lloyd lowers the role of serum killer, but his creepy and sympathetic performance works well and shows many other wires. Elisha Cook Jr., Rhea Perlman and Harry Reems appear. When jokes come, they feel really synchronized and are quite covert when they do the fun of these police classes. <br /> <br /> In general, the idiotic material that is sewn with your sketch is a disposable and intolerable script that is basically intuitive and pointless. Only one or two pairs of gags make out every segment, but there are really too many cheap smells or common disturbances that will remain on your head. The reason for this is that it becomes virtually what it is trying to have fun and which basically shows every story. It loses sight. The performances range from hot to cold, but who cannot deny the embarrassment of most of their faces. Director Bob Girald's first taste is "Growing Yourself", but "Success Wanters" showed some light efficiencies. Henry Jaglom works in municipal offices. Rick Meyerowitz's vivid drawings that open the film are nicely designed and continue to set style and mood. <br /> <br /> This low-eyed comedy strikes over, playing the most. familiar lights. But, really, it's worth checking out the buggy and restless revenge, just to mention them. Well, it's about you.
