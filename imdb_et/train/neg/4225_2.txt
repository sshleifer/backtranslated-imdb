This movie is another Christian propaganda film in the line of Omega codes. Not that it is necessarily bad, but the fact that most propaganda films sacrifice sincerity and realism for the message they want to offer. If you have a biography on the streets, and how the gospel can change life, maybe you can enjoy this movie. I say save your money and rent a cross and a grid or mission. When will Christian leaders know that sometimes people say bad words? It was frustrating to see who depicted criminals who were not allowed to swear (criminals say bad words?) And flat characters that I really didn't get. It would also have been great if the film had shown some R & D. Now this would be something I would like to see. Who was the head of the block who compared The Supreme Movie The Boondock Saints and The Sting?
