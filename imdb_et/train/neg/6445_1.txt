When you evaluate documentaries that focus on a relatively small group of ugly ultra right and conservative groups, you need to consider the following. The United States, with a population of 270 million, and its complicated history as an ambitious democracy and its hopes and wishes to defend human rights with its drawbacks and drawbacks. Of course, the number of extreme right-wing groups and ultra-conservative groups is expected to be quite high, but they are very small and isolated compared to the size of their population. For the people of Europe, Great Britain and even Australia, similar right-wing groups per capta are actually larger than the United States in terms of the actual size of neo-Nazi groups in Australia. For these reasons, it is unreasonable to humiliate and finance the American peoples and the level of their discussions in an educated American society by presenting it very fraudulently and deceptively, presenting it as an ultra-right psychopath of American Society. In doing so, Greenstreet deliberately chose small and isolated groups on opposite sides of the spectrum to build an American image that is an outrageous and deliberate sensational lie. This film is clearly designed to light up and bother the views of those who keep this subconscious and hate the American people and the way of life in the shadow of the idiotic left-wing ideology of clichés and clichés. This film was made to profit not the truth about American society and human condition. Greenstreet can produce documentaries that focus on the ultimate right conspiracy, the military industrial complex, but can not effortlessly present intelligent and balanced factual discussions, not to mention alternative solutions to viable democratic shortcomings. Showing a movie is supported by this trash as Anti-American. SENSATIONALISM at its worst anti-US landfill is disgraceful.
