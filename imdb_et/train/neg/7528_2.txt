It's even worse than the original death game. A poisonous, inconsistent storyline leads down to "Billy Lo" down the helicopter, killing him because we leave our younger brother, Bobby Lo, to follow. So not only do we start with some of Bruce Lee's clones, the movie kills any of that and has followed us for another thirty-minute story. The main reason for this is when Bobby Lo fights against the lion, which is obviously a lion costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also a villain who is usually pretty awesome, but his screen time is remarkably small. Mostly I watched this and the original death game because they are part of the Bruce Lee box set. No wonder they are accompanied by Lee's completed works. No one would buy them differently.
