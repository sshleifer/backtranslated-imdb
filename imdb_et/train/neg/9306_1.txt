This film is the worst excuse for the film I've seen. First of all, I would like to say that the front panel of this film is generally misleading if you think you can see a really frightening movie with a monster clown, so you're wrong. In fact, the face of the killers is not even slightly similar to the front panel, but it is the picture they found on Google and thought it looked cool. Speaking of the things they found and thought it looked cool, this movie has a scene where some gangs are looking for a friend from an old forest, then suddenly the screen cuts off a screen of mother-deer taking care of its youngsters. in sunlight ... I mean seriously WTF? How is it for the dark forests they migrate? I bought this movie from the marketplace, hoping it would be fun if it wasn't spooky, would it be at least funny right? ERROR! The next day I will get this work for my colleague who frees himself from S.I.C.K. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Don't look at this movie!
