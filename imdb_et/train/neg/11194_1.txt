The Order's upcoming attractions make it a decent horror / thriller, but what we get is a plot that has the potential to be great to be thrown together to form a bunch of rubbish. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film is made up of terrible dialogue and pious special effects. The action was also not proud, but Keath Ledger (I think I wrote this right.) Saved the movie in this category. <br /> <br /> Because of Heaven: DO NOT THIS MOVI!
