My husband and I have supported Howie Mandel's exhibition. I also like Shatner - even when he is most miserable. <br /> <br /> But it's the worst on television. <br /> <br /> Please cancel this show. It sucks **. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say is that girls are hotter in this show and seem to wear less clothing than a Deal or no Deal ... <br /> Questions are too simple and incredible confused. And watching Shatner or a competitor say "Show me money" makes me vomit. <br /> <br /> It doesn't last.
