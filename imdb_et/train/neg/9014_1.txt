there are those movies that are bad, they are funny, then there are those where you scream "I want one and a half hours of my life back ..." this is pretty much what it is. <br /> <br /> Dean Cain is trying to be an actress but fails. sfx is really bad (repetitive scenes and rocks that look like falling paper) and fake plastic guns with flashlights on them ... the split screen effect used to show several things at once is just terrible. <br /> This movie cannot even be used as one of those simple night entertainers.
