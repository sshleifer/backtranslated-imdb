Elizabeth Ward Gracen, probably remembered as one of Bill Clinton's "bimbo bursts" (they have pills for that), is probably the weakest element of this exhibition. It continues the tired formula of the Highlander series - the hero immortal meets another immortal with a rebound last time they met, but there is a conflict, and finally a sword fight where you have a cheap sequence of special effects. <br /> <br /> Then you have the character of Nick Wolf. Basically, your typical 90-year-old hero who has a typical sexual tension story. (Seriously, why do you think Hollywood species think sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) It was a joint production of Canada and France, so half of the series is in New York's imitating Vancouver and the other half in Paris ... Just like Highlander .
