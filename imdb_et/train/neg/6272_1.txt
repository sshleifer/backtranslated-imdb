This is the ballistic assistant assistant of famous scholars of the bad choice dialog to his main mistress just before he attracts three incredibly dark college girls to test their behavior in the manor. In the meantime, they drink and dance in a local bar in the 80's rock songs. The bicycle bank is having a football table at the football table in front of the crowd, then the virgin daughter Jessica (Debra Hunter), who is in love with another bicycle (Dale Midkiff, PET SEMATARY), who in turn is with her husband! Back to the house, the corporation bimbos swims, shower, dress and sex with men from the bar. The little silver ball (part of the test) drives into the mouth of the victims and turns them into burning, killer zombies. <br /> <br /> If that's not enough for you to entertain, there's a fun theme song ("Nightmare Fantasy"), rollerblading, some serious daisy dukes and a psychic watch (!?) that warns "DANGER! DANGER!" like a LOST IN SPACE robot and recommends hiking as one of the best ways to get men. <br /> <br /> This filmed-in-florida confusion is so nonsensical that several views are advisable And this is not that NYPD Blue Detective Jill Kirkendall turned CNN's journalist Andrea Thompson into one nude bimbos? Of course it is! It was allegedly started in 1982 and in 1985 a new film material was added to the video. <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10 (and I mean it's good!)
