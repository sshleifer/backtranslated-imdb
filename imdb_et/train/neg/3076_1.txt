You shouldn't watch this movie unless you try to kill yourself. I think this film can cause serious brain damage. The main characters are the hero, not the hero Kevin, Amy, his bratty, the wicked conservative girlfriend, Kyle, the red short shorts who enjoy phone sex, Daphne, the harsh, horny girl who should be "cool" and who doesn't feel how dress up, and his oversized boy Nick, the army recruits who can do something. No, I'm not a pervert, it's really how the movie goes. The film itself is a sexual robbery of the 1986 Gremlins, but you will never find traces of Gizmo. No, the Hobgoblins that Wimpy Man fired (I apologize, Kevin), make someone's brave dreams and kill victims. Yeah, you guessed it-Finally, they'll finish the striptease club where nerdy Amy's biggest dream comes out - She wants to be a stripper! Look, I watched this flick through MST3K and even Mike Nelson, Tom Servo, and Crow T. Robot, who made this cinematic fine laugh and it made me bleed from both eyes. Not really, but I wish I had. I'm not giving you a piece of land anymore because revitalizing it gives me that great desire to drive through the brain. Besides, it is not like being quoted. They should put a general warning to the surgeon on this film.
