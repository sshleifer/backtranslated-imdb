just watched it, I and my right side couldn't believe how terrible and bad it was. If someone else thinks it's good, then you just have to be happy. In fact, I gave up the night to see it, all that was done before. IE. The hostel is remembering, but at least that which did not make you bad behavior and the lack of story, the same old things, re-hatched, read so much about this movie, I even suggested it to my companions, my fault, someone said it was good! is no longer terrifying, spooky, or filthy when your average "scary movie" to be said, please do not worry about this movie. to Get Mary Poppins | Now it's scary! I'm out now, go to the cinema and see something more frightening, maybe a little sunshine
