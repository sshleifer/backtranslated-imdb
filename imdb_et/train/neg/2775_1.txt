It was the worst film I've ever seen in my life. Not really. I'm not kidding. All "underlying true stories / historical references" are not an excuse for such bad behavior. This is a shame, because as others have posted, the kits and costumes were great. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was typical of "Asian style" music, although I couldn't figure out where the "modern" love song came from when Fernando lied to Mary. I don't know who wrote and sang this beautiful song, but it was like suddenly Norah Jones was transported up to the 1500s. <br /> <br /> Hershey Syrup Blood Phychos was more realistic than Ketsup, driven by the Kwik-n-EZ battle scenes. <br /> <br /> But acting. Oh, so sadly sad. Lines are delivered like a bad younger game. When Gary Stretch had put on a potato costume for the county's 4H fair, he might have been more credible. Eventually he sounded like a thug of a small Italian street. Sometimes I waited for him to "Adrian!" or even "You want me a piece?!". <br /> <br /> Favorite line: When the queen tells her lover (after getting on the floor) "I have a child." He answers the "baby?" I was expecting him to "No, jackass, chair leg! Duh."
