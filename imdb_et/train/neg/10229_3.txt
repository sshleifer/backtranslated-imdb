I am relying on this during one observation I saw last night (9/27/06). I don't think I'm looking again. The operation was completely wood, the plot was completely predictable, it ended completely unrealistic - do I think a $ 30 million verdict for a fatal cancer? The main actor (Victor Garber) seemed so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed in his head - maybe he realized how bad the writing was! I fully understand that the drama offered this season is pretty poor, but they can definitely find better writers. Maybe they order in writing from India or China! I bet we can't see it next season!
