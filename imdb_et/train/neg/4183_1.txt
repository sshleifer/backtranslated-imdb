If it wasn't "Oh So Gourgous," Natassia Malthe, this B movie would not be worth one sector of my Tivo disk space! In what low rents was the backyard warehouse that was considered a space port? "People of Continuity!" This is the principle of making a real movie! At night, the alleged space port and day (at night and day in the space station?) In stock! ??!? People please! The only thing I commend for this movie is a wardrobe. Constantly keeping Natassia in such tight forms as revealing equipment! Even the women who saw this bomb had to evaluate the stock he apparently spent every day during filming. The Sci-fi channel would have been SpaceBalls showing better! At least there would have been real humor to see something so incredible. <br /> <br /> P.S. Michael Ironside, please come your representative ASAP! You are so much better an actor that it would even be related to the level of filmmaking.
