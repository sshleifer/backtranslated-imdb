Despite mysteriously positive reviews and high ratings, this is a terrible film. Honestly, I am obliged to warn you about how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The film has been awarded to Raj during the last period of India's independence fight. What follows on a ridiculous plot just fills me with disbelief. What the characters do and how they behave does not convince me that the characters exist in this age. For example, is a local married Hindu in the village a matter of his married English teacher, knowing perfectly well that the discovery of a thing would probably mean total social torture and shame, if not a mortal punishment? Unlikely but maybe. But does the same young Hindu housekeeper, who is in the Indian conservative society of this era, continues to be half naked with British Spears, participating in daylight in a hot outdoor relationship where they can be discovered at any time? Not only is it bloody unlikely, it's a slower plot plot. <br /> <br /> Such idiots, with bad behavior, led me to leave the movie for one hour so I didn't watch the other half of the movie. It can be hoped that the end is more intelligence than what I saw in the first half.
