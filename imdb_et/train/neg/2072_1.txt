I rented this movie tonight because it seemed like a fun movie. I thought you couldn't really get lost with the super power concept of Ex Girlfriend. <br /> <br /> ... but the movie was confusing and pointless ... <br /> <br /> It seemed that the writer continued to splash every step of the way. Also, the writer wrote too much toilet humor and a sexual situation that only a teenage boy could love. <br /> <br /> It would seem that it could just have led the Fatal Attraction Super Hero story, but I think not. <br /> <br /> This is not a fun romantic comedy that was advertised. You couldn't see this baby and you would be embarrassed to see that date. <br /> <br /> If a writer could have made a higher concept around the story and cleaned up - the film may have a chance of fighting. <br /> <br /> Serious waste of time. <br /> <br /> B
