Looking at many critics, this is the biggest stinker of all time (definitely the biggest stinker in Brian De Palma's career). <br /> <br /> Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a secret rich boy whose life goes to pieces when he and his lover, Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith), are involved and hit. His story is crowned by another secretary, reporter Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis). <br /> <br /> Well, as I said in my summary ... <br /> <br /> What should this movie be like? It seems that comedy, drama and satire are combined, but it certainly doesn't add much. This is undermined by the unimaginable, one-dimensional characters you would never want to talk about in a real life dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of the novel (I started reading it once, but I couldn't finish it because it wasn't pleasant to me), but it's obvious to me that those who did / enjoy the novel consider this movie complete. <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many talented participants trying hard to get some quality down the middle movie and fail. What waste is. <br /> <br /> Problems begin with casting a nice man, Tom Hanks, in a role that should probably be UNsympathetic. And Peter Fallow's role in the novel was British. Bruce Willis is bad, BADLY talks about this role. What was thinking there? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even Morgan Freeman cannot escape the movie with his dignity, being obliged to give a flat, heavy hand lecture on "dignity" after the top. /> <br /> This movie becomes an absurd farce. <br /> <br /> I liked a set of talents; for that I give him four out of ten, but I'm sure some people say that a much better film could have been made of the original material.
