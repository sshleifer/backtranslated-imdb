I was told about watching a movie by a friend who blubbed about what a lovely story it was. <br /> <br /> Yuck. <br /> <br /> I want my two hours ago, as I could have done so much more productive things with my time ... like my thumbs. I don't see anything for redeeming this movie at all, except for this eye-candy aspect ... <br /> <br /> 3/10 (and it's generous)
