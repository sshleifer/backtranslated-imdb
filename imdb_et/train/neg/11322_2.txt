There is a word for such a movie, and that word is "turning". During the rental of VHS, it was glowing and the restart of the satellite restarted. <br /> <br /> It might fool you because it has two moderately known names in Kistofferson and Henriksen, sound sound music and a nice Monument Valley landscape. <br /> <br /> It also has some curly hair women who fight a lot. <br /> <br /> If that's all you want from a movie, maybe it will keep you happy.
