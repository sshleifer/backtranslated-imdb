Being a filmmaker myself and having a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humor, I thought I was treating when I took home "My Wrongs ..." (not that the DVD cover does something, but the unclear quote from the contradictory director Chris Morris chooses "short film, including scenes"). I should have known and avoided this inconvenient (and often offensive) piece. <br /> <br /> The church scene is a delightful look (especially because we are too familiar with Morris's twisted attitude to pedophilia from his infamous TV series Brass Eye) and this is nothing more than a shock. How this film is called comedy, which I never understand. <br /> <br /> Runner's comment sounds like a novel idea in principle (being a runner, it is often an interesting and unimpeded perspective in the film making process), unfortunately this is not the case. Instead, we are being treated by some public school boys who talk about a dog about a movie before it comes to the conclusion that dogs do not really see great movies. It is all very interesting, but not worth one cellulite frame. <br /> <br /> If you say that this movie is going somewhere, it would be underestimated. It is based on too high its style, plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely disturbed and unfulfilled. Its overwhelmed message - that a person should take responsibility for their actions - is so obviously obvious and ill-illustrated. entertaining, enlightening, and simply irritating. If you want to see a very short short movie, I strongly recommend Peter Capaldi to "Franz Kafka this is a wonderful life".
