Now I hired this movie because Brad Dourif was in it. He's a great actor, BRILLIANT in everything ... except this movie. And I think it was just because he realized how stupid this film was and didn't bother with a good result. This movie is an involuntary comedy. Some lines break me. And they have some features that make no sense, and it seems that Tobe Hooper is simply casting no lines. Oh! BTW plot is BAD! But this is one of those films that is BAD that he is actually watching. I recommend it only to fans of BIG Brad Dourif or fans of other participants because the plot is pathetic.
