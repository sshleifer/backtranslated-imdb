A luminous melodrama taken by William Gibson's story by John Houseman and director Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark leads the fast-paced rural nerve shelter, where his open women fight with the queen bee named Lillian Gish, and Widmark herself is faced with a worker-newcomer Lauren Bacall, who puts her life back after death. his wife and child. Terrifying and confusing, placed in indiscriminate time and place, and "David and Lisa" in the hidden moor of a love story. Widmark and Bacall have good chemistry, but this script doesn't give them anything to build on. In just one hour, most of the dialogue that is done in the library for hanging drapes (this yarn is not used as a symbol, rather it is a red herring mystical!). The picture hopes to show that people who are in the same profession and who think their opinion is right will see unequal people, but unfortunately, at the Minnell Circle, this tomb is not informative, enlightening or fun. ** from ****
