I really wish I didn't write this review. I'm a Christian, so I waited for this movie. It seemed wonderful - some of the quite famous stars of a Christian film and a plot that seemed intriguing (not that I buy the Bible code myself - you can say something you want. So I'm sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews when the movie comes and I will be able to destroy my mood in a few minutes. I had to bite my lip to stop when I was commenting on the horrible writing and acting in the theater (I would have crushed people who rejoiced rather clumsy but basically ascendant scenes and cast an amazingly obvious and predictable Tension Scenes I was sure. When the final credits started to roll, I could still think. I liked many parts of the movie - some mostly unexpected plots, some effects that were really special (I don't read the visions. They were badly done) and some interesting technical works - disappears, sets the case type, unfortunately I got a clear impression that when I read the manifestation of revelation from the monkey and putting the monkey in front of the typewriter for one hour, I would have become a better script. And the music was outside the cheese (even for a Bond fan who likes pleasant music in action and intrigue scenes). So I wish I could be like everyone else in the theater - like the people who came crying and breathing because it was incredible - but I'm not someone who gets a writer who throws some words, biblical bark and beats this Christian temple. I need a good plot and a credible dialogue before I can enjoy most of the movies, and it just wasn't. Sorry, but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. And this is a tragedy. When do we see some intelligent Christian fiction? It must be there somewhere ...
