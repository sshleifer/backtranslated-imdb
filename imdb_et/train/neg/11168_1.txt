- The Mexican priest becomes a slave to save the orphanage or something - <br /> <br /> I was going to watch this movie because it was a non-WWF wrestling and so I thought it might be funny. It wasn't. It's an embarrassing look. Embarrassing. All comedy opportunities are ruthlessly destroyed. I admit I don't like Jack Black. Since then, I've racked my brain to think of one of the good roles he has played. The only thing I can do with where he was. was the "High Fidelity" film required for John Cusack's character. Jack Black is one of those terrible relentless flat ham-it-up knockabouts (like a little fat one by Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis) who should be told that the excess idiot is not the same as funny. <br /> <br /> It's not even a blow. It's just irritating. It's not even stops, it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> I also heard good things about Napoleon Dynamite, but if this is something I should go to, I won't find it on the DVD.
