Although there are many familiar "television" names associated with "A Man Called Sledge", there is nothing special about the film itself or its performances. In fact, the only thing that distinguishes it from the 1960s to 70s is the television series "The Rat Patrol", with greater light and much more violence. <br /> <br /> James Garner is the biggest star and probably thought he should try to leave all the mild comedy things he did ("Maverick", "Support Your Local Sheriff" - "Gunfighter", etc.). ). Unfortunately, his reputation for sensitivity is working against him, because Sledge is a humorous character written in cash by the character of the western countries of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti. But Eastwood stuff wasn't flat and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I think "Man called" can be classified as Western spaghetti, although the pace is too slow for this sub-genre to fit. Fans of the slow-acting Combat TV series are now in touch when Vic Morrow directed the film and wrote with Frank Kowalsk. Throw in some trendy slow-strokes and cross-soluble substances that signify you rather than tell the story. The type is a standard "big throw" thing (add "The War Wagon" here) with Sledge's drawing on how to spend a $ 300,000 gold shipment. His gang is Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that during the movement, 40 shippers are guarding the shipment, and if it is stopped, it is locked into vaults inside the territorial prison. I think there was an "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" episode on the same plot. <br /> <br /> The story would make a decent television lesson, but it will become very old as a very cushioned movie. Garner does not allow his charms to leak into his characterization, and the film does not attract enough interest to keep the viewer in sight. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it runs and burns right after the heir when the gang is playing a played and completely illogical card game. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
