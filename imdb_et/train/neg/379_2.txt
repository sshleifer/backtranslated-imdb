The TV program calls this movie a mystery. What is a mystery to me, how is it possible that a culture that can produce such sophisticated and sophisticated classical music and great mathematicians is unable to produce one film that rises above the despicable trash that this film is so excellent. This is Bollywood's best / worst, I can honestly say no. Nauseatingly sweet, kitschy clich√©s at every level, story, situation, dialogue, music and choreography. You probably have to enjoy it. I looked at it to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were times when I had to get away from it because I couldn't take it anymore. The only redeeming quality of the film is the exquisite beauty of the leading actors. <br /> <br />
