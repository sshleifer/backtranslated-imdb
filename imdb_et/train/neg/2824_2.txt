I'm a big Porsche fan and the car was the best star in this movie. <br /> <br /> Haim, the abusive letter of the 80s that has died, is commonplace and commenting on small characters / participants would be pointless; it goes without saying that they were all very average. It's a cool movie as the 80's memory route - some strange clothes, some good colors from Colorado's background and a very harmless, though desperate plot. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time looking at if you don't love 80s movies, Corey Haim or myself, I love the old school Porsches (this looks especially good) because life is too short to watch crappy movies.
