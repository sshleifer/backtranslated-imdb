Ice-T stars like Mason's homeless African-American who has hunted by wealthy hunters (Rutger Hauer, Gary Busey, Charles S. Dutton, F. Murray Abraham, William McNamara and John C. McGinley), but Mason is much more difficult then abduct conventional targets in this ridiculous and slow-paced actor that takes too many actions, and then captures them completely.
