I found that the documentary "Fast, cheap and controlling" is a rather interesting documentary. The documentary contained four "mini" documentaries about four interesting men. Each of these men was very involved in their work, showing great love and enjoyment for their work. <br /> <br /> I must say that the sad part should be the subjects where these people worked / studied. They were interesting in about five minutes, after which they became boring and lasting for too long. <br /> <br /> However, the video was filmed in a very creative way. I enjoyed one thing in the movie, the voice of which was over. It played great and also joined the music.
