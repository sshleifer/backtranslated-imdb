This fake journey is never near to match the great adventure these boys took in their first movie. This installment tries to move away from its prequel to grab something new, but it takes the wrong move and is not interesting or funny between trips. <br /> <br /> guys make a rock concert (and lots of people watching "free TV" - because when does this happen?) The scriptwriter would certainly have been more creative; see how all the random elements of the first movie were closely related to the science presentation. Not in the movie that pretty much ended with Bill & Ted's franchise. The joke was over. <br /> <br /> Grim Reaper is thrown into the mix for any reason. This infusion, like the whole plot, is done poorly and there is no spark for comedy or audience engagement. There's a ZZ Top impression that is appealing for no reason. There are lights, smoke, mirrors, noise. But nothing is really creative or funny. <br /> <br /> Leave it fake.
