While surfing the channel, we found this movie with its promising summary. We were puzzled by the flat screen and the formal style. We found amusing exploding car scenes, incredible shooting views that exploded with thunder-foam and cardboard weights. It was even more fun to see all the reused scenes from "Dante's Peak", where the front of the church falls on a school bus, the front of the store breaking from the main street, the bypass collapse and the red truck running down the road as the bricks fall over it. It was a good laugh, though he wanted, and leaves the viewer wondering if it was originally meant to be a small budget for disaster films.
