The main reason people still care about "Carlton-Browne Of The F." is that it contains Peter Sellers on the second account. Watching this movie To see Peter Sellers is a mistake. <br /> <br /> The vendors are the vaguely reptilian prime minister of the Gaillardia, formerly British colony, black-and-white island nation, who now has many Russian languages. miners during the Cold War. Amphibulos wants to play both US and Soviet interests against each other to get a simple profit, "all very friendly and all our cards under the table". Terry-Thomas is a title, a lazy British diplomat who wants to show Gaillardia that Britain has not forgotten them, all the opposite. <br /> <br /> A positive review here says: "The reason for this movie is considered to be average because comedy is underestimated. "I argue that the reason why Carlton-Browne is considered to be below average is because comedy does not exist. <br /> <br /> After proper opening, which creates only two strengths, the film is sympathetically doltish Terry-Thomas and John Addison's Perfect Larky Score, Things Slow Down Slowly for Slow Burns and Flat Miscommunication Jokes Carlton-Browne's low opinion of his boss and Gaillardia (which no one on the map can hide) dies to death by the time we reach the island (after good airsick jokes) , expectations are quite small. <br /> <br /> They are still too high. The island itself, which seems to exist either in Latin America or in the Mediterranean, is so pathetic that the glory of the glory is blowing up at the airport and the stand is broken down in the middle of the parade. is probably still a horse that promises another sheep-like phonetic listener: "During the war, the army uses a lot of horses." <br /> <br /> Sellers are never central even when we re-your character on the island. The plot is taken over by Ian Bannen, king Loris, who inhibits the throne of Gaillardia after his father's murder. Bannen is boring and plays its part both straight and written. Normally, this would make the seller a likely target for theft, but a little behind the accents and fatty mustache, the sellers are just a threat to those who remember him much happier on the other two films made in the same year, "The Mouse That Cried" and "I'm OK, Jack. "<br /> <br /> Strangely enough, this movie, such as" Jack ", was a Boulting Brothers production, where Roy Boulting was here along with Jeffrey Dell. Usually boulting films combine malicious social satire and comedy, but here is only fey jab in both directions. Amphibulos works with his mangled-English language all its worth ("This man is like how you say, pull a Chinese ship"), while Carlton-Browne is generally spoiled by his boss far more than he seems to deserve. <br /> <br /> The weakest and longest feature of this movie is the young Lorisian romance with Ilyen. A point for one point, played by the enchanting Luciana Paluzzi, one dock, that they are probably relatives who have never been treated. <br /> <br /> The film comes up with a flat-staged revolution, the surprise of which does not exceed anyone and the last action of Carlton-Browne, which literally looks like a coffin lid. Obviously he lives to see another day, but the same name movie is strictly DOA.
