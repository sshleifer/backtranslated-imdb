The drama of the rural family - perhaps with "ordinary people" - concerns a little boy who gives up his older brother after a fatal injury. In spite of the downturn (due to the wretched ghost treatment by director Christopher Cain), this is a sad story worth exploring. Unfortunately, the isolated agricultural atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters make the film responsible for making the film a stunning experience. What is Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley, this film is a small scale "The Natural" reunion. Too bad that this project did not get the talent behind the camera to really capture a memorable picture. * 1/2 from ****
