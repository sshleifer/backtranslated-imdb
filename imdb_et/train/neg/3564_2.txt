Pet Sematary, though a nice 80's Horror movie, nice head and atmosphere, is a copy of the Italian movie ZEDER Pupi Avat. It is clear that Stephen King has copied almost all of his director's ideas (Zeder's film was made before the King's book was written) <br /> <br /> Cat, the ground, everything was copied, that's the case. but, being a famous American writer for Stephen Kind, it is quite normal that he can get it, this is obviously due to the great difference between this type of Italian film without budget (and partly it is itself ...) but the original idea I repeat this, it's an Italian director Opened <br /> <br /> Let the world know
