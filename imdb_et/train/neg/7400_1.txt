I've seen pretty bad movies and that's there. No plot tells, it's like one of those bad coma episodes on the soap opera. I just wanted to hit this little girl because she says she's a real suspicious movie. Monsters who ran around were funny. I also saw a little "Silent Hill" there. And I read that done and looked at the Finnish metal band Lord. So it's no wonder it didn't make sense. It seems to be a tool that promotes the band there and more. The FX is very good, the appearance of the film, the monsters and even the good ones. But the story and talking about it isn't just there.
