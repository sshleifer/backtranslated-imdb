I've never posted a review before, but I had to do this movie! This movie is so bad, I found myself trying to justify how bad it is when I try to think of it as a kitsch or parody. But it is not. It's really, consciously aware of BAD. This is a serious test that flips brilliantly. Other reviewers have made a lot of mistakes in the movie, so I'm trying not to repeat them, but I invite you to watch this movie. Throughout this, I was either speechless, literally amazing, or hysterical on the floor. I've never been so fun watching the movie for years. In fact, I'm trying to see all my friends because it's a movie that needs to be shared. <br /> <br /> My favorites: - when Arthur's hearings go -It's a boy (his dancing is incredible) - Volunteer nudity (director / leading actor was just nude to shoot) - Preacher's office with his cardboard and crayon with Christ's handing - Sure , a famous wedding scene with palm trees and forgotten rings (what narrative does it play?!?) - Former wife wrestling with Ben to get her weapon - a detailed queue where Arthur kills the preacher; apparently he burns this incredibly weak game - yes, gay religious-fanatic brother with his bleached hair and WeHo fashion - And my favorite, using Joplin's "The Entertainer" as an opening filter and "Pachebel's Canon D Major as a closing soundtrack! - the list goes on and on. THIS !!!
