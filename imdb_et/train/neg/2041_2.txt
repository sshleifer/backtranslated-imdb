Well, I start with good points. The length of the film was only 86 minutes and some of it was so bad that it was funny. Now for low points. My first warning sign was the movie's actual warning. When it started, the following "warning" appeared: "The movie you are going to see contains graphic and distracting images. Because, contrary to popular beliefs, no fun, beauty or romance has been killed." I should have saved myself for 86 minutes and then turned it off. The first words of the movie were, "I'm in the glue factory." It was a man who spoke on his phone and referred to a nursing home as an adhesive factory. I do not know why. Thus, the film is based on a child who is obsessed with Zodiac Killer and begins to imitate him. The budget for this movie was at least 50 bucks and they have to use the cheapest cameras they found. Operation was worse than I read the script directly. It looked like they did. The script was terrible and the great "twisting" was that Zodiac Killer's biography was actually written by this person in the Zodiac Killer. Of course, they tried to show it fine, but made it quite clear in the first 10 minutes. Without the painful details of the plot, there were some terrible places in the film. They are trying to make Zodiac Killer equal to "one army" because the soldiers are really murderers. Then they tried to try the "satanic worship" by showing boys with some black hoods at the meeting. A big "computer hacker" got the child's address when someone gave him the child's name and phone number. For some reason he had to hack into the FBI to get someone's address. I'm not sure why he didn't look for it in the phone book or use whitepages.com. The reason was also a random reference on September 11th. I learned that no matter where you shoot, the blood comes out of your mouth for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> So if you like really bad acting, sub-para scripts, bad camera work and an obvious plot, you love Zodiac Killer!
