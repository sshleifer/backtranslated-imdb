I hated the movie completely. It was so slow. They have to get some exercise ... no, wait, it won't help because the Naked Brothers Band has slowed down. You know why I'm here even though I'm a naked brother band? To warn people before they watch a stupid movie, so the NBB doesn't get the money, they won't get any amateur fools that are so slow that every old man could go and write in 10 seconds. Not only is the song's words slowed down, they sing badly. Okay, I'm leaving this movie ..... anyway, it was boring and they did terribly. It wasn't funny at all, though they tried to do it very hard. I think they deserve some credit for that ... but the movie isn't worth your time. Just look at its rating. The film (and series) is very painful to look at anyone with even half the brain. Seriously, if you liked it, you have to go to the movies where the actors actually work, not beat their monotone lines. I'm in my school's drama club and some people are actually better than the boys of Nat and Alex. Hurry up before it's too late! I thought seriously that Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this poopie. I don't even know why I went through this movie even with HALF. I don't think it even deserves a movie ...
