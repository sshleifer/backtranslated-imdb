Not just a new story, but this romantic comedy is working on the concept. The young man (John Cusack) and the dying proud woman (Kate Beckinsale) meet randomly and do not know if they are for each other. While both are allowed, it is strange that they still feel that their soul mate is somewhere. Slightly in some places but viva la love. Being romantic, I'm almost bound to rivet. My favorite scene is where Cusack is on the ground and the snow starts to fall. Finale is almost too sweet, but the most valuable. This is not one of Cusack's deeper roles, but who in hell couldn't beat Beckins. Significant support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the worst role I have ever seen him. On the other hand, Eugene Levy is peculiar and funny. Look at it with your breath.
