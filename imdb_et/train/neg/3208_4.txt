This film was a big disappointment for me. I had been waiting for this film to come out for years and I was a faithful follower of Chaos Comics until they went bankrupt. They not only cut the story, but changed the information. The claim that Lucifer is the Father of Hope is wrong. He broke his father, but he himself is not his father. The voices also did not match the characters, and when you hear the voice of the beloved character, the voice heard by your mind can never be sent back. I don't remember everything that was wrong. The bottom line is if you love Lady Death despite this movie. It just didn't make comic justice at all !!
