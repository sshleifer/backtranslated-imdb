I have read posts here on Wonder Woman's costume for this TV movie. At the time of making the film, it should be noted that he did not wear his traditional clothing. Manufacturers detained the concept of the comic book writer WW from the beginning of the seventies. <br /> <br /> As for the film, I have to accept many other posters. Snoozefest! I was a child when he appeared in ABC in 1974, so I was at the right age to appreciate the movie about the comic book hero. Yet I was "tried" with the plot, and I stopped watching it for three quarters of the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, I wasn't at the right age to rate Cathy Lee! :-)
