WOW is all I can say if your reading is following it or thinking about it. trust me to see it! <br /> <br /> I laughed so much about this movie in so many parts that the worst thing is very funny! I can't believe they overlap the school mark! I had to play this scene over and over to laugh more and more every time. If such a movie can be done, it will give us all the hopes of making our films. even the costume was bad. it seemed my 7-year-old cousin could have done a better job of doing this. heck i bet he could have written and act better. I know I have to look at the other part to see if it was as bad as the first one. its a cool idea about a killer scarecrow, but a much better job could have been done. hopefully another killer will appear on the scarecrow, just don't like it.
