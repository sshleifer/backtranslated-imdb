I think the exhibition had a pretty good concept. But the performance was bad. The script is bad and the action is bad. There were many questions that could have been better imagined, such as protesting against gay marriage or finding a graveyard. The performance cannot be properly described as a comedy exposition because it has no humor. I should say that this show was hardly successful in establishing a Muslim community. <br /> <br /> So far, the second season is worse than the first. I had a great hope for this show, but I was disappointed. I still appreciate the CBC for presenting such a concept to viewers. Anyway, I wish you the best of success in the future.
