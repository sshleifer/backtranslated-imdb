I am excited about Shakespeare's modern adjustments if the director is unable to use or update his thoughts. If it uses original words in the updated setup, it is particularly difficult if it is in the 20th or 21st century, although it may work well in period styles, such as Trevor Nunn on the twelfth night is a very effective Victorian. It can work with 30's if only there was much less song and dance and much more Shakespeare text. Unfortunately, this is just a fairly trivial, though very pleasant, exhibition. Another problem is Branagh himself. I agree that he is too old to play one student, but more importantly, he is such an experienced Shakespeare actor that, despite all his efforts to be just another student, his strength at exhibitions is all the time. Of course he would have had to play the king - a mature student king surrounded by a young student. Instead, we had a nice but unimposing actor for the king, so unimposing the so-called King, who had no royal attributes. <br /> <br /> The number of songs and dances that I found tedious, despite the harsh songs and pleasant dancing, unfortunately meant a drastic cut in Shakespeare's dialogue. So the whole thing comes to trivial and light sweets, and I got very bored, including a comic turn, and I was glad when it ended. Branagh has not made Shakespeare justice in this production. <br /> <br /> However, it helps Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, who is absolutely as good as the older couple.
