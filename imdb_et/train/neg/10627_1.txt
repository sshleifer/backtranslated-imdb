I note that most people who think this film is telling the truth are not born before six landings (1969-1972) or are not old enough to be judged. I think it's much easier to ask a historical event if you didn't live it. <br /> <br /> I was young at Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was going on. The whole country followed the moon. Our families gathered around the TV to see its launch. Newspaper titles shouted the latest events every day, from launch to landing, moonlight to moonlight, to splashdown, in many languages. Some classes were canceled in the school so we can watch the main events on television. During Apollo 13, the world prayed and kept its collective breath when men were home to an insecure fate. You couldn't go anywhere without asking what was the last. The world was truly one community. <br /> <br /> Now, with 30-year-old buffers in the buffer, it is easy to claim fraud because global enthusiasm and interest are dead. We are left in our history books and one can claim that history is wrong and tries to prove it with a lot of false and compiled facts, while ignoring the opposite evidence that shows otherwise - not to mention the proof that it lives among those souls and memories that lived through their wonderfully good and fantastic days.
