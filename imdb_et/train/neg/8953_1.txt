I literally saw this movie right after the book was finished and maybe it was a neutral idea or very stupid. I think it was the last one. First, it was inaccurate in many small but important details. One of the first things I noticed was Winston's everyday work, conversations, cafe eating, etc., and he feels free to the unknown and to people who have tremendous fear. One of the most important parts of the book was that even in small activities, it was almost impossible to safely show the hint of his true emotions in his form. This is also shown on the streets of the productions. In the book, Winston knew that it was a big threat to go there, and was skeptical and scared of every trip. While in the movie, he does it so often and without fear that you will lose a lot of important monitoring and risk immediately from bat. <br /> <br /> Other minor inaccuracies included Winston, who hid in his diary wall, yes a very small change, but this raises the question: what's the point? There was also the most annoying thing the director could do with the book, and that is characters. <br /> <br /> However, big inaccuracies were much more disturbing. First of all, one of the most important parts of the book is that Big Brother is a government based on intelligent but raw philosophy. In the film, they miss it and go straight when you think the government is guided by Hitler technology. What is true, in a sense, when it is directed at his face, but if that's all you get out of Big Brother, you really left the point of the book. The terrible thing for a big brother is that in some ways there are some points behind this philosophy. When O'Brien chooses Winstons in the Ministry of Love, he listens to what Winston says against Big Brother. The fact that he listens and promotes his philosophy is actually what is most horrible and intriguing. Finally (careful SPOILER), when Winston says he loves Big Brother, it is a terrible thing that you are not sure whether it was spiritual beating and torture that caused it, or the real power behind philosophy. I'm not saying in any way that Big Brother's philosophy has points to me, but its intelligence and depth are what makes this book incredibly annoying. <br /> <br /> Can anyone also feel any connection to Julia and Winston? It was terrible, no connection. <br /> <br /> And where was O'Brien before he gave Winston his address? One of the things that the book was carrying was Winston's thoughts on O'Brien before he contacted him. In the film, they just jump into a weapon. <br /> <br /> But it summarizes why this movie was a terrible adaptation: because it's impossible to NOT stand up for a weapon and morph characters in less than two hours. How could one guess that this movie was traceable when it was under two hours? At least 3 hours are needed in the movie to capture some important moods and connections. Something less is just pointless. <br /> <br /> If you love this book and I mean ATTENTION, then you don't approve of this movie and it's likely that you already knew you didn't. Because the book is inconvenient and this film proves the impossibility of having a decent film in a small roll. <br /> <br /> Two stars out of ten
