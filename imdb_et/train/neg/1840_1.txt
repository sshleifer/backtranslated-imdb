It must be the most brutally unusual "comedy" I've ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Christopher Walken like a crazy home man CAN NOT make me laugh? There's something wrong with this picture. This is the only movie I've ever known. I used free passports and still felt that I wanted my money back. I can sincerely say that the only film I've ever seen was WARNING. The. ONLY. worse. Movie. I laughed at the very nervous arena and that's the way it is. Spending 2 hours of comedy, you'll have more than one laugh, right? I don't know, I think filmmakers thought the "flan" was a funny word or something. And another running joke is actually a dead horse - literally.
