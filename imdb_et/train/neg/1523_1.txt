This "movie" must be the biggest steaming vapor C * ^ p I've ever seen, what else can I say as BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD. DO NOT save this "movie" and I pray that they DO NOT even talk about making a sequel. If you think about monitoring it, you should know that the story is that two dumpers are dragged into the land to save. Movies, like men in black, have been crushed and put together to make this "comedy", but have been completely unsuccessful. Please do not record this movie (save yourself).
