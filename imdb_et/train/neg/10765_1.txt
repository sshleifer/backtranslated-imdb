A great example of how Hollywood could (and still can) take the literary fiction masterpiece and foolishly disappointed. <br /> <br /> In Big Sky, writer Dudley Nichols and the company surprisingly wrote that the Pulitzer Prize was awarded by Guthrie, the classical pioneer register of the author. In doing so, they removed the soul of the story and any edge and effect it had on the film's adaptation. <br /> <br /> The epic nature of Guthrie's book and its main game, Boone Caudill's development of a naive Kentucky boy tempered and competent survivor / mountain man, has been replaced by a sub-qualified cruise ship, a little similar to the author's intention. In the film version, Boone's presence is nothing more than unique. <br /> <br /> The intriguing and even shocking elements of the plot that give Guthrie a new impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason. The most striking thing is that the emphasis is placed on the character of Zeb Calloway, who was a random little character in the book. On the other hand, Dick Summers, the pioneer of veterans, is a very important and exciting character. It is also obvious that director Hawks decided that the character Zebi played by actor Hunnicutti is not irritating enough. So Zeb / Hunnicutt was given a lot of time to make this unpleasant voice transmission, which is a Hollywood short film incompetent on screen writing, editing and direction. <br /> <br /> Some movies are actually books on which they were based (William Wyler's "Ben-Hur" is a great example). But it is terrible and frustrating not only to adapt the novel, but also to the film itself. <br /> <br /> The story is boring and the clich√© and characters - at least those that have not been changed from the script - are just the low and boring shadows of Guthrie's literary vision. Unfortunately, Kirk Douglas's appeal, which could have raised this film, rejected the role of the milk residue he gave. <br /> <br /> If you can believe it, the Guthrie Pulitzer Prize winning movie version, The West West, which is also starring in Kirki, is even worse. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, The Big Sky reinforces Howard Hawks as one of the most prized cinema history.
