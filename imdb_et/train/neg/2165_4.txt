This movie was a rather strange viewing experience. The film is obviously based on the game. Now I am sure that everything in this movie just works in the game, but it doesn't seem interesting enough to watch in the movie. The film is too "stepy" and they didn't bother to change some of the dialogues to make it more suitable for the movie. Instead, there is now a literal play on the stage, featuring an upper-case character and a staged dialogue. As a result, the story hasn't really worked, and the movie is almost a complete and obsolete viewing experience. <br /> <br /> It takes time before you think it's comedy. First of all, you think this is the drama you are watching, where it is peculiar, but as the movie progresses, you will notice that the film is a tragic comedy, which is indeed a comedy genre rather than a drama genre. br /> <br /> Characters and Dialogue are really things that make this movie original and superficial, which at times become truly unchanged. Of course, the actors are great; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, among other things, do not raise the film to an "observable" level. <br /> <br /> The story seems completely inconsistent. Basically, the story is something and it just focuses mainly on the brothers / sister characters played by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what exactly is this story? The film seems to be pointless and outdated, with very little offer. As I said before; I'm sure the story is good and interesting while watching the stage, but it's not really a movie and it's just not working. <br /> <br /> Editing is just terrible and time-consuming, and it even gets ridiculous in certain sequences. <br /> <br /> More was expected from director Lee Lee Thompson, who has obviously made much better films than failed, stage-stage is translated to screen, project. <br /> <br /> Really not worth your time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
