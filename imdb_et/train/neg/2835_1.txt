Dereks seemed unable to find a roll after "10" for Bo. <br /> <br /> I worked for a park in the Florida Park. One day, the "Kalamaja" trainers spread the manuscript "Ghosts Can't Do It", where foods were prepared for dolphins. There was one scene where -dolphin-allegedly Bo (or Bo dolphin), asking "to make eggs." Reading the script, we -lauuughed -... <br /> <br /> We couldn't make any part of this movie in our facility, even though our dolphins were - "Big Blue!" It must be very close to the end of Anthony Quinn's life. I hope he was fun in this movie because it wasn't something for his legacy.
