The fifth "Black Emanuelle" I looked at is the most intriguing feature of how he does it to a miserable female reporter who is investigating a white slavery / prostitution racket that takes him to San Francisco in Rome, Macao and back to home town, New York! The film has been featured on earlier series of veterans who play inexplicably different roles, namely Ivan Rassimov (here appearing as leader of the UN Committee of Third World States), Karin Shubert (feminist rival reporter) and Don Powell (Rassimov driver). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as is usually the case with this type of film (despite being shown dead at night), it is a heavily modified and especially graphic scene (described in "Stracultr" where the Asian slave merchant gets his fire When her dog is sodomized, it is not here to be seen! But still a scary sequence in the late film, as a buggy politician tricks a couple of girls (including of course Gemser and Shubert) to the New York Bridge midnight congregation with generations (this is how she gets your voices, get it!) - with the palms of your big society who are barely looking - it looks pretty intact. <br /> This is the most ridiculous element of this record - except Gems Er is sure he is always at home when he enters the house (even in front of perfect strangers) - his excursion to India to interview charlatan / guru (George Eastman, who looks like Christ much like that!) to end the event endlessly; of course, when Emanuelle calls her, she gets to premature ejaculation ... !!
