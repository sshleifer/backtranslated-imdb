Well ... now that I know where Rob Zombie stole his "1000 dead body" title, I can rest now. Something about funny performances or a print script was not lifted by the dead in the "Seven Corps House", but from his plot (ha!) There still needs to be a groovy ghoulie to kill the bloody amateurs who make a small rent scary former residence! At Hell House (sorry, I don't remember the real name of the place of residence), some mysterious, inexplicable death happened long ago; some, like the arthritic Lurch stand-in John Carradine (whose small role gives the film the only valuable moments), attribute it to the supernatural; The worshiping film director John Ireland leaves this superstitious hockey. The result comes like "The Girl of Satan for Girls" (a memorable title; the values ​​of TV production; the intriguing plot) that has passed "Children should not play with dead things" (low-rent movie about the small rent filmmakers who wake up dead); The problem is that it's not nearly fun or fun. The "Seven Corps House" is dead inside the frame and spends the rest of his 89 minutes in rigor mort, dragging us to the other painful side.
