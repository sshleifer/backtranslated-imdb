Why were there so many people who drew up the exhibition "Contra Todos" at the San Francisco Film Festival in the evening? "It's a hit man," my friend said. "Well ... and that's Brazil," I added. Beautiful colorful people, tropical weather, lush rhythms and hip gangster plot? There are undoubtedly great temptations. <br /> <br /> Nobody forgot to tell us one little detail: this is a very bad movie, really pretty terrible and unpleasant to watch because it's badly done. <br /> <br> How did "Contra Todos" land in Berlin, Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, many smaller local festivals and now San Francisco? Obviously, the way the advertising process and the film festival functioned won. <br /> <br /> First he won the first prize at the Rio Film Festival, where he was named the Best Brazilian Film of the Year. It must have been a bad year; they have a lot, much better. Next, the beautiful summaries in the catalogs plus the imaginary buzz lead to crowded audiences and - because the film does not appear anywhere and so avoids the close attention of the critics - it continues the round. <br /> <br /> a lot of promotion sometimes. The Chicago Festival, called "Contra Todoseks", is a fast-paced cocktail shot directly from Brazil, and referred to Claudia's boy as "a slum-like neighborhood nail". Soninha is a "Teodoro nymph-like teenage growing sexuality daughter." The film is often "captured by the urgency of a hand-held camera" and the director "develops a real and obvious sense of disappointment resulting from domestic despair and disintegration." The effect is "unbearably raw and honest", and the film hurtles "the end result when life is on the screen." Not the best writing, but it's sure to pump the excitement for a certain type of potential viewer. <br /> <br /> Contra Todos touches a hit man, two hit men and a woman and a daughter, and a Christian girlfriend was born again. It's a shock - amazingly ugly digital video with no camera work ability - mostly in poor poor suburbs, not in one "favelas" or village-like slum of a Brazilian city where such wonderful movies are "Black orphan", "Pixote" and "God City" was done, not this time in Rio, but in São Paulo. <br /> <br /> A man with family problems is Teodoro (Giulio Lopez) and his drug partner is Waldomiro (Ailtan Graça). Both participants have little TV experience, as does the actor who plays Teodoro's sliding blonde woman Cláudia (Leona Cavalli) and Silvia Lorençot, who plays her dressing up, made the rebellious daughter Soninha. These participants can carry it from the back of some telenovel. Who knows? - On a better-looking film, they may even be good. Apart from them, there are some young men who collide with Teororo or, if he is busy, collide. Directors do not work much, although the camera increases their pores. <br /> <br /> A couple of observers, one at the Berlin Festival and one at London, saw the shortcomings of the movie, but unfortunately they are buried again on websites. Henry Sheehan noted in Berlin that "the film" (his quotes) was "the worst video work". "The filmmaker seems to have chosen a video simply because it was a cheap alternative to the film," Sheehan wrote, "and has not used the new media creatively" - nor did he make anything else creative. /> <br /> Sheehan drew attention to the first big mistake of the film: it begins as a domestic drama, which should shake off, if half a hour after the action, Moreira says that the father and one of his friends are professional for thirty minutes waiting for the film, it seems to be a completely arbitrary decision, and it is at least a waste of time, but hanging is all that Moreira does, like a little boy who has got a set of tools for his birthday and is going to be seen without being rhymed, without reason or without skill. "Destructive, But True. <br /> <br /> Metin Alsanjak, who wrote Kamera.com at the 2004 London Festival, tried to look at the positive side, but gave up the lack of redemption opportunities to call" the best feature of the film ". very simply because everything else is so bad. Alsanjak admitted that "this low budget, violent and poor assessment of illegal Sao Paulo has no pleasant characters and hence hope. Too dark and cynical, which is an account of the human situation, the film does not help the bad subtitles. "Contra Todos, who joins Alsanja, did not contribute to" Dogma "and Mike Leigh. <br /> <br /> After this pointless first half hour will not return our first violence of expectation - which, if they come, will simply "beat everything visible without rhyme, without reason or skill" - Moreira tries terribly to end his steep finale by adding what seems to be right after that, followed by an incredible ironic summary a scene where one of the characters marries. Without a doubt, the director wanted to show the low-level men's "banality of evil" in the neighborhood of the workgroup, but he cannot make the characters he generally sees in life for us. Change the material. <br /> <br /> (San Francisco International Film Festival, April 28, 2005).
