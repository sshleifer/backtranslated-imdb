Come on, what's this show, Power Rangers anyway? I always thought that the Japanese exhibition, originally produced in a better form, was great in Japan and became one of the most ridiculous and pointless apologies in the history of toy trade! There's no point in this exhibition. <br /> <br /> Bad discounts, bad costumes, earrings, etc. show what was ridiculous in the 1990s. duhs ", the main cast, Jason, Trin, Tommy, Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: USE A BREAK! <br /> <br /> Saban brought it from Japan and then bought this show from Disney rights about five years ago. <br /> <br /> Now the public has to endure this show on the Disney channel and so on. <br /> <br /> All I can say is to give me a break!
