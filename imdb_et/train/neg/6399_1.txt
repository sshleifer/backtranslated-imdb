One: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two big comics changed for the delicate sons. They both sold themselves in what is worse than Pryor's character. Two: A terrible, too sentimental script that could have been used in Harold Lloyd's movie that has been so broken. Three: black actress selection as a toy; its racial subtext is intolerable, as it has never been discussed. There's no message here, any Prince could have played any comic actor. Four: This boy ... I wish I could go back in time and prevent him from ever acting ... that would mean movies like, and Kid Co might not have been made ... and my childhood would have been free of their mind-twist. So if you want to look at a couple of great comics to staple your sick sweet baby, go ahead. If you want to see something good, look at Pryor's old standup and Gleason for something better than Honeymooners.
