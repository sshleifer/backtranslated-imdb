What a terrible and terrible movie. The worst collection of long clich√©s. Not that I saw a lot. I left the theater for about 40 minutes, looking for a strong drink to relieve his nerves. Meryl Streep was usually terrible. How many injured and tortured expressions are in 1 person? Aidani Quinn's talents were - as is often the case - completely wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan that she could act? In an attempt to be politically correct, this film continues to fulfill racial stereotypes. (Brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches poor neighborhood schools a violin for minors). The kids were not even cute! Just written to fit a terrible script. Aaargh! Wes Craven fired me once. real horror it!
