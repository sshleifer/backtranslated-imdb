I was going to watch this movie in the cinema and I was surprised at the room. There was only me and my girlfriend! It cried to me that this movie is not very good. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, the movie was terrible. Ben Affleck plays a man who buys a family for Christmas. This is a very predictable narration with her who falls in love with her. He is OKish, but he is not very good at the comedy of the film. The plot line is bad and comedy is almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good points. For example, the family breaks down and the mother is very funny. <br /> <br /> I hope this review will stop wasting other people's money. I was very embarrassed when I came out of the room !!!
