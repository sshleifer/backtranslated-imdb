Site Summary: Hong Kong, 1966 Paul Wagner, the man who built the Victoria Tunnel, is killed by his companions with his wife. His twin sons, Chad and Alex, are divorced. Twenty-five years later, in Los Angeles, the karate instructor Chad and the smuggler in Hong Kong, Alex, united to understand their parents' murder and rightly so. <br /> <br /> This is another time that Jean-Claude Van Damme & Sheldon Lettich has collaborated, having previously been "Lionheart". It is also the first of three movies with Van Damme playing double roles ("Maximum Risk" and "Replicator" are others). The plot is a very simple story of revenge, the only salvation function of the movie is the performance of Van Damme as two very different people? dirty rich child and tough - & - drum, cigar chomping tough guy. As it goes, Van Damme's role in each role is not very good, although taking Alex is a little fun. It makes sense that the brothers are wrong with each other by wearing different clothes and different hairstyles. Bolo Yeung is very worthy of the bad guys.
