Amazing movie. It is a shame that some Flemish top figures and actors made such a painful film. <br /> <br /> The first movie and TV series have hardly changed: the same actors, the same prototype characters, the same scenario (emotional complications, the team under emotional pressure, but everything turns out to be top-notch after the predicted grand final).
