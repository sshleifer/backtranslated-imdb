I'm a Columbo fan, especially in the rain on Saturday, and Oahar Werner was fun to see after Fahrenheit 451, but this episode was really missing. The original plot and plot revolution was evident and can be anticipated many years before today's modern detective exhibitions. But it was fun to see crazy patterns and "modern" electronics and, of course, the mandatory suburban humor that bombed modern art for sale. A high-tech home is the Tomorrowland Jetson or Disney version and it is fun to think of their "gizmos exit" writers. <br /> <br /> If this sunny outdoors, play because there are much better Columbo episodes. However, we should be grateful for the cable television that these episodes are being broadcast.
