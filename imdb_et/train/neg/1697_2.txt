I'm a big fan of David Lynch and I have everything he's done on a DVD, except the Hotel Room & 2-Hour Twin Peaks movie. So when I found out about it, I grabbed it right now and ... and ... what is it? This is a bunch of black and white cartoons that are wrong and unpleasant. Maybe I don't know what's good, but maybe it's just a bunch of things paired with David Lynch to make a few bucks. Let me explain that I didn't care about the unpleasant language, but I had to adjust the sound because my neighbors can do it. All in all, it is very disappointing and maybe just an interesting deluxe box. I advise you not to spend that money. 2 out of 10.
