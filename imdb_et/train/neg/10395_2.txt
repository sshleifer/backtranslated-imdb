It is impossible to understand what the producers of this terrible adaptation have been trying to do. <br /> <br /> A group of top-notch actors, in the main well (with a few remarkable exceptions) who give quite good performances. Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and as good as Joanna Lumley as Diana. They all work well with the scripts they were given. <br /> <br /> So much good. The medium would contain kits. Nancherrow is not like the house described in the book, although the house they use for Dower House is incredibly pleasant. It is clear that Dower House is too big. In later parts, writers decided to bring the whole story back to Britain, probably saving money, although with a little imagination I have no doubt that they would have restored Ceylon. <br /> <br /> Now it's bad. Scenario. It is such a terribly bad adaptation that is hard to find to condemn. Edward will not die in the battle of Britain, but will survive, blind. She makes a short look and suicide - why? Loveday is a young woman who is completely in love with Gus, becoming a husband of a sensible farmer who can barely lose her love for her life with a tear (less emotional than a short meeting). Gus, a man who is in love and passionately in love, is willing to give up his love without complaint. Walter (faithfully in the book) turns from a low-unfaithful spouse to a dedicated family. Jess is a psychologically disturbed young woman who doesn't speak. Aunt Biddy still has a drinking problem, but now without justification. The Dower House is busy with the army, without being obvious for a very short scene with Jess, who has the fear of armed soldiers. Miss Mortimer's breasts are completely joyful, but I didn't see how their displaying on the plot repeatedly moved on. Luckily named Nettlebed becomes a daily Dobson. The word limit prevents me from continuing with the list. <br /> <br /> There is a sequel (which I lost to viewing this interest) and I don't know if the changes were made to create the next story. It is hard to imagine that Rosamunde Pilcher would have accepted the grotesque perversion of his book; he was expected to lose control of the purchase of rights.
