This is the worst film I've ever seen. Avengers kept this dubious respect? but no longer. "Jill Ripper" action is terrible and only shade the plot. This film is both intellectually stimulating and Telletubbes. It doesn't know if she wants to be a S&M flick or a really bad thriller. Just watch out for extreme poisoning or when you are in bed and need a skin clad. This script should be transformed into pornography, it doesn't take much effort and would have a longer shelf life. Porn, even bad porn, does not harm Dolf Lundgren's career in how this film is.
