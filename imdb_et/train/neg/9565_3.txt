I can't say that Wargames: Dead Code is the worst film I've ever seen, because it had one or two decent moments, but I can just say it's the most transparent film I've ever seen. No matter if the plot device wasn't mine without my 10 + minutes before. Nothing the film did was any kind of intelligence behind the scene. The intent of every spoken or printed line was so obvious that the film could not "get into". <br /> <br /> I found myself laughing at the terribly thoughtful plot line and bumbled attempts to get the audience back, much more often than I enjoyed the movie.
