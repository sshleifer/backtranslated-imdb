This interesting (which shouldn't be) low quality spanish exploitation (pretty much what i could add) seems good but not? Let me say this again "huh?" In fact, the word "huh?" you go through a lot. Nothing is reasonable, nor does it try. I just don't know if it's a mysterious mystery or just a complicated confusion, but you can't deny how laconically uneven, strange and bright it is. <br /> <br /> Independent sequences associated with (like this nasty opening that includes a little girl), a dead cat, and a fire that is associated with a little story involving a photographer Mario (played by John Caffari, a chest swell whose mustache is a dead ring for Nintendo's symbolic Mario. What's the probability?) that scratches his girlfriend's home and meets a young lady (proudly fixing Patty Shepard) whom she asks her in photography, where they have met some hoody witches in this remote mountain area. which is just an obvious mechanism and growing anxiety. Raul Artigot manages a few unusually unusual visions and creepy passages, but in most cases it seems to be non-existent and purposeful as his writing. Ramon Sempere's striking cinematography protects tastefully rich landscapes by taking landscape views and allowing time to calm. However, there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on. Fernando Garcia Morcillo's stunningly bombarded and burnt-out score blurs a terribly dense atmosphere. The cookers are capable, but there is also a strong heap of secondary presence (VÃ­ctor Israeli election). <br /> <br /> Slowly with little interest, but this dreamy design (which seems to be on and off) manages to keep you looking until it is closed.
