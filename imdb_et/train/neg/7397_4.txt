I've seen this movie many times at various short film festivals and it always gives the impression that I've seen a movie trailer! <br /> <br /> The school film is very well produced and managed, but the story ... but it needed something else to be a bigger and more interesting film. The character named Tim Watcher needed some in-dept approach. Some Portuguese short films are missing - the script is always superficial. <br /> <br /> But still ... I liked this movie ... <br /> <br /> Parabens! (congratulations!)
