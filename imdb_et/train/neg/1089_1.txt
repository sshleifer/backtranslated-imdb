What is Robert's "Pretentious" Altman? Did he save the light? All this boring film was so dark that it was ridiculous. Have you ever seen a law firm where everyone is working on a candlelight? <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. In fact, don't waste your time on something Altman does: it's an unprecedented waste of film.
