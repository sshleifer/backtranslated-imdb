So, what's the big noise to make INDIANA JONES wannabe if you have an actor who has directed a fictional guy from adventure stories who don't want to go out of the adventure? Whoever wrote the JAKE SPEED script was probably fired, but for any reason, this movie is not very excited! This does not mean that it has nothing to do, but look at the dark side of the picture. It must not be similar to INDIANA JONES or other adventure effects that include rockers and narrow escapees, and JAKE SPEED was promoted in this way using smart propaganda to interest me and many others! Besides, I've never heard of this man, so who needs his attention?
