How long has this piece left on the TV for so long? It's terrible. It makes me shoot someone. It is so fake that it is actually worse than the 1940s science fiction film. I have a stroke rather than a mess. I remember it when it first came out. I thought it might be interesting, then I found out if it was really, madly, ridiculously stupid. It was so bad that I really pulled out my pocket and left my hand in the table. <br /> <br /> Please, people, stop viewing it and all other reality shows, they are garbage that mixes nets and cancels quality programming that requires some thought.
