As I read all these positive comments, I find myself puzzled. How is it that so many enjoyed the terribly bad adaptation of my second favorite Jane Austen's novel? The film has many problems that have already been mentioned in some reviews; just put it up, overwhelming and shining to open the credit to the end of the meat work. worthy, the worst is Paltrow. I have enjoyed my roles in some roles, but here he is terrible - he is self-conscious, nose, sliding and completely inseparable from his characters and around him. Very disappointing effort - though even the perfect Emma couldn't record this movie.
