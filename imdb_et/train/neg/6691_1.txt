MY EYES! IN THE GOD'S NAME AND EVERYTHING WHO IS ATTENTION! What drugs are you! it can be the worst movie ever! I felt like I was traveling with bad acid all the time, I have to call a therapist to help me deal with the trauma of this epic catastrophe. From the beginning to the end, shine ropes are the holy masterpiece of Satanic cinema. when I thought I was watching this movie with my Jewish best friend and his family, we thought "oh hey, this may be funny! It's probably bad, but still a little funny", if we were wrong, we weren't ready how terrible this movie might be. All my friends pulled the lobotomy as soon as the film was over, and during the film, one of my friends tried to hang with my belt while the other tried to break his wrist with a wooden spoon. I'd like to watch the video of this Circle so that the pain and suffering would be over seven short days. For anyone who wants to see this movie, NOT PREPARED! You may think that you are this "tough guy" when you rent it, but this film breaks you, pushes you to the ground and urinates you.
