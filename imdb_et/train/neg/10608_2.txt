I don't think any Van Damme movie will ever take a universal soldier, but never know. This movie was good but not as good as the first one. VD returns Luci and has to fight again. He's trying to get 2b jokes here, but maybe he deserves a smile. This time VD has a child from Ally W. Good it showed their picture. 2. Goldberg was cool, he made his famous move forgotten what the reason for this name I was not looking at wrestling-sucks. VD & Goldberg had a good fight. It was like the first one, but just not so good. VD makes the best of his career, as always with HELICOPTER KICK. Although the last end should have been longer. Anyway, it's worth seeing, but it never goes beyond the original.
