If he wanted to be precise, he would have had to choose some Frisco natives and not a number of NY actors who knew nothing about Sucka Free (not Sucker Free). I have lived in SF all my life and people are not talking and acting like they did. Everything was too dramatic, and the only cat I saw in the bay was JT Bigga's Figga with a small comforter rapper. It is no shock that he was the only one who really dressed like the cats here (ie his Warriors jersey). Never noticed anyone who suffered giants or 9-year-olds; Instead, he installed them in some cheeses made with SF or Oakland sweaters, which are not even sold here. HP does not have bowling alleys, black and Asian gangbangs do not wear headbands or wristbands with the colors of the African or Chinese Olympics, nor does every Chinese gangster Yao Ming wear knitwear and try black when shooting ringtones. Further, although there is now a significant yuppie community that has invaded the mission, all that was shown was a white white guy and self-proclaimed "100% West Coast Boriqua". It's not New York! Puerto Ricans is a little and far from here, and the Latin people in the mission are very different, as shown here, who was undoubtedly NY. Also, HP is not the only black neighborhood in the city. The exact idea would have shown both HP's sounds in its hood and Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview and others. <br /> <br /> This film could have been much better if Lee had done more homework and had a better job.
