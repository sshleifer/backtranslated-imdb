The worst film ever. Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this turkey. I've heard that the movie was originally designed with the title "The Treasure," but it was turned into "Sharks" Treasure to take advantage of the jaw excitement. I think sharks were in one scene of this movie; The fact that they were included in the "thriller" had to sell the tickets. Did not work. Every time something "good" happens in the film, the crew of the ship attacks each other with the brand of a particular beer that was introduced at the time the film was made. Gee, do you think beer could have been a sponsor? Would they have made it more obvious? The only time someone should break the beer is when they do this. It's a party to celebrate.
