What can I say about cruel intentions 2? Well, I can quite honestly say that I watch this movie again only when I'm attached to the chair and my eyes open in orange. <br /> <br /> Robin Dunne (No, I never heard about it), whose horrible impression of Ryan Phillipe made me shake. In the case of terrible casting, Dunne (and fails) is trying to play a charismatic, magic. As the actor is neither beautiful nor charismatic or charming, this character remains incredible. Amy Adams, (she was once in a buffer episode), is trying to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar was left behind and bring life to live Katherine ... But Adams is not such a good actor and her performance was flat and There is no real emotion, often he seemed to read smart cards directly from the camera. But there were two good actors in the film, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs. Kensington at the Austro authorities) made very good and fun performances as parents of Sebastian and Katherine and is the only reason why I rated the film as 2 rather than 1. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a poor version of the original, such low is a copy of the dialogue and copied scenes that lacked the originality of the previous movie. I think he could have worked as a TV show, but if it was updated with people who could actually act in the main parts.
