I saw interviews with Rob Schneider (who plays the leading role in this movie, Marvin Mange.) He said he wanted to emphasize physical comedy here so much that even if you had turned it off, you would laugh at this movie. Obviously, it must be a secret. I had the volume up. I actually listened to this thing and thought it was a disaster and totally sleepless - a big disappointment after Schneider's fun performance "Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo." <br /> <br /> The story is stupid: Mange is a big loser who dreams that he is a cop who, as a result of a full accident, is a crazy scientist with a number of animal transfers called Dr. Wilder (Michael Caton) and as a result he is losing control over the instincts of his animals. "It makes him a" supercop. "He can smell medications hidden in body cavities. Of course he also has a nasty habit of eating human cows and trying to attract his goats, but is that a small price to pay? It just didn't do anything for me." /> <br /> There was much to be cast in. Is there more irritating actors in Hollywood than John McGinley? Here he plays Sgt. Sisk, Mange Police Force, as a replicative comic character (much like the physically unexplained "Scrubs" TV series) I was interested in Colleen Haskell's first "serious" action (something in this movie can be called "serious?") Of course, she became a competitor on the first "Survivor" and she proves here what we knew about it: she is cute like a button. this is not to prove it is that he has a visible talent as an actor. And what Ed Edner is the police chief Wilson. I mean how old is this man? He is the size of some cows that Mange has he tried to eat, and he seemed out of the soul. I'm surprised he did this by filming. Finally, Adam Sandler (who was also its CEO) is a short cafe. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I smiled twice: Mange played a police car with his butterfly toys, and the scene with Schneider and Haskell and orangutan - orangutan has more action! So, for two women - 2/10.
