I knew that the movie was to be so bad that it was funny, so I went with that hope. I just found it to be so bad that it was bitterly boring. The captivating theme song is funny for about 10 seconds until you realize there's nothing smart except for deliberately irritating quality. Seeing things break with tomatoes, they grow old in about 30 seconds. There's just nothing smart or funny about the movie except for the premise. Maybe he might have a 3-4 minute comedy sketch, but it's not just imaginative imagination.
