This movie was worth five strokes on my "hurray". I saw it in the mid-1970s in Virginia. I saw it alone, so I didn't bother when I looked at it. It sucks. It was the most ridiculous cellulite waste I ever saw. <br /> <br /> I know others who have reviewed this movie have thought it was fantastic. I offer you this: if it were so fantastic, what was it? End of discussion.
