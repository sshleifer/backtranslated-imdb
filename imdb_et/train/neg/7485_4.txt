Thats a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese Neil Simon in Comedy. Where do you go wrong? Watch the movie and find out. <br /> <br /> Indeed, Martin, the leader, is wrongly cast. He does not make the big stroke he is known for, such as "The Jerk", but plays a kind of character that doesn't work. Hawn, who doesn't want to play, is terrible. Cleese is the only partially funny member. <br /> <br /> Up, the plot is pretty stupid. I can't say how much has changed, but the characters seem to be the least common sense. They break through New York, do nothing right and regret something funny. Not only is the whole assumption completely unbelievable, it seems to give a message that people who do not live in New York are not very bright, a repetitive theme throughout the film. <br /> <br /> All in all, without seeing it, rent the "Odd Couple" original again.
