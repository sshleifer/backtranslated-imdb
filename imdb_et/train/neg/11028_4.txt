At first, after determining that John Dillinger (Warren Oates) is a legitimate attacker, the second bandit of the 1930s is on the farm at an angle and is surrounded by the FBI. Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson) looks at the situation, puts a cigar illuminated in his mouth, pulls up two charged .45 caliber automation and pulls away a distant house alone. Bang, bang, bang. Purvis appears alone from the house, carrying a female hostage that is dead. Everything that has a long blow. <br /> <br /> If you like stories like Red Riding Hood, it should be significant. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's as exciting as it is pointless. Pretty Boy Floyd meets dramatically with his death. Multiple violations of civil code. Lots of shoot out with Tommy weapons and pistols. Blood over. <br /> <br /> History is stinky. Few remember Melvin Purvis as the FBI hero, partly because of his name. Melvin PURVIS? We all remember Mr Edgar Hoover, who fired Melvin Purvis because he was a race for public attention. <br /> <br /> Image is written and directed by John Milius. He is the man who wrote in his contract that if one of his creations were killed and killed, he should be a designated shooter. Milius is a boy, a blessing pistol who was the rough-rider of Teddy Roosevelt in the Spanish-American War, shouting Henry V's quotes - "Saint Crispin's Day" and all that. <br /> <br /> Exciting, yes, and complete garbage. "I knew I'd never take her alive, and I didn't try too hard." That means to kill everyone and let God look for them. <br /> <br /> You just love it.
