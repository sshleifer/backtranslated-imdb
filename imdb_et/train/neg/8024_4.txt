Sitting to see the Bachelor's 14th Season ("On the Wings of Love"), I knew I would be "interesting" for the time. I had followed some earlier seasons of undergraduate studies; watching an episode or two and missing the following three. I find that the bachelor's degree is often tempting and intriguing, although its quality and morals are often lacking. In Texas, to find true love, such as true love, that can be found in the seasonal reality-drama dating show. Jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country. He begins to get to know them a bit, but it is mostly superficial; How well do you know someone in a few minutes? Jake tries to know his true intentions from the very beginning, at least for the audience. He said he didn't just want love or good time, but he wanted a fianc√© or a wife. We can only assume that he has made it clear to women in the competition. If that is the case, it may explain to some extent some of the women's actions. Women are very competitive. Although they still don't know Jake, they are still there to win it, no matter what the price is. Threats, setbacks, and warnings "Follow!" all show that these women were not long. Jake noted that she was not only looking for sex but was looking for a "contact". But the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress Jake. Did they come to the manor with dirty dresses? either small or short. <br /> <br /> While some girls felt their beauty, others continued at this memo. One girl, Channy, noted that Jake was a "good man" to whom he could be a "naughty girl". He continued that Jake could land on his "runway at any time". She received a provocative statement from other girls that showed their situation. <br /> <br /> So, showing reality shows can't be so bad, right? In addition to the obvious problem of sexual attraction, there are other issues that show this seemingly harmless exhibition. Is it the right way to find a future companion; compete for someone's attention to extreme proportions? Unfortunately, what America has reduced today is joy and sex without commitment and little happiness on the side. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the premature emotional connection many girls have with Jake. Especially a couple of girls seemed too busy. One girl said, "If I don't get that first impression, it will kill me!" As mentioned earlier, they don't even know him yet and he talked about a specific rose, not just one of the 15 roses that was not removed. Michelle seemed to have some problems with Jake. Other girls also noticed it. After one outbreak of Michelle, Vienna claimed that Michelle had "a mental division and we have been here for only an hour." Michelle got her last rose at the first show in the evening? a narrowly missing disposal? and was very emotional about it. The other girls thought it was just ridiculous. Another girl shouted, but because she was eliminated. <br /> <br /> It started with Survivor and it just got off? Real TV. It shows our entertainment interests as a country; if we do not see the exhibitions or give them good ratings, network management would not continue. The only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that a sufficient portion of America is hooked. One thing is clear: America (generally) loves the reality TV and the accompanying traps. <br /> <br /> This puts me in doubt: why is it that we like reality TV? What is it that draws us to it? Is it because we see similarities with our own lives, or is it that we want to be sure we are more stable and less pathetic than others? Whatever that brings us to us, we should be careful about the media and entertainment that we would allow our thoughts to be fulfilled. I'm not saying that all reality TV shows are bad; I say, however, that we must evaluate each of them. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>
