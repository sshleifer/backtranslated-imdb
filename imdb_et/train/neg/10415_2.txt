2 stars out of 10 - and it's too generous. <br /> <br /> I was thinking of James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossetti, Jr, and Henry Thomas - how it could be. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only wonder what drugs Sam Shepard was at the end of the week when he slipped this piece. I suspected that Sam S. was such a nuts, this film, based on his game, confirms it. <br /> <br /> This is an artistic b.s. that the actors love to sink their teeth because it gives them the opportunity to endlessly emulate. But for the viewer who sits through this meaningless trash, there is no love for this movie. <br /> <br /> You have not seen dysfunctional families until you have seen this cluster. Pa is crazy, I'm crazy, son is crazy and daughter is, oh yeah, crazy. They also have a mouth that sounds like words that would make a seaman's blush, especially a teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> In addition to the above, as it would not be enough, the plot - and it is so thin that you could read carefully - is an Alaska-sized hole. <br /> <br /> I have agreed to sell a sold farm. As it turns out, this is Pa. Now I do not claim to be a real estate expert, but the last time I checked it, the joint-ownership property must have both the owner's signatures to sell them. If only one of them belonged to the property, the other could not legally sell it, so it would be pointless to do so. Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact, so his scheme doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Nothing else really worked. <br /> <br /> The only possible reason why someone might be watching this movie is if they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods full of foreskin and I can't imagine why anyone would want it.
