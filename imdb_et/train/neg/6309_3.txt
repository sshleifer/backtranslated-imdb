This film had good intentions and a good story. The director and scriptwriter of this film failed and created a boring, boring film tape that made me feel like I was back in Mr Hartford's 8th grade social science class - back back 67. <br /> <br /> Waste, would anyone take this story and do a true movie about it - this story deserves it. <br /> <br /> Every time we had a scene, all we had was some clich√©s with black and white film material that they probably show in the history channel during the channel. Disgraceful. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis was the only bright light in this boredom. The second act was incredibly boring - it fits well with the film and the captain played a new low-level line to deliver. <br /> <br /> However, if you are willing to accept all the numerous mistakes in the movie and are not worried about being scared or entertained but wanting to know about the USS mason, you should look at it.
