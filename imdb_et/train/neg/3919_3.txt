This movie is not as good as everyone thinks. the actors are low and the story is very comic. I respect fantasy, but the Lord of the Rings is a fantasy ... Conan..is fantasy ... This is just normal HK-LOWPRICE ENTERTAINMENT ... Why they contained this splitting language, it makes everything worse. The only good thing is cinematography and cutter work.
