Cartoon Network seems desperate for ratings. Starting with the withdrawal of Samurai Jack, the network seemed hellbent to remove all such popular exhibitions as Powerpuff Girls, Dexter Lab, Dragonball Z etc. When the ratings began to fall, CN started some beautiful mediocre exhibitions. While Total Drama Island / Action and Chowder stand out for their wise writing and audiences' pleasing tricks, there are many other exhibitions that are either terribly remaking (George of the Jungle) or robbing other exhibitions, such as The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack, where the title character works like Spongebob, and then there's the Johnny Test, which is a substitute for the Dexter Laboratory, though it's much more than anything. <br /> <br /> The characters in the show are clearly derived from the Dexter Laboratory, only this time focusing on the character of Johnny, the blonde (or hot hair) who torments his twin sister, Susan and Mary, who just look at HAPPEN like Dexter, with orange hair, that glasses, impossible technology. There is even a rival genius called Bling Bling Boy or Eugene who seems to be sitting for Mandark. Then Dookie, Johnny's best friend and talking dog, one Dexter ... I mean, Susan and Mary's early attempts. <br /> <br /> The Dexter Laboratory was probably one of the best cartoons on television. but an effective art style, a lovable protagonist and episodes that do not seem to be long drags. Johnny Test is a lot different. The style of art here is not nearly as pleasant. In fact, it seems totally terrible. The characters have motivation that makes them really annoying or repulsive. Just like most of the series include Johnny and Dookie's attempts to destroy a neighboring girl, Sissy, whom Johnny likes to secretly, or the twins' obsession with a sister's boy. Seeing that these two geniuses fell into the abs and with the eye that Johnny seems to be someone you never want to associate with, there is no real connection between the viewer and the characters. <br /> <br /> One of the things that the series strongly uses to name it is that Johnny is a guinea pig for these experiments. They range from Johnny fat, ugly, monster, and even woman. Twins help Johnny in any scheme he plans for his services. Every time it is a "win / win" deal, it usually comes back and those that do not come completely out of the rail never end satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> Writing ranges from an average to terrible. The "fat" episode is repeated: "This is Phat with PH. What is a line that should never be repeated, especially if the episode seems PROMOTIVE to obesity in children because Johnny becomes a famous star with money and video games, just becoming fat. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about how this show won't let Dexter Lab off completely. The exhibition captures a lot of characters, two black and black Mr. Black and Mr White, a military captain, who seem to need all his problems, has been solved by Johnny and his sisters, and a lot of super-villains, even though even here, this exhibition steals ideas for other sources such as Mr Freeze's teenage clone, a bad cat with a butler who wants a cat to rule over a man (like Powerpuff, a bad talking cat) Girls), bumblebee maniac, trio of evil skater "dudes" and even Mole Man, which is probably the most clich√© of the media. <br /> <br /> Up all this, with your ugly animation and unlikely characters, the voice is acting either satisfactory (like the votes of Mr Black and Mr White) just for ear splitting (at the show of Johnny, Dookie and almost every criminal). The theme song seems to be the only memorable thing in this show, but then it was just a few episodes that were just about the band that destroyed it. <br /> <br /> So finally, Johnny Test is not a good comic. His horrible references and jokes about teenage culture demolish the interest of small children in the show, while its bright colors, ripped characters and dragging episodes violate the teenage experience. It is just one of them that shows that the Cartoon Network is over-advertising to trick people (like MTV rap). If you need to show what will satisfy your children for half an hour, then you should be better off with Spongebob because Johnny Test is a more patience test than anything else.
