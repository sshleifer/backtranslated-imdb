Understand that I'm watching the movie I've seen. I understand that almost all nudity and gore were cut from this movie so that it was completely sterilized. If you see names like Ginger Lynn and Jenna Jameson, I knew I wasn't going to get horror, but at least I waited for free gifts and bloodshed. But no, it must be the most busy contemporary horror movie, I mean it's easy to say that certain scenes are much more, but they suddenly cut off, or the scene ends completely at the beginning. How does someone turn to cannibal and porn stars? I mean, this is a winning formula, it makes me wonder if the director is sleeping with some management's wife or something because it is literally amazing how much it was cut. Reading it a couple of years ago in Fangoria, I was excited, it seemed like a fun movie, but unfortunately the real movie is locked somewhere in the treasury and we have to endure this piece of evil left behind. Hopefully, for a while, an undervalued cut will be released, because I think there is a good film in this confusion, but until then, the twelve packs of Bud, the only way through this film, will be the best.
