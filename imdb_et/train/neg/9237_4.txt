Stalker is right! Girl sees boy, girl wants guy, girl develops daily ways to worship her, girl leaves her alone, girl pretends to be patient, girl can't talk about her, girl pretends to love another man (or two), she doesn't pay attention to her, because she's annoying, girl STILL doesn't leave her alone. Drake's character might have been amazing, but he's completely unreliable when he strives for Cary Granti's character, his girlfriends are bored, and unfortunately, Drake's play, "charmingly screwed" comes out, "annoyingly demented." Grant himself, as usual, is good for Cary, but it's as close to the caller as I've ever seen him. The direction is weak and the dialogue is just dim. <br /> <br /> Screwball comedy is very difficult to do successfully and if it fails, like this intermittent experiment, it just stinks. Worse still, Drake spends the entire movie, which needs a lot of Valium and a restrictive order. It destroys humor in this dryer as a mummy dust relic.
