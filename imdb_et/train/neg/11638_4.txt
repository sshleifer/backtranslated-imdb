"The Blood of Blood" is the third part of Gabriel Knight's games, a series of adventure games concerning the writer / paranormal detective, Gabriel Knight. Prince James of Albania has asked Gabriel and his companion Grace to investigate several mysterious attacks by so-called night-time visitors. When Prince James's son is kidnapped, Gabriel continues his night visit to Rennes le Ch창teau, where he begins a secret about the Holy Holy Grail. <br /> <br /> Despite being marketed, this game is not a vampire. Vampires have a symbolic appearance in the game, but never in a central stage, such as voodoo hounfor in "fathers sins" or "butterfly inside". Gabriel and Grace do not try to detect the true nature of vampires and do not investigate vampires. Although vampires kill three people during the game, their victims are randomly selected and have nothing to do with the main plot. <br /> <br /> A large part of the first two Gabriel Knight contributions were related to the relationships Gabriel and the Rogues had. Through these relationships, the player did not receive the spouse, but the villain became a human and less monster. But in the "Holy Blood", Gabriel's only communication with the villain is through a cheesy interview that does nothing to anger the player. <br /> <br /> The roles of Gabriel and Grace in this puzzle are quite pointless. Gabriel spends his time on the identity of the treasure hunt group members at his hotel, but what he discovers is nothing more than red herring. Grace spends her time exploring the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau, but her entire research becomes superfluous when an amazing ally is born, who has known this mystery for centuries. <br /> <br /> The action of this amazing action ally and its polar counterpart - the vampire leader - is unsupported. The ally gives clues to the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau in the sunlight and expects Grace (and not other tourist treasurers) to find them. But on Day 1 he could have published Grace's secret as a whole instead of putting the kidnapped child at risk for an additional 48 hours. Finally, he simply tells Grace the whole mystery. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the vampire leader will not be able to achieve centuries-long goals because he decides to refrain from taking action after two days. abduction of a child. The only reason he decided to act is that he wants to enjoy his victory. <br /> <br /> The game would have been much better than focusing solely on the Holy Grail. The robbery and vampires should have been abandoned, replaced by a race against the Vatican to discover the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau. Because Gabriel is depicted more than once as a reluctant Catholic, this conflict would have had many opportunities for character development. <br /> <br /> All in all, the game was disappointing in the series, despite the improved interface and Tim Curry's return as Gabriel Knight's voice.
