I find very little to say about this movie. I am sure that the idea and script were good on paper, but I am afraid that filmography and acting are not the standards I can expect from some very talented people. I doubt this is very good in my CV filmography. Michael Caine from time to time appeared in his doctoral tree and I never believe in my character. The plot was incredible, especially for the victims' son. Some scenes reminded other films that sometimes I was wondering if it was actually a junkie. Sometimes the light was in the dark, and it felt like watching a movie with a small budget with a few big names, wondering why I looked at it at all.
