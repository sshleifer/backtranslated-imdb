When I saw the previews of this movie, I thought it might be stupid, but it's at least funny. Well, I was wrong. Although somewhere deeply, the producers were sending out an interesting message to leave their parents alone and re-evaluate their lives, the way they delivered that message was terrible. The first fifty times foolish for the couple was quite funny. But finally, I can almost predict which foolish misfortune will happen next. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, I only like five dialogues and everything else was in the best middle, which is even more than I say about myself.
