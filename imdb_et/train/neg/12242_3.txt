I was expecting a bad movie and got a bad movie. But I couldn't really imagine how bad the film was in my worst fantasy. I don't even want to try to explain what Blood Surf is. Not talking about surfing the blood, but a big crocodile. They complain about the false jaws, but Spielberg was smart and didn't show up until the end of shark. Here the crocodile is shown many times and it's the worst fake crocodile I've ever seen, and they're not trying to hide it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile, Lake Placid. The director had the opportunity to make a decent surf / shark movie, but he had to make a bad b-monster movie. He had the opportunity to make an original surf film, but he wanted to make a monster movie. So you understand how bad this movie is, has some good parts? Not really, it got some nudity and sex game that is taken straight from the playboy movie. The actor is also not half bad and Kate Fischer looks good. Too bad he doesn't take him off. The main participants are also not bad. They had some potential. The location was beautiful and the film began with good, beautiful surfing scenes. The indictment is an unforgiving writer and director. Dialogue is some of the worst I've ever seen, and the script is really badly written and the director didn't get the talent that was ever so, and not the big fantasy. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it. Even if you want to look at the beautiful Kate Fischer. It's not worth it. Look at the sirens to look at Kate's naked, and look at Lake Placid if you want a good crocodile. <br /> <br /> 3/10 because I'm in a good mood and Maureen Larrazabal looks good and Kate looks good. (but this is a bad actor) and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi did a good job they had to work on.
