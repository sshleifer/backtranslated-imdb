This movie was sold for one dollar on a Wal-Mart DVD and I don't feel like losing that movie except my time. He enjoyed Tom Hanks' (Robbie Wheeling) action, who was very young and gave excellent performance, given that it was a terrible script. The story is for students who decided to play Mazes & Monsters in a very realistic environment. Robbie Wheeling has had problems with playing in other colleges in the past, and parents are advised to leave the game and get good grades. Robbie meets a very nice gal and has a romantic escape with him and when he starts playing, he stops love and acts like a monk. There are some scenes in the film that travel around the former World Trade Center and the observation deck and the roof area. It is quite sad looking at this part of the film where so many people are dead due to the evil of the world. This is not a very good movie, except Tom Hanks, who is trying to keep the film above the level of entertainment.
