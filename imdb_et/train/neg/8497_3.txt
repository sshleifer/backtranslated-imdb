My title should be enough. <br /> <br /> It disturbs me that the literary top culture is so rich (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant), such as the cinematographic movement of "nouvelle vague". Until the 20th century, France had a great tradition of artistic clarity and clever philosophy. But the moment you start them with a movie camera, they start like WOOOHOOO LOOK HOW WEDD I CAN BE! SYKE? Topic? PSHAW! LET'S FILM AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE & ROUND! At least this is not as bad as Godard (who has an unhealthy charm behind the heads of nations. Oh-la-la, quel artists.). No, Truffaut retains some visual clarity. However, the camera makes the camera fast. Two are indistinguishable. <br /> <br /> Haha, the same aside for all you worship at the movie school nerds: I bet the vein is now opening at your neck. But don't leave the last sentence of my review countless. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you like French literature, you hate it. People who like this movie have probably never read any books other than Jack Kerouac or the "Hitchhiker Galaxy Guide". Or maybe they have read the words for The Doors songs and they think it is moving in depth. Regardless of what floats on the boat. I find it ironic that this film puts some (weak) hints on Balzac, one of the best and most meaningful writers who ever lived. Nice to try, truffles. But you're not near the ball park. <br /> <br /> Avoid using this movie as an anti-syringe. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who likes to think, then stick to Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and Japanese masters Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara (SUNA NO ONNA ). <br /> <br /> If you're an idiot, enjoy your Truffaut, Godard and Andy Worhol. For the sake of fading, push this vein back into the neck. You look like cabbage.
