This movie was with me. The title was perhaps the biggest idea I heard. I thought it was an independent film about the zombie outbreak and their aspirations to take over the US and individuals, the band together and plan to take out the zombies. DEATH ERROR! It is about a psycho policeman who has a weakness to kill his female arrests coming to him when zombie women offer the right revenge on their graves. As you can see, there is nothing in this country or county. Where to start with this cinematic catastrophe, the gravity of our nation. <br /> <br /> First of all, zombie women look like the Victoria Secret models with dark eyeliners and a pale face. What are zombies, but a meaningless, controversial intelligent, cannibalistic killing machine that eats for these primitive most basic needs? These zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models, they talk about how they would be in the poor movie noir movie and not they act like real zombies. Certainly there is eating and killing, but where is the pointless and terrible dysfunction? While this is a very interesting concept and maybe a big satire of zombie genre, he makes this genre fun and asks, "Why can't zombies be nice vixen killers?" I would say that this movie is considered to be a really bad indie film produced and made from a garage. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who loves zombie genres too much, it is insulting and as scary?
