a friend gave it to me, saying it was another classic like "Debbie Dallas". Somewhere near. I think my main complaint concerns the most unpleasant actor in the porn industry. Even more terrible is that he is on the screen almost all the time. But I read somewhere that these days porn had to have an "artistic" value. I couldn't find it, though. See it only if you are interested in the mainstream of pornography development, or you can rate movies in porn movies. I know I'm not. But the film's director seems to be a talented person. He even tried to get permission from Simon & Garfunkel to use his songs. Of course, they rejected it.
