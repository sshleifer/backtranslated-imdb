It's funny. I've seen a number of Fassbinder movies and I've found that some are extremely creative and interesting, while others are disgusting and self-confusing - like this movie. For me, it goes from a big mess - without much in the middle. I know he has a lot of fans among "complicated" but I can't help but I think a lot of his complaint is a pure leap. From my point of view (and I know I get a lot of negative reviews on it), he made too many movies too fast and was too self-conscious. His homosexual or sexually sensitive films (like this) tend to be really bad - sloppy, sometimes quite boring (like QUERELLE and PETRA VON KANT BITTER TEARS) and sometimes just gross (like this movie). Wouldn't his message about accepting a person's gender confusion be better if he showed him that he was caught up in a cow's death? Show sensitivity to the subject and make your characters more humane and sympathetic - then, maybe, I care about movies. <br /> <br /> I have honestly been watching this movie that I may not work on Fassbinder movies anymore - it seems to be a good weight.
