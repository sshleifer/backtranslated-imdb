In fact, the adaptation of Marc Blitzstein's "Threepenny" broadband was not "bowdlerized" as is generally believed. <br /> <br /> (I have a special interest in "Threepenny"; my father was part of the first full production in the US, this was done by U Illlinois Guild at the end of World War II, HJitler was so close to playing that they had a script Reconstruct and save in two different languages ​​(not English), a German helper's script, and similar sources.) Blitzstein's adaptation - not a "translation" that was fully endorsed by Lotte Lenya was much closer to the original than was generally thought. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the version most people know is a MGM cast recording (recently available on CD) (which includes Beatrice Arthur, like Lucy, "a great full girl", and can I does not see his hand on his hips and shoulders was thrown back on that line - Bea was a big child of the 50s, Paul Dooley and John Astin) was Mens Curb, head of MGM Records, was heavily censored - I mean 17 (I think was) "Goddamn" got cut just "fucking". <br /> <br /> (at once, MGM also offered a 2-LP kit * for a full * game, no doubt so censored.)
