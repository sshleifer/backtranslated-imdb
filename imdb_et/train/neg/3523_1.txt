Oh, what's bad, bad, very bad movie! Sylvester Stallone's main and main department, which should have been sufficient and with too many climbing views, dizziness, falling and scene-chewing and botched air travel. There are two plots, both flat. One is related to the traumatic unsuccessful rescue and the other is to the bad people who crush the aircraft, and killing, if possible, kills different innocent people. Usually a trusted John Lithgow, perhaps the frustrating product of the product, has been reduced and called to those he doesn't care about "Bostid!" uneven alignment of the English accent. Janine Turner, who was terribly and mysterious when she played Maggie at the North Exposure, is unfortunately wasted on the rescue area and the pilot. Stallone is strong and muscular. There are no dead lines in it. There are also no live lines.
