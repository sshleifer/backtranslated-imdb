I was looking for a copy of the forest because I was looking at a special VH1, I think "Where are they now" and I saw a flash box over the screen during actor Corky Pigeon's segment. He played in this horrible male horror ghost of the B horror, but I remember him in his television show Freddyst Silver Spoons. This flick is a big drop. There's nothing here. In fact, it took four months to look at it from start to finish. I stopped it as boredom, putting it aside and forgetting it, then stumbled upon it and tried to get it through again. Of course, the angle of this film, which was meant to separate it from colleagues, was a supernatural element, manifestations. And apparently it doesn't work here. I can't stand males. I was waiting for them to look at their palms during a longer dialogue scenes to read the scams. In the beginning, the situation where couples decide to go for a separate camping is uncomfortable and stupid. I think the only positive thing to say about this is the scene where the boy falls and breaks his leg, you see the bone sticking out of your flesh. There's a pretty good gore makeup. Man, I really get to the positive side now. The only other non-budget horror movie at the level it would be at home, home.
