This is really new entertainment. Even if there are many worse films. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to convince convincing events in the genre of the gangster / drug scene (this film does not mean, for example, that Sebastian's motives cannot be more distanced and clich√©.) Then you would also need the characteristic relationships that are plausible ( this movie is not.) <br /> <br /> Are you sure Tristan is away from his family, but why was that? What is his father doing again to leave his age? an interesting picture, however, is to ask how children are rebellious in the upper class family. But this movie is not going in that direction. Although it would be possible to judge from a random setback. Wasn't he already off and out, why would he do it again? So here are some interesting questions to create a drama of definite social criticism (but again this movie is not simply because it focuses on "cool" production methods and special effects that don't give the characters a moment that reflects and most importantly compels the story along the way where they are they want to do it, and don't pay attention to the breath of breath and naturally develop.) <br /> <br /> He wants to be drama not to respect substance abuse and violence (would these days be political wrong, right?) but on the other hand is not something other than an inexpensive action movie (as there is so much) with an average number of actors and Vinnie Jones who can't completely destroy their reputation by doing what he always does. <br /> <br /> So at all I just can't recommend it. br /> <br /> 1 for Vinnie and 2 for editing.
