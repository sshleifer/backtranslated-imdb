If ever there was a call for a bad film that reflected how stupid humanity could change, it would take the prize. At the center of the plot are the Bible prophecies that are hidden in the hidden messages of the scriptures, inviting the group's seekers to try the full control of the world. Just how stupid does this writer believe people really are? <br /> <br /> Action was at best bad. Casper Van Dien wasted his talent in making this movie. Michael York's work was fair for this role because he was the centerpiece of the film and did a good job. <br /> <br /> This plot was sick and very disturbing. This movie should not be seen with offers or immature thoughts. This way, the bottom can mislead the good and the evil plot. <br /> <br /> There are many mental illnesses around the film circles looking for ways to market this type of spam. There must be something censored to get a PG-13 rating, but it was still terrible.
