It didn't have any big stars on this film, but it had a great glasses full of great supporters and Gene Tierney before she became a big star. George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwicke are waiting for the film more than they actually did. Most of this is suspected because of the second-level script, because director Henry Hathaway was a competent and well-established man. <br /> <br /> The film is in East Africa during World War II. Just before the Americans fought. The British are trying to control their African colonies, while the Nazi fissile element seeks to cause problems among local people. One of the white men in the film is a double dealer working for the destruction of the British Empire! But lovely Tierney, who plays sultan's daughter (!), Helps to save a good UK day. <br /> <br /> American filmmakers have long seen many empire films with the empire on one side and the 1930s and 40s. Nowadays it has become a ridiculous idea, with the sensitivity, that happy black natives die for the queen and the country - and it is difficult for both sides to root! Nonetheless, this propaganda piece during this day was effective in drumming British support - although it seems today that the film has a long-term script and stupid casting. One bright moment in the movie is the final showdown between George Sanders and the enemy representative. Too bad after such a strong scene, it seemed that the film was just talking and talking - losing part of its punch.
