you have a strong stomach. Holden was only 55 years old when he was filming, but he was close to the 70's and lived for another 8 years. At one point, Holden said, "I'm over twice the age." Okay, try a triple grandfather! The "old enough to be old enough to be your father" topic they did not work on. Some older people sometimes get rid of legal teens. More power for them, but that doesn't mean I want to watch it. This is not a judgment but a question of the digestive tract. I like my food to which it belongs. Lenz is fun to watch and, because of the 70s cars, clothing, furniture, etc., it is worth it if it's a cable late at night and you want to watch something to bed. It would have been nice to see Lenz's blonde who gave the guitar more scenes. Quiet room ... Who was this chick? I'm trying to find out.
