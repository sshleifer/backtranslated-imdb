My husband and I went to watch this movie, being our horror movie. Two hours later I found myself both money and time back. I was so disappointed. The teasers of this movie mainly contained the best points in the movie. There was nothing more terrifying than the good timing of the entrances to the astonishment. After watching movies made by other Japanese writers, I have to conclude that what is considered scary in Japan is not what scares us in the United States. My advice: If you are a fan of real horror movies, save yourself from sitting down. I can't really say that I would recommend renting it if you don't have a free rental.
