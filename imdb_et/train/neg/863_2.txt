I understand that I look at the horror of the Euro, especially the films made by Jess Franco, the Light of Light, that you can't expect a lot of thought. But Franco has traveled with this film; and despite the surreal atmosphere and the reputation of the film as one of the directors, Succubus is unfortunately a really terrible movie. I have to admit that I saw an American cut version that lasts about 76 minutes; but if it was not just the logic that was cut, I'm sure the longer European version is just as boring. The plot has something to do with a woman who laughs; practicing S & M and talking about garbage and it's all boring. There is no gore and sex is boring and most of the running time is a boring dialogue and despite being a short film; I had trouble getting to the end. I have to say that the places look good and Franco has done a good job of using the surreal atmosphere; but the positive elements end there. Jess Franco is definitely a talented director who has done some classic trash - but it seems to be what he did for money, and I generally recommend skipping it and seeing some of the director's more interesting work.
