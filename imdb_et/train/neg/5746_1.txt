Currently the most common movie! I love zombie movies and saw it on a used shelf, so I was wondering why not? Oh my god shame zombie movies and fans genre! Anyone who made this movie must take their camcorder and go to the film school! There are so many gore hounds who have put the time and effort into their films and have something that this film doesn't deserve. I know what it takes to make movies, and I'm sure that it took a lot of money and time to create a meat market, but none of that money and time went to it. You need actors, script, real camera, invest in books, how to make independent movies. I don't know how you have a DVD, but who did it is either a really good friend or bounces your head on the wall. In Gore movies, quality is not quantity, the effect is weak! I was so angry that it was actually in stores and that I didn't get my money back. Please, if you've seen this movie written here and finish. I know I'm very tough, I only had 10 lines, so I'm trying to reach the point.
