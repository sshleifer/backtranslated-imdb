Suffice it to say that - in spite of the strange ridiculous panning of their so-called. The "talents" posted here - the head of this intuition, the nasty tosh hasn't made the movie. Well, that's great news as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br /> Dead Babies has a full bodybuilder, but it doesn't have the wisdom and technical skills to make Martin Amis writer readable. When will the British film industry wake up and realize that if it wants to regain its status, it should stop producing garbage and do something real for the real people who really want to watch it? <br /> <br /> Avoid like a plague.
