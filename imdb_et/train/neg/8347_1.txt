The title should have been "Walker". It was only he walked. <br /> <br /> There was nothing good in the movie. The description of the film does not correspond to reality. <br /> <br /> The only thing I get from the movie is that he was a good son, but a low-life terrible person. <Br>> <br /> I'm sorry to spend my money and time on this film. I saw people who left the theater in the middle of the movie. I was hoping it would be better ... what's wrong. I'm worse. <br /> <br /> If there is a suggestion I can give him a producer, he will have to divert his life, because making a movie is definitely not his cup
