I love science fiction, I am fascinated by Egyptian mythology and I appreciate digital animation. I thought the film that would combine these three would be at least enjoyable. I couldn't have been more wrong: the story (or the lack of it) was completely endless and there is no imagination - although imagination is usually the biggest component of any scientific literature. Dialogue and action is even worse than the average porn movie. In particular, Thomas Kretschmann gives a new meaning to the term "bad power". Bad behavior would not have been such a big problem if only the 'director' Bilal didn't take himself so seriously; all the lines as they should be poetic, it seems that Bilal really thinks he has made a work of art here. Well, this junk doesn't just have art or think, but a pretense! This man really should stick to making comics because he is not able to be a leader on all possible accounts. The worst thing is the terrible digital animation that is so ugly that watching a movie becomes a physically painful experience. Graphics are so fake that even "Van Helsing" werewolves look like living actors! And since half of the characters are CGI animated, it is quite a problem that the CGI effects are so fake. When the Egyptian gods actually exist, the dead man of Bilal, for they will undoubtedly take him in a ridiculous way against awful revenge.
