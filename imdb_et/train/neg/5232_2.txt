Becky Harris plays a female shopper whose misfortune is to stay in the shop at the wrong time and obviously ONLY to be in this movie is to give reason to wear remote controls! Miss Harris seems to me to be her fifties or older when she first arrives. When a red-haired thug is done with him, it turns out that this is not the queen of AARP. If these are not some of the best assets that have ever been shown in celluloid, I want someone to hint at me. Absolutely amazing in my opinion and I literally wore a copy of my VHS that saved his charms. I would like to know if this movie is available on DVD. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is not really worth mentioning. I was hoping to see something quite convincing and intelligent, but I was disappointed in both parts. God Blesses Becky Harris!
