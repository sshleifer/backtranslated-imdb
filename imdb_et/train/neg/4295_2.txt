This is another frustrating and boring film about AIDS and tragedy. It starts very uneven and predictable and continues throughout the film. I was waiting for it to pick up, but unfortunately it didn't. Operation is fair, but the script needs a lot of work. And if you are looking for nudity, don't waste your time with those not so hot participants. Due to poor sound quality and lack of captions, I missed the 1/8 movie. If you have never seen more than five gay movies or have recently reached gay, then this movie may be interesting, otherwise it will be your low budget movie. This is one of the worst homophiles I've ever seen.
