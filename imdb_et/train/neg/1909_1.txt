One of the worst romantic comedies I've ever seen. The boy (who works as a psychic on the phone!) Must pretend to be with his wife of dreams in the apartment. No fun. Boredom, easy gay-bashing and terrible dialogue. When you read Brad Meltzer and like his dirty dialogue, he likes this movie. <br /> <br /> Be smart. Avoid this. if you see it, destroy this copy.
