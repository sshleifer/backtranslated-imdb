I want to give this movie from scratch. Before opening this movie the day after it appeared, I came to IMDb to review the comments. The commentary called the film to be predictable and terrible with terrible dialogue. I never go to other people's opinions, so I wasted seven dollars. It had to be one of the WORST movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The scriptwriter should be pulled out of the shore. When are scary movies with nice scenes? I swear I am surprised that there were no moments in GROUP HUG ^ - ^. <br /> <br /> I think I jumped. One time. And because I was out, I was thinking of my English study. Clogs, birds / cats open somewhere if you did something. <br /> <br /> The characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost laughed when the alarm stopped and the protagonist said, "I have my mother's towel !!!" You. Idiot. Turn the towel! Safety is just a few steps away, but NO, my mother's towel (which by the way did not fit the dress) is WAYYYY more important than my health and safety. And when all this is turned off, they take back their house knowing that the killer knew where he lived. My friend and I also predicted the ENTIRE movie. And not only, I'll put her under the bed for moments. It was, "he stole the watch from the cloakroom and slipped out of the hotel" and "it's a detective coming down the corridor, not a killer!" a moment. Movies should never be predictable. Disney movies are not even predictable. <br /> <br /> I will finish my bead now, saying it was a terrible movie. I'm glad I went to see it in theaters, so I'm not buying it for $ 15.00 and then I hate it. It was just bad. It would have been better if only one thing had happened. If the killer had fallen into the same position after shooting the detective, he went inside. A knife in his hand, falling and stroking a girl. Oh, how cute it would have been. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money. Go see a good movie.
