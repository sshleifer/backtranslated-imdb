I wanted to like this movie, but many of the items destroyed it for me. Using a fisheye lens throughout and uncomfortable editing didn't give me the feeling that I was in the world of methodology, but it made me think I was watching MTV for a few short moments. The film never seemed to go anywhere and acting was a truly excellent example of overall action. I love movies that give us a glimpse of the poor underworld, but this film could not decide whether it was a bad horror movie or even worse a serious comment on the horror of addiction.
