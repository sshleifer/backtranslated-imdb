I'm blunt and point. This movie is not good at all. My film filter hated actress, script, story, direction and almost all editing. Amanda Peet has proved she can act because she was "the whole nine yard". So he should have avoided this movie with the ten-foot pole. But my part of my childhood found this movie very funny. If you forget how the production quality is low, and if you find jokes, you should be fine. And for you, who can't get off your pedestal, it's your choice. My inner child is not dead and I laughed fairly. Even then, only three out of ten, because as a film it's really smelly.
