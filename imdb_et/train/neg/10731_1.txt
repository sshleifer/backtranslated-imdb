The film is basically the story of a Russian prostitute returning to his homeland for a sister / friend's funeral. There are still some minor rows that could actually be more interesting than taken, but they have not been fully explored. The core of the movie is funeral, awakening and later contradictions about the future of the crown community, which make dolls and sell them for the purchase of vodka, but now they have lost an artist who made their dolls marketable. Apparently the film is unchanged. The Prostitute Route from the Village to the Village is a striking and endless train ride and tramp through the mud. Maybe it should impress us enormously on the Russian landscape. In the village, as it is, there is a widow and one man, a dead girl's consortium. The continuation of the business of dolls is problematic for all parties and seems to be impossible at last. Most of the film is on the camera, which can cause nausea. Another problem for Western viewers is that subtitles do not contain crown songs or songs. Don't go to this movie if you're not Russian.
