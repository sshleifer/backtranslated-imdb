Haunted Boat sells itself as "The Fog" corresponds to "Open Water". In many cases, this is correct. Fears and strange looking people are interesting. <br /> <br /> But the ability to act is at best bad. Showing clear signs that it's just a bunch of friends who make a horror movie. Either is the best of their ability. If you accept a low budget, it is very difficult for special effects because ghosts look pretty much like men with rubber masks. <br /> <br /> Many aspects of the movie are horrible and strange. But it suffers from using too many twists in a short period of time that leaves you with boredom and confusion. With your awakening, the film keeps it very well. By ignoring the irrelevant twist every 5 seconds to the end, you really want to know what's going on. And is ready to wait 1 hour 35 minutes for the peak. <br /> <br /> This is not a Ghost Ship, but it will definitely make the evening for T.V.
