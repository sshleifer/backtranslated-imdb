OK, it's got 2 to be one of the worst excuses in the 4 movie that I've ever been unsuccessful. Like all other Olsen twins films, except New York's minute, there was no story on this movie, plot holes, dirty behavior and bad filming even !!!!!!!!! if you have not guessed yet, I hate MARY KATE AND ASHLEY !!!!!! The only reason I watched it was that I was really bored and there was nothing else. I don't know if the twins will ever stop making the same stereotypical movies where they have an incredibly stupid adventure in an exotic location and save the day with the help of two cute boys who will immediately hit them. At least they could be a boy 4 1 of them or they both would fall 4 same men. The plot of this story was so ghostly and just dark. even a toddler saw some drawbacks in it. Maybe they should share and start creating movies separately or perhaps movies that have a different story. Everyone who liked this film was not offensive - really stupid, really artificial or not really a good movie. or maybe they are really smart and just have bad movie movies. whether I wouldn't want this movie for my worst nobility for a good movie experience .. the only thing that is good 4 is some rib-splitting laughter who's pathetic attempts to be cool. if you look laugh, it's fun. basically I give him 0 or less.
