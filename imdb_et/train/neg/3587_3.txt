How they get Joe Don Baker (like Bufford Pusser in the first stage) to Bo Svenson (like Bufford Pusser in the second order). Why did they do it. Just because Bo Svenon looks more like Bufford Pusser The reason for this change was that the first order was Joe Don Baker as Bufford Pusser and one thing I wanted to see in a different order. <br /> <br /> I would have given this movie to 7 out of 10 and I would have given it to 1 out of 10 if the story wasn't about Bufford Pusser's life, but he did it and why I was I have given 3 out of 10 movies. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that anyone who plans to look at this cheese would not recommend and look at the first sequel instead.
