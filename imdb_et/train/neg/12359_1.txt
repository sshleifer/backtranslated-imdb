I thought it was a really terrible movie - I found myself screaming a few times with my TV. One or both gay male leaders were wrong; there was no chemistry between them and Richard Ruccolo seemed to kiss the dog. The film covers their long and tortured treatment, highlighting every break and make-up, but does not give any details in any detail. These reasons would change interesting characters, not struggle or make-up in the bed (flat even when the movie was liked). <br /> <br /> Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine as their characters, but it doesn't rent the movie. Save your money.
