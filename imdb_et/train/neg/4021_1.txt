This is probably the worst film ever made that Roger Corman has to do with it. I could have understood this in my first years when he had lower budgets, but there are no excuses for giving birth today! I'm a "B" movie perverted, and some of the ordinary viewers watch out for all my beloved flicks, but I'll take the word about it, the Vampire club is at the top of my worst list It's hard to imagine vampires without fangs, music score is totally inappropriate, the sound effects are not just effective and eventually Mr Savage does not seem to know that he is in a vampire film. because he had a career against everyone. Let me know that I'm hard for this reason if I don't like the movie I tend to forget.
