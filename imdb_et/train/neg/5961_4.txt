It was all around with slashers around 88 so it was time for the cheese to rip off their older movies. The brain is well done, the script reminded me of a video rhythm, but then in a more chewy way as I said before. The operator can go through it. But it is an effect that makes you laugh, the so-called brain is really turkey and blood is never shown. The order of opening is what makes watching this movie valuable, hallucinations are really nicely done and reminded me of Nightmare on Elm Street, remember that the phone is alive. For all the freaks, it is visible because there is no gore there and, as has been said, there is no blood there, but there is nudity for the pervers. I've seen worship movies like this, but wanted them to have blooded it ...
