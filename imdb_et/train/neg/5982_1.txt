I'm very sorry to say that, but Thunderbirds doesn't even come with a loud pop, never a thunderstorm. At one stage, I was serious about going out of the movie, losing hope for the film to heal. I was disappointed, it didn't get better, it worsened if at all possible. If I had gone to the movie to think it was "spam", I would still have downloaded it. They had a great opportunity to make movies into a big franchise, they have wasted this opportunity completely. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be embarrassed to add names to this film and Jonathan Frakes well what I say he should be embarrassed and not be ashamed of the truth. I saw this during the release of the movie, I was expecting it most eagerly, having grown up in the sixties with original examples. To say that I was disappointed would be something inaccurate. One of the last things I say about the film was the TV dolls just a bit of wood as the actors in the movie.
