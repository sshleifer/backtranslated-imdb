Drones, ethnic drums, bad synthesizers, singing children. Most patronizing "world music". It is a tourist film and sadness. What really kills is inconsistent sequences. India, Egypt, South America, Africa etc. There are no transitions, no visual explanation of why we are suddenly ten thousand miles away, no images being expressed. Just a bunch of shots of third worlds with "baskets in their heads", as another reviewer said. Walking endlessly, it would have had a deep meaning. When these boys wanted to make a third-world music video, they only had to do a couple of hundred miles south of where Koya's best parts were shot and a movie in Mexico. It would have been much better in "transforming life". <br /> <br /> But no. What they decided was a mixed tourist route covering half of the ground and desperately crowded filter shots. The only thing to recommend is that it does not absorb as much as Naqoyqats. <br /> <br /> RstJ
