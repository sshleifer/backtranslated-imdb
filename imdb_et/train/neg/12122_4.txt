Seeing that the finals of the world snooker championship ended prematurely and disappointing with Ronnie O`Sullivan, who won the Greame Dott with 18 shots at 8, the BBC 2 found a gap in his schedule and decided to send A WALK ON THE MOON, which I had absolutely no knowledge left behind <br /> <br /> I missed the title credit for a few seconds so I had no idea that Viggo Mortensen had played it and thought it might be a cheap TVM, definitely opening up where magic Pearl and Marty take children in the summer camp feel like this type of television, although lightly lit (too brightly lit) cinematography seemed to be a cinematic film, and it wasn't until Viggo Mortensen appeared as a hippopotamus, which I realized it was film material after no Mortensen status mean a TVM star, then I think it's like a legend like Robert DeNiro, who appears directly on video. Wait a minute, don't Bob ...? <br /> <br /> Some people on this site have mentioned that Pearl and Marty are a convincing pair of screens and I agree. I understand why Pearl would be attracted by an exciting hippie man, but there is no idea why Walker would have a normal house woman, Pearl. The sixties were before my time, but certainly, if you have chosen a hippie between chicks and the husband of the eternal house, it is not an option at all. Keep in mind that many people took LSDs these days, so I think it will explain it. <br /> <br /> I feel the main problem is the WALK ON THE MOON, which is a romantic heart of drama (just as you expect in TVM), which has several anniversary birthdays, so why add a pretty explicit gender scene ? It wipes out with the rest of the film, and maybe in 1969 it targets 20 menopausal women. I might say, because the film seems to be aimed at the age image, and these teenagers seem to miss the historical and social context that the man walks in and Woodstock. In other words, WONK ON THE MOON is trying to attract several types of audiences, but apparently none of them
