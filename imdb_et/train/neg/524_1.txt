The "40-year-old virgin" exists in a world that I do not understand. A world where an electronics store worker can say "f *** off" to his boss and transfer videos to his naked ass in the store and not get reprimanded. A world where it is really funny to get drunk and crush other people's cars. A world where the boss seems to be sexually harassing her. The world is full of robbers and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And the world without funny jokes! I'm totally shocked by the viewers who liked this movie. I thought every scene was like a bad Saturday night sketch - not very funny at the beginning and expanded all the rational thoughts. The breast-waxing scene went on forever. <br /> <br /> Characters, apart from Carelli, were all in one note. And the romantic elements were completely built, especially the scene where Keener finds porn in Carelli's apartment. It was just flat. <br /> <br /> And I found the "Aquarius" sequence completely annoying and overwhelming. I hated hate this movie I hated!
