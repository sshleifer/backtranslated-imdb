But if I wish I had no faith that it wouldn't be incredible, and a naive belief that comes from the cool looking poster in the lobby. Unfortunately, by the time the old man of the pawnshop explained the whole background, fifteen minutes to the picture, I had a sudden, sinking revelation that came from knowing every plot point of every invisible film. And worse, I knew how badly all the points would suck. <br /> <br /> Let me make it quite clear here that English does not have enough nuance and depth in the ultimate evil field to properly describe how bad this film really is. <br /> <br /> I was wrong about knowing all the twists of the movie.
