I saw this movie today at Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing the comments, but I think the critics just wondered Willem Defoe and his wife (director) who were present at the festival. This is certainly the slowest film I've ever seen with many pointless, ridiculously long scenes. In addition to Defo, who was decent, two and a half other people were in the movie, accompanied by Defoe's wife Giada, ridiculously terrible (how they put a part of the saleswoman out of the bakery). This movie is pretty much a plot less, a flat test to be abstract and wall-to-side out. The only scene that mixed the crowd with any kind of reaction was vulgar and came nowhere to just add some kind of shock value to this film. Sorry you're so tough, but really this movie is a waste of time and money. I appreciate good indie cinema, but this movie is not worth the time of filmmakers.
