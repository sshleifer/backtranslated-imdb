I don't think I've ever shot this movie before. After loving the two previous films by Guy Ritchie (I don't read Swept Away - he was dark blind), I was so waiting. <br /> <br /> The reviews were bad, but again I don't trust the press. Even more worrying was the fact that the internet buzz was that it was a bit smelly, so it was somewhat frightening over its 4.80 kroons yesterday afternoon. <br /> <br /> I'm not even trying to explain this movie, mainly because I have no idea what's going on and at one point I was honestly close and asked if it was me who didn't get it! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that Ritchie seems to have fallen into the trap of her wife to take her too seriously. It seems she didn't have a good movie, laugh, lovely dialogue and good movies. characters. It is almost the same as having a checklist of movies he wanted to rip, here are some of the ones I noticed: <br /> <br /> Matrix, Fighting Club, Kill Bill, Ordinary Suspects, Vanilla Sky. I think the most depressing thing is that the two main actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were actually very good performances, and that was really a self-confident story and editing / direction that allowed the film to go down. <br /> <br /> The big, big thumbs down from me.
