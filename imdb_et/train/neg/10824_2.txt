This version is pretty scary, I'm afraid. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood, but William Hurt is tired, the thrown actor's style is totally inappropriate for Edward Rochester's brave passion and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a boring, petulant teenager whose toothbrushes hurt! Also, I can't believe they have removed Edward's great marriage offer scene from the end of the book, one of the most moving moments of literature. I appreciate that they finally used such a young, common woman to play Jane, who should be the world 18, but if you want to see a version closer to the novels and passions of the novel, please see George C. Scott and Susannah in the 70s York. York was too old, long and beautiful to play Jane, but no one touched Rochester's character as Scott did.
