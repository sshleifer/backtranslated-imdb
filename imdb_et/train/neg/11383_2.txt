This is a really terrible B movie. It is pointless and often embarrassing. The plot, the basic "show-making business" routine, is almost non-existent. In fact, this film is just an excuse for pushing military forces and some popular music groups from 1942, including the Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby and Freddy Slack. Each group receives about three minutes, except for Mills Brothers, who for some reason is justified by two numbers. Ann Miller can't dance the movie in the last few minutes and has little work, but she pulls her stuff between the patriotic propaganda gate. <br /> <br /> The most interesting moment in the movie, in my opinion, was in the Duke Ellington segment. It seems the band is playing on the train, standing in awkward positions. (At that time, in the deep southern part, the band was separated from the railway wagons while traveling.) Johnny Hodges is seen next to the Duke and can also be identified by Harry Carney. At the last moments of the movie, Ray Nance, a trumpeter / violinist, rushes through the aisle and makes "Uncle Tom", waving his eyes and pinching how Willy Best did in many movies. For modern viewers, especially jazz fans, this segregation is indeed sad. Some movies are best invisible.
