My nose is bent slightly when I write it. A few weeks ago I had sent a previous comment about this movie that hasn't yet appeared, so I expect it to be rejected even though it meets all the usual guidelines. <br /> <br /> I found this movie interesting for the first thirty minutes, especially Jordi Moll√†, a veteran actor who has appeared in major productions like "Blow" and "Alamo". Leonor Watling is also pretty good. Unfortunately, everything is finally penetrating with a really terrible, melodramatic script. There is also plenty of free nudity free of charge, which does not help to tell anything or even give an impressionist nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed work of art. <br /> <br /> The real day trip to Valencia beach is far less painful than keeping these fancy signs anywhere and anytime.
