This is one of those stereotypical mtv-generation dance films, and I don't see where all this "not so bad" garbage. Action is terrible, it follows exactly the same story as all the other "dance films" out there. It's terrible! The name should not be shouted. "How he moves." Because when can't movie titles ignore grammar? At least some dance films had half-decent dance scenes, they didn't even look. I give it to 1 out of 10, just because there is no zero. I'm serious about trying to get someone whose IQ is over 60 not to look at it and not waste their money. 1.6 / 10 should say all this. This movie shouldn't even have been done.
