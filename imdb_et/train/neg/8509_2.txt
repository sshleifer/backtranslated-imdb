I saw this movie for a number of reasons, the main one being Mira Sorvino. It would not be so bad with her cast. And even it seemed that it had a mystery, and Olivier Martinez was his boyfriend at that time, and he was pretty "Incredible". The story is set in Spain so it could be an exotic entertainment movie with my favorite actors. <br /> <br /> If you mean the same thing, let me warn you: this is a really horrible, uninteresting, boring movie. The only adjective that comes to mind is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The story is designed with sub-plots that don't add anything to the narrative. They are trying to build a fascism in Spain, but they are not terribly successful. The twists have no credibility, and the so-called investigation does not lead anywhere. <br /> <br /> Characters are thin on paper! I didn't care about anyone. More than they are irritating and quite hateful people. <br /> <br /> Operation is cruel. Mira, what's wrong with you? Why Mira? You're an Oscar winner! Keep dignity! His character was weak, but it is not such a terrible result. It looks like he's all the movies dreams. Come to think, I think I saw that his eyes closed slowly in some scenes. I thought this woman was sexy. Well, he's not here. If you want to look at the skin, try Rome and Michelle because there's nothing to see here. And this accent? My God ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is even the worst. It is too painful to remember his actions to describe it here. I'm sorry, but I can't. Ive suffered enough from this waste. <br /> <br /> This whole movie is frustrating! It is so bad in every sense that it is a wonder how it was even done. A dirty team that produces an evil script and makes money for the actor's name. Don't fall for it. <br /> <br /> Avoid it! <br /> <br />
