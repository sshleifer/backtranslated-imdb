Yes, yes. I admit it. I believed in all the work that surrounded this work, about 6 human trials and ailments that lived in Mexico with regard to their sexual life. And so, I was really expecting to finally see a Mexican movie (aged) that was as popular as an interesting watch. Unfortunately, the film was completely disappointing. The story gives us two pairs, both of which are very obvious family problems. If every couple lives from a third party, their problems will be central. Or absolute absurdity. The plot then becomes a sex fight. The attitude of each group (yes, they are literally a group, girls who have girls and boys' boys) is stupidly stupid and childish (I think humor was supposed to be there). And it all goes from bad to worse. The performances range from the mediocre (Miss Zavaleta) mediocre (Mr Bichir), and Serrano is working on his opera opera. But due to the film's failure, the plot is made up of flat facts, one-dimensional characters, a very bad (if not stupid) understanding of what sex represents in mature relationships, and so on. Impatiently. SPyL has had a (impressive) good reception box. Believe in hype at your own risk.
