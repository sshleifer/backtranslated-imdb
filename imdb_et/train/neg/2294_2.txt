Poor Paul Mercurio. After the landing of Scott Hastings in Strictly Ballroom, the best film in history, he managed to find a lot of garbage. None of the characters in this movie are very unlikely or even angry, but Mercurio's leadership is the kind of person you would like to ignore - completely unloveable and bears general. Big mistake in costume design, this one.
