Really, very bad. How does this film do bad? I was waiting for another redeemable plot point, interesting camera work or at least some free nudity, but I didn't get anything. I just looked at Cabin Fever and I thought it was a train wreck (except nudity and pancakes), but it looks like a genius compared to it. The best script doctor in the world would not have been able to save that glowing poo rods. <br /> <br /> The only thing this "movie" means is that it ended. <br /> <br /> I have a headache for this movie and I'm trying to write something. Ugh! I'm glad I paid just $ 5 for it and it will soon be landfilled.
