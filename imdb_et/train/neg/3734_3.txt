Truly confusing confusion. Most of the things in the movie are more or less similar in 1987, but then it's just futuristic things like a police gun. And this car! The director seemed to fall in love with the colorful lights. The only really remarkable force was the girl who played Valerie, but because there was no list, I don't know what the actor was. It's worth missing. Rating: F
