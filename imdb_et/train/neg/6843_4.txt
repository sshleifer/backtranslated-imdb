A pretty interesting exploit is black and white, written by David F. Friedman. Leading actor Stacey Walker is well cast and strangely attractive. He reminds the poor Renee Zellweger, who has bad hair. This chick made only two of these films and then moved back to Texas. Music is terrible. One of his boys has been playing Sam Melville (THE ROOKIES TV show) using another name. <br /> <br /> Best Tony in the movie - "Do you put me, doll? chicks put me". Good B / W cinematography from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Good places (cool pool, also used in DEFILERS). Strange ending, but matching. 4 out of 10. Best Performance Stacey Walker.
