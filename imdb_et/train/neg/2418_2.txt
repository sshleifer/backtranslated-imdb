The first mistake you made in filming the movie is the use of "dead dead" without a real zombie FX budget. Of course, it was a low budget zombie-flick - really a small budget. I thought it was a film school project. Amateur artists and amateur effects. <br /> <br /> Considering the above, it wasn't really too bad and it gave an interesting twist to the zombie genre. If you intend to get "R" for violence, you can also give us some good pictures of the attacks. Women used so little in this film that it could almost be classified as "gay interest". <br /> <br /> And I'm out of Oakland. There was a lot of hell and there was no hell!
