It's a 30-minute show for about one joke. Fun, Cavemen is not treated fairly. HaHaHa !!! He can't call the phone because he's Caveman. Cavemen is not as intelligent as humans. Oh jeez, these Cavemen are so complicated. There is no humor in this show. They can drive this one joke for so long and they already have Geico ads. This exhibition does not deserve the national T.V. time slot. <br /> <br /> This show is trying to be funny, but it's just not. Looking at this example, I thought he was trying to be like a "bachelor's degree wild show". That means they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women. The caveman is annoying. The glass cave mechanism is too smart to be a cave man (HAHAHA !!!). They all have personalities, but I can't understand why I don't care about them.
