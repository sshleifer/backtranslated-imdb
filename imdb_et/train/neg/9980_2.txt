Don't waste 90 minutes of your time on "fast food, fast women". It is a tediously episodic script that has three stories that have been put together because it is predictable in writing, terribly acting and even bad music. I found that an anorectic main character interferes with viewing every time he was on the screen. SHE needs fast food. Spend 90 minutes on your turkey, doing something exciting ... like cutting your toenails. You would have more entertaining value. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming thing with this movie is Louise Lasser, but she deserves much better than this tired script. It is as impotent as the older boy he met in the film. <br /> <br /> WATCH OUT!
