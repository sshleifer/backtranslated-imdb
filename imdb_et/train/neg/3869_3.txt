It's the second time I saw this movie in about 12 years. These comments come from someone who thinks Kane and Amberson are amazing movies. But the rest of Welles' career is unfortunately destroyed for his talent and too thin for him to be able to hold on to his cinema. And if he puts a pistol like Shanghai, there is nothing important to hang his movie transmissions, it's just sad. I couldn't tell you what he's studying here. It's all like a Welle godawful Irish brogue; that takes a lot of effort but adds absolutely zero to the film. Several Welles projects have evolved and become baroque. Mr Arkadin (choose version, any version) is like a belabored project. Material is irrelevant. It just doesn't cover the entire weight of this sheet. He never feels a pull to associate his heroes with reality with trafficking in a reality-based drama (as here); or a single story. The hire-purchase scheme is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Kudos Welles, though Hayworth's hair cut and it came out of him. The camera loves her. He is the toughest, most expensive, funny and frightening femme fatale ever put on film. But his betrayal is so late in the film that it seems to be a desperate decision, so the film has some genre that it fits. The movie cannot be recorded with the Noir Convention introduced in the last 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> When everything is said and done by L.F.S. to convince you that you've seen something thoughtful? do anything else for Welles? to roll your eyes? Welles does not have any sensitivity to the scale of the story or the story directly. One wonders what Shanghai has to say to anyone who is not a billionaire collapsed, organizing a four-fold murder-rental scheme or a love that is in love with a film-like concept that has no meaning or content. <br /> <br /> Overwhelmed, reluctant, disconnected.
