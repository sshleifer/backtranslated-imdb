There are exactly 2 good things about "fantasies" (both of which have been mentioned by the previous reviewer): <br /> <br /> a) Bo Derek's extraordinary poetry-inspiring beauty. She is in this movie shots, where she even gives Catherine Zeta-Jones money for her money and this is indeed a big compliment. Her nudity is short and discreet, but just looking at her face is enough. <br /> <br /> b) The Greek island, sun and crystal clear blue water. <br /> <br /> The other has no story, the dialogue is sad and sometimes inadvertently funny ("He touched you where you are a woman!") and Peter Hooten's character is a slim jerk. Bo exceeds the naivety of his character, but when you have to work with the dialogue, it's bad to blame the actors (the fact that he almost said "Damiri" in almost every sentence is a big irritation). Oh, and although the film is set on the Greek island, it is hardly possible to hear the Greek word - probably all the children there speak English all the time. (*)
