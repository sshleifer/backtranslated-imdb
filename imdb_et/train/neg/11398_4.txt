I saw this movie mainly to see Brooke Burke (like Jill), whom I met briefly at LA's modeling show in her first feature film. I was hoping to see her more, but I thought she did her role very well. Since she is such a beautiful and balanced TV host and model, it was not surprising. I was wondering why he was killed and what happened as a result. Maybe I just missed it. <br /> <br /> I wasn't really sure about the genre of this movie, and although I liked the actors, I felt it was a college audience. I was trying to keep an open mind given that my horror was not my favorite genre, but I felt that I had grown out of gags. It seems that in some places to pull out, in some places I think what the powers of the evil professor are, and as many other films had a dissatisfied ending. <br /> <br /> Having written a few scripts I know a lot is difficult and can come to personal opinions about how many movies you have seen and learned and the ones you are currently facing. <br /> <br /> In short, I found it to be an interesting, but not satisfactory, plot and ended for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) finally came back through the portal and hit everybody's ass that would be a satisfying end and would earn a higher rating.
