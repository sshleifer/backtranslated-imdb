I still find it difficult to understand that the film is as bad as it could be in Hollywood. Action and story are simply pathetic and the direction is terrible. I don't see the logic of this trash, except that the director had nothing to do. I took ten minutes to realize that I had wasted my valuable thirty rupees. It filled me with the fear that I was going to waste more time on my life with this mess. I bet the movie is made in less than one day. I don't know which category it belongs to. Please avoid this movie at all costs, do something, even head to the walls, but don't do this movie.
