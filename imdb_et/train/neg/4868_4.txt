First I thought it was just talking to Eddie Murphy with some stupid animals. I was right. Some people called this movie Eddie Murphy's return! Who are these people? Jesus, if it is the best he can come, can just stay away. What was this story again? I was so annoyed that all the flat jokes I forgot. I should have stepped out of it.
