I don't buy kung fu movies on the plot. I buy them in the fight. The bad plot will be forgiven for the great fighting scenes, but not the other way around. <br /> <br /> The story was decent but moved too slowly to my taste. There were about 3 or 4 medieval combat scenes that lasted only a few minutes. The last fight was a bit longer, but by that time I was so bored that I didn't even turn it around.
