The main reasons why "Red Eye" is seen are Rachel McAdams, who performs star performance, and Jayma Mays, who is a wonderful Hotel Assistant. On the other hand, Cillian Murphy is moving so badly that she becomes a comic. The rest of the movie is full of holes in the plot I work on. <br /> <br /> Please do not read further if you do not want to know what will happen! <br /> <br /> Here is a plot summary. Rachel McAdams's character (Lisa) manages a hotel where a new director of hard internal security plans to stay overnight. Rachel returns to Miami for a funeral, but she keeps her assistant talking up to the plane. Meanwhile, someone has been placed outside his father's house, Joe (played by Brian Cox), who is ready to kill him when Cillian Murphy (Jackson) calls. All Lisa has to do to call the hotel and move the director's suite to where Jackson's cohorts plan to steer a guided missile (a fishing boat) to kill the director and his family. <br /> <br /> Here are some holes in the plot or absurd hits: <br /> <br /> 1. Finally, convince Jackson to make a call and in the middle lose the phones. Lisa is trying to fake that she is calling, but accidentally makes Jackson go through the aisle speaker and start to hit her phone to show that it is dead. Jackson catches and grabs the phone from Lisa. <br /> <br /> 2. At one point, Jackson's head Lisa and he will get out, but only 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> 3. Jackson is trying to add a note to the mirror in the (extraordinarily large) toilet and he tightens him a bit. Wonderful, the only one who hears something is an 11 year old girl whose word of course is discounted. <br /> <br /> 4. Attach stabilizes Jackson with a pencil in the throat when the plane is landing, steals his cell phone, and makes a crazy scratch for the exit by installing the seat and 18 line of standing passengers. Despite knowing that the traveler is stuck with a pencil, flight crews are obliged to add by opening the door to the jet. <br /> <br /> 5. OK, all these are reasonable (if not very unlikely). But here it is really stupid. The annex gets to the Miami Airport terminal and there is no mobile phone signal (every big American airport reception is great). <br /> <br /> 6. He runs through the airport with Jackson, but no security clerk is even delaying them. <br /> <br /> 7. Jackson, who lost Lisa at the airport, while the train gates pulled out of the terminal, has lost some of his voice from a pen in his throat, but he can be understood somewhat. But he didn't bother his man outside Joe's house. (PS: There is no train at Miami Airport, but what they showed was terribly like Orlando Airport). <br /> <br /> 8. Lisa steals the car and drives away. Of course, the phone will say this time when it is calling, the phone says "low battery" and will soon turn off (when will they end this person's plot device?). <br /> <br /> 9. Although the phone still said "low-battery", Add to your assistant just by rescuing the director and his family of guided missiles launched by the fishing vessel 40. \ t Of course, they expect us not to notice that the hotel is surrounded by three sides of the ocean, so that the missile could probably have been launched in the first set, thus denying the need for the entire Lisa-Jackson plot. What's the story here? Was the Director's original room on the 38th floor one of the only rooms in the hotel with a bad view? Nonetheless, everything gets out just before the missile hit. <br /> <br /> 10. Lisa's driving to Joe's house to save her father just to see the killer out. Although he runs on him (when he takes a picture of him), grabs his Jeep home, it seems that no one in the neighborhood does not notice or barely stop. <br /> <br /> 11. Jackson arrives at Joe's house and hits him (we don't see how ... maybe another headline). He then explains to Lisa that he did not kill his father yet, because he wanted his father to see Lisa die for the first time (give me a break. What is it? Saturday's comics?). For the rest of the movie (about 20 minutes), Jackson rides around the house, and he fights peacefully. Of course, a real killer (i.e. possibly played by Jason Statham) would have added Lisa in the first 30 seconds (or for anyone who is not a trained killer). During this chase, Jackson joins Joe at least once without killing him. <br /> <br /> 13. Finally, Jackson dominates, and he is going to kill Lisa when he thought he had shot Joe. <br /> <br /> So, here's my suggestion ... tell Wes Craven to stay awake. Or maybe he should be with Michael Bay (who drove the equally stupid "Island") and "Red Island".
