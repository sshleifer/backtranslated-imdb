"In 1955 Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared from the Amazon Amazon. A year later he went out of the jungle ... naked. He took 45 years ago." Supposedly, "Leave your right" is "modern cannibal". In reality, anyone who is looking for some understanding of cannibalism is, unfortunately, disappointed. In the first half of the film, there is a New Ginuea travel log that mainly talks about local art. The other half is based on still photographs of the Peruvian cannibal tribes, but in fact it is. Of course, if you are interested in home videos of Jewish weddings or Schneerbaum who introduces your former male lovers. I'll give up. Great disappointment and not really a "modern cannibal story". - MERK
