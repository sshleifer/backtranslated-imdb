I enjoyed this movie most of the time, but I felt like I was watching a children's film. I think someone wrote the pg script and decided to add blood, nudity and language while filming. it was a big shoot. there is the belief in the magic of children that exists in films such as "babe" (pig) or "angels outward" that lose the evil tooth roach. Parents finally believe their daughter's ability to see the ghost and use this skill to be supernatural to win the tooth fairy. when I bought this movie, I thought it would be a b-film response to the horrible darkness; somehow manages to make a better movie of 1/4 of the amount, but they don't. they made the inferior film and are likely to lose the same amount of money lost in the darkness.
