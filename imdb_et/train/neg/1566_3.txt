For the knowledgeable Beatles fans, the main value of this film is simply to sit down and pick out the mistakes, inaccuracies, combined events, excluded events, wildly exaggerated events, excluded people, timeline mistakes, incorrect quotes, wrong clothing, picked songs and (shame shame) ) about incorrect instruments and other boners that I just don't think about. Disadvantages come quickly and fiercely, so you need to have your toes. <br /> <br /> I didn't give it to "1" mainly because it was filmed in Liverpool and the actors (Rain Rain) give it all (the character of Lennon is reliable and does a good job). It also hears the song "Cry for a Shadow" at one point and reads for SOMETHING. <br /> <br /> So look at it fun, but please don't take it historically accurate.
