I was so waiting to see it when it was in production. But it turned out to be the biggest hope. Far from Dr Seussi's mad world. It was vulgar and terrible I don't think Dr Seuss would have accepted. How Grinchi stole Christmas was much better. I understand that it had some adult jokes, but my kids haven't adhered yet. When the cat in Hatis yelled for vulgarity, they tried much more than I would have liked. Growing up with Dr. Seuss Really bothered me that this timeless classic got on the big screen in the trash. I hope this will make Dr. Seuss justice.
