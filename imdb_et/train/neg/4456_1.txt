This is perhaps the worst film I've ever seen. The fact that he has a weak style is bad enough that they have made this football 100 times worse. <br /> <br /> I had serious doubts even before I started watching this movie, but I was open enough to even accept the way the writers saw fit to introduce Elijah Wood's character to the hooligan scene. <br /> <br /> But because of the injustice of the film, the inaccuracy is that everyone in the middle of each movie makes you tougher than before. <br /> <br /> Let's find out a few things: Gentlemen are not going to break their pubs before running - the mill's league game; they are not going to kill each other; they do not wear rock only (and other crowds, or hooligans, no). Certainly, they will not make any exceptions to a member of a new company for their rival companies for pies and bottles. And I would like to meet a caretaker who would go and ride on the top boyfriend of his company. (Although you can tell me what I said, kill one another if it exists). t contains some fantasy contests, but it is equivalent to Cluelessness. <br /> <br /> I found it ironically that Wood's American nobility has been morally condemned because it is a cocaine user when it is part of the British hooligan scene. The film does not want to challenge the challenges of Wood's morality, and instead of using some of the companies to use coke. <br /> <br /> I could go ahead, but I think I've given my point. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, it is very unimaginable and I am sure that if I hadn't spent the whole movie, I would have done above, I would have guessed what happened earlier when I did. And believe me that I was well ahead. <br /> When I'm right, the makers are totally unsuccessful. It is too unrealistic to enjoy anyone who knows the scene, and I can't believe that such a female looking for emotional movies would make a damn for any character that is their violent tendencies. <br /> <br /> Are there any good points? Perhaps the fighting scenes are well-choreographed and filmed, but I rarely impress with slow action, certainly not as a fight, because the point is a ruck, which is still enough anyway. <br /> <br /> There are some funny things like unreal moments. Wood's trip to school brought me a smile. However, some mildly funny moments bother to look at two hours of complete product. <br /> <br /> If you are British, avoid this kind of interruption if you don't just develop misconceptions about the scene if you are not known. If you're an American, you can enjoy it because it's clearly customized to the market. But no one can deny that the plot is weak, predictable, and finally up.
