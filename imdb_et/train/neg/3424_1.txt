You can never see a movie and still don't know The Jerk Too is a disaster. The question is not, "How did it get," because if you throw money at someone and tell them to make a movie, then they do. <br /> <br /> No. The question is, "Why, why did Steve Martin promise to do this?" I think he needed the money to fight the unpleasant case and was ordered to pay him. He knew that the sequel would be so terrible that it wasn't proud, he wouldn't even consider royalties as income. <br /> <br /> The only way this sequel could not be embarrassing has been that Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin would revive the nation's favorite bad black family. <br /> <br /> And "dcreasy2001" (aka Mark Blankfield?): It's just transparent that you work on this sadness with the film and the only way you feel better about your life is to be another single cheerleader IMDb User Comment. I prayed that you would get over the satire, but unfortunately you really did. Why not 10 stars?
