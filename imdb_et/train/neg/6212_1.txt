It used to be my idea that films need plots, or some other tool that makes you care about the story or something that is happening. This movie has shown me that you really don't have to be like that. <br /> <br /> I could just summarize it. But IMDb wants me to have more lines. It was pretty beautiful. not the slightest. The way characters talk in the film thinks it should have been done in a few days, but as time goes by, I'm not quite sure it will happen in an hour. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for entertainment, buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before throwing it. This would be a much better use of your time. The time you never get back. Jurassic Park 3 was pulled better than this film.
