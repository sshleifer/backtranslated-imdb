It was a waste of my time. No plot. The action was so much lower than the par, it should be used as an example not to do. This is just a deprivation of the former Universal Soldier, which also scratches the bottom of a working barrel. It is sad that VD has to claim its ego every few years, and sadly, that people are paying good money for it. This schlock gives the Martial Arts a bad name. For comparison, Segall, Norris and Arnold look almost talented. At least then we could laugh with him instead.
