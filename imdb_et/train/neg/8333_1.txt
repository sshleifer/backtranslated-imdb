This is by far the worst film I've ever seen in my life. Operation is bad and the story is almost incomprehensible. Whether you like things like ships or not is not appropriate. As for special effects, the film has nothing. The whole film crew was probably in the boat at sea, not in the studio, and when some men are "drilled" (if you even call it), their reactions are completely unrealistic. Guns are quieter than quieter. How this film could have two awards raises serious questions about the state of the human mind. Well that's it. This review is probably more fun to read than watching a movie. If anyone is considering looking at it or buying it, I would give serious advice for obvious reasons. I've said it contains a spoiler. If the fact that some people get burned and the gun gets is a plot donation. I think this is because they are the only good parts of the movie.
