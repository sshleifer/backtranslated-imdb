Like my judgment and the title of this review, I think I don't like Johnny Test. Now I think I know what people are saying, "How do you know how bad it is? Don't hold candles to your standards. <br /> <br /> I want to talk about animation first, because it's one of the confusing things Like I've ever seen in the first two seasons or just the first season, there was a hand-drawn animation, I thought it was a nice show to see when it was hand-drawn, but then it was turned into flash animation and quality dropped a huge amount. look at the story of the exhibition. He tries too hard to be like a Dexter lab, but there are differences because there are two redhead scientists and they are both women. There is a dog to tell (why?) and the attitudes of the parents change somewhat. I don't think I can write them here (I don't mean that in church, but I mean, I don't know if there is a limit to words.) Everything else is on the spot, even DeeDee's Johnny. just trying so r just be Dexter, but it just seems to me a heartless knockoff. <br /> <br /> Finally, I want to talk about jokes. Remember in Dexters lab that some jokes are screaming? Yes, shouting may be fun or good for two, but the Dexter Laboratory also had cunning remarks that made me go back and check out to make fun. Johnny Test just forgets it and just hugs 50% of the time and stops music when a stupid joke or lining comes up. It's not a comedy, it's a stupid comedy (I know what some people think. Don't have three foolish comedies? Look at this and Johnny Test and you laugh more at first chance.). Sometimes jokes are based on strange situations like Chowder making me crazy. I have the rule of cartoons and comedies all together: Much odd is not equal to comedy, it just makes you think "what am I watching?". <br /> <br /> So it strikes out of all accounts. Don't look at this example if you have any comedy, shape or shape.
