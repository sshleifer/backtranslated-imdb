<br /> <br /> I recently saw this fear in this movie program, and I thought it was terrible, as I said in my speech, that it was pretentious, subtle, small and phenomenally important in itself. <br /> <br /> I consider myself to be a fan of the movie and everything the film offers. If I want to watch a documentary at Cannes, I look at A&E .... and they would probably be much more objective. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend it, period. <br /> <br />
