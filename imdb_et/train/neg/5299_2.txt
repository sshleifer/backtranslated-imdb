I really like slasher movies, but it's really terrible. Operation is flat, the script is bad and the atmosphere is non-existent. The plot is as follows: deformed gardener Charlie Puckett kills people in a small American city. That's right - it's a plot. Very original, either! "Night brings Charlie" is not even expensive - if the film is not scary, at least they should make it bloody. Avoid this cheap trash bin at all costs. If you want to see some good slippers, check out "Madman", "The Burning", "The Prowler", "Just Before Dawn" or "Humongous" - just don't waste your precious time on this precious waste.
