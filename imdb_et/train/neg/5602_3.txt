"Pandemonium" is a horror film that is more stupid than funny. Believe me when I tell you I love comedies. Especially comedies. "Airplane", "Naked Gun" trilogy, "Blazing Saddles", "High Anxiety" and "Spaceballs" are some of my favorite comedies that break a certain genre. "Pandemonium" is not there with these films. Most of the scenes in this movie were sitting there in a silent silence, because the movie wasn't that funny. The film has a few laughs, but if you look at comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times, and that's the movie that this movie is about. Geezil, "Scream" was more laughing than this movie and it was a more horror film. How odd is this? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (of 4)
