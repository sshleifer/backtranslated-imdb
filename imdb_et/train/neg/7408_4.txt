I'm not quite sure why I clicked "contains a spoiler" because, to be honest, the movie never has enough explanation to know enough about it. <br /> <br /> Visually, it mostly offers. Well, except for some 80-year-old upside-down rubber masks. I say now that before that, I never had a story with Lord, and they knew nothing about them that they won the Eurovision Song Contest. Apparently, its monsters are members of the band, pretty much at their stage. What ever. Anyway, I didn't know when I looked at it. I thought the monsters / demons were mostly satisfactory. Just about. <br /> <br /> I'm almost sure the screen has a semi-coherent explanation, but it may actually be better. Probably it should have been thought incredibly. The action keeps it pretty good to keep the viewer mostly entertained, even if half of the entertainment factor jokes about wtf, which should happen exactly in this movie. <br /> <br /> I gave him four mainly because I got a lot of laughing about it, especially how it explains pretty much. Must have been in the mood, but I found that hella is funny for some reason. Then I watch the movie online and find out that NOBODY knows what the hell it should be. It amused me further and raised my score to an extra half to 4/10. <br /> <br /> It is not intimidating or very cohesive, but it is visually and sonically beautiful. In general, it is far from important, but traceable. Don't expect too much and don't expect it to make sense and it can attract you when you are in the right mood.
