Well then. I just watched movies of different quality. I wasn't too sure what I'd like to see for the first time. Then it hit me like a bag-a-rat: Rodentz. Warn people about Rodentz. This monstrosity stands for someone and is painfully boring to sit down. And this is about mutant rats that kill people. Yes ... real amazing original. "God's Food" or "Willard" Anyone? They were better, and it doesn't say much ... <br /> <br /> ** POSSIBLE SPOILER ** Let's have a story here: Inna's laboratory, scientist and her lucky assistant are experimenting with rats and their lab has a crappy neighborhood and a crappy building and Happy Assistant Moronic Friends appear drunk and everyone gets food from crazy rats and almost everyone dies and, oh yes, there is one giant rat that sees crappy, but it can kill, finally. There's a sentence every time! Spoiler, you say? Ppfff !! I ask you to differ! Secondly, we all realize that there is a giant rat, we all know that it will eventually die! ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Here's a breakdown: <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> - Well, I watched it for free, but for everyone else ... hmmm, no. There's nothing good here. <br /> <br /> No harm, no help: <br /> <br /> - Um ... well. Gore was decent. - Very average cinema. <br /> <br /> - CG rats are not as bad as they might have been in some frames ... <br /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> - .. and in other shots CG rats were pathetically cheap. See if your movie has a small budget, you may not rely on CG. Lesson to bring to heart. <br /> <br /> - Action is extremely bad. <br /> <br /> - Characters go beyond interest - we have mish-mash of cliches and none of them have even done so. <br /> <br /> --Booooooooooooring. <br /> <br /> - You've done it before - many times. <br /> <br /> - Stupid story, just stupid. <br /> <br /> - The big rat looks like a greasy person in a badly prepared bear costume - it was kind of funny - but not funny enough to give that film some value. <br /> <br /> - Canceled, unrealistic and boring dialog. <br /> <br /> - All college students' rat-chow people drink Tequila from large plastic milk cans - and yet they don't seem to drink anything for more than a few seconds. Continuity of continuity, boys. <br /> <br /> Ugly: <br /> <br /> - This movie is bad. Just terrible. Worse than you can imagine. It's not even ridiculously bad, like "Scarecrow" (2002) or "dead house". Now these movies are crap you can enjoy. Even if they make you a stupider. <br /> <br /> A memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - Lame action-movie ends with intact heroes and explosion. Because it doesn't feel such a monster at all - but suck it yet. <br /> <br /> By: 2/10 Story: 1/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character Development: 0/10 Special Effects / Make-up: 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (I was occasionally at my son during the movie, so I can miss it, but probably it was there) Violence / Gore: 4/10 Dialogue: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (average of time) Writing: 1/10 Direction : 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Generally: 1/10 <br /> <br /> Look at it only when you love rat and pest-based horror films. Wait ... Check. Don't look at it. It's a mess. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
