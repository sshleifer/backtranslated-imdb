Man, what the hell were the people who made this movie? And more importantly, where can I get? Open scene determines the tone of the movie: the woman who has come naked, turning it into a werewolf. And it's not Rick Baker's transformation of American werewolves, people. We're talking about some of the worst makeup ever shot on film. I can imagine that some stony Italian spread glues naked to Annik Borel (who plays Daniela, the hero of the film (this is the word?)) And asking him to roll the fur. This is how bad it is. <br /> <br /> It's not much better here. Minutes are wasted when landscape chewers talk about Daniela and his condition or something (I don't remember, but dialogue is so bad if you don't laugh). <br /> <The funny thing about Daniela is not even a werewolf, she is a psychologist who goes mentally when there is a man (understandable because she was raped as a child), so she thinks she gets a werewolf like her ancestor (opening scene ). He can't help but tear every man's throat he meets, and he just wants to be loved! Things start looking for Daniela when he meets and falls in love with a buff stuntman who doesn't start his "episodes". Get to know the assembly here, which is one of the most exciting visions (laughs and hugs the head after diving). <br /> <br /> Daniela's fortune does not stop, because the film is brutally beaten, suddenly beaten and abducted by a group of kidnappers who kill a stuntman. Reminiscent of "I Spit My Tomb", Daniela extracts bloody revenge for her rape. <br /> <br /> It's 100 minutes of my life that I never get back. But hey, this is the game you play when you're a movie geek.
