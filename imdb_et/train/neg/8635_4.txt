This is certainly not one of Lucio Fulc's best clips for some imagination. The plot is pretty bad, the millionaire is killed and his spit calls his daughter out to find out who did it. But the biggest problem I have with it (apart from knowing who killed him in 10 minutes after watching the movie) was why anyone should take care? The father comes out as a really big jerk to everyone he met (including the daughter he's helping), which made it very difficult for someone to take care of who killed him. But no one really looks at the good style of Fulci flick, so it would be like watching porn for writing and displaying an incredible script. Usually, his films try to compensate for it by adding excessive gore scenes, but even that there is no movie in it. If you are looking for a good Fulci flick, check out The Beyond.
