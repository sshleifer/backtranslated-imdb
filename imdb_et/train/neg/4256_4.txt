Resurrection is actually a step that is the story of the original film and its special effects. Jason Scott Lee is good as vampire men looking for a census themselves (when you remember him, he was a Dragon, a story by Bruce Lee). . Diane Neal is good as a woman who steals Dracula's body to find her dead boy to treat, and Stephen Billington is great as Dracula himself. Better performance than Gerard Butler had the original movie list. Roy Scheider rounds off the rest of the movie in this movie and does a decent job as Jason Scott Lee's character mentor. This is the second trilogy, and they are a good start. It is in the air, whether the last film closes the series with a good note.
