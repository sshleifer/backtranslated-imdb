I saw this movie in my international cinema class and stayed away. This movie is nothing more than a value of a blatant shock following. <br /> <br /> The fourth person talks about the alcoholic writer Reve, who has a vision of the threat he is waiting for. She meets a local book club lecture with Christine and decides to stay with her when she discovers how attractive her boyfriend is. Reve likes Dutch sausage to play the picture. So Reve is planning to attract Christine's boyfriend so he can finally have sex with him. He later discovered that Christine had had three previous spouses who had all been murdered. Now Reve and Christine's boyfriend could be "THE OTHER MAN." The story makes sense if there are no holes in the plot. Editing this movie and everything else that is technical is perfectly good. The film is just great and I felt the need to vomit in some parts. It's basically not my cup. <br /> <br /> The movie opens when Reve reaches JUST in t-shirt. So at the beginning you can see how Reve's cute pecker slips around when he walks around in his apartment in an apartment in a mating country. Later he has a dream where the scissors cut the stapler and show it with a fountain of blood flow. Reve fondles the shape of Jesus and has homosexual sex in the mausoleum. In addition, there is a lot of blood. More blood than all Freddy Krueger's films together. <br /> <br /> Not that I have anything against "shocking" scenes, but this movie is just as blatant when it comes to shocking. The whole film is turned around the shock value. <br /> <br /> So if any of them is your cup, check out this movie. Otherwise, stay far away. My mind is still awful.
