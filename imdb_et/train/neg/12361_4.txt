I saw this recent film by Woody Allen because I am a fan of his work and I am trying to see everything he does, even though due to the reviews of this film I was expecting disappointment. They were right. It's a confusing film that can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a romantic fantasy, or a drama about a woman's life crisis. Alice (Mia Farrow) is a troubled middle-aged woman who is married with great wealth and lives in a deliberate luxury with her rather boring wife and their two little children. This pretty everyday plot concept is revived with insecurity like an old Chinese public healthist, who makes him invisible to some magical herbs and the ghost of a former lover (with whom he flies over Manhattan). If these additions sound too fantastic for you, how about something prosthetic, like a saxophone player? <br /> <br /> I'm never quite sure what this messy mess is trying to say. The movie only has a handful of really funny moments, and the end is really superfluous Pollyanna's touch. <br /> <br /> Instead of renting off crimes and misdemeanors, it's a great film that promotes comedy engagement with ethics and morality. Or go back to "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan".
