OK, I like this movie idea. I'm in a demographic age and I find some stories. Even sometimes a sticky and pointless dialogue seems half-realistic and would have been forgiven in a different film. <br /> <br /> I try as hard as the movie did, as others did, but it's not as easy as the filmmakers didn't try at all. <br /> <br /> Editing this movie is terrible! Perhaps the worst editing I've seen in the movie! There are things that you don't have to learn to learn, supporting good editing is not one of them, but bad recognition is also. <br /> <br /> Also blow ... Oh my God shots, just terrible! I can't even go into details, but sometimes we just see random things, and with editing you give you the most painful movie viewing experience. <br /> <br /> This movie is made low or not at all 4 budget and the team is not an excuse. I've seen short films on YouTube that have a lot more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I don't know what the hell you meant, but this movie is nothing but the masturbation of both of them. You should be ashamed! To sum up, this movie is like what a really lazy amateur porn movie was when it was filled with 3 or 4 evil sexual scenes separated by long boring chats and one nasty masturbation. If that's not your business, don't do it at all costs!
