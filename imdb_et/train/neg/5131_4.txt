I liked it, but I think I would have been ironing at the same time. The recycling of Cyrano de Bergerac / Roxanne is a totally unwanted, formal romcom that was rescued directly to the video due to Janeane Garofalo's sharp turn. Playing a pet fraser, he finds himself caught in a trap when uncertainty leads him to his best friend (Uma Thurman) when the caller comes to court. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting movie about Ben Chaplin's exciting career. An average British actress, gave this film a Hollywood treadmill. He is remarkable and his anonymity in studio productions is not surprising on this basis, although he has appeared in Terence Malick's films that are so recent. Uma Thurman makes autopilot turned on and Michael Lehmann's packages are all competent. Icky phone sex though. 4/10
