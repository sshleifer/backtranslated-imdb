How hard is it to watch Ville Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey watching the movie? Obviously it is very difficult for writers here. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays BIG's brother). I have to keep that part of the story, but it really isn't really important. Many scenes seemed uneven and lived; The "funny concept" of scenes that are drugs is too far away to lose the comedy feeling. <br /> <br /> The director / producer finally tried to "tear down" what would have been appropriate if the guiding things had been worth it. <br /> <br /> Ugh, great disappointment. I can see how some people enjoy it because many people take all the garbage they feed, but I strongly encourage them to wait for a DVD. Not worth $ 23,978, which is spent on your family's movies these days.
