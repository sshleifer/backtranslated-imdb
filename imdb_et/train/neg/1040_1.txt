I can't believe that this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating 6! It's hardly traceable and incredibly boring, definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> In the absence of a budget, he reminded me of the mere impression of Star Wars episodes I and II that you were looking at the entire creative train of the scrap. <br /> <br /> This movie should in any case be avoided. It is one of the "festival films" that only want pseudo-intellectuals because they are so badly made that these people think it makes it "different", so good. <br /> <br /> Making bad movies is not "different", it's just a bad movie.
