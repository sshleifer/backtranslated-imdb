This movie was exactly what I expected it to be when I first read it. I could have written a more exciting plot, it is a pity they left it to Howler Monkeys. Alberto Tomba was definitely a good skier, but he must thank God (and also us) for not having his vitality to serve his actor's skills. She can't play, she can't talk, she can't even run very well on the continent without skis ... Michelle Hunziker is a pretty blonde girl and that's it. He obviously did not choose his dramatic roles for his amazing powers, but probably for his nice feet. However, I must admit that he may be a teacher of Tomba's actor, because he is even a worse actor, and it is funny, especially since he is not Italian. I laughed all the time watching this movie. I found it so ridiculous and pointless that it made me laugh, loud, very loud.
