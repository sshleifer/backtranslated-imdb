My life is saving animals. I work voluntarily with a cat rescue service. I'm a vegetarian because I couldn't kill the animal even to preserve my life. I can't even kill a spider, I put it out. A scene where children throw stones at the bird until it dies, along with Sooner, who participates in the attempt to accept other children, made me sick and has been haunted since then. It just convinces me that people are pathetic about the need to receive them. The end time - whether the older parents accept - will not allow the animal to imagine cruelty. Why would someone want their child to see this movie?
