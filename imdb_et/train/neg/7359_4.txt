Anyone who has been watching some Lifetime Movie Network movies knows that plot reliability is the first thing that has been removed from the plan table. So when the crazy Lara moves to Patti's home and starts methodically riding her homeowners, I wasn't even blinking. When Lara's actions finally endangered the poor Patti victims and encouraged her to do something, I just nodded. You will see that people in Planet LMN do not behave for some reason as they do, but do so to continue. Only at Planet LMN could anyone out of their homes be expelled from their home government! Poor Patti - She just trusted too much and Lara went out of her treatment and then it was a big fight at the top of the stairs with a syringe filled with deadly things that could inject into someone's stomach and the body bag goes out of the front door. Fear! <br /> <br /> But this Planet LMN is classic for me. You have to look at it once, just for big laughs. On the instability scale, this film is 95/100. Make a big batch of popcorn and get some apple slices. You will understand later.
