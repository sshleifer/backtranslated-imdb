I first read "Lorna Doone" about 20 years ago and loved it! It is a classic historical romance that was placed in the 1600s when the western country had been traveling from London for several days and the law and organization were much harder to enforce. Unfortunately, this version of the book takes a lot of freedoms and, in my opinion, was incredibly disappointing. The performance and product values ​​are OK, but the way the story came was terrible. Why do TV adaptations do this? Why should they think that thousands of book fans would want them to change their story? One of the greatest secrets of life !!! The BBC made an excellent version of what was on TV at Christmas in the early 1990s and what I still try to watch! Take my advice, read the book and don't worry about this evil version!
