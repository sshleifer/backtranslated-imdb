I remember seeing the movie with her parents in the summer of 78 and I was pretty pretty at that time. Of course I was seven years old. <br /> <br /> Just before the Jackson movie was announced, my wife and I took this movie because she had never seen it and I felt nostalgic. <br /> <br /> Ralph Bakshi ran the money in the middle of the animation process for this movie and was forced to significantly reduce the angles of this production. Because this movie was mainly a rotoscope, it is a budget animation technique for people that says something. Much of this movie is animation with only the loosest word. There are some scenes that are obviously just the people on the screen, maybe some animation effects on them. <br /> <br /> Due to budget constraints, film is already a compression. The Rings Scholarship "and some of The The Two Towers were left even further. What you get is a sort of a Cliff Notes movie book version of the books. <br /> <br /> It's not all bad, but animation it brings the warmth I found in movies from Jackson. It is nice to imagine what could have been a decent funding. <br /> <br /> This movie is also remarkable when it comes to what never came. half-hearted half-hour long special television that was supposed to pack things up, all I say is that it was musical.
