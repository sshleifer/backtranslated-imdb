As a film critic of several Dutch websites, I have to see many movies and not all very good. Some movies are so bad that you are not surprised that they have been released directly to the video. With taboo, Iam surprised me that it had been published on the video. It is really a low budget bad quality bad written garbage. <br /> <br /> A group of young people play a taboo game. They write down their worst wish or deed, and later they are murdered for taboos. The question is, should we believe what we see? <br /> <br /> The film has a potentially interesting plot twist and I won't give it here. But what might have been interesting, stupid, bad and without any reason. <br /> <br /> Some actors have previously played in bigger titles, so why did they register on earth? If you see it everywhere, try to prevent it. There is no logic, no human sense in this film.
