After watching Dean Jagger, the winner of the Academy Award for the Zombie Rebellion, I got one burning question. How was this society, which created these supreme warriors, ever win? <br /> <br /> It's a question of what you mean when you look at the Zombies rebellion. At the end of World War I, the French discover the occupied Cambodian cult, where these undead creatures that cannot be stopped with bullets form the monks' brigade who move up and cast a wolf. <br /> <br /> intimidates the living feces from all the people involved, so that an international expedition is formed to find out the destruction of their zombie secrets, so that no nation can take hold of it and rule the world. <br /> <br /> But we've got differences in these lines. First of all, Snidely Whiplash is the Roy D'Arcy villain who kills a Buddhist monk who has a secret and another is Dean Jagger. Power is the main aphrodisiac, as we all know, and he has decided to pull Dorothy Stone away from Robert Noland. <br /> <br /> I think you have an idea of ​​how it will come out, especially since the zombie race was not conquered by one country in the world. Dean Jagger, when he became an Oscar for twelve years, must be crunching every time he attempts to make this movie and the terrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story, you can make a final warrior with a zombie drink and a zombie song, but you can't make the ultimate slave of love.
