I'm the kind of person who went to the local library and read books from different Babbage engines when my schoolmates played football, etc. So if this movie has a target audience, I think it's probably added to it. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just have to look at it again. The previous reviewer mentioned that this movie was not tired. Maybe it was my mistake. <br /> <br /> I tried to do my best to enjoy my movie, and there are also aspects I like, but generally I found it to be amateur and quite tiring. /> Being somewhat self-recognized as a computer player, I can't just help but take the time to actually make the movie and how the graphics used reflect that time (ie 1997). Having played the era of games, see. "Mind Grind" to quote one example, this movie cannot get the 16-bit color of this time with a low res multimedia explosion. Now, fortunately, at least in recent years, this has somewhat decreased in the gaming experience, for the actual game. <br /> <br /> Taking a look at this movie through the German FTA satellite channel (as I do not) t I think it has never been broadcast on UK FTA TV, well not recently anyway), I was amused to see the end Credit Note Gottdog (God Dog) had 4 people working on this design. Perhaps this means that I am interested in it because ten years have passed since the film was made, but the end result makes a good comparison of the film graphics of the eighties. <br /> <br /> For the main story, I agree that the format is not the best idea. Like others, I agree that Ada deserves a movie without a sci-fi angle, and a simpler biographical approach would probably fit the story of this remarkable lady's life. <br /> <br /> There are fundamental mistakes that undermine my movie enjoyment. First of all, the idea of ​​losing the real information of the past can be accurately reconstructed by means of extrapolation of a certain type through software-based intelligent agents, but it seems somewhat ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Also, a subject that passes through a film that a computer device can really predict in the mechanics of all things over time (such as winds) is now known not to be the case. <br /> <br /> OK, so Victorian might have considered this view, but Gödel's 20th century works, which prove that the mathematical system is not complete, are work done within Turing's computational capabilities, not to mention chaos theory and quantum mechanics, all these The ideas are completely undermined, which seem to be central to today's researcher Software should work. <br /> <br /> Finally, clicking the mouse in the air to mean "programming" is just as wrong as mentioned above. <br /> <br /> This movie might have been OK, but at least some technical a nd scientific advice would have given the film much credit for credibility. <br /> <br /> I will not forget this movie, like "Pi", it is clearly a unique work, but too many fatal mistakes to really enjoy it, 3/10 of me.
