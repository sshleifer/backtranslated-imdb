It's really the worst movie I've ever seen. Never. Period. In fact, I paid Â£ 3.50 to watch the film with a steaming turtle. Incredibly boring, malfunctioning, terrible script, often inconsistent and too many scenes that don't seem to be relevant to the overall movie (like when Heath Ledger's priesthood has been worshiped to the wall ... which was the point in this scene answers to the postcard please .. .) <br /> <br /> I should have received a medal to hold this movie all the time. I'd rather get into the flank than sit back through this movie. <br /> <br /> It should be down to 100 IMDb. Hopefully my 1/10 vote will help.
