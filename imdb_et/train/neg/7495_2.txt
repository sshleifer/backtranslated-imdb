Fox's "Jesse James True Story" (1957) is a remarkably bad new prestigious 1939 Tyrone Power / Henry Fonda classic "Jesse James". I'm not sure where the fault lies, but in this version of the two central characters, the uneven direction of Nicholas Ray and the tooth-fist scenario must definitely be related to it. <br /> <br /> In the late thirties and forties, Tyrone was the leading man of Power Fox, but in the fifties he began to fall, and studio director Darryl Zanuck began to take on the newcomer Robert Wagner. It was a big mistake in Zanuc, because Wagner turned out to be a less suitable substitute. With the possible exceptions between "Broken Lance" (1954) and "Heaven & Hell" (1956), it's hard to think of Wagner, which makes a difference! Jeffrey Hunter was also something other than the Fox player before he was assigned to play Frank James Wagner's Jesse "Jesse James's real story". Borrowed last year's studio, this actor's outstanding and revealing power in John Ford's classic "The Searchers". But playing with Wagner here as James Brothers on the other side is not boring. Neither player gives any personality or color to their role. They are completely between the brand, without being hidden by both the career and power that Power and Fonda showed in the original. The film is also violated with too many setbacks, and the entire site scenario, Wagner, like the western American Robin Hood, is inappropriate as a charming introverted twit you don't know of any empathy. Supporting casting is hardly worthwhile, but it is a disgrace to see such a great actor as Agnes Moorhead barely looks like Ma James. <br /> <br /> The best aspects of this unattractive, so western part are excellent Joe McDonald's Cinemascope / Color Cinematography and the underrated and little-known composer Leigh Harline's excellent music score!
