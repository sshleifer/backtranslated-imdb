This is an interesting treatment that is quite controversial (just read other comments on this movie). Obviously you love it or hate it and it seems that most people make the difference, depending on whether they believe the misery and end times are as shown in the movie. <br /> <br /> In principle, the film - and its succession - was made at about $ 1.30. The production values ​​are from "Plan 9 From Space Space" and the operation is about the same as "Glen or Glenda" (my apologies to Ed Wood). Ignoring a religious message is as frightening as they come. Even the slightest thought was that the story might actually be something that could happen in the future, and it gets worse. <br /> <br /> This movie and its sequels did not attempt to explain why the misery happened when it did. "Left" and "Omega Code" tried to get everyone into the "Thief" and explained the whole policy and maneuver in the Middle East. The net effect of "thief" has done much better work in the frightening part of the film, rather than spreading itself too thin, trying to explain what is happening in the Middle East at the same time. <br /> <br /> Forget about politics and watch this movie and its queues for what they are - horror. Because they can be indirect stories that God speaks indirectly, God just makes them more frightening. If it makes you think about this, he has done his job - even if you never believe.
