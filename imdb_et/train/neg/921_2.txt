I rented this one to see Vanesa Talor again. He can act, but he can't get the chance in this clunk. The opening sequence is a complex mountain crane. Must be from the stock archive because the movie is directly recorded on the video tape. Production values ​​make _Blair Witch_ professional. There's really a cheesy animated shape but the other is worth noting. This movie is bad, but not fun. Players do not mention this well as they continue.
