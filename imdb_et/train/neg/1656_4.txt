It is unlikely that anyone, except those who love silent films, will appreciate this lyrical camera work and the busy (but scratched) background point that comes with its 1933 release. Although the sound was generally introduced in 1928, there are no more than fifty words spoken of by a unmarried woman who forsakes her husband's younger man after a romantic interim forest. /> The most vividly captured scene is a jealous husband who gives a young man an elevator to travel to the city, as usual, until he realizes that he is the lover of his wife. In the madness of jealousy, he travels at the top speed of the level crossing, but changes his mind at the last moment, losing his nerve. This is probably the most intense scene with otherwise decisively slow moving and obviously natural story. <br /> <br /> HEDY LAMARR has been named the discoverer of discoverer Marlene Dietrich, but her beauty beauticians were not yet refined when they were transported to Hollywood. Her performance is mainly sad and frightening, mourning her marriage loss with only a short glance, when she finds her true love (ARIBERT MOG), a beautiful young stud looking for a nude swim after her clothes. <Br /> <br /> Swimming is very short, discreetly photographed, and is not worth all the heat it probably created. Later, the love-shaping scene is also artificially captured by lyrical photography, which is evident in most films - artificially. More is left to the imagination by the use of symbolism - and this is something that others proclaim as a lyrical masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Not so. It's a disappointing, first-sight raw part (including deepening of symphonic music in the background) and Lam Lamr is fortunately fortunate to see Louis B. Mayer seeing the film and giving him a career in Hollywood. He has seen something in his work that I didn't do. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that it is created as a silent movie where the camera does all the work. All in all, the 'workers' scene is too long and it is a dirty invasion where it is not needed. It doesn't end with a movie in the appropriate note.
