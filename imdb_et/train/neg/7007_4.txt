This is a pretty bad movie. The plot is a sentimental hat. I think the production values ​​are right, proper photography, unobtrusive direction and all that. Mark Hamill was terrible. I've never cared for her, and this film confirms that understanding. No wonder he never had any career with his "Star Wars" movies. I'm just saying "Buh-bye, Mark," when he falls into a well-deserved darkness. On the other hand, the very young Annie Potts stole the exhibition. He showed charm, beauty and acting in one performance. I remember seeing him recently in "Texasville" and took note of his beauty. It's interesting to see him ten years earlier. Anyway, if you are not interested in Miss Potts, escape from this movie to shout out of the mountains.
