Spoilers <br /> <br /> WORLD END is a unique film experience. <br /> <br /> Here's a complete story: the scientist receives messages from space (the INDEPENDENCE DAY). Messages say things like a massive disaster will happen and the scientist will hear on the radio later that there was a huge earthquake in China. He begins to think that the messages have something to do with disasters all over the world, so he tries to understand who receives the messages (and who sends the messages in space). He and his wife finally came out of the monastery. They visit it. Everything seems normal, including the priest, played by bored Christopher Lee. But the scientist is sure and really believes that the messages will come and go to this monastery. So he and his wife go back to the monastery where they are caught by aliens, hidden priests and nuns. They are held against their will and Lee's alien forces the scientist to do something they need to return to their planet. When an alien receives a special element, the aliens will leave their home on a planet with some kind of sticky appearance on their own. Lee, the last alien, tells the couple that the land is being destroyed as a result of a decision by aliens. Lee walks the carrier and he's gone. A couple, looking at monitors that show natural disasters around the world, decide to follow aliens. Because the earth is doomed, a couple will not see any points left so that they can go to the carrier and disappear. The last picture of the movie is the papier-makhe planet exploding. End. <br /> <br /> That's it. <br /> <br /> I've never seen such a dull movie in my life. This is the most experienced film I've ever experienced. The scientist and his wife are the two worst heroes or protagonists who have ever been put on the screen. They don't care about anything. They see terrestrial disasters on monitors and decide "what the hell who still needs the land?" They don't even try to stop them and do something to make things work better. Such a story could have worked if the film had an overwhelming condemnation of everything, but the action and the atmosphere were non-existent. The actors and the people who want to pull out of this numbness go through their pace so much that you can almost feel when their cards are kicked out and return to work. I didn't expect much of this movie because it was Charles Bandi's production, but I didn't expect it to be that bad. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee was once asked what was his worst film he'd ever done and he mentioned STARSHIP INVASIONE. Well, I'm sorry Chris, but STARSHIP INVASIONS was actually funny fun. STARSHIP INVASIONS is a terrible but terrible entertainment. THE END OF THE WORLD is much, much worse: it is far from boring and inert.
