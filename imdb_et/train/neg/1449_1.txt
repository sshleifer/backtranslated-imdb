First of all, before reading, you must understand that I am not a neo-Nazis, I just try to understand Hitler correctly so as to be sure that no one likes it again. <br /> <br /> I have seen it in a series and found it terrible. I mean, OK, it's interesting to look, but is it real? I searched for answers and found one: absolutely not. First, Hitler did not anger his entire life, the series shows hatred of Hitler, even if he is a child. Secondly, Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter; in fact, it is very likely that Hitler was really gay and fought all his life to stifle that mystery. Third, people hate me, but that's true: Hitler was charming. What do you think he managed to get when he was so angry and ugly? Because he was charming. This is a common point I found in interviews with people who lived near him or far away (of course not Jews). <br /> <br /> This series was terrible, because if you think Hitler was just angry with the bastard, ugly and of course not charming, you're wrong. If you think you are letting such people in such countries and you don't want it. If you really understand how Hitler was able to reach, and stop thinking that he was just terrible, you can find him dangerous politicians (of course, remember he was chosen) and stop the topic before it's too late. / / <br /> It is important to protect life, this series is just terrible to show us the truth when we continue to see Hitler's vision, the second, like the first one.
