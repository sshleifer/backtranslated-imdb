How viewers respond to the new "adaptation" of Shirley Jackson's book, which was promoted, if not the original 1963 film (sufficiently true) remake, based on the following: those who were either big fans of the book or the original film don't think much about it ... and for those who have never met, and who are the great fans of Hollywood's current trend of "special effects", the first and last word of how "good" film is, I love it. <br /> <br /> Things I didn't like about customizing: <br /> <br /> 1. It was not the correct customization of the book. Based on the read articles, this film had to cover other aspects of the book that were never first received. And it seemed reasonable, no movie can cover the book literally unless it is the length of STANDI! (And not even then) But there were things in the film that were never mentioned in the film or even hinted at. Reminded me of how they decided to kill the black man in the original film version of ACKNOWLEDGMENT. I didn't like it either. What the movie press release MUST say ... "We have the basic idea of ​​Shirley Jackson's book, the basic idea, we kept the names of the same house and the names of several (though not all) leading figures, but then we decided to write our story, and when we watched the devil we first looked at SHIFTS and CLOSING and GHOST, and we also decided to throw some of them away. "<br /> <br /> 2. They completely lost the theme of a parapsychologist who invited carefully selected guests who were all their pastoral healers to explore the house, what seemed "born bad". No, instead, this "doctor" all got to the house with a false pretext to learn about their "insomnia" (he really invited them to scare them there and then see how they reacted to their fear ... like the labyrinths he mentioned ever said that they are part of the experiment ... nice guy). The doctor, who by the way did not have the same name, was the same as the specialist in the original film at night. <br /> <br /> 3. In direct contrast to the statement used to advertise both films, "some houses are just born bad", this house was not bad, but rather bad because it happened there ... and this time Nel can untangle mystery (CHANGELING tones). The only problem was that the so-called mystery was so inconsistent that I was sure it was a mystery to most audiences ... but then there was no secret (not in the book) because the house was bad. This is the first "victim" who died before seeing it. <br /> <br /> 4. The way Luke's character depicted was completely ridiculous. He had to be a debonair playboy, who was once a heritage of the house (and was the real skeptic of this "history") ... and it was just a wine feeling, a bumble bee who couldn't sleep (insomnia) and that was a compulsive liar. <br /> <br /> 5. I was also annoyed how the movie jumped almost in an attempt to restore the original scenes literally (ie, the Four Sisters family and Mrs. Dudley's small opening speech ...) to go out on fancy flights that made me Think more about these other movies than HAUNTING. It doesn't like what he wants to do. <br /> <br /> 6. I missed the movie through the movie. The original was like a Gothic novel so that the story was mostly spoken in the first person, through the eyes of Nel, and we were always with our thoughts. This completely unique touch was completely lost in the new version. They also tried to make four much more heroes. The original Nel was not a bad person, but he was a bitter man (could he have been selfish with an old woman and a stupid sister after sacrificing 11 years of age?) And she liked to moisten her and lost her mood. .. It was almost too good to be true. It was never more visible than the film's climax, where the writer, of course, had looked at GHOST too many times. <br /> <br /> 7. They changed the history of the house and are too much. There was no Abigail Crain (Hugh's daughter, whose legend was in great original versions), had no "companion" and no nursery. There was also no "Grace" (original doctor's wife) and the women of Hugh Crin died completely differently. These changes changed the story of WAY ​​too much. I don't know if the producers of this movie should rejoice that Shirley Jackson is no longer talking about this country or should they ... ANSWER (if I get my drift! Finally, let me leave you a few words from the original Luke (word "house") "Replacing with a movie"!): "This" movie "needs to be burned to the ground and the earth is sprinkled with salt!" My favorite movie is always that. There's no competition for it.
