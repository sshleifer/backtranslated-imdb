I saw this movie t.v. this afternoon and i can't see how anyone can sit through this trash. It's not funny at all and it takes you I.Q. a few notches. I know this film is for kids, but that doesn't mean that writers should take their intelligence for granted. I bet the writers sat around a large wooden table and thought that a) the word "poop" is a big laugh. b) A four-foot boy can dunk in a basket of ten feet high. c) Children should always fight against predators armed with predators, as the kidnappers drop something; and d) 3 months of karate training is needed to win the ninjas with swords. One good thing to say about this movie is that it contains the world's weakest suburb "gang" that couldn't scare anyone. Maybe MST3K boys could laugh at this movie. Don't worry about this flat-ass excuse for the movie.
