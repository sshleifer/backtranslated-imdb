This is one of the worst films I recently saw. When a man says he wants him to have superpower to be able to enjoy oral, I think the film is a childish 14-year-old male fantasy. The bed room scene was up and reduced the intimate moment to a farce of biological functions, similar to the public spread of gas. Of all the other scenes, there was a debate about how little sex they get, how long it has been because they got some when their next sex exchange is and with whom it should be. In addition, dialogue and action were very poor and very compelled, did not feel, and they filled their lack of content with fools. It could have been very funny because the concept is actually interesting, but here it is badly filled. Please don't even think under the age of 16 if you want to see it.
