Sean, you know I think you're the biggest actor in the world, but I can't praise you for that. Comedy is not your strong suit. <br /> <br /> But it wasn't all your fault. Some things were just too difficult to understand. Alfred Lynch did a decent job, but you have to wonder where these starting points came from. <br /> <br /> Once again, Sean ... sorry.
