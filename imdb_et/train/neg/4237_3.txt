JUDAAI was Raj Kanwari's brave movie. In 1997, when such a topic had gone out of the box, he managed to show how greed makes a person and how much a person can go, what he wants to get. The film is, however, damn melodramatic, ridiculous in many places. One wonder why does Anil not buy a TV for her wife? if he serves so much Just show how poor he is? <br /> <br /> Twist is well handled, but handling is done directly from the 80's Johny-Paresh comedy, which is here to entertain and where the painful thumb is even when it doesn't fit the story <br /> <br /> Even there There are several dignified scenes <br /> <br /> Raj Kanwar's direction is enough, although sometimes the music is too melodic, but most songs are forced to <br /> <br /> Anil is doing his part well Sridevi is a great part of it Urmila is decent In the middle of Khan is like the usual Johny Lever is funny, Paresh is irritated Farida is decent
