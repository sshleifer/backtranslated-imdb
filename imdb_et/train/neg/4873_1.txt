This is definitely a stupid, bad taste movie. Eddie Murphy's letters, written as sitcom. He is surrounded by his perfect family, full of good family values. If you are looking for politically correct entertainment, this movie is for you. But if you hate the idea of ​​being the only one who doesn't laugh at funny gags with pop-corn addicts in a movie theater, just escape.
