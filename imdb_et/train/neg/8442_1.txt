GUERNSEY (Maria Kraakman - Belgium / Holland 2005). <br /> <br /> Mousy Maria Kraakman plays Anna in her thirties, who thinks her husband (Fedja van Huet) is cheating on her, but she doesn't dare to face her. He painfully avoids any confrontation with people, his parents and his sister, so we have a mainstream feature film that doesn't do much. We hardly know anything about our background or motivation. Just a woman who seems to be stuck in a dark street, not just during this difficult life. He obviously suffers something, but why do we also have to face the audience? They were very dull and painful for 90 minutes. I usually try to avoid wasting energy on making bad movies. I'll take a hit and roll, but in this case there is a fair warning. How could the land be funded by Nanouk Leopold (largely from publicly funded funds) for Turkey? Obviously, there was no script to talk about. It can be compensated by a brilliant filmmaker with cinematic ideas or just a little more with a complaint. Nothing, just a vaguely defined term, "I want to do something from a woman's point of view". The result is offense rather than respecting a woman's perspective in life. <br /> <br /> To make things even worse, the whole movie doesn't have an interesting picture. I can't think of the pain that could have been seasoned, but Johanna ter Steege is the (small) light in the dark, if possible, if this heavy lack of material. I'm trying to imagine how Leopold tried to lead Maria Kraakman: "Maria, look at the horizon, we'll film you for three minutes, just express sadness." Perfect treatment for insomnia. Get a copy and watch it late in the night, also guaranteeing you sleep. <br /> <br /> Obscura Camera 1/10
