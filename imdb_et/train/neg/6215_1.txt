It was indeed a waste of time ... the film has a weak plot, the story is fragmented and it ends very sharply with many gaps .... although animation is the upper limit. <br /> <br /> When the movie started, I tried to give this suspicion a benefit by saying that it might be interesting at a later stage, but it was never unique. The same plot has been played over and over again, but worse still, the main plot hole was the whole story of how to kill the baddies ... The writer could have done so much more with the whole concept, but he seemed not in his heart and wanted to close the movie as soon as it started. <br /> <br /> In general, there are too many leaps, but they can't provide it.
