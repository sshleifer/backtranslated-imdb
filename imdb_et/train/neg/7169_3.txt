This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. But this little film, Alice and Jared Harris, imitating Christopher Walken, makes this movie fun. Alice's smoking, drinking and unpleasant way to show up when she is called is strange and interesting. I have to confess Jared to Christopher Walken's imitation and Christopher Walken that he promised to participate in the film.
