Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of many Woody movies, probably his 70's later masterpiece (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and most of his 80's / 90's dramas (Hannah, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Men) and women) even liked my recent efforts (Melinda, something else, a little time), but it was exhausting, though I couldn't be worse than in recent years. <br /> <br /> It was loosely drawn - basically a junction between Match Point, the mystery of the murder of Manhattan, and small times, with all the jokes removed - Woody seems to be on the way out, dragging most of his lines and "fun" speeches "I mean, with all due respect ..." over and over until its unsteadiness becomes much empty. <br /> <br /> I know most of the participants are yet to work with him, but they should first read the script - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are so much better - and Woody should be retiring from the camera in the future if he has any about 20 miles. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't be so tragic if we didn't have so many big Woody movies to compare it - but it's clear that his best days are behind him and, on the basis of that effort, Woody should call this day before, if he becomes a joke in the industry. <br /> <br /> Embarrassingly bad
