I think this film is sincerely the second poor in the Dominican film industry. The first 30 minutes of the film are a little funny, but when they change their role in society (men do what women usually do and women do what men usually do), the film falls. Bored and not funny. They promise many things without explanation and the end of the movie is predictable. I didn't like the way Roberto Angel played his character and his little. I went to the movie theater, hoping to see a good job, but I went very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie.
