I saw this movie in my cinema class. I'm glad I didn't see it. I was open to it and was even a little excited. I really like Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood and the rest was interesting. I'm never involved with this movie. Action was great, cinematography was interesting, but the story or rather the lack of it was a problem. The film lacked a central, unifying theme. Was it romance between Norton and Wood? Well, no, not really. Was it west? Sure, but not. I'm all for movies, I recently saw "Brick" and loved it, but the place where this movie went was just there. It was so weird, and if I hadn't been to the whole movie, I would have walked out. Writing was not terrible, but it was just all over the place. By the time this movie ended, I was just terribly confused and wanted it to end earlier. There was something in this movie that didn't resonate, I get more challenging movies like "Fight Club" but I just don't care about the characters.
