First of all, I must be warned that I saw this movie on television and dubbed in English - which could have completely ruined the atmosphere. However, I appreciate what I saw, and I hope it drives people out of this version. I found this movie gently dull. The atmosphere of the whole movie disappears by copying, leaving the slow motion of the stalker movie. Sorry, but in my book, the worst movie is slow, except for a philosophy film. I didn't see a deep philosophical meaning in this film. Maybe I miss something, but I have to say it as I see it. I rated it "1". What I can say is perhaps the US-oriented taste.
