with all the European studios associated with this unit, you think you want at least real photography; but the local color is minimal. <br /> <br /> Irritation # 1 is Mira Sorvino, who uses a Russian accent to play Spanish policeman-WTF? The story is hopelessly confused. It is a supposed romantic story that is deliberately confused - is she a lesbian? - in no way. The policemen in the film are the most stupid that they have been robbing a series of killer films for a long time. There seems to be a message about the Spanish Civil War in the mid-1930s, but since everything has been with it, it is somewhat dead. part of the narrative (what part? who can say), you can never even look good. Earnest Hemingway would be the director of the nose - with my blessings.
