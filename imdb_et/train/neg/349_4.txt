Pot - Boiler when I ever saw it. The alleged thriller who borrowed "Kill a Year", "The Silence of Lambs", even upside down "At Night in the Heat" with a small return to murder, "Strangers on the Train," which is thrown, it fails where everything above, to a large extent, succeeded. Namely, excitement. The plot is a larger book that makes the plot's developments obvious and enthralling, while the direction is not fast and lively. To repel all kinds of spirits, the road had to be driven by a big twist, and it probably isn't obvious either. Connery is clearly slowing down in her old age, barely bothering her experiment with the US accent and seems to be too old to be Hope Lange's husband and father of their gosh-darn children. She even has a father who looks younger than her. Laurence Fishburne can barely live his role and you are confused from the start if he is a bad man or a good man. Someone said that the setbacks should not lie - they are confused. The remainder of the game is only moderately reasonable in their stereotyped roles. The alleged climax also managed to roll, leaving me firmly on the back, not as if the front edge of my seat had to be. A mediocre sloppy Hollywood movie will surely do.
