this movie has everything; dirty camera works, recalling the martini scorcese or oliver stone, the dense "heat" function, the explosive action of the jerry bruckheimer movie, the clever dialogue of the tarantino script, and the epic feel of the "godfather" temperament, but also shows true emotional depth and intensity. his performance reminds me of the image of robert de niro from the dirty bull of jake la motta. Special effects push the boundaries of technology and filmmaking within their boundaries. Independence Day set a standard that this film clearly matched and surpassed. <br /> <br /> A general, good way of working from his list (like the Oscar Night Party Call List!), Stylish places, thrilling action, and a tight script.
