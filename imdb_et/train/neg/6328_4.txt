Why does this film fall below the standards? Ultimately, the answer lies in a poor, humorous script. Thin / average looking for Travolta (looking rather black), and Gross both work very well as two young dads "slippery dressed" but still striking New Yorkers wishing to open their nightclub. Moreover, watching the rest of the movie is just boring. It's so boring that it really isn't worth knowing what's going on at the top of the movie at every level. Kelly Preston obviously publishes a sex task and sexually charged dance with her husband Travolta is one of the few pleasures of the film. Charles Martin Smith is quite fun to see how the KGB horse is "Bob Smith". Personally, I think the film would have been better if the plot had changed a little, so the settings didn't change from NY to Indian Springs, Nebraska (which is in the former Soviet Union)? you see the movie ... It was probably filmed in 1986 when it was ready to release 1987. I think Paramount stopped the release until January 1989 due to an incredible plot. It was reported that they considered it "irrelevant". Nonetheless, this $ 6,000,000 movie earned a slightly embarrassing $ 163,000 in revenue, as it was only released SHORTLY in places like Texas and Colorado before you go straight to the video. This shows the overall BAD quality of this movie.
