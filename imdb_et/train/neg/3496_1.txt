I remember that my parents didn't understand Saturday night when I was 15. They didn't understand Rock's Role and many other things. Now, as I approach my age, I still remember and I find that I understand many of the things my kids love. But it's pathetic. I can't say I've seen what Sarah has seen except for a few performances here and there. They were reasonable. I don't see her special. But this exhibition is so far from what I was waiting for. IMDb Writing has made it possible to hear it. So I started watching this first episode. I turned to this side. Something else is better. Jokes designed for a five-year adult program. Well, Sarah, this adult is moving you. I just don't think anyone actually funded this comedy. The only good thing I can say is that there are so many bad jokes that keep such embarrassment.
