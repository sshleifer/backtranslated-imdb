I hear rumors coming up "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates Blu-ray Disc". The progress made over the last 25 years from Steady-camist CGI is interesting to see if the franchise can be revived. I hope this will help to remove the bad taste left by my mouth in the whole Magnavision demonstration fiasco. <br /> <br /> And yes ... "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates Betamax's video jacket" was a brilliant milestone in entertainment history. After the initial "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates a compact cartridge" and even sticky "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates an 8-lane tape" that would have waited for such a brilliant cinema? I'm crying for that right now.
