I logged in to comment on this movie terribly stupid. In addition to being an executive decision or one or another terrorist attack on the Air Force, it is a film that makes you evaluate a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well. It's hard to blame the actors if they get a stupid, clich√©-driven script to work with. It's bad enough if you mute once in a movie when an insult to your intelligence arises, but if you find yourself bothering again, you have to conclude that the director is not the brightest pear in the film business, nor do the producers decide to bring the story first. Most often, low-rent actors, who can apologize for doing this, because they probably showed money and exposition, not that getting that joke-movie will earn them awards or recognition. It may end up being embarrassing because they have such a bad appraisal to involve it in the loser. I see no point in making a plot summary, or even any examples to prove my case, because that would be a cruel and unusual punishment that no one accepts in this crime. Just as studying well-made films can inspire you to do good, skillfully assembled art and beauty, the only thing you can learn from viewing this monstrosity is NOT what to do and what MUST NOT! Be warned.
