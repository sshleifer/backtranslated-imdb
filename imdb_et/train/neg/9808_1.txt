The worst show I've ever seen. The story is a group of teenagers who have some inexplicable reasons that have super power and when they use some special device, they become strange, poorly designed suits. Action, if they are not slowed down in costumes, is decent. Surely not the good, but not the worst thing I've ever seen. However, when wearing costumes, the actors' behavior gets worse off; much, much worse. Hyper-animated idiots have a lot of unnecessary movements. Even when they talk, they see they have seizures. Roisto is a stangider as a ranger. Every episode, some weak, idiotic villain, comes up with some plans to destroy the Rangers. He then sends a hyper-animated alien force against the attackers. Then the Rangers start their 10-hour conversion animation, then the foreigners destroy it. Then, a poorly designed villain, who can be either an armored villain who actually looks and acts as an evil, humanitarian creature-like creature, whose trumpets are attached to its back, showing the obvious signs of slowing down mental development. Power Rangers are fighting the villain, then the villain becomes Godzilla, whether it is a rain cloud or a nuclear rocket (yes, they shoot the kernels of beings and beings become giant). Power Rangers spend 5 minutes in hyper-animated and call their own horns, which are obviously the toys that show manufacturers used special effects to make them real. Power Rangers wins, the villain gets crazy, they all teach a "valuable" lesson and the show ends. That's it. Twenty-five minutes of brainwashing, fake kung fu fight.
