Nikolai Gogol's story "Viy" has been re-filmed and published on US video via home video via Faith Films. <br /> <br /> The original story concerns a priest who has to look at the witch's body only with his faith to protect him. With great expansion and placement in America, though clearly filmed in Russia (houses, clothing and furnishings are all wrong signs despite English), it's a strange film that doesn't really work. hard to be in backwoods of America but clearly not. I'm not sure why they did it, even after watching a DVD disc). Another problem is duplication, which is daunting. It's done so that everyone speaks if their lips are not in the camera or they are voices that don't even fit with lip valves. I don't know if his Faith Films guilt or the story of the producers who hoped to shoot the film west (unmasked). <br /> <br /> The film is not very good. As I have said, it has all kinds of technical issues that make it odd for ball training. Despite the really good-looking horror images, the movie never works as a horror movie. Like a film that creates faith, it is too confused in this publication to make anyone feel closer to God. <br /> <br /> Considering the choice I would give, even at a low price. My suggestion would be to find the story of Vii in the 1960s, which leads to some trembling as well as some insights into God's faith.
