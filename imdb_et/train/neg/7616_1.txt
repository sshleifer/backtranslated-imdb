The good news is a film based on the supposed myth of the Aztec and an unusually high degree of American (such a word). The bad news is that it was born dead at birth. together. "Diablo legend" is clearly "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" Feed for any future uprising. <br /> <br /> I don't think it can even be called B-film. The production values ​​are so sad that I had to feel that I was watching a film from a variety of exhibitions or an 8-meter backyard photographed by a group of school students. <br /> <br /> SOME SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The main plot line seemed interesting enough to attract me. California-based rural sheriff finds dew containing a Aztec demon and accidentally opening a malicious community. His daughters, one hot and one at home, a team with a gringo FBI man and a priest to try a demon drill. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the zombie scenes that were ever seen in previous Undead movies are restored poorly. These zombies are walking more than the Nutty Professors Army as the undead! From a demon perspective, supposed infrared scenes are nothing special? and he seems to be looking back a lot (on the contrary, moving forward). And the scene where the priest attracts the demon to move quickly from caves is ridiculous! In fact, it really looks like it's a comic effect, though I know it wasn't! I was waiting for Benny Hill's music to start playing, and the whole gang of gombs would start to run the priest across the beach. <br /> <br /> Of course, the voice of Darth Vader / Field of Dreams that calls the FBI agent becomes even comic. Again, most of this cheese ball! The scenario director and writer Robert Napton should win SOMEthing for this effort! (How would life-long blackballing like "Hollywood 10?") What I see now is rated at a 10-step level of 1.5. I'm afraid it might be generous! <br /> <br /> Is there any good thing about this movie? Well, Lindsey Lofaso looks pretty hot as a younger daughter of a dead sheriff. This is probably the reason why his home-grown sister (Calvi Pabon) really went away from home! Fred Estrado is reasonably decent as an FBI representative. I don't know if Mario Soto, who played Father Rodriguez, is the same Mario Soto who Cincinnati for red? If so, he would have had baseball. In fact, they would not have been able to do anything worse if they had gone to the baseball issue and called it a "challenge to demons!" <br /> <br /> When I find out that it was actually a Kino class project for a community college, I'm sorry. It may be good enough for B or even B + when the gang got back to the college camcorder! "The Blair Witch Project" proved that a cool, fun movie can be made in the shoe capital. "Diablo legend," but did not see that he had rubber or shoes! It was a low budget, with little talent, little everything. The final scene and the last 10 seconds of the movie is the only light or creative moment. <br /> <br /> I rented it for $ 3.45. I could have spent that hamburger better!
