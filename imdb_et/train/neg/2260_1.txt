Oh Dear, Jerry can be an undisputed king of talkshow, but movies are a completely different ball game, and he's out of his league. The script of this movie is so poor that it has to be believed and sad to see both vaguely familiar actors like Michael Dudikoff (King of the 80's B'movie), Michael Jai White (last seen on the Sci Fi flop) "Spawn", as well as " Surviving the Games ‚ÄùWilliam MacNamara (who only plays half of the movie in a funny situation)! If you're a fan of Jerry, stay with your TV show because it's an hour and a half. After I sat through it, I was able to catch a Rocky 5 on TV last half hour, which looked like a cinematic masterpiece, I think it says more than enough! <br /> <br />
