As a great fan of David Mamet's films and games, especially his first film, House of Games, which was also starring Joe Mantegna, I was expecting great things about this movie. Instead, I found the lack of superficiality and reliability of the film. Racial slurs are thrown out without any sense or meaning, in the hope of creating a racial tension that has never been realized for me. Identity has been completely reassessed and men become "heroes" for no apparent reason. Because of the oath given as a police officer, the leader refuses to do one of the relatively small activities that do not harm anyone and save lives, and yet carry out one more violent and very illegal activity, but refuses to take action on the minor. In addition, there is a very unbelievable sub-block with a man who killed his family, introduced only for the sake of the plot, which was all but was advertised with Skywriting, and the police responded to this stretch. Needless to say, having been waiting for David Mamet another exciting thriller, I was very disappointed. 3 out of 10
