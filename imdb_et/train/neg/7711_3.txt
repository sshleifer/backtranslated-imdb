The heart of this film was in the right place, no matter where his brain was. <br /> <br /> "Attack" is basically a robber "Fly!" (two years before - nice going.) about what happens when vegetables, or fruits in this case, attack. <br /> <br /> Filming any kind of movie magic (stop motion, papier-mache tomato on skateboard elements), people watching screen-tomatoes, people who throw basketball-sized tomatoes to the actors on the screen, tomatoes really attack all their leaves . <br /> <br /> Then it's Mason Dixon (Miller) and a group of spies, which I wouldn't want to save the day on any side of the government. Of course, the worst newspapers (Taylor), who in the worst of times, dancing and singing military soldiers, dubbed Japanese scientists, a man dragging a parachute and a samurai sword ... and yes, San Diego Chicken before he made it big. <br /> <br /> Here the gags are not so big. In fact, you might want to improve yourself after watching them. Part of the dialogue is inevitably bad ("Please go through the ketchup" - nothing to say about the tomatoes.) And when "puberty love" goes ... well, I can't blame the tomatoes for shrinking to hear it. <br /> <br /> What is good about it? Well, I liked the song song and the original credits, and there was a scene with four people at once, well done at the same time. ... it's about that. <br /> <br /> Three stars. Not "Killer" comedy, but it is trying. <br /> <br /> Peace.
