The "Killer Tomato Attack" mainly consists of puzzling, poorly assembled footage in search of a movie. There is no point in the plot, and the different characters are out of the picture and out of the picture without explanation. Looking at this foolish deception, it feels like so many other comments are so precisely adhered to: that it is easy to make a cheap, low-quality film and then use the corner of parody as an excuse for its cheapness and low quality (one scene, female swimmers are scared of them close to floating tomatoes, how far can "incredible stop" go to parody?). The title song is great. (* 1/2)
