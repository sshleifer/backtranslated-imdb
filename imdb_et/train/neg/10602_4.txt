This movie is mostly crap and the only reason to watch this movie is the stars of Jean-Claud Vam Damme in this movie. There are some good activities in this movie and the best is at the end of the movie. <Br / The functioning of this film is so bad and its worst behavior I've ever seen, and two actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White can't act ALL. And this movie must be one of Jean-Claud Vam Dammes's worst movies, he has done and if u what to watch him in one of his great movie u should look for blood sport, kickboxer or steep death. <br /> <br /> All this movie is crap / OK and my rating is 4 out of 10.
