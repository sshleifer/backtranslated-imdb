What "no noise" does is that we understand its character. Tim Robbins plays Obsessive New Yorker, who is no longer able to cope with the noise of the city, especially car alarms. It's a strange idea for a film that has about as much creativity as "Death Wish." It's smart in points; especially the scene where our hero tries to read through Hagel, "I'm too stupid to figure it out." He reads and reads the confused section again, we read it and don't get it. Throughout the film, there is a constant interference in interference and city noise. All in all, we do not really help to understand our hero who allows it to be destroyed by all of his marriages and pulled aside from by-products to dig deeper into his person. <br /> <br /> Making a movie yourself is too remarkable to spot your own sound problems, dirty editing and visible boom mike. No, "Noise" is not all bad. William Hurt is at least colorful. At least the end won't go down. In general, it drives a logistical point that you probably haven't thought about. At least I wasn't. Although everything is ninety minutes long, it couldn't end before. The story pulled away and seemed to be lost as soon as it began. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies you can see at the film festival, but it probably isn't for distribution. Check this on a DVD if you are a true participant in the project. Otherwise, skip it.
