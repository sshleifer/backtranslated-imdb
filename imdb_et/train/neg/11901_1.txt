"Land of Plenty" is not a film. This is a tombstone for the career of German director Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> Many knew it at The Million Dollar Hotel, and now Land is Plenty quite clear; Wenders has not lost it, has actually become the leader of BAD, creating terribly weak and superficial stories and scenes. <br /> <br /> It can be said that "the time you lose it" comes to every director, but the Wenders case is extreme. Just as he would completely forget everything he knew about the cinema and started again - only to get sloppy results. <br /> <br /> In a few words, this film does not deserve your time.
