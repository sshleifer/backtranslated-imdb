I'm a big fan of Ziyi Zhang and goes to every movie to see what led me to Purple Butterfly. As much as I wanted to like this movie, I have to agree with many others who have commented on it. It is very confusing and also very slow. Since the entire film seems to have been captured with the camera, its essential parts are out of focus. <br /> <br /> The film has very little dialogue and there is not much to talk about. There are endless scenes of people around cigarette smoking or sitting in a room where there is no conversation. It is also a confusing and difficult-to-follow way to shift the time of the film. Even having read a number of comments and a general idea of ​​what the film was like, I still had a hard time understanding what was going on. I knew in advance that the film wasn't much like the previous Ziyi Zhang movies, but he waited for him to see something else, but unfortunately I was finally disappointed. He never returns in this movie, although in most cases he has nothing to smile about. I could have done without sex-scenes because they were about the same sexual and obviously without the participants, as you might expect.
