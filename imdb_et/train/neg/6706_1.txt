I saw this step several years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival when I recall. I liked it, it showed great potential. I think most people here in the movie are blasting because the film seemed hobbled together (the filmmaker's own entrance to the official site - a short was exhibited in the "rough cut"). <br /> <br /> But it was a simple comedy. I think many people are trying to read too much in comedy. All they have to do is laugh - that's all. I did it just during the show, so it reached that level. Just my 2 cents.
