A truly genuine Canadian-German co-production, the ever-wonderful Rosanna arquette, plays an actor whose teenage daughter defines the term "problem child" again - some uears before the "action" that the child killed by her father and mother took offspring. Now she has moved to northwestern United States to get started, but her child still has the problem of being committed to her mother. It is actually dedicated to killing anyone who can be seen as a threat to their bond. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mandy Schaeffer (as a daughter) kills more than people - she offers such a terrible job she also wipes through a movie, although inconsistent script, useless direction, and terrible music (see sax for the first time she your bikini-covered bodybuilding first displays) doesn't help; we should find our sexy and scary, but it fails in both stories. Almost completely unfortunate and not bad enough to be amusing (not to mention that Arquette and Schaeffer aren't really a mother and a daughter), all sympathy to Miss Arquette and Jurgen Prochnow who both deserve much more than this and both (especially Rosanna is the only reasonable reason why someone is sitting through this farrago. <br /> <br /> One production company called Quality International Films - not after three hours of love, Lies and murder "(two short productions) has such" you have to joke "credit.
