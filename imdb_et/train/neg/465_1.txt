When I was in the cinema the other day, I went to Blonde and Blonder, but it seemed like it could be a cute movie. Who knows? I think I'm sure most people robbed Romy and Michelle before they saw it, Blonde and Blonder could just have been another secret treasure that was over. But when I started to look at it: CEO Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew I was scary. Not only that, but both, considered to be the peak of heat: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, not insulting them, but they weren't out of date and they play roles that I thought were more for women who should be in their 20s, not in their 40s. The story was just bad and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Dee and Dawn are your fools stereotypical blonde, they really have no idea what's going on in the world, it's really sad. But if the girls are somehow mistaken for the murderers of the murder, the police officers have their own story and they call the geniuses of the girls because of their "ignorance bliss" attitude. They are designed to make a "hit" for a man and they think they just "show him a good time", but the real assassin is tagged and wants this case and kill the girls. > <br /> Denise and Pam see the discomfort on the screen and almost as they read the script before. I know it was supposed to be a stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, it went uncomfortable and was just unnecessary. Would I ever recommend it? Not a million years later, girls are now trying to maintain their sex-kitten status, it's more desperate and Blonde and Blonder are a huge blonde BOMBshell. <br /> <br /> 1/10
