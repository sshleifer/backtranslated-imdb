This is a typical example of technically highly qualified video clips / advertisers trying to make their first full-length movie. On the one hand, images, camera, lighting, CGI and even sound are very polished and have a truly "expensive" look and feel. Even the actors show a certain potential - to the point where even the best actor could not hide the poor plot. <br /> <br /> In this case, this is not a bad plot, but hardly a plot. br /> <br /> So 50% of the dialogue "What the hell was this?", "What was that?" and "What the hell was that?" In no case will any sign or audience be provided with the slightest response. Most of the other dialogues have the feeling that there has never been any dialogue book and the actors had to freely improvise on a plot that was never explained to them. <br /> <br /> The only reason Skye Bennet's performance may be so good is that his creative autistic girl did not allow them to give the tragic terrible dialogue that other participants had to deal with. So he could just show his acting talent that the rest of the majority could not even close. I mean, there is not one actor in the world who could make up for the dialogue like this: <br /> <br /> Ben: Is this real? Emily: Stop it. Ben: Mass-psychosis? Jon: Someone has to take over this situation. Ben: This situation cannot be controlled. Not you, no one. Emily: Not by you. Ben: No. <br /> <br /> I got goosebumps. But not for horror, more for a terrible attempt. At some point, I felt ashamed that the actors had added this to their debate. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for great technical work.
