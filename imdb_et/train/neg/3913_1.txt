This movie is a good example of how to destroy a book within 109 minutes. Except for the names of characters that are very similar to the book on the film. The book is full of strong latino symbols and is usually represented by non-latinos. The film has no character development and we have no reason to love or angry these characters. And deleting the full generation is unforgivable. Isabel Allende has written a powerful book and the book is what you should read!
