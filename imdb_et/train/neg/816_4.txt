In the 1970s, WPIX ran "Superman Adventures" every afternoon for a few years. Every time we should, we can cure if they prefer "Superman and Mole Men". I've always been waiting for these days. Looking at it recently, I was surprised how bad it really was. <br /> <br /> It was not bad because of special effects or lack of them. True, George Reeves's Superman costume was pretty bad, the edge of the polyester probably used him to be more visible. And true, Mole Men's costumes were even worse. What was supposed to be a hairy coat wouldn't have been deceiving for a decade, because zippers, sleeves and bad fabrics that were poorly adjusted in bags were all painful. But these were forgiving shortcomings. Over and over again, Superman couldn't do anything to prevent the situation from getting worse. Lynch mob looking for creatures? Instead of rounding up the hysterical crowd or looking for the creatures themselves, he is reshaping, explaining the dangers of the situation to Levi and the PR man. Beings are at an angle? Again, he looks around and speaks, but doesn't save them until they are shot. Luke Benson, the city rabbi-rouser, shoots him? Attempting to murder some sensible people, but Superman releases the man over and over to create more problems. Superman had quite a few ways to nip the problem, but they never used them. <br /> <br /> Both George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their symbols well, seemingly instantly in their roles. . If only they had a better manuscript.
