Well, I could get into the plot, but it's just me. The unheard of camera movements sometimes is a charming vintage quality on this film. Occasionally, acting is occasional and entertaining with occasional interventions involving somewhat clad women who were great. The climax is confused and confused, but still ... err riveting to Stella Stevens. <br /> <br /> Stunts are interesting, especially in the 70s Las Vegas. At the end, there is some jerky hand-held camera movement that thinks for some time. But I don't think I'm gonna start watching a DVD.
