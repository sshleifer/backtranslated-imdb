Completely pretentious nonsense. The material is boring, boring, boring, and most of the cast would not even have understood Allen's earlier films. And in order to listen to Ununny Will Ferrell, his Woody Allen imitation again makes another level (though mysteriously popular) even more. It would seem that the 70-year-old obsolete Allen should have gone to work when the time of day was in the new century. <br /> <br /> I really tried to participate in the movie, but it was just impossible; my snyapses couldn't shoot it slowly. So, instead of kicking and killing in the afternoon, I stood up, left my wife and daughter in the theater and went to a car where I had a really good book to read again (George Bailey's great tome 30 years ago, "Germans.") The day turned out to be pretty good, thanks to Wood.
