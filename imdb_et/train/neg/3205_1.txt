I noticed in my remarks that most of the people who are discussing this film rely on MST3K's encouragement to comment. This is fairly fair (after all, how it got the most widespread exposure), but having failed to see "ultimate justice" in its original form, I would just like to share some thoughts and comments uncut First of all, the original version is a bit of a MST3K transfer more uniform, mainly because of the scene of the exposition between Rossano Brazz and Venantino Venantini (I could use the names of the characters) instead of the actors, but I just love typing the words "Venantino Venantini", explaining why Venantini's fleeing character cannot just leave Malta immediately. (This is not a very CONVINCING plot point, but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it.) Did this scene be cut just for a while or because it didn't offer much to the reefs, then I don't know. <br /> <br /> Another original drawing point: the betrayal of Venantino Venantini by Joe Don Baker, which is not seemingly invisible in the MST3K version, can be explained by an earlier, extremely unpleasant scene in which Venantini rapes her in the shower. Although it gives him a motive to turn against him, the whole scenario is really ... icky. (There is no other word for this.) <br /> <br /> Some moments of MST values ​​("Son Son" and "Deja vu" Sheriff Shooting) were pure TV-printed editing that they worked with and from the original movie missing. <br /> <br /> One scene I would like to have had a version of MST3K: Joe Don asks a Maltese police officer to come out before entering some people, because "they see it the same, they don't work together." But Joe Don herself carries her ridiculous cowboy-slash sheriff dress with a shiny mark! I can't imagine why they gave this wonderful opportunity to make him joke ... <br /> <br /> One final observation on the original "Uncompleted Justice", uncut version: Why, oh, why, you feel the need to put Venantino Venantini's bare butt on the screen?
