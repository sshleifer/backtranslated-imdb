Every movie that starts with a cow's career cannot afford much. As for the bobbin stereotypes, as it was 50 years ago, I was there and it just wasn't. OK, every kibbutz was just a small part of what was shown in the movie (like the youngsters who robbed the kitchen at night), but you can't show the whole bitch as full of them - do we say - naughty traits. Every bitch had its own problems, but there wasn't any bits of it. The views of Israel were great. I still remember my youth in this garden of Eden, called Emek. Yes, and the operation was also good, so you can see that it wasn't all black - just a false portrayal - probably also useful.
