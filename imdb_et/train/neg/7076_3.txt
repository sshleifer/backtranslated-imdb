Drivers say 100mph seems to be fast until you have ridden 150 and 150mph seems fast until you are 250. <br /> <br /> OK. <br /> <br /> The Andalusian dog looks breathtaking until you have seen Eraserhead, and the Eraserhead seems breathless until you've seen Started. <br /> <br /> And the born seems breathtakingly odd until you've seen the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. Race fans, there is nothing in the whole world movie like works by C. Frederic Hobbs. <br /> <br /> Alabama Ghost comes as close to each of his films as to have a single plot, and includes only hippies, rock concerts, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, wizards, corrupt international corporations, elephants and Mystery Gas. And Fabulous Woodmobile, of course, to the Sunset District in San Francisco. <br /> <br /> What's really amazing is that someone gave him a lot of money to make Alabama a ghost. There are kits, lighting, hundreds of extras, costumes, lots and lots of effects. Somehow Alabama Ghost makes such a mistake. You look like a terrible piece of cheese like an evening horror or a plutonium baby, and at least some of the strange thing is excusable because they obviously made a movie on their Discover cards. But Alabama Ghost was made with a real budget and it is EVIL. I mean, I have a script about Thunder Bay, a living cannibal tribe in Ontario, building a secret temple in Twizzler's forest, and no one beat MY door where a checkbook is thrown - how did this man get money from Four Fourfold Films?
