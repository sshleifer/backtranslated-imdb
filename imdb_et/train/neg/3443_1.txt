I watched this movie last night and hoped for the best when I looked at all the cool trailers. Even if the DVD cover was good .If I immediately started to look at it, I thought like others "oh my God what it is." moments that were a bit creepy, but then the mood was destroyed by stupid music. There was an opera and opera that was supposed to be tense scenes. rent and hidden by cover art. Nothing against music, it was just in the wrong parts of the movie. No movie has any idea what they're doing. Kate showed a flash, which means it was a lightning storm at sea. It would have been more interesting, but it didn't happen. It wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen since they're all unknown and it's their first film. Another reason I was frustrated was the point on the plot. At first, two men saw all the teen boats, then finally there was only one girl and the others were either her imaginary friends or were ghosts, which I am not sure because it was very poorly depicted. WhyteFox, who wrote a comment here, says it is a real story. He believes in ghosts and spirits and says that the film filmed in this film is a haunting boat. It was not mentioned in this film that this is a true story. I have never experienced anything like this personally, but I don't say it's impossible. I think if someone is interested in renting this movie, do it at your own risk.
