This happened after this copy. I am not mine and if I had spent my money, I would be responsible and demanded! I can say that this would be a terrible student film. There is no understanding of the film carrier. By acting, God is terrible, this story would have been rejected from the original Twilight Zone series as unoriginal and flat, and the change in the warp response to "ghost" is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> agree only that the glowing reviews of this movie come from friends and family. I'm afraid it's not even badly bad. <br /> <br /> Extreme amateur! <br /> <br /> Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
