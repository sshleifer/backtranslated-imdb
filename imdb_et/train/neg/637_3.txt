Good Earth is in no way an excellent film, it's common. Maybe it was different in the 1930s, but who would like to see a farmer's life. It's not very interesting to me. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni are doing a great job, but the film is too long. I could have told you that this movie ends with the first act. In short, Wang Lung (Muni), a small time farmer who doesn't want to be like his father, turns out to be just like him. Both love their women as they are in their death beds. The film makes a complete 360 ​​from generation to generation. This film did not have good character actors or funny moments, it was just frustrating things that remained a farmer during the crisis.
