This movie was a disaster from start to finish. Interviews with Bono and The Edge and the performers themselves have been mixed with "Next Generation Beautiful Losers". It leaves little time for Leonard Cohen's clips, who toss everyone else in the movie with their commanding but gentle presence, wisdom and humor. The rest is too busy trying to canonize him as Leonard or some Old Testament prophet. Many performances are forgotten superfluous interpretations (especially Rufus & Martha Wainright) or blessings. Only Beth Orton and Anthony received Leonard's own versions with little restriction. Long pseudo-avant-garde gestures are sprinkled throughout the movie, like many concert and interview frames, red sphere top focus, fresh blurred camera work, digital delays on some Leonard Cohen comments (making it harder) to hear what is said) and a horrible, pretentious low drone many interview segments (gravity test?). For a real thing, see the BBC's documentary songs from 1988.
