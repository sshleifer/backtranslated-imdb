This Charles outing is decent, but it's a pretty low key result. Marlon Brando stands out. There's a sub-block with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland, who forget to develop and it hurts a little movie. I'm still trying to understand why Charlie wants to change her name. Every movie "Charles" has been pretty bad.
