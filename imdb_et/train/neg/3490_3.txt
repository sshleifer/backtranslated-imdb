Having enjoyed Jean Arthur's "Devil and Miss Jones", my interest was the highest, so I tried to sit with this second string to explore the jockey's death, but I didn't finish it. Arthur, photographed in gauzy, a movie magazine fashion, wants a former spouse William Powell or some other marriage fiery, but I never knew him because this character is just one line of wisecracke (he is a type of hero, inclined to comic curiosity, but one once in a grumble - like all women in these 30s comedies - glows). William Powell had a lot of time to work with Miss Arthur, but you never know about the end result; they see inconvenience next to each other, hesitating about their torture. An actor who plays Powell's lie is embarrassing and pregnant women are laughing.
