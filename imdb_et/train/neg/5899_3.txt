By all the shoulders, Miike and his work have gone through. I sat through this flick tonight. I thought if it's half as good as Ring, as I expected these comments, it's worth my time. <br /> <br /> There is no such happiness. <br /> <br /> All I have to do is find the next big director (or writer), but I don't think Miike is it. I have no masters of fine arts in NYU, but I know a lot about it: horror film has to be fast. It must also give the viewer more loyalty than the film does. <br /> <br /> With this movie, my head was shaking. Some of the scenes in the end-point dropped so badly, I went into the fridge and left it when Kou Shibasaki looked at the camera seemingly until the end of the minute, his eyes wide and his mouth agape. A famous director who made a claim, and I paraphrase, can make the film by switching the camera to a beautiful woman and letting it roll. Kou isn't a good enough actor to do this job. She looks at the undead girl worse than the scenes I remember. And he is not the only one who makes deer in headlamps. other cast members obviously need to mimic this failure. The script gives them little room to do a lot of other time too much time. <br /> <br /> I like Asian cinema. Hong Kong's friction over the past 30 years, Korean horror like "Phone" and "Koma", Ang Lee's work, some trashy, but fun filipino movies with free sex and fighting, as well as others. Chakushin Ari could have done without it.
