This apocalyptic zombie film strives to be cruel and shocking; but MASSING OF MASSES comes out when some rigid foot zombies stand on the streets. In Rhode Island, the government is playing a zombie epidemic known as the Lazarus virus by manipulated newspapers and television stations. Channel 5 TV News a few daring, but stupid, soul, feels that his audience has been given the wrong hope and perception of the real danger. The green reporter (Racheal Morris) and his operator (William Garberina), with the help of the military envoy (Patrick Cohen), threaten life and limbs to play "live" on the air to show service. Do yourself a favor and don't look. This thing is obviously a very low budget and it comes to feel that the high school game is bad. Acting is cruel and the meat's hungry zombies are almost comical. Michael Propster, William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan also appear. MASSING MASSES should be left to starvation.
