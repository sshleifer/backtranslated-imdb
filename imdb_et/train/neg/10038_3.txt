The film has no style, ie original style. everything seems to be copied, including action, first performances in the movie, songs, dialogue, etc. etc. Yes, there were beginners, as in the beginning, when the car is shown as UP **** and a few seconds later it starts to fall down the hill with the number MH ****. It was one of many cinematic works :) There was something good in the movie? yes, for karen fans, if any, in Kareena bikini. Akshay fans, his dialogues and action stunts. That's it. nothing else. So look at it at your own risk and don't blame the director or actors. The director is already crazy and actors, I'm sorry.
