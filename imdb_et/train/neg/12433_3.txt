I like to keep my reviews short and simple, but it comes a lot. You cannot win the original two for a number of reasons, including Chris Columbus's leading talent. I can't even believe that these people are considered actors. <br /> <br /> Pain and sit back. The story was a complete joke about a secret chip and Russian terrorists trying to get it back. Terrible, rent one of the original towing and enjoy yourself! <br /> <br /> The movie wasn't even set during the Christmas season as the original. The home alone was turned into a fun Christmas family hostile movie with no morale or plot!
