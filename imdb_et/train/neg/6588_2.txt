Here are some of the most blurry issues in this movie. Seriously, the terrible "twists" are everywhere. <br /> <br /> 2) The narrative jumps at the right time, which is good if it's well done, but it is not. <br /> <br /> 3) Flat characters that do not develop so much that they remain completely static or change significantly without good reason. <br /> <br /> 4) Big: HORRIBLE ACTING. Almost every person on the top. <br /> <br /> The following are some of the best points in the movie: 1) Lead is a good looking guy. <br /> <br /> As I see it, there are only two types of people in this movie: a) People who can sit for 90 minutes just because the lead is attractive. <br /> <br /> b) People who often think of themselves, "I like the Hollywood dreck, full of clich√©s and exaggeration, but if I could watch it in Korean ..." There are many Korean cinemas, so why waste your time with garbage?
