I am clearly disadvantaged here. I haven't seen the first two films in this series, although I've seen a lot of Larry Cohen's movies. Series fans think it's a good movie. Judging by this, it was quite boring. <br /> <br /> You never really look at the face of the manic police (Robert Z'Dar), but what I saw was quite grim. The scenes of death seem to be staged to eat most of the film, not to give any excitement. Perhaps, when I saw the NC-17 director's paragraph, I may be more impressed. <br /> <br /> Graduation with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany and Robert Davi was quite intense. the best part of the movie.
