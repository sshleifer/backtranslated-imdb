David Arquette is a young and naive home security vendor under Stanley Tucci's wing. Arquette is a golden boy who appreciates Kate's great sales at his first call to a widow. <br /> <br /> Capshaw and his bad son Ryan Reynolds. Things go well with <br /> <br /> Arquette, she appears in security features ads <br /> <br /> sure and falls in love with Capshaw. <br /> <br /> Then Tucci and her right-wing woman, Mary McCormack, gave her a little secret - they sometimes broke their <br /> <br /> house to scare them and get neighbors to buy the company's security systems. Arquette decides not to take part in <br /> <br /> involving Capshaw with his family and living through life with a smile on the face. Then someone at Capshawi breaks home and murders him and his son. Arquette suspects Tucci and sets a number of traps, resulting in a weapon for his <br /> <br /> superior, as Tucci claims to be innocent. <br /> <br /> In the stage game, "Alarmist doesn't open well. <br /> <br /> Scenes where Arquette takes Capshaw to meet his parents are badly played and completely uncomfortable. /> <br /> playing with Capshawi when he drunk and says that Arquette's mother, Michael Learned is sexually explicit, others <br /> <br /> as these scenes, there is not much to do for Capshaw, but he does a lot of what he has given. <br /> <br /> Stanley Tucci, who looks like Terry O'Quinn, is a riot like the owner of a security company, he's a slipper who really doesn't understand the moral excitement of arquette But when she turns around when Arquette kidnaps her, she's fun ... Mary <br /> <br /> McCormack seems to be cared for for a bigger role, but <br /> <br /> he mostly relocates and agrees with Tucci. Ryan Reynolds <br /> <br /> It's too old to play a foolish teenager, but he's funny, especially <br /> <br /> u Arquette. <br /> <br /> The scenario will soon be romantic comedy until dark comedy <br /> <br />. The Capshawi meeting with parents is completely unmotivated, except to give him a reason to get out of town to allow someone to break into his house. Capshaw and Reynolds are in the movie just <br /> <br /> to give Arquette a reason to revenge Tucci. <br /> <br /> Arquette, who has proven to be a good actor, is terrible. It depends on the constipation of looting it got through these <br /> <br /> AT&T ads and it is not strong enough to build it. <br /> <br /> A weak film around. Indeed, Reynolds could have been a better choice in the role. <br /> <br /> Dunski's direction is good, not something that won the Oscar quickly. <br /> <br /> Christophe Beck's light jazz score resembles the type of movie that this <br /> <br /> film is trying to be, and it's really memorable. <br /> <br /> Despite the pluses, Arquette's failure is a driver and the schizophrenic quality of the script sink into the movie. I don't recommend it. <br /> <br /> It is rated for physical violence, weapon violence, some truth, <br /> <br /> strong embarrassment, short female nudity, sexual content, strong sexuality <br /> <br /> references and the situation of adults.
