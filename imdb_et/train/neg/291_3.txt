The film version of Sandra Bernhard's one-woman off-Broadway exhibition is amazingly pretentious. Sandra spoofs salon activities and superstars, but her irony is just interesting and fun. His fans say he is terribly honest and that may be true. But he's also a gentle, unapologetic, in-your-face bravado that doesn't fit well in the movie in this genre. She doesn't want to do a nice thing - and she's definitely not making friends - and it will always rub a lot of people wrong. But even if you meet him halfway, his material is seriously lacking here. The filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as a senior executive, but even though he did not manage, the film has a cold and isolated signature on it. Bernhard wrote the exhibition with John Boskovich; their more striking touch was that all Sandra's in-house audiences were looking bored - a feeling that many real viewers would probably share. * 1/2 from ****
