... but it must be the slowest adaptation of Christmas carol. And it takes some of the activities that have different lifetime efforts. Don't do me wrong - I have nothing against Cicely Tyson. I enjoyed it enormously in other roles (see for example Sipsey biscuits in green tomatoes). But the script gives it something other than chewing the landscape. And chew it with Tiny Tim's enthusiasm that links the Christmas goose. <br /> <br /> Give me classics at any time: Alastair Sim, 1951. An exception might be Scrooged, everyone else is simply an effort to understand Christmas's past, present, or future Spirit.
