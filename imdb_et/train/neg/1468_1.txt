Wonderful cast wasted worthless script. Ten or more adults are reviving the summer camp where they participated as young people. Can it happen in a million years? It's just fantasy and boring. Will they become teenagers again? Do they reenact their pranks, games, good times? They can try, but in the end the answer is no. Is there any intrigue? Any relationship? Horror? Comedy? None of the above. The way someone can be for this generation's entertainment is beyond me. I wanted to like this movie; I tried to like this movie, but my brain refused.
