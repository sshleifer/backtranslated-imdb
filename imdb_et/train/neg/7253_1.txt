We rented a DVD, hoping for a good Western country. The film was beautiful and the scenes were reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. Here are the problems with my movie. <br /> <br /> In the first part, why exactly a bad guy kills the owner of the mine? It is not really connected to the movie, except to determine how bad it was and that it is hiding. <br /> <br /> A bank employee who was bad is just too bad to make a convincing decision to hire killers for his employers. Keep us at least away. No signs have been created for bank owners or bank employees at all. <br /> <br /> A very long delay in how much happens. <br /> <br /> The absurd assumption that Martin still needed a judge to see the gang admitted to killing laws. It is even more absurd that he admits that the judge and judge do not listen to the sheriff guy. even more ridiculous that Martin hangs his rope and the rope breaks, then the sheriff takes him to the gun to finally return his city and save his spouse from a bad banker. Wouldn't he just return the gang to the rescue and arrest bad banks after the gang was sent quickly? Just send the judge a note that the gang admitted before he was killed on the trail ???? !!! In general, it is a very sad act and the idea of ​​a movie.
