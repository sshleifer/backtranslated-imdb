Jeremy Northam is fighting a "Total Recall" clone script and a disposable romantic game to make life confusing. Lucy Liu stops working from a wooden beginning to a laborious finish. You can't laugh when you watch his interviews on DVD when he uses the term "Femme fatal" and "Romance". The French film-actress she is not, and they have no chemistry together. <br /> <br /> This film fails, not in the plot or sequences, but the lack of detail in the film photography and tooth-fist portraying the world of technology around the main protagonists. A small attempt has been made to design a landscape to represent any adjacent film landscape or period. Cars are very 1990s and architecture is quietly modern with open plans that imply a limited budget rather than a conscious clothing method. <br /> <br /> Technology is a lot of fun. Massive "2001: Space Odyssey" are the mainframes powered by human portable CDs whose data have been collected for some unexplained reason, despite the widespread communication network that even the most intelligent technician is aware of today. There is a clear lack of research here and, because of the open source nature of cyber circles, research would cost a little more than a bulletin board and personal time. <br /> <br /> DVD interviews also show the original movie's name was "Corporate Person", but it was probably loose to get the Matrix hype to cash in. The film "Cypher" has only the slightest connection. Terry Gilliam would have done wonders with this idea; Decalogue completely rewritten. <br /> <br /> Tele-movie quality and movie length production are very disappointing. It could have done a good subform for "Alias".
