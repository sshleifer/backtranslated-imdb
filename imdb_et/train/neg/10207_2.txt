Alfred Hitchcock invented any thriller you might think: he set the standards so high that any manager making a short film is deadly compared to him. <br /> <br /> The main theme of this Bullock vehicle, all the ideas, almost everything was already in Hitchcock's classic "Rope" - two students who committed free crime, Nietsche's philosophy, and the hints the boys spread, Master was the first to they wore the screen. And the eighty-minute film that was technical riveting tour de force. <br /> <br /> "The number of murders" does not happen in one room, like "rope" in mind. And what is the ultimate originality, it deprives the two policemen of the evil youth, and you never think it, these two police are very different: in fact, Bullock plays a part of a woman who lives like a man, and his partner (Chaplin) is as shy as helpless girlie Two boys' performances are not really outrageous, not as good as saying "primary fear" by Edward Norton. <br /> <br /> Well, you know, "Rope" was so good.
