I can't believe this movie was allowed. These people should be out of drugs and blunt objects. They should be tortured. This movie is abomination. It's nothing but a footage of the first movie. Whatever is original, it is terrible and makes no sense. It's like hallucination of some drugs. Like what is reflected in nude treatment. Nor did any moor that had been put together bothered to look at the first movie because they called the character of Suzanna Love Natalie when it was Lacey. I felt like yelling at the screen, "LACEY, it's LACEY !!!!" I'll give him 10 out of 10.
