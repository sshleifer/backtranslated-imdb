The acronym "F.P.1" stands for "floating platform # 1". The film is the construction of the "F.P.1" building in the middle of the Atlantic to be used as an "aerodrome" for transatlantic aircraft. Based on the contemporary novel by Curt Siodmark; it was filmed in German as "F.P.1 antwortet nicht" (1932), in French "I.F.1 ne r√©pond plus" (1933) and in English "F.P.1" (1933). Soon the technology made travel to an endless ocean much more preferred. <br /> <br /> The stars of Conrad Veidt (like Ellissen), Jill Esmond (like Droste) and Leslie Fenton (like Claire) will find love and sabotage in and out of the Atlantic platform. Karl Hartl. Mr. Veidt is the most interesting look; However, he is not convincing in the "triangle of love" with Mrs Esmond and Mr Fenton. The younger stars were spouses of Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak. Both the concept and the film are not well outdated. <br /> <br /> **** F.P.1 (4/3/33) Karl Hartl ~ Conrad Veidt, Jill Esmond, Leslie Fenton
