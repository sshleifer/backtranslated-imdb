I haven't seen this movie for a while, so I'm afraid I can't figure out the details exactly. Ralph Bakshi's Test J.R. The animated adaptation of Tolkin's masterpiece was a very ambitious project that was so ambitious that he went bankrupt at some point during production. So not only does it stop sharply somewhere in the middle of the second book of trilogy (sort of hiding a queue that was never done), the film itself seems less than ready. Some signs seem to have been animated, while others were filmed, but it is difficult to say deliberately. The whole thing seems to be loose and taken back, especially Orcs and Nazgul. Another problem, of course, is the big gaps in the plot. Bakshi was quick in completing this film, and he hoped for a book and a half time more than two hours (Peter Jackson's new trilogy makes about twice as much). (and I'm not just referring to Tom Bombadil, which I think was cute in the book, but it would look silly in the movie.) And of course the end that is absolutely steep and inappropriate. I'm not even sure if Bakshi originally intended to finish the movie, or if he even had the idea of ​​ending it. <br /> <br /> Characters ... well, most of them were okay. Hobbies don't seem so bad (except for gay Sam. Did you know that the producers of the new trilogy wanted to make Sam a woman first to have a feminine lead?) If you're a fan of Tolkien (like me), check out this movie (though I'm not What are the special features of the DVD version?) But you know that you will not see the real "Lord of the Rings" Movie "but not much more than the historical curiosity that probably doesn't look much better than in the 60s Beatles moved forward with his plan (I think that the psychedelic LOTR might have been pretty cool like Gandalf, Paul like Frodo, Ringo Sam and John as Gollum.) If you didn't read the book or didn't like it or don't like animation films See the semi finished movie ... Stay away.
