What a terrible movie. It sucks. It was terrible. I don't know what to say about this movie, but DinoCrap, which I stole from a reviewer with a nail. AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sigh .. This is not Roger Corman, whom I hate, this is a godly film. Well, really? But what can be expected from Homoeric computer graphics. What's more, CGI sighed loudly; I hate this movie terribly. This is undoubtedly the worst Roger Corman B-Movie and probably the toughest B-Movie. It's-it --- DINOCRAP! Sorry, I had to offend some nerves in those moments. It's just a terrible movie ... 0/1000
