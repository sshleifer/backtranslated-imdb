One thing that astonished me about this film (and not in a good sense) was that Nathan Stoltzfus, who seems to be proud of Rosenstrasse as a great historian, was one of the historians working on this film, considering how much of the actual events were changed or ignored . Another reviewer said that von Trotta said he had never told Lena to Goebbels bed, but in that case he gave the impression that it happened? Why not show other possible reasons for the release of men, such as the Stalingrad disaster, or the Nazi fear that the international press in Berlin will be aware of the protest. <br /> <br /> Why did the whole story play with another five weak family ties made over and over again? Certainly there is something so fantastic as it can have its own history! At times it was as if the film had two stories that seemed really little in common. <br /> <br /> In general, this film was unsuccessful in its purpose, which was to draw attention to the resistance of the little-known act, which is shameful because it has been done better, it would have had a great impact.
