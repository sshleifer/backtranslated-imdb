I'm not sure if the filmmakers were after a Saw-type movie or 12 Angry Meni (people who brought up the facts to get the truth). Regardless of what it was, it was badly done and was not viewed. <br /> <br /> I don't see blood and gore movies, but since this movie wasn't going to go elsewhere, he would have had to show more of the actual killing. Most of them were cameras, minimizing the fear we had to feel about deaths. <br /> <br /> It is also a mistake to me that the policeman was among the victims; he inadvertently gave up an innocent young man in prison, taking evidence of planted evidence (which he gave to MJH). (And wouldn't MJH have a prosecutor's attorney available for such evidence - it would have been taken out and proved wrong - so he wouldn't need police help?). Others, though often unaware of the person they harmed, still played the greatest roles in their final death. The gun dealer should have known that his weapons would be used for evil intent. Obviously, the insurance man rejected the person in distress, etc. But police crime seemed to be of minor importance because he didn't know exactly what he was doing. The filmmakers could have gone a step further and should have been the one who encouraged the MJH to provide evidence that would have made him more guilty. And MJH screams that he (the policeman) got confused, there is no point at all. <br /> <br /> It would have been more interesting if every person died in a way that offered others an idea why he was there and had died. An insurance man, for example, could have dropped the requests he rejected, so he drew them; an oriental woman could have fallen out of her eyes because she was a false witness, and so on. Yes, the more violent that the weapon died but more interesting. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was not funny, it wasn't twisted and the end was one of the worst (if not the worst) I've ever seen. After all, I knocked out three stars out of my rating. <br /> <br /> The participants did a decent job, especially considering the garbage and motivation they had to work with. <br /> <br /> Generally waste from time.
