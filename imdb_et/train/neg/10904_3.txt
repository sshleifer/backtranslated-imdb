I hired this movie, waiting for some smiles, hopefully enough to keep me interested, but I was wrong. This movie showed very little moments of humor, and the pesky jokes were disgraceful to rent it ... For this 10 to 15-year-old age group, the film's viewers leave those boundaries, being very pleased. It is worth not more than 3 voices that are not recommended to anyone who does not want to waste 2 hours of their lives.
