was such a film until Ed Norton's face hair. Without any plot detailing - one afternoon he had a light beard, but the same evening the beard was gone and a very luxurious mustache was in place. It was much better than the beard's mustache. Later, in the dark night, the mustache was opened and it appeared that it was cleaning the paradise. This was a case where stopping shaving would not be an option. These discrepancies in continuity completely disrupted me from the rest of the film and destroyed all previous credibility. I also found that his bedroom had only a cowboy long scene that reminds too much of De Niro's taxi driver. Even if it was meant to be honored, it was too thick for the viewer.
