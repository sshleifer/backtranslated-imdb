The only salvation was a small part of Larry Miller. The film seemed to be too hard to be "something for Mary," but I didn't like that movie and it still stayed beyond those standards. The actor who plays Paul was great, but Selma Blair is stupid in the nature of her cruel intentions. James Brolin was great, but Paul's father seemed to be trying too hard to be Randy Quaid's character in National Lampoon's Vacation movies.
