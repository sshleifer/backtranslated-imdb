The film seems to have aimed to show the aggressive (mafia-like) character of the Russians, or at least the Russians, who are able to travel outside their great country; that it is too easy to rob a bank in England; and that the British police are so ineffective that they will not find a person abducted from the bank even when these issues leave the air. In addition, Nicole Kidman and her assumed Russian colleagues spoke a language that has not yet been identified, albeit foreigners in the Ural Mountains, but far from Russian. So Nicole, if you really want to speak Russian, kindly go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and keep busy studying Russian grammar and its pronunciation.
