What a disappointment! I hated the mummy, but it was even worse! It was very tiring and unbelievable and at some point I always found myself sighing and waking up. I can't believe people really liked this movie. Nicholas Cage's role was not very convincing. The whole film was a big tour around America's most sought after buildings. The stream of never stopped tips and combinations was not convincing either. I stopped to watch for about 30 minutes. What was supposed to be a happy night was a complete disappointment. What to drag ... I think I've just seen too many movies to enjoy national treasure.
