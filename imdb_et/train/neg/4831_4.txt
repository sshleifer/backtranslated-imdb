I rented this movie to Netflix after winning all the Oscars to see if it was really that good. <br /> <br /> Hurt Locker is a very realistic (mostly) soldier rotation group in Iraq. The films will focus on Will James, a reckless soldier who gets his adrenaline risk taking and breaking bombs. <br /> <br /> If this movie seems to me to be inadequate, the film has a drawing and direction. This film has no clear plot, unlike other movies such as Black Hawk Down. What this film is trying to do is to focus more on the characters and their different attitudes towards war. Bigelow does a job that focuses on the characters, but there are many points in the movie where the dialogue seems to be dragging. Hurt Locker is 131 minutes long, but it seems to be a 3-hour movie. <br /> <br /> A movie's special court, which was especially scary and destroyed the movies, was a sliding scene with a semi-film. It was both unreal and long. <br /> <br /> Overall, I thought this film was OKAY, but the reason I gave it to 7 instead of 6 was because it was the best picture to win the best picture. The Oscar. I felt that this film could have been so much better than Sail Private Ryan had lost the best picture, but it was much better than that movie. Another remarkable remark is Black Hawk Down, who won only 2 Oscars. I honestly don't know how it won the best picture. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a busy military flick, rent a Black Hawk Down. This film is forgotten in a year or two years.
