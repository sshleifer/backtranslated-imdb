I'm not one of those who thinks the king is a great writer, his books are a little disturbing for a couple of hours and they often have interesting spaces, but I think they break down quite quickly if you give them a serious thought. br /> <br /> This movie suffers from the exact rewriting of the king's story. When you read the book, there are zero surprises, no changes, no scenes or no characters. This is a King's movie for fans of King's fans. <br /> <br /> The rest of us have nothing terrible about the film, this is the "gypsy curse" of horror, the twisting of which is a curse. something that many people want to get thinner. The last third has some serious structural problems, and at the end of the day, it seems that the rules of this genre are little broken. <br /> <br /> The 90-minute lifestyle is worse, but you can also read the book because there is nothing new here ... <br /> <br />
