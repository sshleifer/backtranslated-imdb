Does anyone feel betrayed? The first lesson was so strong but the last one. Oh my God. It seemed to be predictable and cheesy. Not grandiose and epic like the whole show. Most reviews are read is glowing, but I really don't understand why. I had seriously predicted this general end to WAY earlier, but then I pulled it back because I thought "No, they never do it, it's FAR too flat." I can hardly stand it. I feel so dissatisfied. I think I'm going to walk out of the door to sell every season I have. Someone please. Change your mind. I want to love it. So bad. Someone tells me why I'm wrong. Great show. A terrible ending.
