The story goes like this, Netflix sent me their DVDs late, so I went down to a similar rental, known as "Blockbuster Video". Really bad, they have 150 copies of the last flat films to enjoy your viewing, but I never want to see them. So I saw BTK Killer on the shelf, all by my own self. I like to see successive killers. It's just a part of humanity that I never understand, so I want to see such a thing. Anyway I put it on a DVD and suddenly in the first second, it sucks. I'm sitting there with my b.f. and we are like "what kind of crap?" Uncertain camera work, terrible action, - the first scene where a woman is killed, you don't know if she's just going to be calm, then the rat gets under her throat. I really don't know if the director has a hard time for this mess. There is nothing decent about this "movie". All I have to say to the director is "do you have a clean stand?" Each shot was brutally unstable. The music was terrible. It was like they decided to do a movie one day. They probably gathered people from Walmart to show and "act" for them. Just terrible. If you make such a movie, management is your hobby-NO, which you should make a living - it shouldn't be done for DVD kidney outlets like me. Better to leave your friends at home if you have a party and interesting things to keep them entertained. Then you break your BTK KIller movie and say, "Want to see this mad movie I did once?"
