... but the trouble with this production is that it is not very good musical. <br /> <br /> You can always wait for smart masters like Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter; yet this music music even makes Andrew Lloyd Webber funny. It is deadly and boring and unique (with one or two exceptions) and immediately after I watched it, I couldn't recall any important melody - it is quite tragic from someone who has been studying for three centuries throughout the second century. <br /> It's also strange and theatrical. It happens at an incredibly big stage (you really need to know those people who are on the front line who broke their neck to see something that is going 50 meters from the right or 100 meters to the left) and does nothing about it. If there should be one person who sings on stage, that's just what you get - and the rest of the enormeous stage is empty. For me, this aspiring theater director was almost painful to look at. <br /> <br /> In fact, Cole Porter seems to have grabbed the French culture of her works more than those non-talented people can ever come close. And I'm overwhelmed by the popularity of this legendary music.
