Someone had a great idea: let's Misty Mundae's Rara-rated version of Lara Croft - firing two weapons not only in dusky equipment, but also in topless. It was a really great idea. The problem is that the people who were able to do so could not support it. That's why we get a "movie" that barely reaches the middle, playing in many parts of it (often in slow motion) and apparently seen inside the garage. Misty Mundae's appeal is still obvious: she is incredibly cute and has a natural beauty in her neighborhood. But her two female stars with whom she shares a long lesbian scene are not too close to her. If "Mummy Raider" was presented as a Youtube video, I would appreciate it, but "DVD" for DVD does not get more than 1/2 a * 4.
