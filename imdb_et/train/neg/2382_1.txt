There are films like "Plan 9" that are so bad that they have their charm, there is some "Waterworld" that is as unhappy as a car accident, and some are like "Desperate living" you hate to admit to you love. Cowgirls have none of these redemptions. There is enough talent in casting to make almost any plot traceable, and what I have been told is an enjoyable book. <br /> <br /> How can this movie be so unbearably bad? First of all, it seems that the director brought together names that had no connection other than the one that brings 20 times. Then tell them they will do the best Kevin Costner imitations. Open the book at random and start taking pictures that are on the page to keep America's interests interesting in some way. Finally, do the editing work for your brother, because the meat packing company just put it down. He has twenty years of cutting experience. <br /> <br /> This movie now defines a basement for me. It's so bad that it's not even bad.
