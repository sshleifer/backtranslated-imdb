While Nothing Can Compare Vampires Vs. Zombies ... in the making of any movie, I try to evaluate this movie. <br /> <br /> First, the special effects were breath. When the television screen exploded, I thought my whole house would explode, and when the machine guns were fired, I thought the shells landed on the floor next to me. Just stunning my friends. <br /> <br /> But the scene when Jack Black's sound-a-like gives the worst monologue I have ever heard that I almost killed myself, but don't worry, because he started blazing the movie he is able to act terribly "I have to be high". Seriously, he had to watch myself unnecessarily beat up on incompatible thoughts that didn't make any sense and just added that he had to be "high" to justify his terrible action. Well, if you can say that to apologize for terrible acts when you talk to writers, directors, executive officers, sponsors, you probably get the same answer ... seriously. <br /> <br /> With a production team called "Shock-o-rama" I was shocked that I didn't put the sawed shotgun into my mouth and finished my life after this shockingly terrible movie apology. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie you must be murdered. <br /> <br /> Really, <br /> <br /> General
