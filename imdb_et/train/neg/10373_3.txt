This is one of the films I can only sit once. Charlotte Henry is good - in fact, all the participants were good. The problem was scripting, dialogue, direction, editing, kits and special effects. In this case, it was in 1933, but it really did. The problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable (the face cried out for recognition that was not coming). Movie collapse and lack of cohesion. Much of Lewis Carrol's spirit, humor and consistency are missing. What a pity! This is such a big book. I recommend Disney's 1951 version.
