HAH! So this is the movie "The Stars of the Next Steps" got into. Well, I'm glad I didn't participate and didn't win ... <br /> <br /> Isn't it funny how you can watch the first 10 seconds of the (!) Movie? I mean, come on! Just look at these headlines!? I watched this movie (or part of this "television object" because it was produced for television and we couldn't look at the whole thing.) One night when I did my military service and the audience was a typical hodge-podge with the average guys who watch from time to time like Las Vegas, but for the show girls. so the bar wasn't really high, the most viewed movie in my group was the Girl Next Door (and it wasn't because of the big scripts; D. But this movie's full originality, functioning, scripting and almost everything was missing) other that makes the movie good, changed the channel in Las Vega is quite easy (or was it a CSI? Don't forget ...) without the rest of the group's complaints and it's rare (!) for heaven Don't do this movie! If it's on television, yes, look at it and think about it. My conclusion? Well, because Joel Silver has indeed produced some of the best films there (Die Hard, Matrix 1 to name a few), I can only say that the producers do not give the film quality, they give the board money and sell this movie simply because it is Joel Silver's movie , is just a desperate attempt to hide the obvious flaws of the team who actually did it.
