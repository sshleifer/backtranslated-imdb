I saw an apple when I was 11 years old on TV. I enjoyed trilogy. So when the opportunity to see the cinema finally came, it didn't go over it. I went to the cinema knowing that what I had seen was not a movie, but it was made for a movie. But being a fan could not resist. But this film by Omen, which I saw at midnight, did not bring chills that brought laughter. Acceptable dialogue, for example, "it is written that when a child cries during baptism, they reject God". With nonsense.No decent set of pieces. Faye Grant so good V is wasted with this script hell. No surprises and no fun. But I did a laugh out loud how many times our bad thing was. Really Pathetic.1 out of 10
