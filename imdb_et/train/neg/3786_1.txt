This is not really the right view because I didn't see most of the movie. I stopped watching it. The film is very violent, disgusting with drug dealers and street beacons, but that's why I didn't stop watching. <br /> <br /> There was a problem here: I just looked enough to introduce several characters that were not all interesting. Everyone was a tedious, despicable psychopath who had no interesting personalities, giving me something to wait for. I found myself the least curious about what they would do next or what could happen to them. <br /> <br /> If there was even one interesting person and I don't want a good or nice person, I mean an interesting person, I could have stayed with it. See "Country Grace" to see what I mean. In this movie, Gary Oldman's character is completely crazy, but he's very interesting. Al Pacino probably did a good job at Scarface, but his character just didn't involve me.
