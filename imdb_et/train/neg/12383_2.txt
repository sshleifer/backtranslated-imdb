Although some performances were good - Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau and two Italian girlfriends remembered - the story was flat and derivative, the focus on the girl's racial background was at best cumbersome, and relatives mostly portrayed stereotypes rather than real. I found myself uncomfortably many moments that had to be funny. I hardly understand why a local book in SF said it was a good movie, and didn't know if the WHO posted IMDb here. I was very frustrated and crazy about this movie, to see it, based on a faulty connection with the garden, which is a much more fun, inventive and touching film than that. I must especially mention the emotional climax of the church, which was both wood and numbers that I almost left, and some audiences actually DID. This was followed by a foolish climax in the tomb, which I saw 10 minutes before. I really don't like being misled to spend my money so useless.
