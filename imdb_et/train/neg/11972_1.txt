In the "Just Looking" first ten minutes, the direction that most of the film takes will be dictated. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14-year-old boy living in the 50s in New York. She has a burning desire to see two people having sex. Who are the best people he has? Well, of course, her mother and stepfather! How nice. Unfortunately, Lenny has been caught before she sees anything, and sent to the summer to stay with her uncle and her uncle's wife. But the woman is pretty pregnant and they don't sleep at the moment. Then Lenny makes a new friend. He and his friend spend most of their spare time around a couple of girls. They have a small club where everything they do is sit down and talk about sex. The problem is that it is not innocent, charming in the 1950s. I am not a tool, but I found that listening to these children from masturbation, blowjob and anal sex is quite disturbing. Such a crude can work in a movie like "Kids" (1995), but in this movie it just seems perverse. Lrien lihalikest soovidest. Jason Alexander must stay as far away from the board as possible. "For Better or Worse" (1996) was terrible and now. What waste. 1/10
