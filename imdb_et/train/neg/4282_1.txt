I just don't understand why all these relics of the Ceausescu era refuse to let go. It is plain to see how disappointed they were during the commercial censorship that forbade them to show so many things in their films, and now they are depicting a great deal of artistic-fartsy freedom to fill the screen with people who remove, urinate, vomit, intimidate and other imaginary hiding places. It's not CINEMA, FRIENDS, and NEIGHBORS! It's just a visual perversion. Forget about Bunuels Chien Andalou, David Lynch, Forman and Neorealism, and other filmmakers who were able to work with aesthetics of ugliness. These people had their own works - well, you didn't! Take advantage of all of you, Daneliucs and Nicolaescus and Saizescus and Muresans and Marinescus and Margineanus and other aged seniors, and leave us alone! See some Romanian movies on the screen for a while, enough for your immature terribilisms! You are not the directors, you are ATTENTION!
