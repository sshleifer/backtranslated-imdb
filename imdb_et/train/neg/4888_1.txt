Nick Millard, named Nick Phillips, should have left alone well when he made "Criminal Insane" 10 years before the waste of this godly time. The fact that the original "Criminally Insane" was less than an hour long should have attracted him to the fact that he was likely to hit this story to anyone from whom he came out ... but he decides to use TONS's original shots, even the original opening credit queue! Unfortunately, the quick recovery of the aging Priscilla Alden did not save it. What a little bit of original material on this flick would look like it was filmed with a rented handheld camcorder! If this film cost more than $ 100 to be very surprised, I would be as surprised as he made it close! Avoid it and see the original!
