Salvage: 4 out of 10. Earth Day meets the horror film of the Christian Coalition. Okay, that's not so bad. But it's close. <br /> <br /> Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Currie Lewis) has been kidnapped and possibly killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry, who is quite dangerous and brutal). I say that because he wakes up and it was all a dream? Or was it? (Cue music) <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie is that these fifteenth plots (done quite well for the first time) are repeated over and over again. And since Claire wakes up every time and every scene is clearly a dream or an alternative reality, I just finished taking care of what happened to Claire, and I started thinking about what a flat twist will pull at the end. was rooting for s√©ance (which would have been honestly more meaningful), but got one of them too obvious for a surprise decision (think village or below). Yes, the film is gathering faster than Donnie Darko's directors. The Big Twist-Ends of All Horror Movies The Sixth Sense, the initial invasion of the body's Snatchers, a happy birthday to me, because the audience does not expect the left-wing explanation. (Heck even a canoe that ends on the original Friday of the 13th day was worth beating) <br /> <br /> Salvage, on the other hand, screams, ending every scene change. Other chewing bugs are the obvious timepiece of one note piano music (although the highlighted songs were decent) (Claire makes dishes, Claire's mother's sub-blocks), as Claire says, "Hello someone's there" every time she thinks there is a series killer around . <br /> <br /> There are also some secondary acting roles (especially Claire's mother, played by Maureen Olander, who remembers Mary Kay's zombie) for the first time with a small budget. <br /> <br /> Both too intelligent parties and not just enough clever salvage will keep your interest if you only see how they are going to fix it. The problem is that they really are not.
