After reading a book that had a lot of meaning for me, the film didn't give me the feeling that the book had given me. It makes me wonder if Kaufman even liked this book because he did something else successfully. Which one or he is just bad. Most importantly, where is lightness?! From the first scene, most of the music is submerged from the dialogue and felt, and it continues throughout the film. I think the makers thought that playing the music directly through the film would make the story sensitive, but here they are completely unsuccessful. Instead, the music succeeds in giving everything that the film feels like, so dramatic events happen, so we move on, so everything really seems to be difficult. <br /> <br /> Another example of how this adaptation will fail is by decorating the story, making it more dramatic. In the film, we see Franz on the street Tomas, who is on his way to Sabina. The introduction of this opportunity to meet / overtake, which certainly did not happen in the book, gives Tom more importance than it changes light. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples where the story has changed, imo for the worst, but it could have been done because the book just doesn't make a good movie, like Kundera's style. This makes us questionable whether all the generous reviewers on this site remembered their book and film experiences, not just the movie. A movie that is as long as it is uncompressed. For those who haven't read the book yet, I recommend reading it. For those who need it, I have to say that you just waste your time and are likely to come here to write the same warnings.
