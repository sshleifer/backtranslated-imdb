May contain possible spoilers (not that there is something new in this movie or surprise you in this matter) <br /> <br /> Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything he has ever forgotten? Of course, it is cheaper for them, but after a while you would not think about quality and how people think about them. House Of Villains is a despicable piece of comic book that has no meaning at all. Some of the signs of total disregard for previous movies are as follows: the voices are not even far away, and Iago is once again evil (because when?!) I know these movies are right for kids, but it was time for everyone to enjoy Disney movies. Even the musical number of the film (which had been in Disney for years) crowded. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone even very young. All I can do is that if you release more movies with the same caliber, it's just a matter of time before a little animation studio crosses Disney's overall quality.
