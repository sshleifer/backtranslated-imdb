It wasn't good. The characters were underdeveloped and the only personality was the memories of the previous film, which were opposed to "new" persons (or their absence). I thought seriously that Ariel's opening stage was a nightmare because it was absurd. It was serious. It just reminded me of all the annoying signs of the Disney channel - everything is hyperactive and the story jumps from action to embarrassing scenes without any real connection. , not amazing. In the original Ariel was an amazing and powerful voice, and the whole song is memorable and fun. You remember them and you want to sing them. But the songs in this movie were not at least creative; it is as if they were talking with a tedious vocal voice - rather weak, disappointing. I don't want to sing to those who feel like you usually get a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> It's not like no one wants to make this movie. . . this movie needs a new story, new memorable songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without annoying "look at me! Look at me! I'm so annoying!" Disney's generation mentality. : '(
