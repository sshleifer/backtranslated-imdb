It's just the worst Ridley Scott movie. Ridley Scott is a great director. But this film is a black mark of his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both completely confused about the excessive film about the girl for the army. Very stupid. And there is never a scene that is convincing. It's not really hard to make such a movie. Everything the team does could have been just someone's idea. The writers also did not have much inspiration; many foolish dialogues that didn't make sense at all; and some meaningless action. I strongly urge you to stay away from this garbage. I hope many of the talented people involved in the project will realize their attention in this type of film and that they will work more respectable and intelligent films in the future than this useless mess.
