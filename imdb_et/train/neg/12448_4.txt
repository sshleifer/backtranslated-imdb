Clint Eastwood is Bronco Billy, the leader of the Wild West troupe, one of the six most common malformations that consist of struggling intermediate exhibitions. The seventh cluster member is a woman, Billy assistant, but such women never last long and the position is chronically open. Enter Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Locke? S Eastwood Girlfriend). It seems that Miss Lilly, as Doc (Scatman Crothers) calls her, is likely to receive only her deceased father's legacy if she is married when she turns 30, so that on the eve of her birthday she will get Geoffrey Lewis. <br /> <br /> So what's the graph of this movie? It's hard to say. There is a romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lilly, but the problem is that in the first half of the film she is so harsh and despicable that if she suddenly becomes a "half" movie, it's not just incredible, but the audience takes care of her carefully. Behind the Northwest West exhibition is a chronic lack of funds, but this is not enough to really be the raison d'etre of the film. There's Lilly Miss's insecurity that they're gonna hit the West in the West, cut off the money that feeds her spoiled luxury (she's mistakenly thought her family and the press are dead). But should we really believe that he did not get back to New York and his anticipated happiness when he gave him some trouble? <br /> <br /> No, the point of this movie seems to be that Billy is a family leader, a lovable bunch of heaps who hang with thick and thin. Is this a warm, fuzzy movie? or at least try to be. <br /> <br /> Clint shows us his skills with a gun, even trying to shoot a bank robbery, which is otherwise out of the relatively non-violent movie. One gang is arrested for tax evasion of the old bill; Billy bribe a local sheriff. The exhibition tent is on; they make the orphanage new. But numerous secular pitfalls do not make a plot. <br /> <br /> Connecting a problem is acting or not. In addition to Scatman Crothers, supportive cast is quite amateurish. Eastwood is not on his own, though he looks better because it is surrounded by such a small bunch. <br /> <br /> And the movie takes 116 minutes. At what point? Good question ?? <br /> <br /> 4 out of ten
