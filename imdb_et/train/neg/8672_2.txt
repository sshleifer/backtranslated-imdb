Most feature films are Hindi cinema, especially Sunny and his family crass. <br /> <br /> The film is typical of sunny, bass, large dialogues and melodrama. <br /> <br /> The film also has a typical Rajiv Many Rai ingredients and a weird attacker <br /> <br /> Getting started is okay and then moving to Kenya is good, but then the movie continues and goes on <br /> < br /> The sequence of events at a slow pace and something that happens. <br /> <br /> They are many foolish scenes, as Kenya's policemen have been shown to be jokes, especially Sharat <br /> <br /> Rajip Rai is doing a good job Music is ok, only one song is working and this is the last TOOFAN camera-job is good <br /> <br /> Sunny Deol is as usual, Chunky acts like a monkey, if his serious scenes are ridiculous, Naseer is the right heroes of wood wood Amrish Puri is not even half-scary when he was in TRIDEV, the rest is okay
