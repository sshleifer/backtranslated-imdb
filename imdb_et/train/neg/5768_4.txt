Well, I was first glad to download an animated open source movie that was demolished by the demo reel. Animation is great, lips synchronization is terrible and you look at a movie that hopes to understand what's going on, just to understand that nothing happens. You don't feel the feelings, but create the creators of the waste of your time. I've seen short movies that are twice emotionally halfway! It would have been a great short film if they had just taken the time to hire a real director. I'm sure all Blender's visitors will be delighted to introduce their software and rendering capabilities, but the apologies that speak are what makes the movie.
