Sometimes I don't understand what the directors think about making a movie ... I was traumatized after I greeted (2007) and thought they wouldn't do it again. But after the strain of amazing promotions, Tashan finally ended up as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> Such amazing 3 song promo - Dil Haara, Chhaliya, and Tashan Mein ..... and what's in the movie? Zero Story, Predictive Plot, Many Akshay Kumar Stunte and Something Interesting After Seeing Kareena After Her Great Weight Loss ... !!! <br /> <br /> Music-understanding is another great catastrophe ... in the music album, they have spent some of those miserable small dialogues of these four jokes and they have not thought of giving the background song of scenes when Akshay Kumar tricks ...! this song is so nice, quite comparable to Tashan Mein and it won't be recorded in the music album !!! :-( If you are planning to watch this movie, I'd say you would look at this background song that goes something like this ... 'Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ...' <br /> <br /> In general, very disappointed how Bhaiyyaji has tried bad English talk! <br /> <br /> Get out of the guy, I gotta dress up!
