Now, I'm not getting it wrong, I enjoy the movies of Christmas lands. i love my wonderful life and i really enjoy the direction of christmas song george c. scott and alistair sim. but this particular film is terrible. I think I love life song ghost Christmas gift singing is especially painful. albert finney sings quite well. I don't know what's wrong with this movie, but it seems that someone is trying to sing through the mouth of dead gerbils. the only thing that saved us this movie was to turn off the sound and watch the dance numbers with the cd of the south park.
