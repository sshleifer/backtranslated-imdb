I have to admit that drawing this film is directed by Eduardo Sanchez, who led the wildly popular and successful Blair witch project. Besides, it is an alien film that sounded like Stephen King's Dreamcatchers, one of the films that were hated by critics, but I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> But the speed, unfortunately I felt that for most parts, the change is a waste of time, so I keep this overview short. Rooms are always promising and Altered is no different. It tells the story of a man who has experienced wonderful meetings when they were younger, and as usual, others take you with the imagination of diapers. The history of an alien abduction must always be in the openings in the probes, so I'm not going into details, but you get a drift that is awkward, and something you want to forget. <br /> <br /> What if you got revenge? This means you can successfully cool down and capture one's life. What are you doing? For this group, it's a nice payback period or they thought. And this is where the film begins to become a snoozefest, a poor, uninspirant dialogue, and even worse. Even if it is a small budget, there are not many redeeming factors, be it the storyline's strength, or the tool that has been made to make these characters interesting. This is a standard cardboard ticket for a vanilla standard script, with some cheap intimidation tactics added. <br /> <br /> What is a good makeup. A lot of effort has been made to do some things that I do not mention because it breaks only a few elements of what makes this film acceptable. In addition, there are common cheap special effects, blood and gory moments that you have never seen before. <br /> <br /> Look at it only as a last resort. Compared to the other monster movie in the city - it is less fun and takes itself too seriously. You have been alerted to the uninitiated direction.
