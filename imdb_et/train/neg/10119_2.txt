The animation of the transformation of St. Petersburg and Wolf is great, but after 29 minutes, the film is dreaming. They should have called it "Peter & the Snails" because everything is moving at a snail's pace. I couldn't even watch the movie in one session - I had to watch it for 15 minutes and it was pure torture. <br /> <br /> Save yourself for 30 minutes - don't watch this movie - and you won't watch this movie. thank you. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the Oscar nomination committee only looked at the first few minutes of the candidates. Unfortunately, the best winners of the short (short!) Category winner must vote the whole thing. I already feel sorry for them - and we have to predict that this film has not won in any way.
