This film resembles a Baroque Conan, but more like sex, rape and murder. All this morality is a plot, but filmmakers do not do the good work that is ashamed because it can be a decent story. Richard Hill has a solid lead in the lead, as does the villain - who unfortunately did not show anything else. Fighting scenes aren't too bad either - I love how Deathstalker lets his sword "drink" blood from his victims - and there's a lot of nudity and sex temperature in the overall level of machismo. <br /> <br /> All in all, not good - but not necessarily so bad ...
