This film was absolutly terrible. I can't figure out one thing. The holes in the plot were so big that you could drive the Lobster through them. The action was so amazingly bad that even Jean Claude should be ashamed and it says a lot! And dialogue, What dialogue do you think I was a fan of the first representative (I use this comment loosely, more than innocent pleasure than anything else). This movie was crying out loud at Goldberg !!!! There's nothing good about this movie. What makes this movie even worse is that it is so bad that you can't even watch it with a bunch of friends! It must be with all five of my worst films. 2/10 because it's hard for me to give 1.
