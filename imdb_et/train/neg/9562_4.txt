I think it could have been a decent movie and some of its parts are OK ... but it's a B movie. The same about the plot, the parts are OK, but it's several holes and weird that aren't quite included. Mostly OK, I have seen it worse. :) <br /> <br /> The start determines the level of cars flying in the desert, making "cool" but completely unnecessary jumps through some small dunes (slowly! Cool!) as drivers have never seen sand before ... It turns a little better, but not much. <br /> <br /> If you rent it, take the other and use it as a heater. Keep your expectations low and it may work for you.
