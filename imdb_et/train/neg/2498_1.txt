Forgive me, but some movies are good and some movies are bad. Of course, these two broad categories are extreme. Movies such as godfather, German privacy and Star Wars are in a comfortable category. At the other end of the spectrum are those movies that just don't deserve the name by name. Sometimes someone produces a really terrifying movie. A movie that should be highlighted as an example of how tough a film can be. A movie that's more than bad. Such a film is Maiden Voyage. <br /> <br /> In short, Maiden Voyage is a story of a luxurious cruise ship hijacked by criminals who demand ransom equally from the owner of a bad ship. Of course, there is an American hero on board who is hidden in the jaw and sculpture that saves the day. <br /> <br /> It's a new depth. All this is bad. Functioning, direction and so-called plots are breathable. In short, it is an insult to the intelligence of any unhappy viewer. Even an American viewer would be disturbed by its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> I am tempted to compile a list of things that were angry about this movie. But the dumber-dumb conclusion should be a good example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> Imagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you have been standing on an open lifeboat in a calm sea. You're in a company with a hero bomb at a hero. This hero throws you a bomb and dives overboard. What would you do? I don't know about you, but I throw the bomb as far as possible into the sea. Not that man. He watches how our hero swims and then tries to disarm the bomb because of the regrettable (for him) results. That's enough. Such death would be a worthy mention on the Darwin Awards website and may also be the most appropriate conclusion to a production team's life.
