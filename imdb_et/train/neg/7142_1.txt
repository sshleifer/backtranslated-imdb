It's far from the WORST movie I've ever seen. I was waiting for a cheesy movie, but with at least some cool car scene / contest. I didn't get anything. The racing scene is such a low budget that they speeded up so that the cars would look like "fast driving". In one scene, the Mercedes SLR moves from over 200 to 4 like 4 seconds, turning around. It's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real movie about cars, look at the fast and furious series. They may be a little cheesy, but 100x better than this film could ever count on. Better yet just look at the Mischief 3000 which is the best car movie I ever thought.
