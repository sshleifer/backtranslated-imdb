This film was like a bad train wreck as it was so terrible as you had to look at. My boyfriend and we rented it and wasted two hours of our day. Now don't get me wrong, act good. Only the film as a whole annoyed me. There was nothing positive or good about this scenario. After that movie I had to go for something that was a little lighter. Jennifer Tilly is traditionally a very dramatic actor. His character seems to be manic and not all there. Darryl Hannah, though he played over, does a wonderful job to play where he is. More than once I found myself screaming at the TV, saying he was fighting back or becoming violent. All in all, a very violent film ... not for the weakness of the heart.
