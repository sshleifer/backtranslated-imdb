I may not be a critic, but here's what I think of this movie. Well I just watched cinemax and first I just have to say how much I hate what I mean, what a snowman scares besides babies, secondly, it's pretty funny, but I bet because the film is so low they probably used ketchup so MY CRITICAL VOTE IS BOMB !!! nice to try and sequel sucks twice as much.
