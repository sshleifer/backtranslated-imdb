First of all, I agree quite a bit that escapes from Mr. Chomsky's mouth. His interesting counterpoint to reality is what makes a man hit the campus circus. He is terrible, uncomfortable, pragmatic. He does not satisfy the current political style (unpleasant bi-partisanship) and he places his sights far to the left, as well as right and right, harassing both and for good reason. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film itself is noisy. In fact, I would not even call it a documentary, but rather a collection of speeches. Watching "Rebel Without Pause" is no different from viewing a speaker on a CAMPAN 3-point taped segment. There are no camera movements, changes, stylistic touches. There is no story, no story. <br /> <br /> Technically speaking, production is strictly amateurish. Sound is terrible and inconsistent; Sometimes we cannot hear Noam, otherwise we will not be able to hear the questions presented by the attendees. When Noam rarely speaks, we are allowed to see the audience's reactions, except when we are given his wife, who apparently participates in every pride of her speech and beam every time we see her. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie, and I would say you are probably better off listening to calls recorded on your tape or CD in your car. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars ... and I'm a generous mood today.
