DARK REMAINS is a small budget American horror film that managed to win 2 prizes. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to be related to two different chains. First of all, a woman suicide, grabbing her wrists when bathing. Second, the young writer of a technical writer is found inclined towards her throat. The grieving couple decide to go to the isolated cabin in the mountains. Later it turns out that the cabin and the surrounding places are haunting. <br /> <br /> When the movie goes on, the two different stories will eventually come together as one could reasonably expect. However, filling is accidental and causes confusion, which could perhaps only be solved with multiple views. Unfortunately, the movie is not just tempting to attract most viewers to see it more than once. <br /> <br /> Almost everything that goes wrong with this movie goes wrong - and fast! And a small budget cannot be used to justify all the shortcomings found here. <br /> <br /> I believe it would be wrong to make decisions about the actors involved in this production because the material was just too poor. <Br /> <br /> Characters are uninteresting, as other reviewers of this site have noted. A poorly written script introduces too many people, offering them an interesting dialogue without creating opportunities for creating and characterizing their specific situations. </p> <p> <p> </p> The inspiration for J-Horror's films like RINGU, GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL is obvious. Unfortunately, DARK REMAINS leaders didn't look at J-Horror's style. J-Horror works so effectively that it plays with unknown fear. Tensions arise between a constant shift in a strange situation (a ghost walking in a CCTV camera toward it) and a central reaction that faces it without warning. There are no humor or oral elements in these films. Everything is played both straightforward and unfortunate, or without restrictions that you can't help but be convinced and fascinated. Failed atmospheres led to intermediate controls and ensure that horror has a psychological effect, very different from the fears of jumps used in Hollywood films. can also be prevented by CGI. J-Horror's respect could have been well anticipated. Unfortunately, the lack of inspiration makes the viewer laugh on the supposed "intimidation" screen. The "ghosts" make-up effects were not too bad due to the low budget, but their actions simply gave up the logic. I was scratched a few times during this movie. <br /> <br /> I couldn't finish the end even when I wanted to. I just didn't understand it. All I can conclude is that it was something culminating. <br /> <br /> What's up? Another website reviewer's response has indicated boredom. The film is a chore to sit. Fortunately, the pain ends in one and a half hours. Most would probably switch off long before the end. <br /> <br /> In this movie, only 2 positive things can be found - the successful avoidance of frightening clich√©s and the absence of "f" in any sentence, like one, should normally be found. This is what the two letters are meant for. <br /> <br /> Those who like the supernatural or psychological horror associated with ghosts and ghosts can well adhere to films such as HELL HOUSE, CHANGELING or J-LEGEND Horror. <br /> <br /> If you think you've seen too many movies created and want to see a hidden ultra-low budget "R-rated" horror movie about ghosts, see DEATH GHOST HUNTER. It may never have been the biggest horror movie ever made, but it is definitely much better than DARK REMAINS and has some real surprises. <br /> <br /> I recommend that everyone avoid DARK REMAINS like a plague.
