The last reviewer was very generous. I would silence like the first film, but I can't say I like it. The beginning is tolerable, but it goes down quite quickly. I just don't see Jon Bon Jovi as a "bad ass vampire hunter" and a vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary. Many scenes don't make sense. I mean, every ordinary person would suspect that something is up when a strange woman who suddenly emerges somewhere, attracts you, not to mention an experienced hunter. Why Una Can Communicate With Jov? Nothing was ever explained in this movie, you wouldn't mind being fun, but it was too much to ask. It must be one of the worst vampire movies I've seen.
