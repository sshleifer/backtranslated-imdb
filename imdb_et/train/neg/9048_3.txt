Originally, the week's ABC film was presented. It includes two young innocent college students on the railway in a small southern part of the prison camp. They don't have phone calls and no one knows they are there. The following are rape, torture, beating, humiliation and degradation, leading to a very disturbing conclusion. <br /> <br /> The TV version was gloomy. Not nudity and beating was quite cunning, but the general feeling that leniency was wearing. The unrated version is even worse - there is plenty of nudity, violence is extreme and, in a particularly disgusting sequence, we see a crying female prisoner forced to slip when the lesbian guard "uses" her. YUCK! There is nothing wrong with usage films, but it just goes slant. You get the feeling that filmmakers enjoy these poor women for torture and deterioration - all this is your face, as you should enjoy it. An unnecessarily lowering end won't help. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 3 because acting is good - but it makes it harder to watch the movie. Ill, buggy movie. Not recommended.
