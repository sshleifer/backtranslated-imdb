It was not a big disaster I was expecting, but it is about as positive as I can in the movie. I'm not sure what was funny about this movie, but I think it's all a matter of taste. Personally, I don't see a funny look at my idiotic life or a fool on television, but then again, I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's pathetic daytime talk. I didn't see it too, but I certainly didn't enjoy it. If you're in the mood to see a bad movie, but that's not too painful to sit down, it's a good choice.
