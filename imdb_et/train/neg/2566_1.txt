Recently, a part of the TV got GEORGE 2, but could not look to the end. Just terrible! I can't even remember the plot. I know George and Ursula were not the first movie George and Ursula, which was bad enough. There's a lot of scrambling around, but the direction and editing were so dirty and dirty, it was like looking at views or deleted scenes. Ape Ape's original voice was not nearly enough to warm me up. GEORGE 2 is probably one of the worst things I've ever seen, and it says something. Jeez, since IMDb has 10 lines, I have to write if I have nothing more to say about this Crapulastic TV post. Disney, hang head shame.
