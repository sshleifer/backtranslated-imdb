This movie was absolutely ... ugh I can't find the word oh wait ... crap! I mean, when it started, I was like yeah it looks good and then after it was so boring. I almost fell asleep and had nothing to do with getting late because it was totally messy. Ram Gopal Varma has tried his best, but the cast could never live the original Sholay lie, which he thought he did. What was he trying to do? Like Sanjay Leel Bhansan and win all the awards next year as Black? Ajay and the other boy were particularly good, but the other guy who played the casts, because all of them were watching. What was Amitabh? He destroys his dignity by doing all these foolish movies. First Nishabd, then Cheen Kum, then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, and now it means he could collect some money and move as far as possible from Bollywood before he loses all his respect and I tell you he's already half his way . I mean, this is really good for other actors, like Shah Rukh Khan, who is now a very good name thanks to Amitabh's recent decline. I never liked her because she thinks she is God and I just knew Abhishek was going to be in that movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to save your Â£ 17.75 and spend something good, look at Heyy Babyy because it's just the funniest movie and it's the first number of tables!
