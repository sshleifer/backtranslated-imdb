From time to time, there was a scientific writer H. Beam Piper, who wrote the classic book "Little Fuzzy", which was about a man who discovered the fuzzy humanoid race of the gods of another planet. Mr. Piper died in 1964, but Hollywood and many of today's authors began looting their graves before his soldier cold. This is a book where they got an idea for Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Skullduggery is such a "dirty" "little fuzzy" that I don't know why I'm the only one I've ever noticed? <br /> <br /> But don't take my word. Here is a link to Guntenberg where you can download a "Little Fuzzy" copy for free: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
