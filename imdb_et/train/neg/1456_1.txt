Simply put, it's a simplified and one-dimensional film. The title, The Rise to Evil, should tell you that it is not trying to be something deep or to do much of Hitler's character. Rather, from the first minutes of the film, where we see that Hitler is looking for evil evil music in the background, we are given Hitler's view, presenting him as a comic strip director, seemingly hanging on a television show on Saturday morning. The film really wants to happen that Hitler was evil, but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was evil? Ultimately, he is both one-dimensional evil in nature and boring (one must ask how the cold, physiotic nature of the film will convince the people ever to follow him or to call him Man of the Year). This film had a great opportunity to draw a figure who in the 20th century devoted some of the most terrible acts and tried to deepen his mind. Instead, it's basically just saying, "Hey! Hitler was evil! Just thought you wanted to know ..." over and over again. The great irony is that the film was still being attacked for a too sympathetic character. Leave me alone.
