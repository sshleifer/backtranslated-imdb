The director is trying to be Quentin Tarantino, screenwriters are trying to be Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger is trying to be Faye Dunaway, late James Coburn is trying to be Orson Welles, Michael Rooker is trying to be Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore is trying to be Faye Dunaway (older version), Cameron Diaz is trying to get out of the frame as soon as possible (successfully), Joanna does not ask Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader are trying to hide their embarrassment with this funny thing. It provides endless, meaningless dialogue and very little action. <br /> <br /> Tulsa is a city with beautiful elevators, Bruce Goff Art Deco Church and Frank Lloyd Wright's beautiful, extensive mansion. Visit Tulsa, don't look at this movie. It does not do justice to the location.
