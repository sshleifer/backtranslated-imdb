Of course, it is nice to see improvements in the Turkish film industry, but I would have been more creative than Togan Gokbakar. from the scenario I believe it was not wise as some think. especially the cheerfulness of dialogues that put the audience in the position of being smart enough to understand the situations that usually make the film unbearable. it also has an obvious end; you can easily guess the murder. the weakest part of the scenario is that it is impossible for seriously ill patients to act like normal people like professionals right now !!! Another strange point in the movie was the medical term that even normal people cannot use in the scene where the workers were looking for the most dangerous patient and to protect any weapon. and this scene was so suitable for "Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir" title !! they are not the only weak parts of the film. the film also had a lot of precision. depicting the most dangerous patient was an exact copy of Hannibal, and the appearance of Togan at the end is probably the worst mistake he could have made in his first film! The size of the film and the interviews the actor gave were just making people curious and forcing them to see. Gen is a complete disappointment. would it be wondering if Saha wasn't famous, would Togan be able to shoot this movie? I hope Togan understands that it is not fashionable to play as a director as he said in the interview. it was Hitchcock who did it wisely and Night Shyamalan continued it successfully! he should be aware of the fact that he is not yet Hitchcock or Shyamalan !!!!
