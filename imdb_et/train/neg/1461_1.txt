I saw this movie and I was shocked! Robert Carlyle is not Hitler, he is a man who unfortunately tries to be Hitler. The film lies, it does not reflect the truth. In the scene Hitler hit his gun. Hitler had never hit anyone, he did not hit people with his fist, but with the fists of soldiers. Understand? The other thing is that it is too obvious that Hitler is this evil, he was smarter than the one shown in this movie. No German would have accepted her as a leader because she saw she was bad. So the real Hitler has not shown people to his evil. <br /> <br /> Did anyone in the Yankees watch Der Untergang or Dawnfall? this is a great movie with amazing actors. And this is a German film. I think that this Nazi-German theme should not be realized as a film from people who do not know anything about Germany. People! See "Der Untergang": <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ <br /> <br /> It's a great movie of a very sad time for people around the world.
