An extremely disappointing film based on James Michener's novel. <br /> <br /> What's worse was Marlon Brando's performance. His southern draw was ridiculous. I found myself laughing as he spoke as he was like an elderly lady from South, who comes home. Brando, which was so great in previous films, has fallen in color here. Tyrone Power, "Prosecutor's Office", should have been nominated as Best Actor instead of Brando. and Japanese women. <br /> <br /> Brando was in front of the film with a stone surface. His movement from anti-these relationship to pro takes place when he loves an Asian woman. His emotions and talking made it harder for him to draw such new views. No result was so impressive. Umek's appearance on the screen was short and without anything to see. The best results of this movie were made by Miiko Taka, who did well in Brando's love interest. He showed great emotion as an anti-American who found Brando's love. His face was etched by an accident he had to lose in his father and brother in the 11th World War. He realized that his dance was not the way out of his life. Hebrew mother Yochobel "Ten Commandments" at the beginning of Brando's beloved mother. His performance with Ricardo Montalban was destroyed. Patricia Owens, like Brando's first love, showed her depth and conviction in her work.
