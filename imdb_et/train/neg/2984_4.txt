I admit that most of this movie was uninspired, but I was still entertaining. It has a wonderful power of energy, higher than average music and women in the film are very defensive, there are no prisons. I can think of dozens of other films that were even worse, at least it had an intriguing plot with some social comments. They point to how the army is dealing with viral epidemics, destroying everything on the horizon, even if it means people you are supposed to be economical. Likewise, how dangerous a martial law can be, because at this point, democracy ceases to exist. Fulci seemed to be trying to combine his earlier work (zombie, farther, hell gates), trying to fix them somehow. He failed, but surely it was unhappy as many people would have thought. I have a soft spot for Zombie movies, I admit that I am somewhat biased when it comes to reviewing them. All I say is that this movie is once good, if there wasn't so many generations of making this movie (fulci quit and bruno (I can make them the best hack) took over) could have been much better and more targeted. fulci zombie swan song.One of the most surprising remarks is that there is a scene in zombie 3, which the cemetery person actually hung, I couldn't believe it myself, check that you are surprised.
