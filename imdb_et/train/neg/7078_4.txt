This film could have been a decent B-film if 3/4 of the film was not focused on sexual scenes. I mean, he's a sex addict, and I'm sure that more and more of the sex addicts continue beyond sex. Michael Des Barres did a good job with what he was supposed to do. At one point or another, he should laugh at him because his character was so pathetic. Nastassja Kinski was her sexual therapist in her role, she could have done more, and I do not recommend sex with her. The person who was most prominent in this film was Rosanna Arquette, a loving and concerned woman in her convincing role. There's something beautiful inside and outside that I really like. He played this role and when you watch the movie, you start to feel bad about it. <br /> <br /> "Sex-Dependent Diary", while non-Oscar material or a modern classic with its own standards is quite informative and does a fair job, showing you how individual demons can take over and destroy those things alive, what you really think.
