The title of the slowest movie is the one that is issued quickly and often. Most of the time this is exaggerated, but I would like to welcome the short list of real candidates in the dark alone: ​​9th Space Plan 9, Battlefield Land and Adventures of Pluto Nash. <br /> <br /> When I looked at the 90-minute cage, I had a hard time waking up even when I tried to laugh at the movie. But unfortunately I felt alone in the dark (I tried to avoid red, but I couldn't resist) when I looked around, hoping to see Mike Nelson and his two robots. My friends and I had to offer comedy for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> So ... movie about yourself. Let's talk about action and effects, because it should be the only positive part of the film. In the film, there are evil creatures that are perpendicular to aliens Xenos (they even call them Xenos) and Pitch Black beings. It may accidentally become invisible (and I assure you that it is accidental) and will damage the light. There are also small hundredth-century creatures used to control people, making them zombie-like. All these have been shown with outdated special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997. Action scenes are chaotic and impossible to follow. People who accidentally photograph a blue screen stage or an empty set of monsters posted in a post. The light flashes quickly on the dark screen, which makes your students burn, while the bad rock music is in the background. <br /> <br /> And these were high points. The story rises around a paranormal researcher (Slater) whose idea of ​​harshly riding a black woman's beater Tshirt with a ditch and not a 2-day shave. Archaeologist (Reid), who is quite incest. And the government agent (Dorff) whose lines include the barking order. All three should be ashamed of their performances (not that they have done a good job before) and the casting guide should be ashamed. Reid and Slater should be in the movie I think. The film contains one of the most uncomfortable scene of love I've ever seen between two films. <br /> <br /> Then there will be a plot. Frankly, meaningful parts are not interesting at all. The rest is at best illogical. The holes in the plot may contain all three stars in the collective egos. The film begins with a text and a voice explaining it. This opening takes more than a minute and the viewer already knows they are something terrible. Later, this unveiling is repeated in an awkward dialogue with the very cumbersome and heavy hands of the adnausem through the rest of the film. And the end didn't make one ounce of thought. Not only is it meaningful in the world of film, it just didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Finally, one Uwe Boll direction. Shame, that's all you can say. Use it to shake the camera to simulate intercourse. Lack of direction with participants. Just look at Reid's scenes, where he's not at the center of the scene. Complete waste of special effects money for ball time effects. Finally, we chose the voice to explain something that should be painfully obvious to the viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 1.50 for this exhibition at another exhibition theater. And while I and my friends are laughing, it was worth every quarter, I would recommend people not to pay this movie anymore. Grasp about 3 friends and share your rental costs and tear this movie over. <br /> <br /> You are ashamed of Uwe Boll. Shame on you Tara Reid. Shame on you, Christian Slater. Shame on you Stephen Dorff. Shame on anyone associated with this film.
