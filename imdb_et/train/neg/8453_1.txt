This movie is a mash-mash confused with recent cinema clich√©s. There are some promising ideas, but when the director had clearly tried to end the haunted vague film, he was a confusing mess. The main actor, Daniel Wu, is doing a decent job, but in the absence of a central theme, he does not seem to have much work. In addition, the film is very scary (although there are some horrible moments in the flutter). <br /> <br /> * GREAT SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> We have a mysterious death of strangers, devilish librarians, ghostly love interests, confusion of identity, death of wild monkeys, papal conflict, malicious fathers, sublimated homosexuality and crime gangs. The only real common thing that these elements share is that they seem to cause the main character a vague confusion and dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this movie is that despite the fact that the brother died in monkeys that are heavily featured on the DVD cover, this action is never shown directly. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what seems to be a monkey stock - not very scary. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Avoid this. For an excellent psychological, ambiguous horror story, see the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).
