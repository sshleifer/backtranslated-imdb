This is one of those films that could have been great. The main prerequisite is good - the immortal cat people who kill live, etc. - Variability of the Vampire concept. <br /> <br /> What makes it all break down is the gross negligence of the main characters. Even sociopaths know that if you want to survive, you need to keep a low profile - see how long it took for Unibomber to catch it, and that was because the family member did it. <br /> <br /> By contrast, the child (and to a lesser extent the mother) behaves as if they were inviolable. The child kills without thinking that they will not leave evidence or a trace or a living witness. How these people managed to survive and remain undiscovered within one month is incredible, not to mention decades or centuries. <br /> <br /> It's really a shame - it could have been as much as it would have been credible, ie giving the main characters a level of common sense that they would have had to get for so long. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is not a bad show. I loved a bit at the end of every town's cat approaching the house - every time I put the food in the porch and seeing our cats suddenly hurry from where they were before, I mean this scene.
