When people from Cinema Video collected their fine "Slapstick Encyclopedia" collection, which was a silent multi-choice cassette, one decided to open their first installment on ONE TOO MANY (1916), a hidden one-reel farce. very young Oliver Hardy. As enjoyable as the set is all, this decision was unfortunate because ONE TOO MANY is a very bad film that almost doesn't let the viewer look more. Like any typical farce, it includes greed, panic when the plans are frightening, and complications that get worse absurd, but unlike good ones, ONE TOO MANY is inconsistent, inconvenient and completely annoying. Here it is difficult to say whether a hopelessly confused plot is the result of a lost material or an unfair film, but regardless of the reason, even the most disturbing viewer has no idea what the relationship is or what is happening and eventually it is no longer caring. <br /> <br /> The only interesting point here is to see the 24-year-old "Babe" Hardy, who looks much harder than he was a decade later when he joined Stan Laurel, but still full of youthful energy. Open in the scene when the awakening is hanging, Babe fills a very sporty upside down bed. Trust me, it's as funny as this movie gets. If you read this before you see the first cassette in "Cinema" Slapstick Encyclopedia ", I suggest you move it quickly and skip it.
