As many agree, the origin of the beautiful anime is artificially. Music, graphics and the created world are proud, and this is really the most other modern animated works. However, if you are looking for more than what I recommend looking elsewhere. Beauty stops from its appearance and if it really falls on the plot and the characters, there is nothing special. The activity is slow and minimal, and people are flat, interrupted and not working. Not to mention the parcels here and the plot of land there. So all in all, oh, my goodness, I've never seen such a beautiful anime as that; and oh, my goodness, it's like ... - boy-people don't work that way. In the anime, graphics and music took the GIANT step forward, but it took a few steps back in times of bad character and unfortunately there are not so many steps to do that.
