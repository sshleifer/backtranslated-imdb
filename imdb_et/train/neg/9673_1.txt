"The plants are the most insidious and cruel of all life forms," ​​one of the hostile victims says, "Seedlings", foolish, flaky transformation, "Human Invasion", "Trichide Day" and about a thousand udder moovies. And why are seeds as dangerous as plants, can you ask? Because, according to the same dolod, "seeds can track us". Yeah, I remember one terrible case when MooCow was just a calf that drove from school on the cluster ball ... Yeah, right. Unfortunately, such tiny turkeys "monsters" like sons look like little mups, some of which roll like evil tumbleweeds, others who ride on strings. There is not even a small fear or arrest here. For inexplicable reasons, ejaculations are overthrown with 50-fold ultraviolet light, although they can walk in daylight, with about 1,000,000,000,000 times more UV energy. As you can see, this cow flop was not much thought. MooCow says you leave a rich garden instead of wasting your photosynthesis. : 8P
