I wish I had the money back from that trash that I could donate to the home of obsolete actors. The whole garbage! Five people were watching this movie at the same time and there was no laugh to hear, a lot of horror. Paltrow is a beautiful woman and she was the best thing to look at in a so-called comedy film.
