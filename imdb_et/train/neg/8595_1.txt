Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are both great actors who can definitely respond to them. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Detective Watching" (2007) offers only one to both participants and audiences. not to fall asleep to a sensibly boring, very predictable and unimaginable story. <br /> <br /> "Detective Watching (2007)" is trying to be very funny, but comedy is forced, extremely poorly targeted and embarrassing to the full ridiculous edge. <br /> <br /> After a third of the movie, there is still nothing that can even hit the most unwelcome audience, like the director's friends and relatives, not to mention the fact that it really happens <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure everyone who liked it was fake or had to fake it like Neil's former girlfriend when she showed her an old black-and-white film she didn't care less about. "Detective Detection (2007)" is not close to Category B, somewhere between Q&R, for example - Questions? and -Repress Questions! The director knows what he's doing! Well, if his goal was to bring the viewer to death, he has done a great job! <br /> <br /> "Detective Watching (2007)" was a waste of full time for Lucy Alexise Liu and Cillian Murphy, bur PLEASE Don't let her waste your time! <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 100.
