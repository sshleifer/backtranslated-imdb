I thought they should have called this "Whites" instead of "Heights". Godawful ... a movie that makes people hate in New York. People who are so confident and think their life is so important ... give me a break. The lilac-white goggle that Glenn Close was the most ethnical in it, cried out to be a real one and steal it ... ) who should be in Wales! Intellectually dishonest ... this film is such a film that is capable of thinking so many people that it makes sense, because it is more ambitious. It is better to fill theaters with MI5-10 if this pretentious mess ... has to be better to play because you can't fall off the floor.
