I bought this video for $ 1 in Walmart's trash. I think I'm paid over !!! In the 1940s, Bela Lugos made a small studio (in this case, the Monogram - those who made most of Bowry Boys' films) a triple film. Although most of these films have not come to a terrible nuisance, their latest films have been (Ed Wood's "classic", such as the monster's bride and the plan of 9 cosmos), but they are still poor films and should be avoided by everyone. but most hard fans. <br /> <br /> I am an old movie junkie, so I gave it a try. In addition, some of these few movies were pretty good - just not. <br /> <br /> Lugosi is another crazy scientist who wants his pretty strange and violent woman to keep her concocts from young brides through the serum. They have never explained why it was supposed to be a bride or why it should be a woman, or even what a woman's illness was - so you can see that the plot hasn't been dropped at all. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a really annoying female reporter (Lois Lane type without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to reach the bottom of the visible murders where the bodies were STOLEN! So, he follows some hints up to the Lugos door. The home of Lugos is with his crazy wife, female husband, and two strange people who are probably the assistant sons (ugly descendant generation and dwarf). Of course, this nice reporter appears throughout the film - apparently, narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! In the end, the maniac ALL dies - mostly because of their hands and everything is fine. Finally, the reporter and the doctor with whom he just met decide to marry. And, of course, the reporter's darkness amazes the cameraman when it happens. If you haven't noticed, there is a lot of fainting in this movie. Or maybe because it was such a slow and pointless movie, they just slept!
