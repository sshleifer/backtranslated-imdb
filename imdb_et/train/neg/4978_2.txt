This movie lost me with a spiked RPG (rocket-driven garnet). It was like someone cut and stuck on Robocop's scene. I thought Beowulf says, "I like it!" <br /> <br /> I watched it because I like Chris Bruno's "The Dead Zone" TV show and he did his part. He chose a strange accent, but at least he kept it differently with regard to the whole movie - unlike all his costumes. They continued every kind of speech from the old English to modern English, sometimes in the same sentence. <br /> <br /> There are already many comments on how this film is different from the source material. But even independently, this film plot is not good. It's just boring, which even a small budget doesn't excuse. A low budget means that you must have at least a good story, dialogue and decent action. These things don't cost much. Instead, they spent half of their money on CGI and some decent costumes and kits. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to watch this movie.
