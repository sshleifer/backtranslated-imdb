Early film, directed by D.W. Griffith; this is a gloriously happy king (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Marion Leonard) - but wait! When the King leaves the scene, the Queen makes music with the Minstrel Palace (Henry B. Walthall). When the king discovers the lovers, he decides to make the dreadful Edgar Allen's poetry revenge. It is hard to believe that lovers will not hear those who represent them; although the actors try to alternate between noisy (lovers) and silent (cement mixers). Sets look like "The Sealed Room" very staged. Performances are fine and the story is easy to follow. <br /> <br /> Sealed Room (9.9.2009) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard
