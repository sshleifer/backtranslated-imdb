"Semana Santa" or "Angel Of Death" is a very weak film. Mira Sorvino plays a detective who tries to find a murderer who lets people get arrows. Mira has an Italian accent that occasionally disappears. Does he just speak English? All other characters have an Mexican accent that Dialogue is very bad and its handover is wood. Cinema looks nice, but it's not enough to save that salvation. NEXT PART OF THIS REVIEW contains spoilers !! At peak times, it seems that the villain is going away, but then he comes back down the stairs to get down and make a cool stunt. This only shows that the script has no originality. AVOID!
