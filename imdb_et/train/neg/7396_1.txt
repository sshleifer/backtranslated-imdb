Unfortunately, I have to agree with a critic written by halopes. <br /> <br /> Short film has cinematography, costumes, kits, sound, editing and everything else very good. It may seem surprising at first, but I was told that the technical team working on it is made up of professionals, so quality is expected. The problem, as usual, lies in the story itself. <br /> <br /> The thing is that it is not really a story. To tell a story (or a SHOW story about a movie), you need a plot and conflicts. You need things that happen to the main character: events. These events happen because the protagonist wants something and for some reason can't get it. Tim Watcher has no problems or goals. He is a kind of supernatural entity that monitors humanity. That's it. So we have a clean exposure here. Instead of showing the story, we just learn things related to that Tim Watcher individual. Of course, given the timeless nature of Tim Watcher and the short duration of the film, it is difficult for him to give enough background information so that the movie sites go to Voice-Over Narration. In this case, it is used in the worst sense, which is to provide information that we would never have. In fact, if it wasn't for VO, we would think that the character was just a kooky old man looking around. To make it worse, VO also explains what is happening on the screen! The images shown are just the text we hear. <br /> <br /> It could be said that this short film would give a good video to the band or something, but because the pictures are not stand alone, it is impossible to say. Obviously, this value is a measure of the team's technical capabilities (not incredible but good), but it is unable to show entertainment, amusement, excitement or at least the story.
