I don't waste that much time because I don't like that it's really the beginning of the movie, but the careless mish-mash borrowed from the footage and the embarrassingly amusing new footage that has been made just for sticking and naming the whole confusion of "Boogeyman". In the literal sense, 80% of this movie has been stolen from its far superior predecessor "The Boogeyman", a film that the writers of this garbage probably didn't even look at because they didn't even get the actress Suzanna Love's original character (Lacy) right. And to offend the injuries, the killer is invisible in the original film material and visible in the new film, they probably think their audience is as stupid as they are. 0 out of 10 and I want the IMDb rating system to go so low, the toughest, and the most blatant, to drop people's money, which I've even seen, you've warned!
