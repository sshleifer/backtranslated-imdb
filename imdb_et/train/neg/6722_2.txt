You'll ever sit through the movie and after that it's like a big "wtf!?". <br /> <br /> Welcome to Decoy. <br /> <br /> Another straight video feed flick that you can immediately forget about being watched or better still doesn't look at it at all. Peter Weller and Robert Patrick celebrate this fast-paced mercenary activity, where the story is pretty bad and this action sucks, and seeing action when the action blows? In particular, Robert Patrick strikes a new low-level sequence where he put a machine gun on the hood of a moving school bus. Together, Ambient Charlotte Lewis and Canada own Scott Hylands (TV Night Heat fame).
