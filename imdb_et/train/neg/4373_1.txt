I think I'm just guilty of a giant disappointment, "Virgo Entrances." You already know you're not expecting a cinematic masterpiece if you see such a succulent and proudly promoted title, and the first impression is only a confirmation when the film comes from Japan in the mid-1980s. Currently, there are quite a lot of demented and sick filmmakers in Japan, but Kazuo Komizu crosses all of them with his thoroughly exhausted and ill trilogy that focuses not only on aggressive sex and young girls' sadistic abuse. Not even trying to tell the story, but "virgin deliveries" are just a UN-side semi-pornographic sex and really bad gore effects, which wouldn't even appeal to the weakest fan of the 80's horror horror. Among the pictures, photographers and their fashion models are inexplicably linked to the dirty pervert scenes with a seemingly minor girl. He digs him even after a minute at the peak (typical) and he asks him to stay, even if he has to share it with others. I can't get it. Should it represent a general male fantasy? Because it's really a clich√© and a lie. Anyway, back to horny photographers and obedient models. As a surprise to come home due to the upcoming mist, the group is attacking an abandoned country house where they have a more terrible sex and eventually fall into a ridiculous sex demon who kills them all. Functional performances are amateur, dialogues and primitive, and Komizu's direction is weak and intrusive. I can tolerate all this, including portraying a woman's unfavorable gender, but I was too close to turn off the movie indescribably during the mean mental wrestling sequence. One of the men is brutally hit, hitting and throwing a girl around and calling her a dirty whore until she literally gets her panties and cries. This is my absolute low point in the Asian Asian cinema in my humble opinion. One to avoid and possibly even boycott.
