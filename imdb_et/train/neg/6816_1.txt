I have to say that there is nothing wrong with low budget movies, so it wasn't my problem. My problem is that I felt like I was watching my neighbor's home movie. IMO all this just seemed like a man wrote a quick story, grabbed the camera and started shooting. I understand how hard it is to do it efficiently, but when I pay for renting a movie, I think I feel like watching a professionally made movie. <br /> <br /> John Schneider has a tremendous sequel, a great actor and it was good in this movie. Other people were not there. I understand how it must be nice and cheaper to use friends and relatives, but it doesn't provide convincing action. It seemed as if it was shot, he tried to give many scenes a more interesting look, but when it comes to writing, plot and acting, this type of style is not necessary and it is a distraction. <br /> <br /> At the technical level, it was also a digital artifact all over the place. In the first scene of all these small cars, when they scanned them slowly, they seemed a bit back. The problem is not in my viewing devices (Benq PE-8700 84 "diagonal"), but somewhere in production, I've never seen this kind of items in a professionally made movie. Then there was sound. they did not make any voice transmissions, which may be ok unless it sounds on this film. It sounded like a camera's built-in microphone.
