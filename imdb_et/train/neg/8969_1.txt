The plot has no new excitement, it even starts with the same cube I. This time there are no other improvements to the cube machines except the extra exit option, which is not guarded, very brilliant. The characters are not as well developed as in the first episode, they just became "flat" as in soap opera. <br /> <br /> If someone does this for normal exit, people will be asked some questions, such as "Do you believe in God?" it fits the mystery of this cube in the trap. There is nothing else to say about it.
