Promising and interesting is the premise and subject matter of understanding the crime that his victims captured in his family. But this is the only interesting part, which was discussed 20 years ago by quite a bit, directed by director Ravi Tandon in his movie "Jawab" (1985), a problem with Ace director Rajkumar Santoshi, who found himself confused whether it was a fast-paced thriller (namely Khakee) or the grandiose dramatic drama of emotion (Viz. Damini) and this confusion is quite obvious in the end. Lajja (2001), this brilliant director has always given us very entertaining films with great entertainment value, which is why this film is a surprise about what made this script a sensitive director for baking both main characters. Amitabh Bachchan and Aryeman When the film goes over, the audience who was hated and to whom to express compassion did not know, and this factor is the main limiting force of all the narration, which starts as a war with a common man and the underworld ends up as the self-realization and regret of the Danes that he owns went wrong with the family. The son of Doni's revelation as a real scammer is not a surprise element that, compared to the similar situation of "Khakees", worked with Aishwarya so effectively that it is not all, the more. The life of the underworld operating abroad seems rather illogical, his open landing in Mumbai, where he assumes he will flee, and will run unbelievable after his enemies and their own. as Aryeman, unlike Mr Bachchan, is not a good idea again, but the film still has some positive points: Ashok Mehta's exquisite camera work, two good fighting sequences (co-ordinator Abbas Ali Moughal), some well-functioning light scenes from Akshay Kumar in I half, Santoshi's fast paced treatment And, of course, Mr Bachchan, as usual, is trying to live his inanimate character, but all of them do not make it an exciting experience to watch r and your family!
