The story is a bit slow and a bit stupid. Greta Garbo doesn't seem very good and I couldn't understand half of what she said about her accent, which was exaggerated for this role. Meanwhile, Melvyn Douglas plays his usual improbable role and Constance Bennett is just like his few screams, which were funny. On the plus side, Roland Young had the best role in the film. I want him to have more lines because he disappeared in the second half of the year. It was also interesting to see that Ruth Gordon looks so young. I saw him only in the mad roles he played from the late 60s to the 80s and attacked an old woman. Of course, the best part could have been the last few minutes when we see a nice man doing amazing things on skis, pretending he's Douglas falling on the slopes. It was an amazing and humorous film material. <br /> <br /> Overall, I see where this movie - Garbo's last - wasn't a box-office success. It just pulls too far, goes on and deals with fraud. This is a tedious story. Garbo knew it and called it to close.
