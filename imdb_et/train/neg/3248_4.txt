Why did I see this movie? Honestly, since Jim Carrey was in this and in the past, he has made fun movies that have made me laugh so you really blame me for waiting again? In addition, I was encouraged by the assumption, the funny trailer, the involvement of his co-star Jennifer Aniston and the fact that it was a huge blow to the state. <br /> <br /> However, as my "one line summary" suggests, I was disappointed. For various reasons: <br /> <br /> Cause 1: It wasn't funny. With a 2-hour movie, I laughed about 5-10 minutes ... all together, the rest of the time I thought, "I should have got ice cream". I admit that maybe it is wrong to understand Jim Carrey about his earlier films, but what he really expects when he does Gemi, such as "Truman Show", "Liar Liar", "Me, Me and Irene", "Stupid and Dumber ',' Mask 'and' Ace Ventura 'films then produce such a mediocre movie in Bruce Nolan's own words? <br /> <br /> Reason 2: Jennifer Aniston's role was criminally assured. in the public eye and in this movie he says about four lines. Wrong. <br /> <br /> Cause 3: One word - clich√© <br /> <br /> Cause 4: Randomly used American references - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite 'Sweeping Week - Have a Clue to a Movie Specially Homemade Complaint.' The teenager says drugs and yes to education - it's a miracle! Want to see miracles soon? Be a miracle! "God tells Bruce that this is a much more difficult vengeance in the US, but it can face tougher resistance in markets that retain nuances. And I'm still at school, and this statement refers to me and all of my friend's miracles. or maybe it just means the brain? <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are enough funny Carrey moments to make you fool and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a complete accident, but you are advised to start reviewing your expectations.
