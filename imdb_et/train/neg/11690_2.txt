Such a weak and boring film is such a waist to enjoy such great actors. In addition to all the unanswered questions posted in other comments, what is so difficult to catch the robbers? Just remove the bank staff, see who was in the bank - from all the corners of the camera films - before you get into the robber and you have these 4 remaining robbers in hostage. Where's the relationship that everyone is talking about? It was so obvious that the hostages were asked to make such an identical form so that they all went out of the door ... seen it many times. At least Mr. Spike Lee could have tasted the film with some good music and artistic photography. The film is not worth it. Pronto!
