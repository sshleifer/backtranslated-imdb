I refused to look at it when it was originally incited, commemorating the memories of the late 1960s with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cop, but I can never resist. I should have felt better. Not quite a remake and parody as an honor, this exhibition didn't know how to play it, and plumpered with the comedy and comic strips and badges of babies. The three main characters were slightly more than the cartoons of the actors, and only Emilia Fox was able to act (Bob Mortimer is in pain). Supporting pains were only Vic and Bob's comic acquaintances who wanted to be a joke, and too aware that the situation was convincing. And CGI, although the effects could not have been made available 30 years earlier, they can simply dazzle the viewer with light and camera work and did little to hide the scripts and dialogue with poor quality. The whole style and substance. (And since the exhibition of the 1960s is mocked for being a lot of time, this "update" is now very dated, with "Matrix" style fashion design, mandatory "girls" scenes, and less than a subtle tension between the two lives takes.)
