Well, it's Robin Hood like "geezer" all right ... as advertised! It didn't look very promising, and unfortunately it was worse than I suspected. <br /> <br /> Ladi Robin, whom I can take; Robin, who interferes with the real color of the daughter I can credit; but Robin, who is exchanging a non-very funny trap for one of his minions, is harder to swallow, and Robin and * all cast * who seem to be heavier in managing their lines are a kiss of punishment. How could somebody let such painful delivery pass the scenes again? Again and again it sounds like he is fighting semi-understandable Shakespeare rather than letting his salt quip get rid of; I was hoping at first that it was just an unfortunate comedy feature that was clearly intended as a comedy sidekick role, but then it began to spread all over the cast. <br /> <br /> Whatever you are talking about, Errol Flynn was in the role of being able to offer a high-profile dialogue, of course, just as if he was just thinking about its current status ... and as it shows, it's not that easy as it sounds! When they began to harass the characters, the actors in question would have had to give the appropriate features: they sound like they have no idea how to deal with them. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid For the same reason I didn't even like the pantomime Sheriff; the lines are obviously not meant to be serious, but delivered to the audience (and in this case in writing) with the eye and eye. They're out of place - the fourth wall-breaking thing - but it's not really funny. <br /> <br /> This much promised production reminded me of a sliding school game. The only actor and character I felt at all was the one who played the Gisbourne Guy, who was the only one who seemed to have a) a reliable herb and (b) a credible testimony - but frankly I wouldn't it has not said that it was a great rise for the future of the series! At the time of writing, I give him another hope that things may improve a little over the next week and fall into bed, as setting the scenes required is weaker and perhaps the participants will communicate better with the dialogue: after all, the "Doctor Kes" opening episode was not exactly the closing of the exhibition, it wasn't nearly as bad as it was. But if I don't see any improvement after episode 2, I'm afraid that the series has almost certainly lost one viewer. <br /> <br /> What would be a shame, because I have a Robin Hood Legend on the screen, Douglas Fairbanks adventures, and Richard Greene's strong addiction, but this Robin can't blend my blood anyway.
