With such a headline you know that you get a lot of spam. Bad. The script is bad. The director is bad. Grammar is bad. <br /> <br /> Film makes a lot of noise, not really music and many people shout. The film makes a bad racial stereotype. Why is every movie a black hero drug addict? Why should a hero always dance to be successful? Why is a famous rapper always in a dance movie? Why can't the letter "s" be the title? > Do it yourself and don't look.
