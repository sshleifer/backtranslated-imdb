Well ... I was waiting for this video to see, and I wish I had, on the second day, a really terrifying film of cable 2, and it made me longer what I got on AIRPLANE CRACK ... I mean you like the plane or any other Leslie nielsen vehicle, it is probably in the sky, but if you are accustomed to WAYANS COMEDY then you are violent, there were many more candies in the eye that keeps the young hormones happy for kidnapped teen boys, which is probably why it was a box that hit the first week. I enjoyed the terrifying movie 2 ten times more than this feed and some 5 times more. Strangely, the better of 3 is part 2, but I always liked Halloween 2 better than the original. The fun part of the movie must be how foreigners say goodbye. But it wasn't worth the $ 11 I spent with my husband with this matrix. Save yourself cash and retrieve Part 2 again with the cable until it appears on the video tape and then rent it, don't buy it.
