It's enjoyable and fast. <br /> <br /> There is no chance that Matti will play eighteen on Earth. But the main thing is that he works eighteen very convincingly. His hearing must be a credit that he persuaded them to put on him. I soon took the boy of a na√Øve youth with him. <br /> <br /> Although he was the best result, most of the others were very interesting. In particular, the interaction between police officers was natural and balanced and worked very well. <br /> <br /> It's only about 45 minutes long so the plot is not complicated. More keys are the style of the whole thing. It is very slippery and lively, and the backgrounds are atmospheric, especially because all the colors are very rich. Gangland is identifiable to foreign target groups, but still manages to be an Australian.
