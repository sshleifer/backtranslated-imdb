I can't believe that this movie even made a video, and that video rental stores are ready to put it on their shelves. I literature asked for support. Take advantage of the fact that the film has no historical truth, and it is still a worse film ever found in the video store. It's not even good enough to be called a B-rated movie. Don't waste your money or time on this movie. Just hearing the voice and terrible music made me sick. Anyone involved in this film should be pulled out of the trade union, giving the industry a black mark, but after looking at most of this movie, I really don't think anyone is affiliated with a member of the Union.
