Gymkata is undoubtedly one of the worst films. But not bad movies. It's so terrible that it's fun to watch and laugh. Kurt Thomas does not obviously have a profitable career. He should go to gym. But who can forget such memorable scenes as chalk, a high horse or a five-minute chase that is a village of ages. I don't think it was supposed to be that bad, but who says it. It's not art, but if you want something lite and fluffy that makes a good conversation, rent a gym. Makes a fun evening.
