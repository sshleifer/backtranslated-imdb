This can be one of the most enjoyable movies if you don't take it seriously. It's a bit dated and the effect is flat, but it's so enjoyable. There are giant crabs that attack the girl. Oh, and the crabs sing Japanese. It's amazingly bad. And the end of the movie with the telegraph is awfully fantastic. Predictable, but seeing the final fight leaves you on your seat rolling. Don't even give this movie a chance and you love it. Susan George is fun to watch and yes, she looks naked. Her daughter is not quite worth it, but the giant crabs are attacking her. These are the size of big cats. It's 2, but I love it. Like a movie, my God, but for entertainment, I'll give him 7. Did I mention that there are giant crabs?
