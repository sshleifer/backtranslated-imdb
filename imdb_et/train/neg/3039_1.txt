I can always say when something will hit. I see it or hear it and get a good feeling. I didn't get a good feeling when I looked at the preview. I was not enthusiastic about this movie and I am not surprised that it is rated here as one of the worst 100 films. I was actually right. <br /> <br /> The first thing that kicked me was the title. Not that I have an ebonics problem (I'm black), but for the film they could have used a better title and at that time use a title that doesn't have bad grammar. I heard the dialogue, saw the acting and everything I could do was to do the face. <br /> <br /> I also think that the theme of the dance film is superfluous. At least "You Served" was, in my opinion, better than that. Even the soundtrack didn't excite me.
