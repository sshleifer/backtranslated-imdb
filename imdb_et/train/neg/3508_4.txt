Despite the overwhelming cult that followed this sad "documentary", I have to admit that I have worshiped a film that hit our parties so much as disturbingly as useful informative. This means that after seeing this great stage music you can understand what the film might have been like. <br /> <br /> One suspects that many of us who have been actively affected by the film may have been in some campy delicacy with their brutal fans who were destroyed by an unpleasant suspicion that too many of us - or those we know - are only two or two withdrawal from two depicted mad women living and contributing to a strange situation that seems to be able to control or escape. <br /> Film leaves the viewer desperately how someone could slip into this level of degradation and, unlike music, does not offer warning hints or explanations, but only a horror game that is not found in humor or understanding. <br /> <br /> This destructive plane of the film's soul makes the performance (hopefully filmed for the cable) even more remarkable. Law II is faithful to the film in question in almost every detail, but it is strange to set the difficulties of sad prisoners to music and to increase the tragedy of art. More importantly, this law is preceded by a good law I, where we meet women before their proper reciprocal madness and are offered tips on how their isolated cans were formed. In short, all that FILM does not have. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers' credits (or their descendants) include the excellent Criterion DVD edition of extracts and bonus material that partially redeem the main film - scenes photos, interviews, and commentary - some empty spots are filled in the original editing deliberately without leaving fear and depression. They cannot satisfy the amateur film themselves, but they can at least make it somewhat more understandable. Ultimately, it is just a spectacular stage inspired by this book by writer Doug Wright, composer Scott Frankel and writer Michael Korie, who raises the rating of the original GRAY GARDENS over one single (a generous star.
