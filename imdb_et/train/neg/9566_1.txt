I see a lot of movies. You saw the original wargame years ago and loved it. Computers, where most of us and the movie still have a "big secret" were convincing, are in their own way. <br /> <br /> It looks like a small budget on Wednesday night special. Total mess from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The plot is so weak that you don't believe it until you see the movie (which I wouldn't recommend first). I can't point out one actor who actually worked in this movie. But hey, with this script I would be surprised if someone could do a good job. Lots of clich√© scenes. CGI looks like it has been taken out of the '86 version. <br /> <br /> Bah, no, I get a bad mood on it. DON'T look at this movie. <br /> <br /> Life is short to waste on watching movies.
