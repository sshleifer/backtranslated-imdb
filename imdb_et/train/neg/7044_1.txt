How sad to see that beautiful and talented Tina Louise reduced this terrible apology for the film. Tina still seemed fit and attractive, but for some reason it seems really frightened. I understand his fear; fearing that this third-degree smell is somewhat released to the public. I'm also a fan of Adam West. Again, as with Tina, Adam sees a good and good shape for his age. His actions here are satisfactory, but the script is so bad that even listening to the dialogue is difficult. <br /> <br /> The film is from the classic Brando biker flick, The Wild Onest. The horse biker gang is out of control in a small hick city. The cyclists here look like a dirty group and I wouldn't want them to be my sister so far. The actor is rigid and wood, and the story is as old as sand. Hellriders are hell to watch!
