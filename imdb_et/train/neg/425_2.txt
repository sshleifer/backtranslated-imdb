I can't believe I'm so angry after I see that I write my first review of IMDb. <br /> <br /> This Disney documentary is nothing more than a planned planet Earth. Now I knew it was going to be advertised as "the people who brought you the planet Earth," but I had no idea they were going to use exactly the same cuts as groundbreaking documentaries. I just paid $ 8.75 to see what I already have on a DVD. Shame on Disney not to warn people that there is absolutely nothing original here (save James Earl Jones and 90 seconds of sailboat, which I don't believe on planet Earth). <br /> <br /> But the biggest crime is that although Planet Earth uses the tragic story of a polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecological change, Disney took it and made it family-friendly. After the death of the men's polar bear, they show that his boys grew remarkably a year later and cast some rubbish on how they are ready to carry their memory, and that the land is really a beautiful place. None of the mentioned raised sons coming to death because their father has suffered, there is no emergency message for future generations unless we get our actions together. Just editing things we've already seen in the movie (and many times more than you are one of the billions of people who have already seen the planet). <br /> <br /> I've never left the theater shame and deceived my life.
