Okay, I was bored and decided to see this movie. But I think the main thing that brought this movie down was that it would take an hour to frame, but basically the same hour is repeated 4 times. It consists of: 1. gathering troops and discussing the attack plan; 2. setbacks for male spouses; 3. The Soldier's Approach to the Long Line 4. Men running uphill and shooting; three other men saved him. Step 5: Fight the enemy and invite you to start to succeed 6. Men who flash for women and sing for 10 minutes. It was the main film and the same sequence took place about 4 or 5 times. and every time he pulled back for his wife, it showed a man, his wife and her. There were about 10 men or more who would have a backlash, so it took a long time. In addition, men could not kill their enemy except bayonets or grenades. I liked the music and there was a lot of action, although the action was repetitive. In general, I probably didn't see it again, but it wasn't too terrible.
