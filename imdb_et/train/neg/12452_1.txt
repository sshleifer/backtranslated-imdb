This movie is so bad that I won't even describe it. What's wrong with the blazing well with writers, manufacturers, and directors? How did they calmly get this abomination? The plot is ridiculous, the actor is at best bad, the story ... What's the story? The first fight in this movie is OK, but then it continues to repeat until you want to turn it off. <br /> <br /> I think I'm the biggest relaxation after turning off this stupid movie after the first minute. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I only saw this movie because Scott Adkins was in it ... and he's in that ... 30 seconds. .. <br /> <br /> I give it to 1 out of 10 because it is the lowest grade in IMDb. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor: Instead, watch Uwe Boll's movie ... twice ... it's worth your time.
