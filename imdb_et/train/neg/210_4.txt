Maybe you shouldn't compare, but the wild style and style of wars is the original Hip Hop. There are many original Hip Hop artists on Beat Street, but they have clearly made it clear that it can be their big break, of course for some, and that's great. But if you look at it as an original Hip Hop culture, you're wrong. It's super-produced and has a Hollywood sauce. Rather, look for the first two films mentioned. They have transmitted ghettos that accompany the ghetto's life. Yes, the rating of this movie is low, but reviews are mostly positive or even loot. This is probably because while the story, actors, dialogues and direction are all terrible, music and dance are what people love. I, I love dancing, but at the same time, I thought electro was the death of Hip Hop (I was so happy when the new '86 generation of Hip Hop artists appeared, like Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie little), and I don't like most of the shots in this movie and that's why it doesn't work for me. I mean, Wild Style doesn't have much story, but music is great and authentic. Of course there are different flavors and that's fine. But as far as I am concerned, this movie is in the trash, except to break the dancing and some of the music, so I can't judge it higher than 4 out of 10.
