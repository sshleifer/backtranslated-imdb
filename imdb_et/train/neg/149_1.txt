Well, you know the rest! It must be the worst film I've seen for a long time. I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had some bills to pay for this role. <br /> <br /> The leading role is played by (unknown to me) the complete unknown, and I imagine that immediately after the vagueness disappeared, Bruce Lee led the martial arts in the early 70s, and since then the fighting scenes must be based on martial arts or at least cruel when using street fighting techniques. This movie uses quick cuts to display martial arts, but even that can't hide the fact that a lady doesn't know how to break. An average 8-year-old boy would take it to the show. <br /> <br /> Sorry, the only secret here is how it didn't win the golden raspberry this year.
