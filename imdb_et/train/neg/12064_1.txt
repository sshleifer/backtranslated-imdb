This is one of the most boring horror films I've ever seen, because it's totally divine terrible, John Carradine has a very limited screen time. All the characters are boring, and the story is terrible, and I saw these two twists ending miles away!. A great place and a creepy house would certainly have helped if it wasn't so boring boring, and there is no symbol that would have rooted it, and I hope it will make it to the bottom 100 because it deserves to be there in my opinion. When John Carradine finally comes out, it's a pretty good scene, but it's too late, and the only other screen time he had was in setbacks, but the only real scene in the movie is when the character gets confused with his face, Bee's. because it was pretty tough. I got this DVD Horror set, called Back from The Grave, and everything really moves over me, and it's lucky that it contained a set that I bought otherwise, I could have pulled it out of the window! This is one of the most boring horror films I've ever seen, as it's absolutely divine terrible, John Carradine has a very limited screen time and I say avoiding it like a plague! You don't want to go through torture. The direction is absolutely terrible! Carl Monson is absolutely terrible! working here, making all things cheap, wasting your potential in making a horrible atmosphere and just keeping the movie at an incredibly empty pace. Operation is just as bad. John Carradine is good in his scene, but otherwise he is hardly in the movie except for the setback scenes. (Carradine Ruled !!). Merry Anders crosses Laura here terribly because he didn't convince me at all. Ivy Bethune is OK, and somewhat horrible, but also superfluous, he finally created a horrible smile. The rest, I didn't pay enough attention because I had a lot of problems with it, but they were all very bad. In general, please avoid this, it is not embarrassing!. BOMB 5
