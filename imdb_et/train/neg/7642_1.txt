Everyone just seems to have a sloppy theme and not really noticed how the film was made. Deaf, mute boys are good, losing victory - it's good, the cricket aspect is great, but the movie is general. I think it could be much better than it is. <br /> <br /> The plot is too predictable for a movie that is not based on a real event. I'm sure the movie could be made more interesting. The songs are just there, and I had to literally carry it where the same thing would have been shown from different angles. <br /> <br /> Good. Traceable.
