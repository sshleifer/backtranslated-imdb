At the end of the film, I felt it was too technical. I felt like I was in the classroom looking at how our navy rescues at sea. I liked to see that the engines have fire extinguishers. I think I should have figured it out before, but I've never thought about it. Using 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic. The action was pretty good because they are mostly experienced professionals, but if you go so far from what is likely to happen, it should be fantasy, comic, etc. Everything was taken too seriously. At least the film had Felix Ungar as a pilot, Buck Rogers, a night stalker and Dracula on board. The film was full of well-known faces. I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate the drama, but it is detrimental to the quality of the film, how serious the issue is about caricature. That's why I said it should have been comic. Riding my pets on a movie is that everyone is just moving randomly. They walk around with drinks and put them down and choose them 5 minutes later, as if they were in the building or something and acted just like no turbulence. I also know that this is a catastrophe, but the intercourse doesn't have to contain 30 seconds before it hits. Anyway, experienced actors and actors will keep this weak script from making a movie that got its first screening. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to see a psychotic person who got a box ... :)
