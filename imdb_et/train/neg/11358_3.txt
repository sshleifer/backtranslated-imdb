When I saw this trailer on the TV, I was surprised. In May 2008, I was in New Jersey's six flags and it showed 4-D in attraction (you know the seats are moving). I think the version I saw was a shortened version (15 minutes) and was created to add motion effects. It was a lovely movie ... but it was so. It was education and talked about the first mission, but ending the CGI space race seemed a bit ... well ... trite. I was not a big fan of the film, but I would recommend this movie to any parent who wants to make their children fun in the first moonwalk. I say that character actors were well chosen and the characters themselves were lovely. So everything, I'd say if you want to bring younger kids ... do it. But if you want to take your parents' children, take them to another movie ... they'll thank you.
