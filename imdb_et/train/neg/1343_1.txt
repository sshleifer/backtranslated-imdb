We bought this movie from the Poundland store. We were looking for more inspiration, as we have previously bought the No Big Deal movie. But it was shocking. CAUSATION is the main word that comes to mind. Bad impact and script is not enough to view it. The body of the main woman seems to have been whipped at inevitable moments, trying to keep the viewer interested. But it just makes you wonder whether they're putting the budget down to take off his clothes? If so, I would have asked for a refund! It seems to be a homemade film, the shots do not match with each other and the camera's work is so amateur that it makes our bad movies a professional. I can't believe it's sold as a marketable product. <br /> <br /> IS RESPONSIBLE and UGLY follows. Participants are bad and have no professionalism. There are no words to describe how terrible it is.
