Imagine the American anthem becoming a comic. Throw a couple of cute animals, some terrible bumps and a couple of roller skates, and you'll find yourself with an almost exact copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> I remember when I was younger; I made my mother's video store about 5 times. The story itself is not too bad, it is just that all the Marxists would definitely do something about it. <br /> <br /> If you don't like America, this movie doesn't like it.
