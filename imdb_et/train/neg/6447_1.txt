I bought this movie for $ 5 in my local video store for just one reason, Chase Masterson, but I should have crushed five plots, threw it to the toilet and rinse. There are about twenty times in the film that are cutting edge in excellence and reuniting on the anniversary of the death of their idiot friends who drunk and fell in the forest and died. The problem is that the reptile monster cools them one by one. Action is exhausting, these worthless people were obviously at exhibitions like 90210 and Dawsons Creek. Management was equal to twelve years of age and probably 13 years old. The whole set looks like someone's backyard in Malibu. The people living here who praised this film are probably the directors and / or actors' friends. Avoid this at all costs of the trash.
