Fun concept but badly done. Except for a pretty good make-up effect, there's really nothing to do with it. There are obvious problems; for example, after he seems for weeks and weeks to get fat to normal size, it seems that the main character goes from normal to deadly thin day ... and if he is deadly thin, he remains pretty much equally deadly, which seems to be long time. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film has much worse problems than it is - movie art is decisively low-quality television quality and above all, it's a terrible terrible thing. Robert John Burke always seems to be trying some sort of strange awakening of Charlton Heston and is literally painful to look at ... the only creepy thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both worse. <br /> <br /> The only reason I make this movie so high is that when a movie enters its last 1/3 or so, and Joe Mantegna's character takes over, the film's fun and fun "cheesecake slaughter" feeling develops and The gangster crazy schemes that torture the totally nasty gypsy are somewhat fun to watch. The end, if predictable, is also beautiful. Avoid being a King-o-Phile or a truly psychological idea of ​​Fat Tony's Simpsons who terrorize the Gypsy camp.
