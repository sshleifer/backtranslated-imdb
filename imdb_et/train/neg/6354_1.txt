Woody Allen has lost the ability to write dialogue or characters that are clearly distinguishable from one another. This is the case with "Melinda and Melinda", where all the characters speak of Allen's general pseudo-complexity and have problems and views that are not relative to anyone who is not within the four-block radius where Allen lives. They also have the same curiosity that they can afford the multi-million dollar Manhattan apartments, which seem to have been designed by professional designers, regardless of their financial situation or livelihood. <br /> <br /> The Only Person who exists outside of this dull mind is Will Ferrel as a mandatory substitute for Woody Allen. Although he just doesn't come by impressing Woody Allen (like Kenneth Branagh's godly "Celebrity"), Ferrel does not have the charm or charisma that real Woody had when he played this part in his best films <br /> <br /> The end result is still one of a series of self-evident eternity, once a great filmmaker who has been trading for years with his former reputation.
