This is one of the things I get a little more than most people associate because I hate noise and don't know how these big cities, New York, can get people to sleep at all! It amazes me that people can stand the noise all these days. The main thing about the film is that it makes an interesting topic. It's too bad. Tim Robbbins is decent, though with the exception of a couple of scenes (especially with an absolute supermodel that looks at Margarita Leiveva), he didn't really seem to be there. My biggest hope for this film is that paints see absolutely stunning and talented actor, Margarita Levieva. He doesn't have much to do, but he's beautiful. Even when they try to look at her more girls in the neighborhood. It makes me sad that there may be people in the world like Hilton Hilton & Kim Kardashian who have no redeemable skills or talents to gain more fame and success than this talented beauty. I don't care about this movie because the script isn't very good, but I'm glad I saw a new talent. I hope manufacturers and managers think about Margarita when they need a beautiful new actor to be on the big budget. If they can make Megan Fox's star (he's not so hot, and his acting "talent" is worse than Disney's TV shows), then it should just happen to him as he's gorgeous & talent! I suggest that you change your last name so that we can pronounce it and make it more marketable. Here is the hope that this will make her a career, and if there is justice, she can open a few big summer movies or two over the next few years.
