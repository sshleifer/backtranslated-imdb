For that reason, I liked the somewhat high hopes for Tim Roth. I was not happy with this movie. I liked Ang Lee The Hulk a few years ago, so I thought it had more bangs. First of all, I was very disappointed with John Hurt's performance here. She looks like her eyebrows have been redesigned. His performance was not convincing. He was not as good as he would have expected. Tim Roth is cool as always here. Gama's thing was not really the original storyline I don't think. I think the best part of the movie was the end. It had some cool action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. It's not that long, but from time to time it was a bit boring. I remember a while ago when Walmart had a really cheap movie and I always thought why?. Now I know. I was hoping I could blow, but I wasn't.
