It doesn't mean the depth of Creepshow 3, but it's close. It also uses the same technique to use some of the same actors in a number of roles throughout the anthology that disturbs at least say. <br /> <br /> It is also a rather irritating rap out of Twilight Zone (where the bookstore is comparable to Serling's later night experience). Unfortunately, manufacturers and writers forgot that Serling would build his symbolism before they handed them over. No symbol is particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segment. <br /> <br /> Frame Story: Adam West is ... well, by yourself. He doesn't go to Bruce Wayne / Batman's 60's, but he rarely does it. He just plays a non-particularly mysterious "Jay" (there is an ominous backbone cooling name that is comparable to Dr. Terror, Private and Cryptkeeper) and makes some uncomfortable / horrible statements. <br /> <br /> Abernathy: Have you seen Rod Serling's "Stop Willoughby's"? Then you've seen it. Nutso's red herring is unused, but even the main character's friend recognizes her as a wimp. As well anticipated, but fundamentally inconsistent. <br /> <br /> Nex's Diner: Reminiscent of a variety of Serling times, blended with Steve Allen's 'Thought Meeting'. Most of the actors are not too bad (except Josh Astin as Cassius, who manages to walk, talk and even breathe) and the idea is slightly interesting. But like Abernathy, it doesn't go anywhere. The protagonist raises some relatively reasonable questions, a bit of a mistake (who wouldn't be?), And for some reason he ends up on nuclear waste. <br /> <br /> Life Repetition: Not a bad little piece and succeeds ahead of both Click and Creepshow 3. I think it says something that people charm about the magic features of the remote control. The main character is lightly sympathetic. There is nothing important here, but it's okay. <br /> <br /> Fighting Spirit: You see a twist that has come a mile away, but as the main character, it has a heart and it is a good defeat and redemption. /> <br /> Finale: So ... why do people get into cold storage in silver costume costumes? Do not know. And it makes no sense. So ... all the protagonists went to the bookstore and traps? Kinda undermines a happy ending with a boxer (thanks, boys!) And the first segment man died. So how did he get trapped? Did he visit the bookstore before he died, trapped and ... did not die? What? Ah? I think it is not reasonable, because it is supernatural. But still ... <br /> <br /> Generally: There are basically no two newer Twilight Zone series or some episodes of Tales From the Darkside or Monsters. The last two tracks and the second part are probably worth your time. But there is nothing very remarkable here.
