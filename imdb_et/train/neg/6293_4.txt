I was happy to watch this movie early and I have to say that I thought it would be boring and wondering how they could ever improve the 1984 Bachelor's version, which plays Tom Hanks, which I thought it was pretty good ... I was right ... To be honest, I thought it might have been better ... Of course it was funny moments, but it just didn't make me sign ... The show was OK and the story pretty well follows the original, but I think it could have been so much better ... This movie I would say is for teenagers and youngsters of the heart; full of female organs, alcohol and sex ... This is another typical mill party movie made over and over again. 4/10 is my vote.
