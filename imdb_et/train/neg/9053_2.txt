I just found that the television show "Mash" tricked, preached, oh so "politically correct", repetitive, pretentious, and the greatest sin of all, and that is? that it was (was) incredibly boring. You have the main leader, Alan Alda, "(star)", who is so in love with himself and his wisdom that it made me uncomfortably even try and sit through the episode. In the original series, both McLean Stevson and Wayne Rogers, whom I gladly admitted, had some panic and style in the presentation of their character. Harry (Henry) Morgan and Mike Farrell, both individually and together, are like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread. Loretta Swit, which I also found dumb, including her own guilt, was no wonder to look at, and Gary Burghoff, who was good in the film, was tired of watching and showing that it was at the show. This was shown to me in one exhibition a year. Jamie Farr was just a low "comedy" and that's not worth it at all. The reason why I did not give this (one) rating that everyone is currently thinking of is that all ratings are not just subjective speech, but relative. With the exception of relatively few exceptions, television is such. It was fairly said that Mash had some quality of production (according to television standards) of this era and of today, and that is why it is earned from two. Rob Ritter
