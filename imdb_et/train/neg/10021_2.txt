The worst movie I've seen since Tera Jadoo's Chal Gaya. No story, no humor, nothing! The sequences seem to be a series of random Akshay Kumar Thumbs-Up ads. The matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle were heavily influenced, but very poorly executed. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much, but watching this movie is an irritating experience that makes you think: "What were these guys thinking about" !! ". <br /> <br /> The only thing you remember after watching it is anorexic Kareena in bikini. <br /> <br /> The reason I didn't give a rating of 1 'is that every time I think I've seen the worst, Bollywood wrongly proves me.
