I watch a lot of frightening movies (or at least they're trying to be) and this must be the worst, if not the worst, film I've ever had to do. I never knew the depth of masakism until I rented this piece of pressed cheese covered with used latex. I'm a fan of Julian Sansi, but it's worse than I hope for. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the story was promising and I was intrigued ... the first hour and a half, credited with credit, and I still had to see what the pain seemed like first. Maybe there are some viewers who enjoyed it and can direct me in the right direction, but then I know those viewers who understand if they don't remember me, especially if we had to turn off the video and just NOT ready to watch us (we we had to make one exception). <br /> <br /> If it had been prepared, I would give him the opportunity to have as long as they had a maximum of 1% of the original. That is all.
