The film had a good concept, but the execution just didn't answer it. <br /> <br /> What is it? Well, the story, it's "Dirty Harry," which corresponds to "M". The killing of children has started to terrorize the city. The main detectives (Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest) have never dealt with the serum killer before. The mayor and the chief of police desperately ask secretly the local mobile to speed things up ... go places and do things the police can not stop as soon as possible to end this confusion <br /> <br /> really good things. <br /> <br /> Besides the concept, I liked the hidden appearance of the killer. Norman Bates is in his basement. This man has a shameful drain. In some frames, light comes out of the water and creates ripping reflections on the walls; these scenes often give horrible, dreamlike quality. <br /> <br /> Operation was also good. Dennis Hopper is one of those actors who are getting older. <br /> <br /> When you are over, it will go less or less. <br /> <br /> Movie is pace too fast. The actual research process from both teams is very fast, not complicated and interesting. It could have been fixed in two ways: make the movie longer or cut some of the many sub-blocks. Each of them would have given the team the opportunity to devote more time to the actual mystery. <br /> <br /> An example of how bad it is is one of the most important tips that will help them reset just the right suspect. this: at one point in your life a suspect pet shop ... It is right ... I'm here serious. It's like they went from point A (first hint) to Z (suspect) and took over all "intermediate" steps. <br /> <br /> Then there are characters. The only one I really liked was the two pocket pockets you met halfway through. Given that they are small characters, I would call it a bad sign. <br /> <br /> Finally, there's a mobile. That's what gets me the most, because that's why I coughed up $ 3 to buy a DVD first. I mean, what's hooked! Over the last 10-15 years, there has been an absolute number of serum killers. Mobi's angle was a trick that MAY be helped to rise over the rest ... but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> I thought gangster methods would be brutal, but at the same time fun and exciting; sort of like a vigilante movie or something ... maybe they would even shoot some movie elements. After all, we are talking about criminals. Instead, we are given some of the most reluctant protagonists dedicated to celluloid. Detectives ask witnesses. What does a mob do? They listen and kill them. It's not even as these witnesses are so bad. I actually found criminals less pleasant than the killer they hunt. <br /> <br /> If the good points you mentioned are not enough to reach your interests, I would say I will give one. Maybe for a few days, they use the same story idea again and do it right. I hope. I hate to waste such a good concept.
