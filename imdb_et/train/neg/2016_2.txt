***** Warning: May contain SPOILERS ********* My big problem with this movie is how completely a self-centered and self-consuming adulterous woman is! After she was one night with slippery psycho, she was being pursued by her. She constantly calls her and threatens her and even sends her night video together. He is disgracefully crazy and very dangerous. The problem is that he thinks he is dangerous to HER (and discloses his secret). He had never thought about his husband for a second! Did he even think for a few moments that he might have this psychotic threat? As soon as he realized how spiritual he was, he should have warned his man, regardless of the consequences. Maybe it wouldn't have been a movie, but there was no difference whatsoever.
