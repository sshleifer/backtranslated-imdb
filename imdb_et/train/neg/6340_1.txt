This is the movie I fear the most. Arrogant and irresponsible, it is a colonial conflict sketch that is so confusing and stupid that represents an insult to all Colombian people. The performances are godawu, Grisales (her naked scene is totally pathetic), Bejarano, Fanny Mickey (who looks directly at Tim Burton's nightmare), Díaz, who is making considerable efforts to bring a character to life. -The dimmed, so cliché and so badly written that he's left to work, is a mustache. Not to mention free endlessness, a gore fest, so cheerful that it would make Ed Wood shine. It fails in any way, cinematography, artistic direction, costumes, makeup, editing and above all guiding, Jorge Alí Triana has always been a sad filmmaker, but at least in his earlier films had some dignity. I cannot say anything good about the waste of this money, except that I hope that Colombian filmmakers will learn from this average fiasco of honesty, honesty and responsibility.
