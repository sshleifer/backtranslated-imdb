My friends can usually collect a lot of hopeless movies, but it was too poor for us to even look at it. It was just so boring and unfair. Not even the "hot" girls who played in this movie couldn't look at me. Everything was just predictable and tedious. The actor was sometimes good ..... but several times bad. The most annoying feature of the film, which you just want to die, should be the best friend of the main characters. The more I saw him, the more I wanted to break my screen. (You know what a fatty boy is talking about) <br /> <br /> Plot has been made so many times before I think other filmmakers should sue them. OK, it's a good idea, but all this movie was. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie can only be viewed by you to record abuse of your friends. Or if you have something better to do.
