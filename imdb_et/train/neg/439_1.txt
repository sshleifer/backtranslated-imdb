Just amazing is the endlessly better "Murder, She Wrote", it's absolutely amazing that this poorly written garbage lasted for eight years. I'm sure most of the people who looked at this endless crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do or just remembered their stars from the old Dick Van Dyke Show. Van Dyke, who only had a decent career in the 1960s, was never an actor (at his own permission) and was already too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993. because of chain smoking and strong drinking. His talented real life son, Barry, a wooden actor who has rarely had anything to do with his father, plays his son in the series.
