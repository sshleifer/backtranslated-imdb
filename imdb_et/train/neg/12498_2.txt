This movie has a really good story. The Coast Guard's work for men and women, especially in the North Pacific, is the stuff of heroes and legends. This movie creates a good story with three ends (no one responds), a couple of unnecessary and pointless bar struggles and two alleged "romantic" relationships that have as many sparks as a dead campfire. The rescue scenes are great - even if the computer generation is hockey and the scenarios are quite unrealistic - but the background is flat and disappointing. Costner is good - especially his hand (see it). Ashton Kutcher is flat, but not terrible. The main female characters are one-dimensional. The best female is one of the Coast Guard sailors in the rescue center and she is about two minutes in the camera on the film. It could have been a great movie - and Costner needs it!
