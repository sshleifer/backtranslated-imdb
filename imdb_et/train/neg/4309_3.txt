Keenan Wynn, who has lost his basketball team, hires an inexperienced trainer not only to become a wonderful blonde (Cathy Lee Crosby), but also as a catalyst for their new winners. Are you really surprised? Along the way between the coach and the team star Jack (Michael Biehn) romance. The police will never be informed. <br /> <br /> Packed with other Crown International Pictures, like a flooring house movie, this movie doesn't really offer a service. This can easily be transformed into a weekly television movie. Cathy Lee Crosby looks good as coach Randy Rawlings, especially with her dirty equipment, but I was expecting more than just titrating from an R-rated movie. The sidekick, which is attended by the dorky center, which his teammates have hypnotized to think he is a former NBA player Sydney Wicks, is the real reason for the new team success, not Cathy Lee's guidance. Too much teaser and not enough to be a big disappointment.
