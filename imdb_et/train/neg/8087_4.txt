The film lacks helicopters that didn't exist until the 1950s. But no woman did what she did here, even a woman before the 60s and 70s. The only part of the film you could believe was that Germany would like to know where the landing is going. For a moment, ignore the fact that the British have seized all spies, but even if they weren't there, they would not let it move around to convince the Germans that the landing will take place in Calais. This is not one of the main things that makes a movie not working. This is the culmination of all things that make the film a failure. Bad leadership, bad scripts, an authenticity test (at all) just blend in with the movie. In general, spies should disappear for woodwork. The break should be with spy to think about whether their information is valid or not, and to worry about its discovery. The game was over since the beginning. This spy did nothing but spying. Your only way to get something that has some credibility and that creates some tension can be reading a book.
