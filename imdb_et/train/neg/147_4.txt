"Valentine" is another horror movie that can be added to the list of stem and slashes (think of "Halloween", "Friday 13", "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer"). Certainly it is not as good as the movies I have listed, but it's better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first "Friday 13". movie. One of these films was Canada's "My Bloody Valentine" 1981, which I hated a lot. "Valentine" is a better movie than this, but it doesn't talk much. Plot: A couple of his classmates are bullied by a young boy at the beginning of the movie. Then the film moves years later, when these classmates have grown up, they are chosen one by one. It is assumed that the killer is a young boy who has all been looking for revenge. But is it her? Or could it be someone else? "Valentine" is an attractive cast that includes Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshawi and Katherine Heigli. They do what they can with their material, but a weak script does not give them any justice. However, there are some frightening moments. <br /> <br /> ** (Four)
