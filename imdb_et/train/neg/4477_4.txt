What is empty and lacks the classic romance. I want people to end up with the classic if they do not have a clear understanding of the original intent or point of the original. This version is no different. I felt that Ralphi's Fiennes version was much worse than Juliette brioche's casting on Kathy's worst decision-making EVER ... anyway back to that version. Its purpose is to make the story modern and musical. It succeeds in both, but with high art it is called. It's possible to watch the rainy day ... The direction was average and editing abysmal. Worse than the old Quincy. Deepak Verma makes a great turn as Hindley and is actually one of Britains talents. Heath's role was played with great charm and faith and I think it is the strongest point of this project. While a more talented director would have made better use of his opportunities. It is clear that he was the director of the lease and did not instigate the project with the passion he served.
