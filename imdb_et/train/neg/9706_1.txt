... and I gave her ZERO on my personal 1-10 scale. I've been to the movies since 1952 and have seen a lot more than 1000 people in the theater (I don't appreciate the movies I only see on television). This is the only movie I've ever appreciated ZERO. <br /> <br /> My wife and I took our four children (then ages 15, 11, 8 and 6) and even the kids thought it was terrible. In fact, it was my daughter (now 26) who warned me on this site (surprised that the movie got a general rating of 4+). <br /> <br /> The Dinosaur animation looked at the time as an amateur (and again worse) for the actor (especially Sean Young) to be scared and stupid. <br /> <br />
