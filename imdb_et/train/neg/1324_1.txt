"Suzanne's Second Coming" is another of these surreal films that try to meet as extremely complex, but everything she does makes the viewer fall asleep. Like other films of this type, dialogue is limited. Everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetics of the picture. Nonetheless, cinematography smells so that your attention is not lost. <br /> <br /> The video box states that this movie is "one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen on film." Yes of course. That's right there, looking at stimulating events such as an ice-melt bucket or a turtle walking for miles. 1/10
