I read some comments about the movie about the internet, such as "... heavier than Hostel ...", "the camera never shows up when it's really brutal ...". But none of them is true. The camera will never be displayed because there is nothing about it. The same scene is repeated a hundred and a hundred times. Women are on the table, the killer rapes women a few times, the killer cuts the women into pieces (you can't see it all over the movie!). The police arrive and arrested him. Killer fools the jury. Movie over. In Germany, we would say, "Viel LÃ¤rm um Nichts". All in all, one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Definitely not recommended.
