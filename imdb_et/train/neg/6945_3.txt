Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) has been killed by his child and his husband maliciously attacked an intrusion at home. Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) is trying to help him through traumatic stress. Then Archer, who faces a man (Til Schweiger) who is tied and worshiped, finds finds. He has said that this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and he can do whatever he likes. And there is a wide variety of tools to help him ... <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting first (and shows true restraint in blood and gorees) but gets stupider in a minute and is very unlikely to twist the plot. It all ends with a final twist that was so old and stupid that I was shocked to think about using it. How are talented actors like Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer in this mix? It gives the actress three stars, but the stupid bite and the truly incredible twists make this harvest to sit.
