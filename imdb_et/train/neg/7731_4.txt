The comparison is perhaps unfair, but inevitable. With the intimacy and depth of umbrellas, they are tremendously attracted to find American-style cut and pasted music - an inconvenient and intelligent dialogue with unexplained song and dance numbers. The French accent of Gene Kelly was probably so poor that the terrible duplication work was replaced (as you remember, it was almost completely copied in the umbrellas). Translating French (subtitled versions) leaves something unwanted, although it cannot be associated with Demy. The film also has a number of self-conscious moments that come out of nervous confusion, such as song references to LeGrand. And costumes - well, a combination of tight pants / white boots and freakish unnatural colors, resembles one Austin Powers movie. . <br /> <br /> But Demy pays hints to the viewers; Take note, for example, of a suitcase left by Rochefort from Maxence - the same suitcase that Guy is wearing when leaving Cherbourg. Also note "Comfortable brunette resolution" - Madeleine in sunshades and Josette for young girls. <br /> <br /> In general, those who are waiting for a natural feeling of sunshine (to record a floating bicycle scene) or look for similar deeper questions and ambiguous ends like the Umbrella script should probably pass through it. Those who are looking for a French version of thin 60s American music are quite happy.
