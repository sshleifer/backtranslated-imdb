Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good game that depicts a great variety of siblings, but only Winningham can do something convincing or important to its role. Leigh, who plays bar-band singer and Sadie Flood, constantly relies on the older Georgian, the acclaimed folk singer Joni Mitchell. Perhaps due to his double responsibilities as co-producer of the film, Leigh seems to be in the corner: he is not credible as a singer, and even if he is deliberate, he gives himself too much on the screen during a microphone. Probably hoping that the racing force, Leigh, is wired and nervous and skinned; but we just don't see any talent in this talent (Leigh is obviously an actor, but he makes the decisions that bind us down). If Sadie had even the slightest charisma or appeal, we might think that she would get the (small) breaks she was doing. As it is, the probability that his stage is growing is thin. Director Ulu Grosbard discusses some intense dramatic sequences, and finale editing is equal to Sadie's bar performance in Georgia's arena exhibition - both sing the same song - and unfortunately this is a nuanced moment ... but actually, what's the point? * 1/2 from ****
