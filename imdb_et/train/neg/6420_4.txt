OK I admit that it started very pleasant and good, but then it just fell down, I can't believe Sarah Michelle Gellar could even have read the script in about 5 minutes, the only reason I actually go through the whole movie is I wanted to see a twist, and to my surprise, people, I can't even tell you if there was one, because eventually you finally get confused and then the role of credit, I was like hell? it didn't deserve a theatrical run, I'm sorry, but that doesn't mean it was terrible, the only reaso I gave it 4 is that he had some jumping parts ... that's it! you can watch it, im not telling you, hey, you even like it or even love it! but if you hate it, don't say I didn't warn you!
