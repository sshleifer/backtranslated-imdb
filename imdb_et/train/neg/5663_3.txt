This is the case with Zatoich films because "Star Trek" movies were "Star Trek" - except that in this case, each original was entertaining and more interesting than it was big, shiny redo and also better made if the substance is more important than the surface. If I had never seen them, I would be beautiful but empty; since I had, I thought its style was not suitable and its content was inadequate. The idea of ​​reviving the character in bigger, poorer production must be good, but it did not make any sense after the hope of money; it is just an exhibition that mostly fails to occupy the character in the world atmosphere and cannot take the stars where it has not already been (the actor was not his best). I was hoping to see Ich later in life, a story that gently looked at her and summarized her experiences in general; it repeats the bits and pieces of other movies experienced by more sex and sfx violence. Not the same experience at all.
