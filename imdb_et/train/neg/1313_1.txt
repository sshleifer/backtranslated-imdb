Don't worry about watching this terrible mini-series. It is a six-hour, incredible love triangle between three people who have no chemistry for each other. There is no warmth, no real passion, no real romance in this story. It is dry, boring, pulled and undetected as they come. And it doesn't even match the expected level of technical skill. Take these six hours of your life and use them for something more valuable.
