I just want to say that this production is very one-sided, stops the necessary impartiality if you want to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> There are no credits available for the interviewees, so you have no idea whether they are worth hearing. <br /> <br /> The story is only from one perspective. This is very dangerous because the next generations are learning bad ideas and this is the reason why wars come. I know it's not the only reason for the war, but it doesn't help. <br /> <br /> You can watch this documentary, but read on the internet much earlier. Balans are complicated because human history is.
