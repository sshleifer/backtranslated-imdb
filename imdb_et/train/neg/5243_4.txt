Make your mind. Personally, I found it so much fun when I got the backbone from Stevie Wonder. Not offended by Mr. Wonder. Maybe it's comedy, but I just found it stupid. Not exactly the first two choices to make your children take care of; Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), two energy beverage vendors to avoid imprisonment, are judged to be in charge of two children from a development center led by Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch). One of the confusions is Ronnie (Bobbe J. Thompson), the fifth attacker, the second is Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a terrible young man who plays fantasy in the medieval world. Wheeler and Danny are desperately trying to give their accusations an invaluable insight into life, love and heavy metal. Lynch has fun with its smart smart analogues.
