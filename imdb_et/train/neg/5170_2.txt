Wow, could have been such a good movie, starts with Brittany Daniels is tied up, Im thinking we want to get back to flash, but something, the movie starts again with filming. This film would probably have been better if it didn't work. I mean, it was mostly horrible. Although the poor actors had to deal with the lines, I think they did the best they could ... Let it really be a violation of the movie for me. some acting skills .. The movie is drawn for a long time by the anticipated shocking conclusion. Did some reviewers say there is gore and stuff. Did I see the same movie .. Well that's eight out of eight and so far only one has been good.
