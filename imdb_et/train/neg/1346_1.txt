Dear friends and family, <br /> <br /> I think that if one teen wants to become a second teenage biblical, it is their eternal destruction - I just remember children, "birth control" doesn't mean "oral sex", I don't care about it what the student of honor says. On the other hand, even with the help of a senator, quoting himself as a "little romantic man", he still only hits a high school girl. If he were my sister, I'd eat the boys on my knees. <br /> <br /> In addition, I learned that Mongolians do not kiss the same way as the French, and that baseball players named the zoo as delicate underwear. I think I'll almost look at Richie Rich once as I suffer the resentment of this slip. Thank you and good night.
