After an awesome AANKHEN (2002), which was a remake of Gujarat's game, he joined WAQT, which also looks like a stage game. <br /> <br /> While playing the show, we have characters that call out, moving too much here. In the first half, Amitabh shows almost 40-year-old Akshay Kumar jokes that are too funny to do like a little nerd <br /> <br /> The film has a good message not to spoil your son, but unfortunately, Amitabh wants Akki to be completely fake . <br /> <br /> Even his reason for obscuring the illness, getting to his hospital, and the Akk's melodramatic speech is delayed <br /> <br /> Some emotions don't touch you, but most are too up. <br /> <br /> Rajpal's comedy is fun, but stretched over the other side of the <br /> <br /> Vipul Shah direction is too redundant, although some scenes are good Music is good Okay <br /> <br /> Amitabh amongst the actors in the first half, but it is great in emotional scenes Akshay Kumar is doing well, but it looks too uncomfortable. The holy scenes of His chemistry with Bachchan are unparalleled Rajpal is highlighting, he makes you laugh without exaggeration and just his presence and his stupid behavior and deadly humor, what he's rebellious Boman is good at some cartoon, but too loud places in Priyanka's heroine so nothing to do , this is his last movie with Aki until Shefali is fantastic, although he sees Bachchani too young
