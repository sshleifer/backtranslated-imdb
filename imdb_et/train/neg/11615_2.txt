Although not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised when I saw his name in the credits when opening "Joshua". Heck, I didn't know he was in "Joshua" until the movie started. So it goes without saying that I was watching a movie, not a movie based on the leaders. Certain "Rosemary's Baby," "Omen," or some other demonic boyfriend, "Joshua," was presented. Unfortunately, it gradually fell. Slow, incredibly slow and flat. However, I continued to see how it would all resolve, hoping for a belief that the final line would be light on the subject. Okay, I admit it was (joking), but what is the hidden closure. And what is a low-low budget movie, or at least how they shaped it. Person falls? you don't see the fall, you see someone who is lying in the blood. Person hits the cab? You can't see it, you see someone who complains, holding a bike. I'm not sure if it's called style or laziness or just to finance special effects. We have a "rich" family with a crazy mother, a working father, trying to balance everything, baby? Joshua, who may / may not be an antichrist and a new born girl who cries a lot. He cries as much as we see, how many days is he alive? and what was it? Are the rats above or Joshua? Is his mother's nuts? Is Joshua Crazy? Is he just jealous of a newcomer to the family? Does he grow into Michael Myers? Or does he lead his family to the brink? I do not belive. They were previously nuts and none so called. The so-called action could not believe me otherwise. Unfortunately, barely asked questions, barely open doors. I'm sure it might have been an idea, but for Pete, give me something. Something. There are many better boy-wild films to explore. Joshua is more like an antichrist Mini-Me.
