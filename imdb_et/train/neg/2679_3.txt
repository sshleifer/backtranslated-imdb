(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian fantasy "actioner" (and I use the term loosely) I've been trying to watch for over a year. Finally, I have come to an end and now I wish I did not make repeated efforts. <br /> <br /> In an effort to save two hours of your life, I tell you, a man who has the ability to design a long blade from his hand back home to see his mother. Things become ugly after beating the old girlfriend's mafia boyfriend. He takes the man's revenge when he brings the girl home. Men Mafia's mother sends her men to revenge when the police start looking for her. <br /> <br /> Very little is said. no explanation has actually been given (for example why they lock a girlfriend in the shelter) and activities, most of which are off. The film consists mainly of a man who looks like Adrian Brody, who is looking for an intense and does not say anything, killing people (most of the actions are turned off on the screen). It looks good, has worked well and would have had some reason why it worked, it could have been a good movie. Hell, I would have wanted some real character or a back story (we all know the boy was a boy). The movie runs for two hours and it seems to be his month. If they were not going to tell us anything, they would have been able to at least speed up, so it seemed to be moving too fast. Instead, we get the hero on the boat. Hero on the bus, hero walk, hero looking for disruption. It is very annoying to me, because I think it could have been a good movie if they had just done something or if someone would make sense, except giving instructions to get this man. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 It's about four hours (all my attempts to see it) I never get back. Only for those who want to see very little Russian activity
