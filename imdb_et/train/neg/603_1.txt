Absolutely ridiculous movie. I live in London and the plot is so poorly researched that it is ridiculous. You can't terrorize anyone on the London Underground. For a short period of time, there are no crews of maintenance staff that check the tracks and carry out repairs, etc. every night. Or is it even possible that this day and age can be locked and accessed to a mobile phone ... <br /> <br /> The worst thing that will probably happen if someone found themselves after the last train. that they can spray graffiti on them. Though it has come under control because there are many security cameras on the network, it's another bitter side. (Remember, in London as a whole, we have more security cameras than any other city in the world.) <br /> <br /> If it was placed in a city, I don't feel like I could have enjoyed it, but it doesn't not a quality movie, so I couldn't stop myself from my belief and try and enjoy this banal little story of what it is. <br /> <br /> I would have given him 0/10 if such a rating exists! Maybe the most disappointing film I ever thought.
