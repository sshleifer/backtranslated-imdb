Here is another blasphemous European story in which they break the religion of their country. (These atheist filmmakers are relentless.) Here we see the brutal blasting of Catholics and / or Catholic clergy (and I'm not Catholic). <br /> <br /> It actually won the Academy Award for foreign film. This is probably because the story was made by Catholics and religious beliefs are generally very weak. One of the main characters is the priest and he cares more about food than anything else. He is nothing but an idiot. No wonder the secular-dominant Academy loved this movie. <br /> <br /> There is also a somewhat amazing fool playing a man who gives up his religion so he can marry one of the four daughters who have the story. The daughters take an alternating "seminar" student (who claims to have studied for six years but says he is agnostic!). I mean, how is blasphemy this movie? !!! <br /> <br /> This is a shameful and another great example of the secular progressive bigotry of the film industry around the world (not just in Hollywood).
