This movie is still the worst movie. If you need to create a film that carries this guy who plays Lars on heavy vehicles, if he doesn't make a fucking movie. I have to say that I can watch Leprechaun in space 6 times before I can watch the movie on this POS trailer. Adam sandler should be limited to any movie after that shame. Watching this movie is like listening to Cher and putting your tongue in the mixer. Anyone with half a brain cell realizes that this movie is not worth the dime. If I had an extra dollar and would have had to spend it, I'd give it to Lorraina Bobbitt's fund before buying the movie.
