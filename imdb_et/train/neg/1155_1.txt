I've never been prompted to write my review, but it was just dirty. I was trying to find what was about the movie that made snoops its first serious role, but frankly it was a bad choice. did a good book, but it didn't work for me as a movie. I found this as an incredible lack of atmosphere and I found many scenes that were terribly inclined. A musical maestro that he can be, but a serious actor. by Dylan mcdermott and rose byrne were satisfactory but not enough to wear a weak plot with a weak dialogue. Maybe I have just filled this point, but it didn't fit into any genre, it did not create characters empathy or tension, because I finally found myself praying and a deep desire to hit all three main characters!
