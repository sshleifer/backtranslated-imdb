It was probably the worst film I've ever seen. I looked at it with a large circle of friends and after no one of us understood the plot. Apart from the absence of the plot, it was frightening, the "special effects" were not so special and the writing was absolutely terrible. The only redemption factor in the movie is that it is so incredibly bad that it is pretty funny. You can't help but laugh at the zombie when the actors have tried the dirty dialogue. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good movie, but it is something that a group of friends can get together and laugh at. Now my friends and I have a running joke.
