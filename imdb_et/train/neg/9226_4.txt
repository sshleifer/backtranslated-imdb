Okay, the film festival's crowd probably loved it. But your average, popcorn munching movie mover, who has scrapped ten or fifteen bucks he pays to see the movie these days, may not know why he made that choice. If it's "Copolla" stamped, it's a very good thing, right? Wrong! This is a nice movie film claim. But it's terrible. I worry if filmmakers worry about entertainment rather than the public. It's interesting as cinema and it has a couple or two in it. But when it has been in films and on television, the thickness of dust in film and tape boxes keeps growing. Hardly either epochal or epic!
