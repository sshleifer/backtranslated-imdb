Annie wig doesn't look good. She's not cute and pretty enough to play Annie. Annie sticks in the movie because her outfit looks like Halloween costumes. terrible actions and terrible plots. This movie is such a change from the 1982 version. I think a younger and smaller girl should have played a leading role. Ashley Johnson depicts a very young Annie. Not at all attractive. At least the election organizer got it right with Daddy Warbucks. Mrs Hannigan was also unsuccessful. Camilla Belle played Molly right. "Warning" This movie can offend your IQ so you can only show it to very small children. 8 and younger. Some of the plots are too fancy and hardly in the real world.
