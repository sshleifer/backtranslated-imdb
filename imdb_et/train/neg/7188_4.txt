When I got a look at the headline, I thought we could get another trial hip joint, but I actually found the "7-year-old 5ive" to be slightly satisfactory, and almost back in the 80s after it was slowly slow in the middle the last half hour of momentum, leading to its extremely sticky climax and the end of the immediate police. It doesn't win prizes for originality because it is as systematic as you can and steals your thunder's excitement (normal cheap jump scary), location (separated mansion) and motivation of other movies. The dazzling direction is through the book and the material is quite hackney with poorly realized red herring in its complicated drawing and thin script. Sometimes ridiculous, but still for entertainment, mainly because of my brutal and harsh violent violence against some rather annoyingly irritating college students whose psychotic murderer is the ax of battle. The performances were not bad for the young men, but they were not very attractive. Rutger Hauer is always present as a short supporting role as a grizzled detective. Slickly made but low and forgotten supplement times.
