First of all, I want to say that I am a Christian (and that I work in the film and television industry), so I understand what it is like to work on a feature film that is the requisite for filmmakers in this regard. I am all for positive, exhilarating messages when they are true to the nature of life (that it is a fallen world and that things do not always work ... even for Christ followers). I am glad that others have such overwhelmingly positive reactions to a public Christian message; For me, it was just that the movie was where the movie fell. The story lives and dies in the film, and here you have one-dimensional stereotypes, abundance of exposition and spontaneous changes in character behavior, which is the least inexplicable. I believe that the movie does not have to travel over your head to get the whole point. I'm sure Kendrick is. improves over time and also their narrative methods. Maybe they could target someone else's scenario for the next project. <br /> <br /> * Sports movies are not exactly my first love, but good (Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, etc.) can inspire you in many ways. If you are interested in a PG-rated film that inspires, give Steven Soderbergh a "Hill of King". The whole truth is God's truth ...
