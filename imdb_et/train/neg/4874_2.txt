It wasn't too bad for the animals or Eddie Murphy to say anything. this movie is just sharp. <br /> <br /> Children's Film? Well, if you're trying to sleep, maybe. It is only 90 minutes of a somewhat strikingly poor animation of animal lip, which is not funny. And the lips synchronization makes the old Godzilla films perfectly matched when compared. Meanwhile, Eddie's "Pluto Nash" Murphy is calling a depressed underrated delivery that is painful to experience. Obviously, he is trying to change his old manic personality, but what? In short, all of the 1967 original version of magic and miracle in this transformation or whatever it disappears. The city wants to tempt some forest creatures and blame them for bad things. Not really. And Pluto Nash can psycho-babble with them. Things in the chain with some hidden jokes to bring a unique conclusion without surprises. <br /> <br /> Rent a '67 movie. Or some old Yogi Bear cartoons.
