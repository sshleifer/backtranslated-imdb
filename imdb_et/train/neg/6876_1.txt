Yes, it was a pure incredible despising slip. We know that the French idea of ​​the US is often pure, that is puritanism and gender views. The American (Hoosier), who lives in France, has ample opportunity to follow these attitudes. And while some of these preconceived concepts may be true, no element in the city center depicted in this film is real. A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years before his penis is too big? Where would you find this world? Juke-box in a bar that only plays vintage bluegrass? Maybe 16 people in less than two hours away from Chicago, but without major petrol stations, without a TV set at home, no McDonalds, no children ... The population who knows each other's intimate details but unintentionally meets one big family who hate each other . Adult males sit in the local cafe with cushions, have farms on their farms, but don't pick up, kill the guys they don't like for everyone, and they seem to leave and all have equal emotions? A freed French girl, who screws a 17-year-old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity, is too much of a meat guy going out of the ground just by using the illusion of Illinois to help break the same 17-year-old peasant? HELP! I'm so embarrassed and surprised by the absurdity of the film, which I don't express clearly as ridiculous. See this for the A-Z primer to avoid. I hope I didn't break it for you!
