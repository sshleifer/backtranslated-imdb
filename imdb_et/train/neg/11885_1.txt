I give up the usual comparisons with a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic New Yorker personality because, frankly, to compare comparisons with ghostly loser Josh Kornbluth, it is just one such director. I do not want to mention the "Space Space" satire in the same breath as this celluloid disaster. However, can I compare it to waking up during my surgery? It is painful to look and you don't know if surgeons know what they are doing. The Haiku Tunnel is the movie you want them to pull in at their production stages. It was cruel to let him live and as a result the audience around the world suffers. <br /> <br /> Movie Prerequisite? if it really does? not even worth discussing, but for the sake of caution. Josh Kornbluth, a heavy duty phobia worker, is offered a permanent job. His main task is to send his boss 17 priority letters. But, ridiculously, he cannot perform this simple task. My reaction? Great thing! Isn't that a story? this is the best thought thought - what should have passed any self-respecting filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Leading actor? if you can call it? is a cumbersome slim man with a fleshy feature, a receding, undressed hairline, and a series of facial expressions ranging from brightness to normal distraction. Where's where the director found that score? What do you say ???? is he the director? My mistake. One thing is to play the embarrassment of your own scenario, but I suspect that Mr Kornbluth is not as convincing as the human being, not to mention the actor. You can be sure that this is by no means a purposeful assassination, but never before has I been on the actor screen! My disappointment was further aggravated by the monologues of his cameras between scenes. I mean, if the viewer needs to understand the dream to understand this stranger, Kornbluth insults us, "explaining" the action (the first film rule: "dramatize exposition"? Show, doesn't say). Who does this man think he is? She has no charisma, charm and decision making on her Hawaiian shirts, sense of style. His casting tool should be left empty! <br /> <br /> Supporting parties do nothing to alleviate the intense boredom I felt with just one exception. Patricia Scanlon looks like a very funny look like former secretary Helen, who has been crazy about the old elder boss, making phone calls from his cellar while holding the flashlight under his face. It made me fool, but soon the moment I checked my watch for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie's title is also a misconception. The Haiku tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of Japanese poetry. Do not be fooled into thinking that this is a film of an art house, because it is your pretentiously sounding title or the fact that it played only a handful of cinemas and did not make money at the cashier ?????? this is a very good reason. <br /> <br />
