I watched this movie and the original Carlitos way back. The difference between the two is nasty. Now I know people say that prequel was made with a small budget, but it was never associated with a bad script. Now, maybe it's just me, but I always thought that prequel was made to create another movie, marking key marks and maybe filling a little life we ​​didn't know. Rise to Power is just a movie with Carlito's name. The original film should have had at least some signs, the end is not meaningful to the original. At the end of this movie, he retires with his sweet heart, but how do we kick him out of the next movie out of prison? And her wife is not even the same woman who speaks of her only love in the original. I would say that this film is somewhat entertaining in itself, with some decent bits, but it is very big when it is his big brother. Don't forget the night maybe to see it, look at the original once more if you really need to hit.
