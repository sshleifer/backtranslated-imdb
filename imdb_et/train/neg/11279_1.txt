The words can't really describe how bad this film is. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least it had some nice shots and occasionally a good chin that prevented you from staying here and there. It's just ridiculous! Terrible script, bad direction, terrible action and what do you know? I can't think of one thing to suggest about it except that it's not too long. If you want entertainment at a value of 100 minutes, book yourself with a dentist and do the root canal work - much more enjoyable and much better for the money (assuming you need it!). By the way, I have to enter 10 lines of text to complete this review - DO NOT BUY THIS MOVI. It's sharp!
