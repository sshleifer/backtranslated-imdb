I'm just entertaining. I liked "Hot Shots" and "The Naked Gun" and their many aftermaths, even though most people thought they were intolerable. I've even managed to enjoy most of Pauly Shore's movies. There's only one movie I've seen that I can honestly say it was bad ... and that was it. It's been a while since I've seen it, but I remember sitting in the theater thinking, "It's a stupid movie. Why did I see it?" This is honestly the only movie I can't recommend.
