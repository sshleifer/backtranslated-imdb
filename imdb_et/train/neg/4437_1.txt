The triumph of love does not win anything. It is embarrassing, embarrassing, 4 hours of torture. In fact, it is a little less than 2 hours long, it just seemed longer. I have the pain to even think of the amateur performances of fine actors such as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. Supporting players aren't quite as terrible. Maybe they were trying to be so clowned, but if so, I didn't see it that way. Mira Sorvino makes no impression in any way. He's right there. I think the game with the same name, written by Marivaux about 270 years ago, is much better. It can't be worse. The writer and director of this film, Clare Peploe, was inspired by a recent production. I don't know what he meant when creating this bomb. <br /> <br /> Maybe it all lost in translation.
