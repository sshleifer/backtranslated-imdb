I couldn't follow, understand or understand the story of my life. As the plot progresses, it will also be incomprehensible. I think and say that there was a manufacturing story / plot problem that never came out. Manufacturers were never able to separate the many details that the novel or novel has time and space to create from another idea, which was to make the film sequence killer and police kill. They had too many things that happened during banned movies. Too bad because they had a definite light, a director who knows how to move things and great cinematography. In fact, there is a well-made film that you can enjoy and relax for a few hours.
