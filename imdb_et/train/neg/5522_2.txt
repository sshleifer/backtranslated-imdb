I've been looking for the right words to describe this movie. First of all, I was inclined to just go to the more important issues, because the film doesn't rise to the level that deserves comment. <br /> <br /> But I stopped wondering how to describe these things and the somewhat interesting challenge posed by the question: "What can you say about such a movie?" Garbage? No, its not garbage, garbage can recycle something useful. Greenhouse gas? No, its not a greenhouse gas, greenhouse gases help plants grow large and healthy. <br /> <br /> Finally, I hit "Not even bad" around the wording "Not even wrong", sometimes used in theoretical physics. describe a theory that is hopelessly flawed and even worthy of correction. This is then, Georgia Rule: Not even bad.
