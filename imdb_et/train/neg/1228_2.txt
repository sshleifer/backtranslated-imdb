Wow. Rarely have I felt the need to comment on movies lately, but this is especially begging. Let's start from the beginning. First, writer-director Susan Montford puts Kim Basinger's tired old role as a victim, with the necessary abusive spouse and the existence of an eternal suburb. Now let's say that almost all of this boring film is completely attacked and tritiated. Montford's pathetic attempt to symbolize a Christmas tree without stars is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> When he goes out for a dark paper and an ominous night for a piece of Christmas paper, Della is furious that someone in his double park is the most active shop in his car's year. He decides to do something so he leaves the car windshield nasty. Within the next fifteen minutes of the film, Dell is deliberately moving around in the mall. When he finally arrives in his car, the thugs are alert to him, the policeman is killed and he runs, and they come to him, and he goes away and they are pursuing him further and further and further. Everything is completely predictable and engaging. The pliers are not at all intimidating or threatening, and they all get off one by one in the usual way. stupid as you can imagine. Why didn't the bad guys kill him instead of waiting for him to hit the wheelbarrow. And once, just as soon as in such a movie, does the pack leader have to die? What is important is that they are all selected one by one when they are all equally wrong? Much of the film consists of just Lukas Haas, who runs around in the woods, shouting "Della !!!" And adding the Joy Division to the sound of this wretched movie is offensive. <br /> <br /> The part that made me use the keyboard for my computer was when Della was exhausted and painful, crying to heaven, "Where are you, God?" ? I'll give it 2 only because of the cinematic and lighting skills that are right, and it's not as bad as the "BTK Killer", which is the ultimate marker for evaluating all terrible movies. Cheers!
