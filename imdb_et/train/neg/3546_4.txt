Further spoilers - proceed with caution. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this film is that, when Harry learns the identity of three blackmailers relatively easily, he will continue to wreak havoc with his demands. And then the whole scene where his wife is abducted decides to drive his classic car to explode (with the money that comes with it), which makes us quite a logic leap. <br /> <br /> Okay, so he wanted to keep his attitude in the eyes of Cin's public because he was part of the DA campaign. I see this, but why not hire someone who knocks them around a little, or even kill them when he decided that there was no real blackmail (like Cin's body?) It was a pretty interesting movie for the first 2/3 of that. After that it breaks down.
