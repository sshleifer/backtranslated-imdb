Wow ... what would you do for $ 33m? Let me give you a choice; you can either a) break and wash your toilet or b) make a movie based on Whoopi Goldberg's assumption that it is a hard nut futuristic cop partner with a rubber dinosaur who uses terms like "I didn't beat a trumpet" and blowing raspberries on it based on the fact that it is funny. That's right, you choose the option that has more decorations - rinsing the toilet. <br /> <br /> This must be seen as believing. I can't even find words to describe how bad this film is. It doesn't even fit in the "so bad - it's good" category. I have it on TV when I write - and when I look, I felt I needed to come to IMDb and register my nasty. <br /> <br /> Jurassic Park was held a few years ago, how on earth did they think the audience would no longer tolerate a rubber dressed man? The workgroup should simply have consequences for walking and exhausting. Anyone involved is going to hell to waste this criminal money. <br /> <br /> I have to finish writing a letter - I intend to implode.
