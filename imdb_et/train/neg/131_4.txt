So where are the cannibals? Those intrigued by the film's title and the "real cannibal" complaint are let down. Instead, we have been shown a strange man and his visit to Papua New Guinea, where there are natives, one of whom was his lover several decades earlier. The man, Tobias Schneebaum, is a New York Jew as they come and somehow, it is intertwined with a documentary as he appears in his yamika scenes. <br /> <br /> There are no real cannibals here: only stories by some natives and Tobias himself. Not all with a bad movie. Very interesting and great cinema. Schneebaum is still very pleasant and gives us a fascinating glimpse of life that is as far away from Western civilization as possible. <br /> <br /> It's not just what he claims to be on the cover and a plot summary. <br /> <br /> 4 out of ten, kids.
