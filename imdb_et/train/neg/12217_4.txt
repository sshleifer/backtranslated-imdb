As low-budget indies go, you'll usually find that you get what you pay for, and let me just say that I didn't pay much for "Frightworld" ... <br /> <br /> Writer / director: David R. Williams brings us a story of an abandoned amusement park, limited by the enchanting spirit of the killer of the killed sera. Not a bad assumption, but it is done with a low budget error. The work of the camera is trying to be too divisive to the audience by constantly using shaking fast cuts to cover the fact that they really don't have to show any grace or fear. This is immediately apparent from the bat, as we introduce a potential killer, and soon we realize that (acting) is the most frightening thing that is happening ... After a painfully long line of headlines we bring back to modern times. acting remains the same. "Frightworld" creates some rather unique cinematographs when the landscapes are shown in the amusement house, but with a very long period of time this movie can't be shot down from the average indie. <br /> <br /> There are some mediocre nudges, but not much for gore, which is usually the sustainable arm of this type of film. <br /> <br /> Fans of really bad B movies can find something interesting here, otherwise spend a lot of money.
