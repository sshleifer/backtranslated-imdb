It must be one of the worst films. Even for the biker movie, it's the bottom. The small plot also includes a small town (how the original!) Overtook the bikers and the attempts of the townspeople to prevent them. Why don't they need external help? Who knows? Fighting scenes are probably fake. Adam West and Tina Louise are in this, but both have little to do and both are ashamed to be there (understandably) This movie is in the trash!
