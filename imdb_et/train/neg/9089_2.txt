The film has only one mistake, unfortunately, this error damages its entire credibility. <br /> <br /> It begins with condemning the occupation of Israeli disputed territories. It does not solve the cause of the Israelis. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel. That's why Israel "captures" its land because these countries lost the war when they began. <br /> <br /> The film also claims that Israel has violated the UN when it did not comply with Resolution 242. The problem is, 242 was immediately rejected after its beginning ...... by the Palestinians, making it void. <br /> <br /> Many movies are well assembled and can really show images that change thoughts, but remember when you look at something, believe that none of what you hear and only half of what you see. <br /> <br /> All participants in this movie are well-known Israeli critics and some have made a number of anti-Semitic public comments that eliminate the potential credibility of these words. <br /> <br /> All participants need a real history lesson taught objectively , not by a Palestinian companion.
