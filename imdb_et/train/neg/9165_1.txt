There is no spoiler in this review because everything was already shown in the trailer of the movie. I'm trying to balance my review because I strongly support local movies, but I can't help but support this movie. It's slow, boring and pointless. Even "almost nice and plausible moments" were immediately under painful clich√©s and bad behavior. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, whom I usually love, were satisfying in this film. It seems the director tried to make a melodramatic TV soap, then he went away and decided to put it on the big screen. Mortgages should be rated RA-rated (valued) but this has not changed my faith in local movies. There are more good movies coming out of such movies.
