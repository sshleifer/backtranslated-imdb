The first thing first. In this genre film, the first thing you need is good music and one where Mr shankar and his party fail. <br /> <br /> Music is totally pale and ineffective. On the other hand, AJAY DEVGAN, who has removed the letter "A" from his spelling, did a good job, but was not useful for such a bad film. <br /> <br /> ASIN is like a doll that is used to entertaining the public, although it is good to watch, but its role in the film is to dance, in fact it is a member of the rock band and I don't think any band has a dancer as a member of the band. <br /> <br /> This movie is a piece of T *** in a nut shell. see if you want to cheat.
