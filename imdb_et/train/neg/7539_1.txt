When to start by describing the general mercy of Neil LaBute's last film making attempt? <br /> <br /> There are many different filmmakers, but the most annoying and inferior is Mr. Intrigue. Do you feel intriguing, isn't it? He's a companion that, no matter how stupid, flat and incomprehensibly boring, he says, "Gee, I don't know why everyone hated, I found it intriguing." He's the kind of boy who thinks dogging is fun. Especially when he assigns this upper lip in the form of Hitler's mustache and runs around a house that speaks of a glimpse of scientific fiction that contains thinly hidden references to Greek mythology. He is also the man that this Wicker Man version was made of. No one else could tolerate it.
