Haunting is another bad horror remake with counterfeit overdone special effects and a large selection of screen favorites and has no redemption features except perhaps for cinematography. Yes, the remakes are not all bad, but the transformations led by Jea Da Bonti are definitely. I think that participants in List A (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson) have come across us from a boring plot, ridiculous special effects and terrible events to intimidate the audience, but this is not a film that does not care about the tabloid who we care about characters and story of two things that this movie didn't answer. The event is like the classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House and the four chapters, and then left for each movie is so boring and much unexplainable. The characters are pretty thin and if the actor is good then you don't care about the characters at all. Lily Taylor gives a terrifying job and sounds like she's 8 years old when they can't talk about what's a terrible screamer. Lily Taylor is not for the horror genre at all. The spirits are foolish and cheesy, they look like Casper's friendly spirit and ghost Hugh Cain looks like a greasy man dressed as a Halloween wet cleaner with a smoke machine. It is a creature on the roof of one room, which is a giant purple mouth, and it is not even casually funny funny. beautiful and well-designed, which is probably the only positive thing about the movie that looks nice, but it doesn't save it brutally from anything else. so I would be pi $ ed ed if I had seen it, but luckily it was on Scream Channel. In general, Haunting is a boring remake of trying to get you into bad special effects, a bad attempt to do horror.
