Bela Lugosi is not in this fantastic twelve-part adventure series in which she plays a leading role as Frank Chandler / Chandu, a wizard who plays his role as a representative of the White Magic forces pushing against Black while showing a strong fighting skill in a young Egyptian princess and fun lover and relaxing facial cutting in sailing equipment with a seacap. A somewhat brash plot grabs Chandler / Chandu in an ongoing series showing her bride, Princess Nadji (Maria Alba) and others in the germ-waving section of Ubasti, carrying Nadji's blood to restore the old mummified princess that has been wrapped up in the mysterious Lemuria Island. Director Ray Taylor, old hands in such entertainment keeps the events fast, but recurring scenes and footage, many of which last year's Skull from Iceland KING KONG and port locale KONG SON, reduce original activity in less than 60 minutes from the current run of more than two and half an hour, and if viewed in one session, most viewers will not reach if it is not an insomniac.
