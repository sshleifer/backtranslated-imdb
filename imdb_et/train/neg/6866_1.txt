This film has as few classes as on a train with strangers, or even at a random meeting, that despite the parallels of the parcel I do not know it correctly when actually comparing either side. Yancy Butler's character happened as much as I was too embarrassed because the writer and director continued to look. <br /> <br /> I don't enjoy many lifetime movies, but I feel obliged to watch it every time. to promote home harmony. I often silence quietly, but this film made me loudly protest, stand up from the room and walk around in the house before I return to my usual favorite chair to torture myself. <br /> <br /> Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY
