"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) collects the group from high school to a meeting room where his twin brother Wes disappeared. When they are there, the reptile's creature waits as a man (reminded me of a lot of Gillman's black LAGOON) by choosing the right time in the desert to separate them one by one. Cyclist, Ellen Ripley-type female devil, Kat (Chase Masterson) has a subterranean military point where she is engaged in experiments while she is also a victim of bleeding. Kat knows more than she talks (she also suffered a child's loss), but there is another twist on the novelty, most of the group don't know. This creature can simply be more human than it understands. And this is a former identity that can lie about fraud, but another person has hidden Wes' death. Kat has the key to many mysteries that open when the group remains near the cab. <br /> <br /> Luckily, much of the movie stays away from the creature that pops in the air when we see the blurry screen as we look at it. The film has Dawson Creek-style melodramatism, which often prevents the real tension that must be built into a small monster. The direction is very sharp, leading to a rather boring experience instead of creating fear. Cast is rather lifelong and uninteresting. Pretty Maggie Grace (THE FOG remake) can be the only drawing of this movie.
