Not sure why this movie was advertised as a natural, peculiar and ridiculous comedy. There is not much entertainment or entertaining in this movie. Annette Bening (whose actress was worthy of the Oscar) comes out of here as masterly, with her frequency. Brian Cox's character is confusing and irritating and lead plays Augusten? Joseph Cross? apparently just does not own a person to carry his role. The best movie is Evan Rachel Wood, but she's not enough to approve this boring, unpleasant movie. <br /> <br /> The movie disappeared quickly and seems reasonable. I found some scenes uncomfortable (ie Brian Cox and rivals with just the used toilets some of the worst scenes "You and me and we all know" and "Squid and whale"), some embarrassing and most annoying. I found that the whole experience is a waste of time. Don't you waste your time?
