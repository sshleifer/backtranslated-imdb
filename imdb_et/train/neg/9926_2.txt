I just looked at the 30th anniversary edition of Blazing Saddles, one of my all-time favorites! A black pilot for the Black Bart collapsed. The plot was non-existent and the action was not good. It was obviously an attempt to make Blazing saddles a success and there have been TV shows that have succeeded in making big movies start, but it would never have worked. Considering that for so many years on television on television for television on television for so many years, it is not conceivable that they thought they could show "N" on TV. On the other hand, I enjoyed seeing many familiar faces !!! There were quite a few actors I admitted from other exhibitions over the years. I had to write all the names and do some searches. It was fun. I argued with my mother when Steve Landesberg was from Barney Miller or Mash. I won! :)
