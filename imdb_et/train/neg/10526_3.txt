This is a girls-reform-school flick that plays somewhat like a prison movie. Chris (Linda Blair) is there after the abusive father goes away. When he is in a de facto prison, he rapes the strength of his "prisoners" of compatriots. <br /> <br /> Overflowing (even 98 minutes) with a totally useless ending that makes the whole movie meaningless. / 15 <br /> 15-year-old Linda Blair does her best to prevent her body from appearing when dressed, but letting the nipple slip during a shower scene. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out *** *
