As I am from Hungary, I have heard that many people still say better and better about Ãœvegtigris, but I really do not understand the reason for all the noise. <br /> <br /> I liked a lot of movie points, some quotes pulled me up, but stereotypical characters are there again, as in every Hungarian movie, and the story is also quite boring. I liked the first half, but then I started to get bored, and then I found the whole movie just WIN. <br /> <br /> Rudolf Peter is always good, Reviczky is also great, but others are just there ... doing nothing. <br /> <br /> How many years is a good Hungarian film good for?
