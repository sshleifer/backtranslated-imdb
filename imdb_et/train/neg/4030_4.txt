I remember watching "lost rocket" (which really fits until my brother and several cousins, where I was a guest overnight, agreed to follow me - from time to time I was Eric Cartman in the 1960s - sorry, boys) and somewhat embarrassed as permanently Millions of degrees of heat was created as a plot device - even as a second-class class, I knew that a mere rocket just couldn't spend as much heat or destruction over energy as the duration and limited radius of nuclear detonation. <br /> <br /> My hugging with Turkish loving relatives was a punitive offense. <br /> <br /> Movie production values ​​were very good. Operation is not bad (except for the actor Shatnerism, who played the role of governor's help, which someone else mentioned here). <br /> <br /> But the idea that the rocket Easy-Baking Earth has the heat of this exhaust ... no. <br /> <br /> How did the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" people miss the "lost missile"? <br /> <br /> This is a great classic of unintentional comedy - see if you want to have a beer at the weekend.
