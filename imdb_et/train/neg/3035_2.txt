We've got a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Okay, I admit that since I'm white and I have no practical experience of "dance" in a competitive world, "I may not be the author of this type of film. On the other hand, I know a bad movie if I see it. <br /> <br /> And, boy, have I just seen it. <br /> <br /> Filmed in low budget vision and directed by Ian Iqubal Rashid ("A Touch of Pink"), " How it moves "tells the story of the importance of keeping track of your dreams - even if these dreams involve loud loud sounds, irritating hip-hop music and a conversational dialogue the average person doesn't understand if he has an international translator. <br /> <br /> First of all, there are two actors who look like LL Cool J, who work in the Toronto auto parts (Mecca of racial diversity), but they still have time to dance for 8 hours a day. <br /> <br /> There are some other guys in this team, including a symbolic white guy and a man who looks like Denzel Washington "Malcolm X". There are also two women in the movie - one looks like Serena Williams and the other looks like Geraldine from the old "Flip Wilson Show". One of these women was expelled from a private college because her parents spent all their learning on a drug addicted brother. The other girl, Salt N Pepa's member, is undoubtedly just good. <br /> <br /> There is another guy who looks like Eddie Murphy's Buckwheat, but he's another actor who is Huggy Bear's knock. These guys are rival steps. Obviously, this "hood" activity is a very hard core and they all practice the great Step Monster jam in Detroit. <br /> <br /> Since I couldn't understand 90 percent of the dialogue (maybe some subtitles would have been useful, like the Bergman movie or one of Snow's music videos), it's hard to explain what happens, apart from having lots of claims , Serena Williams girl (who by the way does not smile) becomes a freelance stepper (moving from group to group), there is some step-dancing and a lot of irritating hip-hop music. <br /> <br /> This is a typical dirty-rich story; sort of like "Rocky", which has a really bad soundtrack, "Rudy" with annoying raps in the background, "Cry Freedom" with no laughs. <br /> <br /> But why should a film that could have had a big impact on the black audience include drug addiction, bad parents, and a headline that sounds like a first-class, saying, "How's it moving?" <br /> <br /> This movie "me" was moved. Bringed out of the theater as soon as possible.
