This film was a great disappointment with the way of painting the direction, the intellectual niveau, the plot and its theme. This is a slow moving film, similar to the Wonder Years episode, but a terrible lack of depth. Nor can it convey its message convincingly. <br /> <br /> Approaching to a painting subject is a very elite, confined to vague and subjective concepts as 'beauty'. According to the authors of this film, "beauty" can only be experienced in Bob-Ross-style narrow-skinned landscapes. A good movie according to this film can be achieved using basic (primary school) color theory and many feelings. In some cases, the film is offensive, e.g. at some point it is said (rather dancing on the tables) that people with mental disabilities are not capable of emotional emotions or expressing them through painting, their works are worthless "bull". <br /> <br /> I don't understand how a movie would get such a high rating, yet, so far, many people haven't rated it, and they chose only a very high or very low grade.
