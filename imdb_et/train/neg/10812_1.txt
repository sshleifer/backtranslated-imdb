What is a pathetic film. <br /> <br /> I don't waste much time commenting on it. I'm still trying to go back a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> Let me just leave it together - Shaq has no business as an actor or singer. He's completely without talent on both floppy disks. It's a cry of shame that much more talented people are wasting community theaters and karaoke bars while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player to inadvertently cut movies and CDs. <br /> <br /> Much of this failure film was a pathetic no-talent that is Shaq.
