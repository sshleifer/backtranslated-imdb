I thought the film was a poor documentary. Nothing was discussed about the substance. The idea seemed to be cheaper and nothing new. The film lacked a miracle or a romance or something that would really attract science. Most scientists seemed "stereotypical" and sometimes weird. One woman said her prizes were not important, but the kids she helped. He said after a 10-minute scene where he explained all his prizes. Do we play a "modest scientist"? "I have dancing equations in my head," said another. I don't see how it explains something to us. This has not involved the significant impact of science on our culture. The research policy was hardly touched. <br /> <br /> Not a bad flick for 10-14 year olds. Besides that, I felt it was boring and unrevealing. <br /> <br /> 4/10
