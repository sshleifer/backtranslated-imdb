The direction was clearly saying that the idea and plot of this film is completely original .... but for those who have read the "slam dunk" comic, we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes ... <br /> < br /> Another note is Jay Chow himself DON'T KNOW Kung Fu, it just doesn't impress anyone when he tries to act as he can, many people see the differences .. Fortunately, the movie doesn't contain much of KunG Fu's struggles and much is fascinated and visual Effects ... <br /> <br /> I think Jay's action is still painful to look at, especially when almost everyone else in the movie is so much better. The only reason I think why Jay is the main actor is just his popularity. <br /> <br /> Despite how hard I would like to prevent anyone from seeing it, changing this "original" movie has become one of the best budget films in China this year.
