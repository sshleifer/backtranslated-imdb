The "lethal look of love" is essentially a "deadly attraction", with a pair of twists attached to the back. The end does not surprise anyone who has seen weeks more than two or three films. This is another warning story of falling into temptation, and it adds something fresh to the genre. <br /> <br /> Brett (Vincent Spano) is involved in a beautiful woman with just a big trust fund. Even if he has it all, he can lose everything, starting with a steaming aspect of Janet (Jordan Ladd). Janet, Cedar Falls's eye-catching blonde, falls hard on Brett, and she doesn't take it very well when she considers her recruitment clean. Shortly after the wedding, Mrs. Brett will appear in the bedroom of a larger, luxurious home she shared with her new husband. When the police asked Brett, he quickly referred to Janet's finger. After his arrest, Janet seems to be for a few minutes - not that she was before stability. His defensive lawyer (Dutch Taylor) is convinced that Janet is innocent and devil to prove it. <br /> <br /> Did he do it or not? How does it end? The answers to these questions will be available next time in your local station "The Lethal Look of Love". And don't forget that this beautiful story doesn't leave morals: men are pigs and women are crazy.
