I think it was just pointless to produce the second part of the movie like "My Girl". "My Girl" was a very good movie, but it is ridiculous to make another part of the movie where one of the main characters (Macaulay Culkin as Thomas J.) dies. The story was after the first movie. I don't know why someone was trying to find a way to make a story. It was pointless!
