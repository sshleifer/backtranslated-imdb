I made a special effort to watch this movie and I was completely disappointed with this result. On paper, the script looks promising and the choice of actors leaves one hope - I liked Pacino's wife's smell and I have seen Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in a number of French and other 70's / 80's films. But I forgot the importance of partial dialogue in the film, and in this movie they are absolute ..... trash! The shooting locations were also attractive, but hopeless, pretentious and forced dialogues drew the whole thing down to zero. In addition, I am quite allergic to the world of racing and find no interest in this sport. Even the "love story" of the failed dialogues was better than this movie (and it says something !!). I was really better than waiting for this movie and I was very disappointed to miss so much.
