One of my very favorite actor James Spader assumed that this film was at least acceptable. It wasn't. After the first half of the year, I watched it in the rest of my hand with the remote control, so fast forward was ready. So tricked, so standard, we know what happens on every scene. You can even predict the dialogue literally. This is one of those films that makes one scratch and says, "How was this movie ever finished?" Attempting to say something positive, I add that there are some special special effects. But in general, if you've seen 5 Sci / fi movies or are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip it.
