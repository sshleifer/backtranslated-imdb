It was the most painful experience of my life. I can even finish it with Nick. His best thing about Nick Nick is Drake and Josh and it's going to air. Children's songs are annoying and so kids. My little sister wanted to watch this play because she likes something that is usually Disney or nick, but after she sees this example, she said "one of the worst shows I've ever been bored." My little brother was really tall when I envied him. In short, if your three-year-old parents who have no brain, you will enjoy this example otherwise change the channel now.
