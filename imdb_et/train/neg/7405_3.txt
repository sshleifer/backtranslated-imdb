I think they will allow the quality of DVD production away from them. I rented this DVD from 2 movie shops and the second time, I could play it on the third DVD player I tried. <br /> <br /> Anyone else having this problem? It is very difficult to give the film an uneven view after it has played it. First, I have never seen a Finnish horror film, so I was kind of curious that the film was in English. Also, since it has never become clear what has gone wrong with Sarah, she just left behind as slowed down and so I really hoped someone would shoot her on the face and make all the terrible events.
