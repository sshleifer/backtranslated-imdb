Priyadarshan- if a person heard his name, his first thought would be "comedy". This is what this man is known or rather known for. After giving amazing blocking comedies like Hungama, Hera Pher and Hunchul, his train went slowly down to movies like Chupke Chupke and some others I can't remember. Now, with scary movies like Dhol, the first word that will hit our mind after listening to his name is "torture". <br /> <br /> Dhol is a mixture of bad, uncomfortable toilet jokes, somewhat dramatic, bad mixes. intercourse and idiocracy. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two scenes that were funny, though not witty, and second, except for Kunal Khemu and hysterical grandmother, the actor was decent. Speaking of the actor, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were up (when compared to other films), then Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree, and lately two of the above idiots. When it came to Khemu's mistake, he was hard in his jokes and even in his actions. Grandma was first like a ghost, plus she wasn't funny at all, but rather silly. <br /> <br /> The plot was the same as one saw. Four boys behind girls and need money but some couples. It is a "bad" person who is foolish and stupid. And finally, good wins over bad and everything is fine. The idea that Dhol is full of money is not just witty. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is its length. After hours, you are exhausted and want to leave the theater. But as a critic, it is my duty to endure the film for two and a half hours. Continuing the movie continues and the same jokes are repeated over and over again, and the situations are multi-annual. <br /> <br /> When your mother comes home and starts mocking you all, send her to this movie and have fun. 3 out of 10
