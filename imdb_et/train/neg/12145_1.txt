As you might have collected from the title, I believe this movie is the worst zombie movie of all time. The performance of this movie, camera-work, writing, special effects and all other remote-controlled images were sucked. People have argued that although this film has been terribly behaved and terribly produced, it does come wisely in an intelligent script. Wow. The plot has more holes than I or anyone else could read. For starters, why should the government tell everyone to go back to work if it is not safe? I know the government should be bad, but they don't get anything by killing the entire population. No one would rule! One more thing I was thinking of, even if the government told everyone they would go to work, why should people go when the streets were horrified by zombies? Did the zombies hide in the bushes and lurk unsuspecting people to help the government kill everyone on the planet? And what about the end? This stupid Torch boy sacrifices his life to get some close-ups of zombies. He probably forgot that every last 35 years the camera has a zoom function. And the other thing is why he tells Hindenburg before he dies. Hindenburg was a rare event seen by very few people. Zombie's threat is seen by everyone in the country, perhaps in the world. He doesn't think anyone else gets some pictures? They also managed to destroy the only semi-interesting scene of the film when the soldier watched exotic dancers. Why did the zombie hide behind the curtain five minutes before attacking the girl? Especially when the zombie could have come through DOOR. It's probably just something that an inadvertent zombie-movie fan like myself doesn't understand. Every day, I pray that God will increase his brain power long enough to find out all the subtle nuances in feeding the masses. desire to physically hurt people involved in production. Hey Trent Haaga, I call you out!
