After this movie, I watched IMDb and read some comments that compared it with Lost In Translation LITE. When I read that, I immediately see the reviewers point. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bad test of a similar theme. Interestingly, the movie format is almost identical, but PACING is incredibly different. The "10 records" pulls the viewer through the movie's 1-day timeline, while the better-planned "lost ..." seems to stretch out in a few long days. <br /> <br /> I'm sure some people will see it because he has Morgan Freeman and he's frustrated. It seems that his better roles now-days are supporting roles with big blockers, not leading roles- $ 10mil in limited release movies and indie movies.
