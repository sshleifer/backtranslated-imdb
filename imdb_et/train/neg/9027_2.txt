You may be looking at the public. I sat through this 2-hour movie and waited for the second act to hit, so the movie lived up to its title. But Costner will never end the fate of his lovers when he dies and the movie ends. I was wondering where the rest of the movie was. When a movie is called revenge, the hero gets better at the end of the movie. I had the chance to see it or luck in the Black Rain cinema when I saw the movie of other brothers in the cinema instead. the movie had one good thing and it was his beautiful theme. Listen to cd.dont despite this. 1 out of 10
