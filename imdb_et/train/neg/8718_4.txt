In the third part of "Carnosaur" trilogy, there are a number of Keystone Coptic-quality military commandos who are trying to kill two Velocirapors and T-Rex. I give him 4 of compassion alone and my affinity for dinosaurs. The film is definitely the worst trilogy, it can't really be taken seriously. More important, however, is watching a movie that I don't know, but I notice some interesting parallels between "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" trilogues. The first installment in both franchises is a dark, annoying film that has become a cult class, the other is a "stranger" ripoff, and the third is a tongue-in-cheek, almost capturing (whether intentional or not) a film that you laugh on the floor. Also, like the "Xtro" franchise, all "Carnosaur" films are completely interrelated. They only carry the name of the franchise in order to interest the succession. Obviously, "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" have two different product groups at work here, but if you have seen all three movies from both franchises, you will find yourself back and forth between both.
