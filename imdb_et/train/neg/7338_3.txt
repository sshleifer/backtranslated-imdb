I've been watching this movie, hoping to find a beautiful and interesting story, but the story wasn't good at all. The actors' game wasn't better. <br /> <br /> Of course, Shahrukh Khan was there, but he couldn't make this movie "credible" and interesting. <br /> <br /> I have read that this film was based on Flaubert's Madame Bovary novel, but for me I didn't see it in line with the Indian way of thinking. not to waste your time and make your mood worse. I just don't understand how he would get such a "high" vote, averaging 6.8 / 10. You're just wasting your time if you don't like the "dark film" that has a "strange and pointless story".
