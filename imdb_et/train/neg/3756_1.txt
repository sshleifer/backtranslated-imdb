It's really so bad for the movie. My friend rented it because he's an idiot. But then again I have to be an idiot because I watched the whole fucking thing! Participants were parallel to the high school drama geeks who think they're going. The only place they go is back to the Luby table. I watched this "pearl" while watching it really did. I mean, some "scriptwriter" actually thought that this assumption was fresh, original and profitable. Then some money with the money believed so much that he decided to cut some cash because of the naive misconception that he was going to come back to it. The actors were cast, scores were scored, master artists were hired, fresh animators from Al Collins' graphic design school began to formulate. <br /> <br /> Obviously, there were many tons of things I hated about this move, but one thing I was doing was overuse of music. This flick was sent every minute. There was no break in music. And sometimes it was mixed higher than dialogue, not that it put you on every important plot point or something. <br /> <br /> After that, we decided to look at Mystic River. It was like driving with the 1980s VW Diesel Rabbit, then switching to the BMW 740. You didn't get two more opposite film quality.
