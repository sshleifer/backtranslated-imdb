It would have been NC-17 because of all the excess violence in this movie. But Gore could have been pg-13 and there was a lot of fear when the mother had the initial jackass bad-haired boy friend. There was a lot of character development that made the movie look better, then after the boy came back to the scarecrow, he was a meaningless hour and ten minutes of killing him. Violence was too big and I think this number was higher than twelve, which is a large number of such films. Almost every movie's characters are peeled or cut off, but the teacher who called him "white trash" and "hoodlum" (although the character is something other than hoodlum, not even close, I know the closets and part) they don't pull class, they sit and throw stuff to the teacher). The teacher deserves more terrible death than anyone, but it was just upside down. The film had two suspending scenes, but it wasn't long enough to be scary at all. As I said, the killings were excessive, and sometimes people who have nothing to do have beat their heads. If gore was really fun, it would have been nc-17. Two children describe the body they find in landscapes, describe it as a gorilla, when it was, they explained to the policeman that the boys were around the intestines. His belly was not even cut off so that the ores would not have been in the stomach, even though I would have seen it. The act was pathetic, the characters were losers, and the scarecrow could do many gym tricks. I recommend renting scenes for the death of this movie, I never see it, but I enjoyed excessive violence. Also, do not worry about the sequel, I looked at it for five minutes and died, it sounds good, but not. The original scarecrow was interested in me.
