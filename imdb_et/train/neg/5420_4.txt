ME FAW DOWN <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Quiet <br /> <br /> (Black & White - Short Film) <br /> < br /> Stan 'n' Ollie mixes with a few bangs (Kay Deslys and Vera White) after they visited the theater that burns them in their absence! Needless to say, their tyrannical women (Vivien Oakland and Bess Flowers) aren't amused ... <br /> <br /> Leo McCarey's OK comedy made William Seiter's masterpiece SONS OF THE DESERT (1934) narrative with L&H chewing victims who are forced to say a monster for a lie, which setbacks in a grand manner. Much of this is very funny, especially the scene where Deslys dances to Stani, leading a violent pushing and striking game. But some of the fun is downgraded by Oakland and Flowers, playing their roles perfectly, which adds to the henpecked husband scenario. Originally published in the UK, WE SLIP UP.
