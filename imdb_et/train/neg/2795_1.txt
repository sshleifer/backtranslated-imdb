Cassidy (Kacia Brady) puts her mouth in her mouth, blowing her boyfriend Neal (Jason Dibler). Cassidy was the singer of the "demon and death" rock band who couldn't feel his boyfriend's sadness against him (you know I find other reasonable ways to fix it after putting the ball through the head). However, he returns with a Dora (Jill Small) soul with his friend who replaces his vocal, so that the group can stop the album stopped by Cassidy's premature death. But Cassidy was engaged in darkness and collecting souls. This anger is mainly consumed by Neale, but all band members or all members of the music studio die when they fall victim. Rather tortured Dora ... not Cassidy pay back. <br /> <br /> Lousy's micro-budget horror strike seems cheap, cheap to cast, who should make plans in another line and boast of cheap kill-scenes that are not effective in one bit.
