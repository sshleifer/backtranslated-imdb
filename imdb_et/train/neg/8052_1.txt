I sat through this turkey because I had never seen it before and because the assumption seemed to have potential. It was a little fun to the hurricane. At the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to blow the windows out of the house, but the trees in the background are completely erect and the leaves are not moving! In fact, when the characters move out of the house, the sunlight shines in bright sunlight. At this point, no matter what the filmmakers trust, they evaporated faster than the very localized rain of their films. It is too bad that all hurricanes are not the same, so it would definitely help our homeowners get insurance rates here in Sunshine.
