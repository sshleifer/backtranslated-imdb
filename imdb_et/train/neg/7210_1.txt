What's more, Disney manages to make a children's film that completely ignores the background. The only thing that is common to this and original gadget movies are names. The most prominent mistakes are the characters - Penny does not own a book, Brain is reduced to a fictional proportion, Dr Claw is more than a dropout than an evil villain, and so on. The horrors begin with the first minutes of the movie - when Gadget is a security guard called John Brown, he doesn't help to identify him as a classic inspector widget. And right from the start, we see Disney's blatant attempt to make every story between a man and a woman a love affair - they introduce Brend, who only serves this movie with Disney compatibility. Add to this the fact that "Claw", seen in this film and classic Dr. Claw, is almost diagonally opposite and you see that it is not close to the original. What would be a better excerpt to replace it - but as you thought Disney failed. The whole movie is just Gadget, who is stupid because of stupidity and Brenda after lusting. As if it were offensive to add damage, Disney introduced the "new" Gadgetmobile - it doesn't look, doesn't work or think like old Gadgetmobile at all, it's just a canonical "comic relief". Disney obviously admitted that the gadget films were comedy, so they made the movie comedy, but they took out all the smart running gags (like a call-to-action paper that exploded the editor's face) and replaced them with Gadget, Gadgetmobile is smart wise and "Claw" shows off. Someone should tell Disney that "child's film" does not mean "complete absence of the brain". The gadget should target children aged 10-12, not children aged 10-12, like this film. Whatever this movie should be, it is not a repetition of NO, a real inspector gadget. Since I love the old gadget, I hate it.
