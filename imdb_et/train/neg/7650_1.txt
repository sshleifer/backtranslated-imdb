I know I'm in a minority, but ... <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll is about as talented as a frog. Not even a toad; just frog. He recalls about one hundred other talented cages, who, one after another, cast out one useless crap-fest. <br /> <br /> This movie? There is crap-fest. Slater's talent is only minimally used to believe that he has other things (like his failed relationship) in his mind. Reid works the way he'd forgotten his action lessons, hit the head and MADE seriously to forget his lesson, or is one of the worst leaders in film history. I am voting for the third option, although the other two are always possible. <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll has never done any of the things I've ever had the slightest joy. Frankly, I'm pleased that he made this stink. I was worried about Bloodrayne, who competed with Underworld: Evolution for ticket sales. Now I'm sure Len Wiseman has nothing, and I mean NO to worry about. <br /> <br /> This sets the 1.0 / 10 rating for this dirty, twisted crap-fest, from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
