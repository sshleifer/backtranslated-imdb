This latest adman-reverse-movieman attempts to make its debut (s) into business with a fairly old discussion about almost every cultural standard - timeless romance (pun intended). <br /> <br /> But Desi's audition (and use) of tissues is somewhat short, as the usual tendencies towards "pepper, spice and sugar" in a mixture of conventional b / g score, dialogue, dance, drama, etc. produce a nice look for the package inside. <br /> <br /> In the first 40 minutes of the movie, the kitchen scene is repeated at least 8-9 times. Further repetitions follow the movie (after all the lead figure is the cook). But there is les problemos - no story! Hah, no wonder. Someone forgot to write the script. <br /> <br /> Amitabh will put Cheen Jyada (more) in excess. Really when will this man ever stop? How many 60-something French like this is 30-something for a nub? An timeless mind, but certainly not a non-eternal bod? And the sole? Sorry, soul? Reasonably good actor Paresh Rawal, who has the only rational role in the film. The director has no sense of reality when everyone reaches his new, confused hot idea. Nowhere are any real problems or problems that such a couple may encounter except for the actual marriage, which is only the initial obstacle. The lower limit of the child with cancer (the first love of the bachelor boy) goes somewhere and no matter how little poignant it would have changed, it would be killed because of the girl's character. <br /> <br /> Anyway, nice to try, but not quite there.
