RUN ... do not walk away from this movie !!!!! This film, which is aimed at very young children, was a tear to you. While the 90's Gamera trilogy raised the bar, this film lowered it. It's a slow pace and the fight against the monster is good, but rarely seen. That movie was dry in the box. Only a very bad offer after the 90's phenomenal series. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ON THIS POINT !!!!!!!!!!! Here are the top 10 reasons why 90's series of Gamera fans HATE this movie. <br /> <br /> 10. This movie is a drama that follows a child who is trying to cope with his mother's death and is afraid of losing a baby to Gamera after he knew his father saw the death of an adult Gamera. At the beginning of the movie, you see an adult Gamera, a few minutes away. Can he get a pair of Gyaos from her ass and destroy her? She looks old and sleepy. In addition, he does not see what you have seen. Her suit seemed cheap and hurried. <br /> <br /> 8. The young Gamera you see through the movie looks like a Pokemon. Big-eyed and cute ... it reminds you of Godzilla's children from Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2. Gamera is now too cute. <br /> <br /> 7. The speed of this movie is to watch the NASCAR race with a 3-hour delay. I watched this movie with two other Gamera fans and nobody was happy about the slow motion of this movie. I've seen a full-fat people with SUVs moving faster on the mountain road. <br /> <br /> 6. Like Godzilla: Final Wars, this movie had a very small echo time on the screen. Final Wars had many more, really and better battles, though short. <br /> <br /> 5. Children take the title role. The theme and poor writing of all children killed the original Gamera series in the 1970s, and history is repeated in 2000. Gamera's most successful films abandoned Sesame Street and went darker. Why go back to a failed formula? It was supposed to be a new trilogy and bad ticket sales killed the hope of continuing this story (thanks to God). <br /> <br /> 4. Gamera lost her iconic roar. Now he sounds like an elephant with a stroke of strike. <br /> <br /> 3. This movie can bring a new Olympic event ..... Imagine a relay that involves sending very small children to harm. You have to see the end of this point. Where were the parents? Oh yeah ... from there, your kids are sent to the echo zone. <br /> <br /> 2. Special effects were good, but for Gamera movie sub-par. Legion and Iris had better consequences. The best result was to show an apple-sized baby Gamera flight. Not too impressive. <br /> <br /> 1. This movie isn't exactly what the adult echo fans are waiting for. Director participated in Power Rangers and shows it. It comes out like a cross, ET, always: sunset on the third street and TMNT. Kudos if you know all 3 references.
