I usually enjoy Loretta Yun's earlier films: she was light and windless behind her and she knew how to wear clothes. But this is just the loser word Go Go, except for the funny supporting turn of Glenda Farrell. Young is a hatchback girl who talks to her writer-spouse (Paul Lukas) as a champion of championships. It's not a cinematic game and a long, narrative in the middle, where their marriage breaks down almost from killing a movie. <br /> <br /> However, there is one interesting bit. As Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk start their climate game, a series of quick shots show planes, trains, football games, even the diver in the middle of the air, freezing before the event. This is the early use of the cold image seen in American film. I want the rest to be so inventive and funny.
