The film was made in 1942 and during the 11th World War, the film industry decided to take advantage of spies around. <br /> <br /> Eleanor Powell's fabulous dance makes it fun to watch the movie. The recent Miss Powell was certainly a great thinker in every sense. He's back to the very younger Red Skelton. Two of them also played "I Dood It". <br /> <br /> Moroni Olsen, who 3 years later was great when the "Mildred Pierce" interrogative cop reappears as an officer who asked Powell to go. The problem is that Olsen and his rogues are really Japanese spies. Bert Lahr is his usual brilliant himself here and he gets a lot of support from Virginia O'Brien.
