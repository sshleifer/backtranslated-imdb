Having seen three more versions of the same movie, I'm afraid it's the weakest for me, mainly thanks to Scott's rather boring and leading result. His emotions are so wonderful that participation in the film is difficult. Alistair Sim represented this role indefinitely better. If Scrooge was his most sensible, you would not feel that Scott was talking with the dialogue with great conviction, and if he passed through his metamorphosis, he was also convincing. I can't think of the participants in this movie who are compatible with Alistair Sim. Even the musical version (and, frankly, the Muppets) performs better. Very disappointing.
