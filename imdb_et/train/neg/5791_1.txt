As a Professor of Native Film, I can honestly say that this is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. I'd rather get a root channel than watch this movie again. Using stereotypes, creative experiments with traditional coyote stories and bad camera work worsened only the glib creative story and the bad script. The writer and director has shown the worst part of a colonized approach to depicting local people and communities. If this person is a mother tongue, they must go home and apologize to anyone they know as an apple and inner racism and a poor sense of humor. If this person is not a native speaker, they have to seriously re-examine their white privileges and ask themselves whether they have unexplored, involuntary racism or are deliberately ignorant. My only hope is that the local actors in this film had a good time and at least received a reward for their efforts. If you want to see good local movies, check out: Christmas in the clouds, dance outdoors, medical river, PowWow road, smoke signals ... just a few.
