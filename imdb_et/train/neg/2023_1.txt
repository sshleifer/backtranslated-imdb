As a summary, you've just made the most ignorant comment I've ever heard about RPG. You thought they were gay? Have you slowed down? If you went away, save your best friend and someone decides on the goodness of your heart to help you, you have a serious debt for that person. Lavitz was a good person and each time they helped each other, they made them friends. They were not gay lovers, like your looting. And to find out that the game is set for a medieval period. Then the women prepared the meal when the men fought. Do you even know your history? Do you know how long it took for women to accept the army today? This game contains a lot of reality, even though your too damn slow attempts are made, and you really need to force some specific evidence instead of unknown assumptions based on your erroneous action to interpret the story.
