I have to see an early preview of this movie and I hope they have the time to change what they can improve before August 3rd. It marks Andy Samberg's "Hot" Rod Kimble on Saturday night. She plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a trickster like her late father. When we meet him, he jumps in the post-truck on his mo-ped, yes, mo-ped and almost does it. It would be worth the "Jackass" movie if he hadn't tried it honestly. Isla Fisher plays a little older and much more mature girl - in the neighborhood of Denise. He seems to like Rod enough to join his team. Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half-life Kevin, who documented the stunts with a video camera. Sissy Spacek plays Rodi's mother, Marie. He married Frank Powell again, played by Ian McShane. Frank is a real tough guy who enjoys Rodi's real pull. It is clear that Rod is not going to earn Frank's respect until he takes him. We know Frank needs $ 50,000. heart transplant and Rod has decided to raise money just so that he "can capture his ass" when he is healed and proves himself to be a man. The long fall on the hill convinces Rod to "big" with one stunt. Rod tries to get the seed problems by paying you for tricks that would do you when you saw them in real life. Like a human flashlight - children's birthday. There were those who were able to laugh at most tricks. Just when all hope and money disappear, the sponsor will save the day if the 15 school buses Rod wants to jump. He gets exclusive broadcasting rights and creates telephone lines for donations. Rod gets new clothes and a real motorcycle. The whole city is clear and the world sounds. Does he make a leap? Does she get a girl? Do they raise $ 50k? Does Frank get his ass off Rod? Wait until the video of this 90-minute movie can be found.
