Being a big fan of Corman's horror films, I waited a bit more for my West than I got. Well, I was all right. I had almost as many smiles as I looked at Mel Brooks' destructive saddles. <br /> <br /> Look at the mobile tire track spectacle in the old western prairie. You can kill time by counting them when the otherwise boring scene happens. And the horses have a gear, they are considered to be fast forward. See also the queens of the swinging bar of the traditional wild west salon, who make a number that resembles a fashionable dance in the 1920s, decades before the invention of style. I hope the salon around them will not break. <br /> <br /> In the middle of this speech, the main actors are doing the right job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are all really good. Special thanks to them for doing the best they could with the material that seemed to be mostly raised from "Johnny Guitar" but not quite impressive. But there is something wrong with ridiculous western similarity. Just like a really bad old horror movie, it may fail in one direction, but still manage to delight. This is one of the reasons why Corman's work I like and that is why I dare to recommend you to experience this movie if you have the opportunity.
