Watching Marlen Brando on the screen is like a masterful carving of the sophisticated details of a carpenter into a mahogany. Brando's action is the only thing that makes this movie traceable. The plot is ugly and ridiculous (not comic). Other great names indicate that they are making desperate attempts to give them signs that they represent some moderation of humanity ... these characters are damp priest with humanity. All of the technical aspects of this movie are either mediocre or just terrible. The director throws images of cold images and slow motion with impunity. Random music is comic and destroys all the hints of dramatic effect. It's not something I'm really looking for in the movie, but even the wardrobe was far away. Honorable Brando couldn't concentrate on the terrible towels she had covered her. I've heard this movie called "David Lynch-esquire" and "irreversibly funny" ... it's neither. David Lynch's films carry evil creativity - this film was not creative in any way. And do not mix the carelessness with stupidity.
