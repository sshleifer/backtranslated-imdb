I think this story was attracted by the story and the leading actor, so I gave him a chance from Head Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically, Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) by the police, especially the superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), is forced to go running to form a gang and go against them to erase his and his family's names. It's really all I talk about because I didn't pay attention. Also starring Orlando Bloom Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan Dan Kellyna, Philip Barantini Steve Hartina, Joel Edgerton Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon Kate Kellyna, Emily Browning Grace Kellyna and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott . Ledger does a pretty good thing that is worth it, and the film has outstanding moments, especially at the end of the weapon battle, but I can't say I enjoyed it because I didn't see it all. Okay!
