Unburned and undifferentiated "new" Columbo, who sees a man-in-the-teddy, attends his brother's wedding only to make her bride disappear on her wedding day. Columbo is investigating ... <br /> <br /> And this applies to this: it is drawn and surprisingly loaded with a flat script, given that it has been written by Robert Van Scoyk, who made a very pleasing Columbo story "Murder Under The Glass" Detective Flourishing; is not even a murder to talk about, and that script writer has been with Columbo with the greatest inventiveness to restrict suspects through photos taken during weddings involving everyone who was there! <br /> <br /> The lack of any Columbo feature, I thought I was watching Hill Street Blues episode. Insulting the series history, with a soap opera style appropriately. Very avoidable things.
