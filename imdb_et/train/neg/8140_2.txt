I saw this movie in a sound science theater when it was called "It lives at night". This title is much less misleading than "Batpeople". In fact, it's called Batperson. This movie is a doctor who is studying the bats that I mean because he wants to better treat rabies. It's not really clear. It is clear that he and his wife take a tour of the caves and are bitten by a bat. Why a scientist has to go to study bats. Shouldn't he go in for himself. Well after biting, she and her husband will go to their honeymoon, where she will start to fit. They'll ever go to the worst doctor. The man stays in the hospital and kills the sister. Finally, the boy kills 3-4 people and his wife is standing by him and you have to kill him to kill him instead of taking the investigative sheriff.
