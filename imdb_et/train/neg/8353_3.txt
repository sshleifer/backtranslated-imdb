Beaudray Demerille (weak Peter Fonda, who also led), an aging gambler, wins the young teen Wanda "Nevada" (a beautiful but not talented Brooke Shields) poker game. Along with an unlikely couple (of course), India will start looking for gold in Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> It's a story and there's no need to look for a deeper meaning. It's not just there. The actor is also very weak, which was quite surprising given that Peter Fonda was in the lead. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something interesting in this movie, look at the beautiful landscape and some good Brooke Shields. His character, however, is so irritating (especially in the beginning) and stupid that he is never as sexy or tempting. Too bad, but in the light of the story, I doubt it could do more. I don't know why Peter Fonda directed and celebrated this film. He even had to talk about his father (Henry Fonda) to this ridiculous mess (useless) firework. Unfortunately, this was their only film together. Couldn't Henry be in EASY RIDER? 3/10
