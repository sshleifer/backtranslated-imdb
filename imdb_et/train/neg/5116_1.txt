I rented this movie today, thinking it might be a good football movie because I'm a big football fan. Boy, I was wrong. This film is too religious and preaching and is really unrealistic. This movie says pretty much that if your Christian gets something you just want in life, like becoming a football player! You cannot become a big footballer by becoming a Christian and asking God, doing it through practice and hard work. All you have to do is ask God and he will give you something .... clean rent. It's not true, duh. I laughed several times because of this embarrassment. The only part that was funny was when they were fools (Shultz cartoonist? No, a guy flying over the Atlantic, etc. etc.) But really this movie wasn't that big. I don't recommend it, especially if you're not a Christian, lol.
