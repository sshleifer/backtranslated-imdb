This film was so badly written, directed and behaved to make it easy for faith. It should be rebuilt with a better script, director and pain service. The worst problem is action. You, on the one hand, have Jennifer Beals, who is polished, professional and completely believable, and on the other, Ri'chard, who has been in vain in this and just that piece. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just as terrible as the slave (and holding) pair, although they both do a good job. The participants (and the director) should not have made any accents - they are inconsistent and incredible. It would be better to focus on doing good work in real English. Casting is ridiculous. Why are "African" merchant children (hence less socially desirable for gens de couleur society) cast with very pale skin, while supposedly socially desirable Marcel has expressed African qualities, including apparently dyed blonde "fro"? Just as casting leaders can't barely read the script they cast and choose the right actors from a wide range of highly talented and physically diverse color artists. It's just that weird! It can be a great movie and it should be done again, but with people who respect the material and can choose the appropriate and qualified participants. There are many good actors and it would be nice to see Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben do the right casting, a good script and a decent direction.
