This is the best film Derek has ever made for the couple and if you think this is a recommendation, you haven't seen any of them. There are ordinary ingredients: it has been as bad as their other efforts, we can watch Bo who has noticed T-shirt competitions quite often, the story is just ridiculously idiotic and the film takes too much. And then: Orang Utans in Africa? <br /> <br /> But it has some things. Bo looks good, production values ​​(kits, costumes, etc.) are pretty good and this greatly increases the value of this camp. In a strange way it's pretty funny, just because it tries to be serious and fails.
