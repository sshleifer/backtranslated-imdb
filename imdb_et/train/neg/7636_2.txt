I wanted to believe this movie after the only mainstream comedy admitting this country is slapstick and stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Of course, it went to the other side - let's be cool and sharp - and came out on the other side with little to show. I bet one small seed had nuts for it. I know SL did. <br /> <br /> None of the major characters are comics to pull it out. Even Danny K had better timing. I'm really serious. Every time they used a little character, I thought, "Darn, this person should have been a leader!". <br /> <br /> An independent does not mean that the camera's work should be terrible. Black and white did nothing for this film - in fact, with such a flat dialogue, it wounded even more, bringing boredom deeply into relief. Black and white were also not crisp. The composition was terrible. The use of music was terrible. Strangely enough, I looked at Little Miss Sunshine after this movie and its composition perfectly - maybe the shortcomings of this movie have been left out of my mind. <br /> <br /> I think Corne (who was more fun than the driver before he even said anything, said this movie, not David - see it and you understand. I think it would have been filmed in someone's back yard. <br /> <br /> I think SA comedy will stay a little longer during the Stone Age.
