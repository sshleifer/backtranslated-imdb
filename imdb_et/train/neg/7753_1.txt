All of this movie is a hog wash. Dirty behavior, terrible dialogue, ugly local girls. this movie falls into oblivion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director must be on the weekend. Robert C. is completely gone and has no idea what's going on. College kids are the worst. Don't act talent at all, a very stupid reason and just right dumbbells. Special effects for birds. The so-called security forces in these parks belong to the playground: with loose-fitting arms, useless speakers; and a computer system located on a roll of toilet paper. when the park is under construction and nothing is working; why bother to invite potential customers until all is over. writers should be the first victims of confusion with manufacturers and teams. The whole movie is part of a septic tank that has been viewed on another planet for viewing. What a pearl. The convicts should look at it so that they can commit suicide.
