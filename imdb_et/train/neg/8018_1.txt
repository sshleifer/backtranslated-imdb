Oh, I hated this movie. The substance should have brought a really fine movie and the leading player was certainly sensitive and talented enough to deal with this issue, but the script - even if * was a * script - is a mess. It's less of a movie than a random slide show that doesn't go anywhere. I'd say it doesn't go anywhere fast, except it's actually the longest 81 minutes you ever sit. As I mentioned, the leader is a good actor. So is Faruza Baulk (SP?), When her sometimes tough but finally loving and accepting mother. The filmmakers have a lot to answer here because it's a mess. True shame, because I really wanted to like this movie, but it's basically outside of a movie that's never been done. Skip it - it wasn't even worth $ 6 to get paid for viewing.
