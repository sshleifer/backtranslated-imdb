This movie was definitely the longest movie and record-breaking movie with definitely 30 players. After JAANI DUSHMAN (2002), I thought no one could do anything like that. <br /> <br /> The movie, as the title suggests, is based on Kargil's war, but there are too many characters and romantic subpages, and many characters are boring <br /> <br /> Even if there are too many cinematic freedoms like killing people with a knife , don't know what Soldier does this? <br /> <br /> JP Dutta's direction towards BORDER's music is okay <br /> <br /> The big cast of Ajay Devgan is high, Saif is very good, and his first movie with a queen, Abhishek is nice Manoj Bajpai moments Sanju is wasted, Sune is okay Akshaye Khanna makes her part well rest is satisfactory Rani is good, Esha is a good holiday is satisfactory
