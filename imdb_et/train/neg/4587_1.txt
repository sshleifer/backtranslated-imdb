Well, what can I say. <br /> <br /> "What we know" is almost impossible - leaving behind genre masterpieces such as "Postimees", "Dungeon Master", "Merlin", and fourthly, it goes into history as the single worst movie I've been ever seen. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is really impressive, because I've seen a lot of bad film. <br /> <br /> This contemporary cinema masterpiece is made up of two interwoven parts that alternate between stupid and creative parcels, an extremely annoying photographer, his or her spouse to accept antidepressants for forced and forced survival, and talking to the heads who say how quantum physics is supposed to justify your new-brain-pseudo-philosophy. Basically, when you start your day with meditation for Enya and Kenny G, this movie is for you. If you have a sense of humor, a crowd of people who know how to have fun, and a great deal of good weed, then this film is for you. Otherwise, stay away. The first thing that hit me "What do you know what you know" is what seems to have changed and put together with the same kind of people coming from a cheap wedding camera with pink heart effects, computer-generated sparks over the screen and other confusions . Whoever makes these people a mystery near the theater release. I think it's too much Kenny G for you. The movie was hit with cheesy GCI, I liked that you or I can record on your computer using a video editing program, but never because it's just too ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The script was written by someone who had no writing experience. All the characters and conversations were not only cumbersome and confusing, but also "writers" felt that they had all the information they needed, or rather the misinformation that is most of this film, to the end. throat. Well, given the target audience, it may not be the idea too bad. The main character, for example, spends half of the pills on the film. Obviously, it was not considered convincing enough, so there are at least a couple of dialogues specifically referring to his anti-anxiety pill just in case it is impossible for viewers to combine their overwhelming pain and suffering with the small white pills it takes when it feels. Acting ... Well, I've seen Ed Wood's movies work better and not, it's not an exaggeration. Heck, the little game I was at the age of 12 was much more inspiring than that. That was really so. <br /> <br /> The story has been broken here and there, with a bunch or randomly spoken head, a strange combination of scientists, kooky doctors and self-proclaimed mystics, and continue on how the quantum physics supposedly "explains" how ever a man or a woman in his / her life has made a reality by participating in the experience. You see, reality is the probability field of a variety of options, and it's just a stone if the observer decided to mark it. What happens when more than one observer observes that they have not said, but then again who cares. Listen to Enya, ponder, watch, and you are God, and no one gives critical thinking, logic, etc. about such foolish and archaic things. "paradigm shift" and "go down the rabbit hole". In addition, Heidelberg's principle of uncertainty is probably proof of alternative realities, parallel universes, and so on. <br /> <br /> Speaking of rabbit holes, the analogy film goes through. All these people are constantly talking about rabbit holes. I'm not sure what it was, what they say or show, but one thing I'm sure is that it's somehow related to anal sex. In fact, the movie is _extremely_ anti-sex. Sex is always dirty, ugly and enlightening. <br /> <br /> In any case, speakers say that the protagonist achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting the hearts with the magic marker of his whole body and continuing to move around when he sees with his eyes more prominently than he started. <br /> <br /> I want 2 hours of my life back. <br /> <br /> Here are a few random quotes I remember: <br /> <br /> "I think it's unrealistic, I've become much more real to me and what I thought was real before is often less real than unreal. ‚Äù- Some speak of the spirituality of quantum physics. <br /> <br /> "What does one man take to have an erection? It only takes one thought. Nothing changes from the outside, all the changes are in there. However, he has an erection." - Some self-proclaimed mystic, headmaster of their lighting school . <br /> <br /> [looking at you in the mirror] "I hate you! I hate you! Fat! You are ugly! - The protagonist, fat and ugly photographer."
