Okay, let me tell you that I didn't expect the film to see Jerry Springer as a cinematic gold, all I asked for it to be cinematographic ... and it wasn't even that. It looked like someone's bad home movie. Poorly acted, scripted, and full of nudity you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> "The plot" focuses on a low-class family who decides to go to the "Jerry Farrelly Show" to discuss many things between mother, daughter, father, and daughter's bridegroom. From there, a unique experience is filmed and developed: white-trash pornography. Red sex, interactive sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This movie encouraged me to go out of the theater and cut into another. At least it was mercilessly short. Nasty and humiliating. African-Americans and working class America should be offended. (Howard Stern should still be happy, he didn't destroy his movie stardom attempts. He was smart, funny and fun) <br /> <br /> MY GRADE: F + (daughter was hot)
