Cornel Wilde and the three dumbbells are looking for stolen treasures in the southern Atlantic. <br /> <br /> Wilde-led treasure hunters are fighting a group of territorial sharks with cute little generations on their hungry face. Wilde and his cheerful men have to find a way to get out of the menu so that they can start the mining of the old Spanish galleon, filled with a golden rod. <br /> <br /> After a team takes a little eternity by pushing, moving, claiming, and listening to Wilde's tedious health problems, he led a mad imprisonment boat and made things worse. Now the idea of ​​the battle is about who gets the treasure and who sees the shark inside the stomach. <br /> <br /> At least Wilde is a shape that carries exactly the same thing she was wearing "Naked Prey" 10 years earlier and she's been in a great condition. <br /> <br /> Made from 75 cents from the budget.
