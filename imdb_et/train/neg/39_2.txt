In Africa, a film actor is kidnapped and taken to the jungle where he is held for ransom. The manufacturer hires one to go and bring back. The whole complication is the jungle cannibals who worship a truly ugly view of the "god" who likes to eat naked women. <br /> <br /> This is a gory sleazy movie. There's a lot of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against nude people. This film is for the deepest dark parts of our being, and if the film was not so boring, this film would be classic. Lets face, despite gore, nasty sex and abuse, and ugly monster this movie is snoozer. Stimulation is all turned off and it puts you out. There are several plot lines that all seem to be separate from each other, but ultimately it is one story. Worst, almost no one says anything. Most of the minimal dialogue concerns cruelty or one of the characters that protest that "I do what I want". It is such a quiet and boring film that if it hadn't been for the frequent screams of the victims, I would advise you to sleep. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that needs to be avoided if you don't have to sleep, or if you don't have to see every European cannibal movie. <br /> <br /> (aside. VideoAsia published it simply as part of its Terror Tales series. Their print is a strange letterbox that seems to result in their printing from a Japanese source (there is fog) that was cut to remove subtitles.
