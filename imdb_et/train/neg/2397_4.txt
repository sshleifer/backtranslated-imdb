Nicolas Roeg? He led the classic supernatural thriller DON`T LOOK NOW, which he didn't do? Strangely enough, the above-mentioned movie was broadcast on BBC television over the weekend. <br /> <br /> You can't compare COLD HEAVEN and DON `T LOOK NOW because they both have the same director and the same structure, and in the first third of COLD HEAVEN I thought they had the same The plot after the dead spouse was replaced by a dead child instead. In fact, my idea was set for the film that rotates around the grieving widow who saw her late husband run around Venice with a red anorak. This is not happening, but about one-third of the driving time, which is a massive plot and, despite being a significant plot twist, is not explained in any depth. In fact, COLD HEAVEN, which destroys the film, has very little. <br /> <br /> People have mentioned COLD HEAVEN's rather poor product values ​​and cannot be noticed. If I didn't differ, I would have thought it was a TVM because it felt like television that it would be white capital letters in the title order. Roeg is also trying to inject the prescriptions of an art house through spoken thinking processes, but it does not help the film at all. One can't help Roeg have put all his efforts into the plot's twists, which are perfectly flat on the screen. <br /> <br /> Cheap production values, interesting leadership and a really strange assumption and scenario make a bad movie
