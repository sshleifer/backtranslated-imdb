The film, written and directed by Neil Young, "Greendale" is a little more than a 87-minute music video set for the singer's writer's works or so long. Instead of a dialogue, the film relies solely on the words of Joun, which are strongly associated with social-political comments to speak of "the story", while actors act on the pitch. the image has a similar effect to that of young people who blasts some of their films at home and releases them for public consumption. Although the story is said to be going through the film, we really have no idea what happens mainly because of the polished look of the film, the lack of dialogue, and the amateur's intuitive intuition. Everything we get in eighty-seven minutes is an outdated number of hippies cavorting quietly through inconsistent narrative, while Young's songs play endless sound. The whole thing becomes a self-conscious annoying workout. "Greendale" gives Hollywood a bad name for making a low budget movie.
