Anne Bancroft plays the dead Jewish mother Estelle, who asked the dedicated son (Ron Silver) to find a unique one-time movie star Greta Garbo and introduce them to two before Estelle controls. Perhaps it was called "Bancroft Talks" because the actor attacks this insecure comic / dramatic / sentimental material during its duration. Hot or cold director Sidney Lumet can't get a consistent rhythm and the filmmaker can't keep Bancroft's constant overwhelming - he keeps him on time: cute, tearful and stranded. Estelle can drag this scenario (not so much on the thin plot). Silver and co-stars Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks are getting very little, but are celebrating this star, and everyone is robbing him. * 1/2 from ****
