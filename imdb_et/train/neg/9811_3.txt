What can I say ??? This movie was so stupid and stupid that I thought it was a psychotic comedy of DRAG - they should rename it to "Pregnant Cat Fight!" What a stupid waste of time if you want to see (DIE DIE !!!) I want your baby's dragon QUEENI Jennifer Tilly is her Freaky herself, just rent one "Chucky" movie, oh ya, "Bride Chucky." more fun when you look at two ugly plastic jackets (one of them, Jennifer Tilly, became UGLY's Chucky female version) with Squeaky plastic rubber, looking at Daryl Hannah, who was pregnant, Dumb & stupid; & Jennifer Tilly Grinding Husbang in a food processor reminded me that my mother is trying to do the job!
