I was so eager to see this one of my favorite TVs. I saw the Universal trademark following the title and the song of the theme that still impresses. Computer animation in some landscapes, such as the solid title "Jetsons" or a scaled-down view of a spaceship approaching the amusement park and its larger and more fantastic action. Briefly after that until the end ... I couldn't believe my eyes !! How happy I was that I forgot everything I had seen. Tiffany's songs and song of her new song were with my head. Anyway, I want to see this space-older family (including Flintstones and Yogi Bear) on all graphical computer models like story or Bug's life. Hanna-Barbera is in my opinion.
