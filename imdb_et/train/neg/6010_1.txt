This movie is perhaps one of the 2000 most boring films I've ever seen! In particular, music cannot create tension when people suddenly disappear. Similarly, aspects such as martial arts are not taken seriously enough. The story itself is a problem: the United Nations could never take over the world, because the United States alone would not have allowed it, but countries like China, Russia, Japan, etc. would not. It would also be played by someone trying to take over the world, as Nicolae Carpathia does. It reminds me of James Bond's movies, only to have more action! Of course, the film is made for Christians and only for Christians, and they can enjoy it. Since I can't read myself as a Christian, I think the whole idea is ridiculous. Moreover, this prophecy, if it is believed to be true, appears dangerously close to other prophecies that cultures do at the end of the world. Why fear this opportunity if we can live as well as possible here on Earth
