Merry Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O 'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. The hotshot yuppie dug by her girlfriend does not want to remain alone at Christmas, so she decides to return to her childhood home by placing her in an uncertain family who lives there and bribing them to represent the family. Affleck's uncomfortable and one-dimensional performance, which mainly works with a glowing smile, makes her character as a spiritually unbalanced slip, but Gandolfin and O'Hara are breathing into this confusion. Even in the case of a farce, its stupidity is disdainful, there is little point in the scene and the scene, and its sentimental messages are as fake as Affleck's smile. 91 min, rated PG-13. * Â½
