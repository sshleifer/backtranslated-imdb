Many other reviewers here, including many of whom I respect, hold this horror of the slice of European sleaze high. Personally, I didn't like it at all. It is a precarious attempt in the atmospheric period between sex and violence. Jess Franco does the best for such films. Unfortunately, the notorious filmmaker Joe D'Amato is not. D'Amato's best-known films are notorious for their high gross margin. He, with his early film, has no constant nasty scenes made by his more infamous "Anthropophagic" and "Behind the Dark". Ultimately, this is an inconsistent film that cannot capture the viewer in any way. Without a sleaze factor, it becomes very boring. As I said, others have enjoyed this movie, but I found this to be an excellent example of incredibly lazy writing. <br /> <br /> There are some advantages to a movie. Ewa Aulin ("Candy") is in it and she looks pretty hot and often naked. However, the Klaus Kinski icon of the film is completely wasted on the subfield without being attached to the main film. He seems to be bored and does not have the manic intensity he has at his best. The music score is great and there are some short moments of unintentionally funny gore. However, it is a fictitious and pointless film that can be incredibly boring. (3/10)
