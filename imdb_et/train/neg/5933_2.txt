I've been a fan of my first album. This movie is a service to him. The performances, except for one Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson, are just terrible. Martha Wainwright, Nick Cave, Antony and Jarvis Cocker were particularly annoying. Even McGarrigle's nurses destroyed Martha Wainwright's so-called harmony. <br /> <br /> I've never seen my wife come back and walk away from the room, and I found myself fast forwarding through shows to get into a few interview segments that were hard to watch because of heavy camera work. <br /> <br /> There are many who have been able to interpret Mr Cohen's songs, Jennifer Warnes, KD Lang, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville and Willie Nelson, but those people who have been chosen for this performance were just amazing . <br /> <br /> Hopefully there is another attempt to capture Leonard Cohen on a film that illustrates his understanding, talent and intelligence. <br /> <br /> So sad
