I mean, really ... I suddenly lost my sense of humor, or it's just a very bad movie. It's silly, ridiculous and just not funny. I've seen everything. <br /> <br /> As I saw a preview, I knew it wasn't a big movie, I just didn't think it would be so bad. .. <br /> <br /> What happened to the good old days when you could find funny funny lines in any movie? If the actors didn't have to play ridiculous roles, would they be? Now we find ourselves in such movies, Borat, Little Men, Scary Movie 4, where I couldn't find funny parts !! <br /> <br /> Just leave it in the trash <br /> <br /> PS (sorry for my English)
