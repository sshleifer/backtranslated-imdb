I find it hard to believe that someone would put this movie in the same context as the exorcism. When exorcism was subtle and horrible, Stigmata was blunt, clumsy and too shapely. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most visually beautiful films I've seen for a while, but the pictures don't make the patronizing exponential spiral that makes it unbearable. <br /> <br /> My interest in this film was highest when compared to Exorcist, and visiting my official website increased that interest. The website had many stories of "real" stigmas throughout history. The scene of the scene, the film is so obsessed that it wants "reality" that it will initially become comic, and then it is finally hard to see. I began to suspect that a priest studying potential miracles walks into a beauty salon where our future heroine will cut her hair and probably flirt with the priests. <br /> <br /> Plot: A woman who does not believe in God begins to receive Christ's (Stigmata) wounds and is confused and upset. The case is sent directly from the Vatican to the priest. Is Frankie the ship of Satan or Jesus Christ? <br /> <br /> The only miracle in this movie is that it finally ends.
