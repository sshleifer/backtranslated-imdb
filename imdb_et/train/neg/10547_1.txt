I don't remember a movie where I've been less concerned about where these characters come from, what happens to them or where they go. I understand that Hollywood's greatest pastime is watching the navel, but these people are either too despicable or too boring to take time. Because of what is worth, the debate that followed the Key Sunday Cinema series showed that three women showed some redemptive qualities. I disagree.
