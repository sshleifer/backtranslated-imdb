The nature of companies strives to succeed in others. Here is a film that contains elements of the earlier elements of "Drakula" (1931) and "Frankenstein" (1931). In the Germanic city, village leaders believe that vampires (in the form of bats) have caused recent deaths with bloodless victims. Even if it is Universal (and in the Bronson Caves!), This is a line of poverty; it is not fair to compare them with earlier, more expensive and better films. <br /> <br /> Known and fascinating main titles (which must be Mischa Bakalienikoff) from music to music. but a well-done opening sequence, we are looking forward to the arrival of Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye to give us a good 30-year mystery film. Unfortunately, this does not happen. This is disappointing. <br /> <br /> We get a little more than the formal elements of such movies, but the slow pace, the low budget, not enough Dwight Frye, the Maude Eburne (aunt Gussie) excess presence and assumes that Lionel Atwill (dr von Niemann) needs human blood or how he exhibits his servant Emil (Robert Frazier) very clearly ever. <br /> <br /> Don't look at the technical color Dr. X '(1932) - which also marks Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray, but as father and daughter - before I watched it; For comparison, this is an Oscar winner. So look at this first. Structurally, "Vampire Pill" is still not so good. It plods with too much talk or unnecessary comic relief without focusing heavily on vampiric villainy. <br /> <br /> In addition to "Dr. X" and "Mystery of Waxes" (both 1932 and Fay Wray), Lionel Atwill's most famous performances are like one of Frankenstein's sons (1939) and Moriarity's Sherlock Holmes and secret ". Weapon" (1943) Dwight Frye steals all his manic scenes in Dracula (1931) "Young Lovers" is Melvin Douglas and Fay Wray a nice kiss, but that's it. (1932) and Fay can drag Joel McCrea '' The Most Dangerous Game '(1930), then his classic' screaming 'in 1933. There wasn't too much time, money, and rewriting for this movie to better introduce Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye's talents and chemistry. Unfortunately, this hardly disappointing movie only gets 4.
