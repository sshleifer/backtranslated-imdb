Just a warning ... This is the worst movie I've been seeing for years ... I couldn't look it up ... It's a waste of time ... I'm really sorry about Snips because he's finished in this movie. There's not really much to say there. Terrible action, incredibly bad lines, story, everything. The only reason I would like to watch this movie is if you really want to see how the movie shouldn't be. Just to tell you one scene: the police are looking for a snipe and they surround the building with helicopters and cars;
