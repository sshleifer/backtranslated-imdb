Only the fact that the cover is a drawing, like those old B-films, should give you a warning about the quality of this film. But this is not a B movie. It's a D movie! <br /> <br /> There are no known actors and animals - WOW - this is the worst data storage you have made in the last two decades. <br /> <br /> You almost never see the SCAAARY sabretooth shown on the front panel. You just hear people yelling, bleeding, and dying, and you can sometimes see your teeth or tiger paw. It's so amateur! Maybee, what to see, just because it's so bad. Give it to a friend and say, "This is the best movie I've ever seen and wait for their reaction." The film is weak to give it Spoiler Alert! That's SPOILER.
