The Polish expert must be feminist, because he finds that "Young Catherine" is an excellent film and historically accurate. Nothing can be further from the truth. As a practicing Russian historian for many years, I took an exception with YC at almost every step, especially his politically correct depiction as a boss who moved Russia with one hand to dominate. The Truth? He was sent to St.Petersburg only to wife and mother and found that he had to "survive" with dvoriane, boyar and army to survive. As long as he did not contest them, he was able to allow his cultural desires (by filling Hermitage's art cards, etc.). There is so much evidence that he was not "big", but the evidence in this postmodern revolution is not very popular. YC is just a costume drama, a bit fluffy by Ted Turner, like "Peter the Great" in 1986. Another example of how badly Russia is depicted in the West.
