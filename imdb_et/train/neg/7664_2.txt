Spoilers front, but is it really important? Have you ever read a movie review that consists entirely of questions? Could it be? Why did ancient civilization bury objects all over the world? Why has this question never been answered? Why did the original text crawl? Why should a nun (she seemed nice!) Crazy over 20 orphans? Have you ever had a gold mine in the center of Vancouver? Why does one of the gold mine shafts leave the front of the orphanage? Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly appear for Christian Slater's apartment? (Or did I just answer my question?) Why would even a non-archaeologist bang open a precious solid goldfish with a butterfly? Why do today's computers display green-Tron-mesh meshes with small "shocks"? And should all the film clocks be digital? Why is there no point in this film?
