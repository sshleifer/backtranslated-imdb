99.999% pure crap. And the second 0.001% was a short moment where I thought the blonde chick would dress. No. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was legendary bad. Action was sucked and there was no sex (the aforementioned blonde chick is modestly dressed, unfortunately the whole film). The CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst in the film, and the anachronisms were numerous and outstanding. The action was mediocre even from Ben Cross and Marina Sirtis, the only "names" in this movie. And Marina Sirtis seemed really bad. <br /> <br /> I have seen that high school is more capable of producing. This is a movie that MST3K succeeded. You should roll in Sci-Fi to allow it to evaporate in the air.
