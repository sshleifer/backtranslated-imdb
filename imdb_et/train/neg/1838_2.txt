"Envy" is bad for many reasons. Yes, there are unlikely signs. This is not a problem. They are unlikely and we don't care at all. "The Roses War" was characterized by improbable signs, but due to proper introductions we grew up against our fate, while the introduction of "Envy" is thin, characters are never believable, and the plot only makes things worse <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller is just a repulsive role in my role and I'm a fan of her work most of the time. Stiller fought for it to be released directly on video and now I see why. The film suggests that he is "the best friends" with Jack Black, but within the first five minutes, film material is still appearing to be still hateful of Stiller. I thought it would be a one-sided relationship (la "The Cable Guy"), but it's never, but Stiller insists that he is his "best friend", and I felt confused when he seemed to treat Black well, "poo." The film's plot is ridiculous, but it doesn't matter because it should be an exaggerated story of morality. Unfortunately, the message is confusing. Walken gives a good result, but Black is key and annoying (and I find it very funny). No, it's not a terrible movie, but I still can't believe that Barry Levinson ("Rainy Man", "Sleepers") is responsible for it - it's not one of the slowest movies of all time, but it can certainly be a lot better. I want Va-Poo-Rize to exist - so we can get this movie forever.
