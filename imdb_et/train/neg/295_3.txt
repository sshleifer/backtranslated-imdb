I got this movie because I worked in a movie shop so I got a free rent. It came in and the cover saw it well. Hot chick with a gun, well, I look at it. <br /> <br /> Oh man, bad move. It was so terrible, I spent half of the movie, looking fast to get the nudity that was minimal. I think MAYBE has three partial nudity. <br /> <br /> Pleasant dialogue, dirty violence, bad excuses for characters. I feel bad about putting this movie down because I know it was made for a cheap budget, but it was also "Clerks" and it became a cult class and a franchise. <br /> <br /> 2/10
