The script is so ridiculous ... this in turn makes the characters' lines hard and unreal and not to believe. The sentences are repetitive - "my dear little goddess" and the small variations of that line that comes to mind ... and it's just a sloppy soap opera dialogue. <br /> <br /> Even worse, music is so WRONG! In addition, the main theme of the blues is terribly odd and completely wrong. And it seems overwhelmed mostly because the instruments, texture and layout of this theme never change, even if the scene's emotional context does. <br /> <br /> Then, when it appears, it will look like a painful thumb as the main transition from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> The ripple of music and the fact that the writer would have written music for soap or sitcom - a small budget for the 80's Canadian channels - and it feels like we would always be on a commercial yarn. <br /> <br /> It is so unsuccessful, there is a lot of redundancy and it is a real stretch that so many of these characters use only one type of NY accent - a thick Bronx accent. I don't know if this is the limited capacity of the participants to know just one * NY accent - or is it a question of the director's ability to notice such an outstanding anomaly. <br /> <br /> In the end, this amateur script has its wires, which makes this whole movie ... hit. If a foundation is shaky and unstable, it is not possible to build it without being erroneous, damaging, and uneven.
