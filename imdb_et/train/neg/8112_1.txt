Hanna-Barbera sucks for another famous asset. Violence is weakened, stories are formal, animation is bad, music is unpleasant and repetitive, and frankly, this show is not just funny. <br /> <br /> At that time, HB put each of its series in the same clich√© situations, regardless of whether it is a comic book world or not. So Popeye and Bluto will appear on a recurring segment like cavemen ("Hi! Popeye is popular and flinstones are popular. Put 'em together and you can't stay!"). Likewise, Olive Oyl and Goon are obviously a regular segment of the "Private Benjamin" pendant that holds them as new army recruits. Seriously! Why? Adding an irritation factor is public service announcements in every episode (standard practice during cartoons, but still annoying). Popeye reads his nephew in a safe way to cross the street, recycle and - are you ready for that? - Smoking Dangers! (I swear I won't do it.) <Br /> <br /> It is worth looking at only once to get the new Fleischer shorts. Otherwise, avoid any cost.
