this is probably the worst thing I've ever seen in the movie. and what is pain. the leading woman of this film has some kind of nose-figuration and it is almost impossible to look at any time period without it being fixed to the nose. On Sunday afternoon you can go to your local grocery store and find some 50 skilled, better-looking leading ladies. I made a regrettable mistake in renting this movie because he had a "cool" DVD bag. This film looks like it's just a class project for a group of multimedia students at a local college of technology. I would have spent one hour or so watching this movie on public television ... at least the special effects are better and the people there are more attractive than anyone you see in this movie
