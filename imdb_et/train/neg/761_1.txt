Absolute garbage. The reason this is so terrible is not because it was different from the formula, but because the plot was simply pathetic. <br /> <br /> The alleged star did nothing to deal with the incident - or anyone else - it was just routine police work. Totally annoying. <br /> <br /> You sat down to the end, hoping to twist - and you had nothing but great disappointment. <br /> <br /> There was so much potential that a relative appeared in robbery. Can Lti's personal involvement eventually cloud his decision? <br /> <br /> All obvious signs were from strangers. Certainly, the genius, like Category C, is constantly talking to the wrong spouse, to gradually reveal a notorious plot that includes the recorder playing the dictaphone, while the masked groom surprises the bride, hides the body and plants with subtle clues. It could have been good. It was a complete waste of time.
