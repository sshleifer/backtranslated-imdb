I rented this movie to see what could be a bloody, non-stop action movie and got this too sentimental and super cheap low-budget action drama that puts Kickboxer out like Die Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and when Lou rescues Rebi, he gets off his head, which is easily one of the worst consequences. Vietnamese scenes hitting someone's backyard, I swear! Lou is now brain damaged and Reb and her live together and have a bar. Super homoerotic. Lou is convinced that he will fight for the cage for money and Reb goes to the killing to get him back. There are no good fighting scenes, the dice are two inches away from a person. Character personalities change within seconds. One man is bad and on the next scene he is good. Acting is terrible and music is somewhat sentimental Frank Stallone's sounding song that makes you sick. I hated this movie.
