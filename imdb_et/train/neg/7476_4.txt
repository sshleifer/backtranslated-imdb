Evil Aliens owes Peter Jacksons early films in Bad Taste and Braindead. I have to admit that I don't enjoy these movies especially and I say the same. Jake West is a director who obviously does not have the inspiration and decides to steal those he looks at. I lost a greater number of Hollywood films, especially James Camerons Aliens. The amount of blood and gore shown here is not funny, the last end of the film is tired. Perhaps it would have worked better as a short film. The participants are poor, the direction is weak and the plot is not there. I see what the director was trying to do, the respect he was trying to make, the respect he was trying to pay, but the others did just as much as he did here. 4/10
