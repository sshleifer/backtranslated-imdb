This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I can't express how bad it is. I just wanted to accidentally just kill myself several times so that the pain would end. Instead of seeing the movie in acid, I recommend you know at least some of the pain without any scars. <br /> <br /> I had such great expectations when I read the back of the DVD When I first added that Jesus was following them, I was so excited ... then I finally wanted to kill myself. I think of a twenty-three minute introduction to the most disturbing characters in cinema history ... JUST PAIN! Monkeys would have been able to change this in the trash. At least they would have thrown out the stools and some of the garbage blurred. It would have been that no horror had been seen. <br /> <br /> It wasn't that I didn't get jokes, but the fact that they were not just funny, they repeated themselves like 20 times. Probably nothing is funny if you don't see it as a million times. <br /> <br /> Don't under any circumstances see it. People have rated "Manos' hands as fate" as the world's worst movie. I've seen it and I agree that it's bad ... but ALAS is just the second worst. "Fat outputs on the bus" are much worse.
