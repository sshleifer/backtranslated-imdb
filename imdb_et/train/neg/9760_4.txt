The film crew did not have good access to the occupied territories, so filming was dominated by Israel. I was almost confronted with the mothers' opposite view. The mother of Israel lost a child who had the opportunity to live enormously happy. A Palestinian mother lost a child who only had the chance to live in hatred and despair. With such completely different perspectives, no meeting had any real chance of thinking. The word "peace" did not have the same meaning for everyone. The peace for the Palestinians was freedom. Peace against Israel was security. With such an abyss, is such a movie really worth it? I ended up feeling I was looking at meaningless propaganda - both sides were not convincing.
