What is this? Canada produced a zombie that I haven't heard before. The deadman is working on the body of a recently dead young man. This allows for a longer kickback that shows how the man got there. Basically she went to the cemetery with her friends on the 13th century and raised her dead thanks to her stupid song. Cut back to the morgue, where our corpse lives back and kills the body and the owner (who gets his eyes out). Final WTF? Shot is a funeral home owner with a straight jacket and shouts, "I'm not crazy!" Amazingly, he has his eyeballs back. <br /> <br /> In just 58 minutes, this zombie cinema is definitely a weird one. It looks a lot longer, but put me in a trance where I couldn't watch. The film also has one of them when you see this picture, turn it off the screen. This is an old man who gets sick in the theater (prophetic?) And when he appears (only twice), the blood starts to flow. Scenes are pretty damn over time. There's a big gaffe where the zombie starts shoveling the girl's right hand, but - if she pulls the fake hand inside the frame, it's the left hand.
