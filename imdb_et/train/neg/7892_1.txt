It started with an interesting assumption. I always like the civil war and the ancient secret societies. The more the movie arrived, the more I realized it was the best film B. In the last half it quickly became a C-film, then D, then F, then "I wish it wasn't renting so I could put it in the microwave!" . I can't say that action in all cases was terrible, just the most. But writing ... I never read this book. Maybe the book is well written. The scenario was written by a 10-year-old. It was ridiculously low, the dialogue was uncomfortable and uninteresting, the characters were about as interesting as the 5-kilo fertilizer spreader. I really hated this movie, just like my wife. I am a Christian and I have no problem with films that promote or support Christianity. This movie made it a great service. Terrible, terrible, worthless. If you liked it, I recommend Superman 4.
