This movie is one of the worst comedy films I've ever seen. I hate these explosions of the Napoleon dynamite. Just facing people is already a humor in low light. Make a new one once. All these new comedies are just terrible. And when coming out of SNL, Andy Samberg is not ready for the lead. I hope he can get it behind this terrible movie. And the character of Arnetts is just bad. Hey Will, did you read the script. The plot is really the worst. Now you tell me if this is weird. (this is a movie) Rod Kimble's step father Frank is dying and the family needs $ 50,000 for heart surgery, so Rod plans to make a tremendous jump for Frank to raise money. The only way Rod can win Frank and prove his masculinity. Yeah, it's a movie to tell me you would spend $ 7.00 to see this nonsense! <br /> <br /> 3/10 Simply Creepy <br /> <br />
