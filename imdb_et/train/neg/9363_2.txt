In this movie, there are some fatal mistakes in how someone could walk through a large safe medical facility with an open back door is incredible. Then the same person just walks out of the facility and enters dr. In the office, it's just bad writing or bad editing. Very very predictable film. <br /> <br /> I am not sure how this movie was, except when it was filmed in Canada, and probably it came from the state budget. I have to say that the person playing Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a good job. <br /> <br /> If you are not really bored and have nothing else to watch on television, I would say it kills for a while, but otherwise this is a movie that no actor wants to continue.
