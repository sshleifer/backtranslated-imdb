I have grown up with the whole life of Scooby, my father grew up with a scooby doo. We just looked at this first episode of travesty, which calls itself Shaggy and Scooby. Which planet is Warner Bros, which allows it to get into the air. My younger sister could have improved these signs. The story could have been better written by the cousins ​​of my 3-year-old twins (who are also fans of Scooby Doo). Scooby and Shaggy are not just !!!!! if somebody, but Casey Kasem makes Shaggy's voice, then just don't work people !!!! trust me. <br /> <br /> This program was disgraceful. What's New Scooby Doo is much better. Why change winning format. Leave this garbage and go back to the real Scooby
