I'm a big fan of Lucio Fulc; many of his Giallo and splatter clips are among all my favorites, but this is a very subpar for a TV movie and not what I have been expecting from a great Italian director. The film is not interesting, like some of Fulci's more tame Giallo, or like most of his cult classic; leaving it missing in both major areas and ultimately ensuring that the film is not very good. The film works from a plot that has been used many times before, but it is still an idea that there is always the opportunity to draw an interesting story precisely because it focuses on the topic of succession, which is the ultimate unknown. This film focuses on Giorgio Mainard; a man who is not quite well-liked and after he dies of visible stomach bleeding, there are not many people who are saddening him. This means that his ghost is trapped somewhere between life and succession, and so he decides to try the bottom of his death and his only ally in this endeavor is his daughter. <br /> <br /> The video that I saw proudly announcing this movie is "HP Lovecraft Style" and is one of the most blatant attempts to ever sell a movie. Something even doesn't like the story of a great horror writer, and the reason for this sign is that it is a title similar to Stuart Gordon / Lovecraft's "From Beyond", which is much better. The film is clearly Italian and the score is pretty good. Unfortunately, Fulci has seen that he can roast each scene positively - and so the topic quickly becomes annoying. The plot plays really boring and most scenes are simply related to a ghost that is desperately trying to find things, or a daughter puts her doubts on her family members. This movie was made for an Italian TV, so it's no surprise that it's all annoying. Zombies are a little gore and a nightmare; but it is not Fulci, which we all know and love. In general, this film is extremely mediocre and not Fulci's talents. Not worth the effort if you are not a Fulci graduate.
