Koen Wouters is a flamish singer and performer. In the early nineties, he also tried out films. But this incredible junk created his actors' career forever. He also graduated from the Dutch actress Nada van Nie, who has been a TV-female programmer and programmer. I saw it (almost empty) in the theater because I used to be a fan of the Koen Wouters, Clouseau band. I'm so sorry to spend the money. It looks cheap, it is a terrible story and it is badly filled in any way. Some people think it's so bad that it's funny. I'm not one of them. I found it just a waste of time and money.
