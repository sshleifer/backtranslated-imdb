I think scarecrows are horrible, so it's a pity that this movie doesn't make them any more. <br /> <br /> Kobar robbers make an extraordinary parachute from a plane into a huge field with pearls. One of them goes missing during the looting, and the rest of him goes on inexplicably with the bad peasants. Acting is hammy and peacemaking (as they move) unimpressive. On the positive side, the director gets out of static terror. Just as Alfred Hitchcock says, "The bomb goes under the table and it is a surprise. We know the bomb is under the table, but not when it goes out and it's tight."
