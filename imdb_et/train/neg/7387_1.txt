The DVD was a joke, the first few minutes of sound was terrible with the non-synchronized sound and the Segals voice wasn't even his !!!! Pathetic! If the audio synchronization was better in about 5 minutes, poor plots, lines and actors should get another job because the film company is not where one of them should be. <br /> <br /> Although Segal had the first jokes in the early days and should be embarrassing for her and the company that made it. <br /> <br /> When Segal was the one who handled it, he would return to the other half for a show because he never has such a talent. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete confusion for everyone involved in its production and shame on anyone who saw it. I turned it off after about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I ask my money back at Buster! Mark Ontario, Canada
