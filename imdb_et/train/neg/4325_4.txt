The second holiday series is easily the least enjoyable because Clark Griswold won the whole European family. <br /> <br /> The tasteless, humorous belt that worked so well for the first time practically nonexistent. This guilt is definitely the director Hackerling, who is obviously almost as good as Harold Ramis and a very uninspiratory script that has only a handful of decent lines scattered around. <br /> <br /> Casting does what they get; Chevy Chase injects some form of life into the process, but it's just not enough and the very funny Eric Idle is completely unsuccessful in English. Some potentially fun moments will not be played in full and the viewer will usually get worse. All the images of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost not funny (like how SOOO is polite). <br /> <br /> Apart from a few scenes, it is hardly ridiculous and ends with one complete stroke. But if you're a Chevy Chase fan (like me), the movie is traceable, but no more.
