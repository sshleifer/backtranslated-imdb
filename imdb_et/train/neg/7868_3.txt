I've seen many Guy Maddin movies and liked most of them, but it literally gave me a headache. Editing by John Gurdebeke is too frenetic and, in addition to the tournament ranking, which shows a series of lines to view one item, does nothing but disturbs the ability of participants to communicate with the audience. <br /> Another thing I didn't like about this movie was that it seemed more brutal than Maddini's earlier works - although his films have always had dark elements, his sympathy for the symbols gave the films overwhelmingly a sense of humankind. It seemed more tough about harshness. <br /> <br /> Since I have to add more text lines before IMDb accepts my review, I mention that the actor who plays "Guy Maddin" manages his facial expressions to entice.
