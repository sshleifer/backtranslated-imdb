it seemed like a strange combination of Withnail and I room that had a view .. sometimes it worked, at other times it didn't. The tragedy that they changed their name to US release though .. Keep Apidistra Flying is much better than nothing in the title of Merry War. acting was okay, the script was okay .. generally it was a mediocre movie.
