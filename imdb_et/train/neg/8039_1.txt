This pointless film is a piece and boring as repetitions of the plenary. All people who want to see a big, exciting and cool horror movie should not even think of looking at this pointless work. F - in my opinion. I have one question, what did they mean? Let's make a list: 1) Bad Script 2) Bad Script 3) Bad Script 4) Bad Behavior 5) Bad Behavior and Last but not Least Bad Script. I mean, I don't like every movie, but I was disappointed when I watched it. This movie must be disabled in the box, locked and pressed into the sea. So please do nothing like this, please, please !!!!
