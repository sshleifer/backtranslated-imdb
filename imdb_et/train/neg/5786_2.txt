If you look at it now and hear the language here, it is amazing that it was rated "PG", but that's for you the 1970s evaluation system. Peter Falk leaves the name of the Lord in vain for the first six minutes of this film! But few people think they are offensive, and certainly not the ones who make the films, or the people who "rate" them. <br /> <br /> There is a clue about how this movie can be: Falk, Peter Boyle Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gena Rowlands, and Paul Sorvino are not exactly the actors you can't find in "The Music Of Music". <br /> <br /> I like the movies and many director movies by William Friedkin, but this script doesn't start and it's just too much "Sleazy" from the 70s to feel it visually and audibly. For those who loved Falk's "Columbos" television, it must come as a shock to hear how he uses as much embarrassment as in films. This is by no means the only case.
