If this film was a comedy, I would have given it 10. Oh, my beginning? Put it this way - I've seen a lot of terrible horror movies, but it makes Troll 2 an exquisite Ryan. Just as a group of porn movie makers decided to make a horror film, changed their thoughts in the middle production, and decided to do comedy, then he went back to horror and then decided that they should have just porn (soft). All this movie is just terrible: a musical score (someone lets Yamaha's keyboard invented), script, director, cinematography, actor. There are not just words to describe it. Wait, yes, there is: Holy $ *%!
