Germans all stand out open and mow with the machine. The good guys will never die unless it is dramatic. "Plot" has as many holes as ridiculous. (Where did German soldiers go when they rolled the tank towards the train? Erik Estrada? Please!) And the whole idea of ​​hijacking the train? How is it moral? The Germans know where you are going, he doesn't like you leaving the road and driving away! What waste. I would squeeze myself with the head hammer 10 times, then I have to sit it again. I mean seriously that FELT likes it, as it did in the 60s, but it was produced in 88! 1988 !! Team A is more credible than this terrible excuse for the movie. Look at it only when you need a good laugh. This movie is for Tele Sevalan, which Green Beret was for John Wayne.
