I'm glad to read so many negative comments about the plot of Tritter. Everybody I talk to says the same thing. They like House's terrible nature and intelligence, but they really do not like the integrity of this continuing plot. It covers the actual nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry with the police. It must have a more caring nature than a hospital conviction. It also seems that Tritter has many questionable legal aspects in reality. He alone cannot freeze accounts and has the right to stop prescribing doctors to patients. Much vindictiveness he shows is also hurt very sick patients in the hospital and it is not a good storyline to imagine. I voted terribly for the episode, not because it is the story itself, but when you insert a Trittor piece, it turns me off and the rest of the plot damages it. People say they don't want to see the story anymore. Please change it. Get the Tritter out.
