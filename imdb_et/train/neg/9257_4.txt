If you hope something new, you have chosen the wrong movie. Who can think that a movie that is a virtual replay of this pre-recorders can be good. Perhaps the manufacturer and perhaps the director, but hopefully they were not serious about doing this thing. This whole movie is like creating the first third movie DVDs, but changing the actors. BHHAAAAD.
