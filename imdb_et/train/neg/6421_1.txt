I'm surprised by some of this movie's review. The only place that seems to be true is RottenTomatoes.com. This movie is terrible. The plot is very lazy. It's also not scary. People out there who think that because he celebrates Sarah Michelle Geller, she has somehow forgotten Grudge. This film is rather dark water, except it is even more predictable and slower. I was very disappointed with this movie. It didn't scare me, nor did I care. Let's face it, this type of plot is dead at this stage, eg. Dead Attempt to Contact Live - Dragonfly, Located Below, Ghost Story, Dark Water, Darkness, The Changeling etc.etc. It seems to me that the only people who write original horrors today are Japanese and Korean. Such films coming out of Hollywood are cynical exercises of money without respect for the viewer. They're just cut
