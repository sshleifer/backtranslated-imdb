This program is really overpriced. A detective, like Danny Pino's hot-headed character, would have been put on a rubber gun for years. The whole team consists of celebrating egomaniacs who, according to the 2007 standards, appreciate people whose actions go decades ago. Every Vietnamese veteran mark they have ever had has proven to be a killer unless it was another Vietnamese veteran. There was only one black murderer, and he was put on his white boss. The only Spaniard killer was a "racer" who killed another Spaniard to design a Spaniards Street Boy for a crime that (naturally) committed two rich white children. What a lot of propaganda. Hey, scriptwriters: minorities and poor people are also murdering. Only this exhibition has the highest class of murderers' whites. <br /> <br /> Moreover, arresting people in their 70s, 80s and 90s for 50-60 years ago is a joke. No real life DA dies of murder because it means that the country will remain on its humongous doctor bill until they finally hit. The state will make its families and insurance companies benefit. The prosecutor simply accuses them of inadvertent killing and does not serve the day. The only really old criminals who go to prison are either the indicators of organized crime or the former Nazis, whose high-quality convictions increase their career in DA.
