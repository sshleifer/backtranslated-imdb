Anyone familiar with my review of my online movie database knows that I am a dirty bastard from time to time. There are many movies that I don't like, which for some pointless reason I felt like a desire to watch. However, if anyone wants to know what the worst film I've ever seen, look no further than Transylvania 6-5000. Undoubtedly, it will take no. 1 terrible movie. I can't believe I did this clunker from start to finish! <br /> <br /> This is obviously meant to capture Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein taste, but where this movie was a funny horror movie tradition, it's a desperate and erroneous attempt to laugh embarrassingly weak material. Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr are ashamed to be a pair of journalists in Transylvania today (maybe they realize early that they are doomed). During the studies, they came up against the main monsters that were against all the previous horrors of horror, such as vampires, werewolves and mummies. <br /> <br /> Anyone who succeeds in dreading this movie until it is over can pray that it will drive their hearts to ease them from torture of boredom. It marks a career for the lowest of all parties and proves that if comedy fails in a great way, it will lead to terrifying entertainment.
