The worst De Niro Scorsese co-operation in this horrible agonizing violent redundancy. Scorsese is completely away from this film because this spooky, stubborn sudden phone ringing and door clips that seem ridiculous and embarrassing come from such a master. There's a lot of wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced. Nick Noltie plays a wimpiest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can protect anyone! De Niro's psychotic Bowden is nothing more than a typical psychological killer of the 90's movie. The early scene of De Niro and Lewis is very uncomfortable and the climax will continue and we will all have to be more than tired of being a psycho-stalker who never dies. One of my most terrible movie experiences. Rent the original 100 times better. <br /> <br />
