I'm discussing right now whether I should even watch the "poppycock" movie. They had a pretty interesting idea, buried with a movie set and that was it. So far, this incomprehensible confusion is not a real story. There's a buried set, some wolves running amok, an amulet, and a host of bad actors attacked by a wolf that is masked by whatever it is. I would have forgotten that if I had a good idea of ​​taking out the nonsense, dune buggy chase, some really bad C.G.I, some incredibly foolish dialogues, worse C.G.I and the hero are fighting on paper. After the original idea of ​​the film, this film has absolutely zero values. My error resuming tracking. - MERK
