Of course, it's going to the west, but the title changes it from the usual west. Instead, she's a Sheriff movie. Don't make a mistake, though it's a bad movie about a woman's sheriff. He becomes a sheriff when his wife is suppressed; he's just a little irritated about it. His main goal is to go after the villain who is also a woman, but the villain hires him to kill him. So this happens, the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. Absolutely stupid, because all the people killed in this movie have a new sheriff. He had more than a few chances behind the killer, but I think he liked it not. The killer is also after the mayor for personal reasons, which is also quite stupid. This movie is very boring and not really worth it ... it's not one of those better MST3000 episodes. I can't imagine anyone seeing it without them, because it would make it much more painful. Corman is a low budget director, but even he should know better if people go from one place to another.
