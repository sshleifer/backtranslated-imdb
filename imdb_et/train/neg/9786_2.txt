OK, I bought this movie from Woolworths for my friend's joke on his birthday, because the front panel had sexual zeal. <br /> <br /> But we decided to look at it anyway. Just for fun. <br /> <br /> And I'm sorry, but this must be one of the worst films in history. <br /> <br /> It started right and we thought "Ok it may actually be OK". But after about 10 minutes we were wrong. <br /> <br /> It started when the "mysterious color baller" turned out to be the most obvious, Scouser / Australian (I say it because he had an accent that could not be detected) who acted, I would just say was exhausting. <br /> <br /> Then it came to an end and by that time we had all lost the will to live. Finals of color balls. The only thing I did about this plot is that they didn't really win, but annoying enough that they won by default. <br /> <br /> And I know it has nothing to do with it, but the name the team gave was just terrible. Critical injury. I mean, they could have chosen more awesome names like "Anti-Christ Destroyers" or something. Or what the film should still call.
