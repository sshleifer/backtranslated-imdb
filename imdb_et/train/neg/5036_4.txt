SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) ** / ***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell <br /> <br /> Fifteen-year-old bad girl Melissa is a new desert the city and it won't be long before people around him die. The detective must bring clues to her with the daughter of her good daughter, Nancy Drew, who was played on Friday by 13 alumni Dana Kimmell. Local local Americans are the main suspects because they seem to be disturbing prejudices. These events bring Melissa's sixteenth birthday to the killer. <br /> <br /> This is not too average memorable. It's made for a TV without much scores over the character's own joke that plays a few times. Features like "killer make us a salad form". Install a standard eighties scenario. Marci calls Melissa a bad name, but at the same time they make friendship. Apparently Marci sees how hard it is to fit because Melissa knows how to wear make-up. This film would be hard to press, so that the main character would be fifteen and the director would enter him several free. The social comment of the Indians was not developed enough to take it seriously. I'm too surprised by the pretty high rating of this movie. Both the sweet sixteenth and Ed Hunt had a bloody birthday that could take advantage of the festive tradition of creating birthday kills during this time, but I do not feel it was successful. However, on the bright side that releases such dark movies on this DVD, there is hope that others will follow.
