Imagine that a true Hitler, who was the master of propaganda and speech, would have been such a moor when Carlyle depicted him in this film. <br /> <br /> No one would have followed him, even in a desperate, unemployed man in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> It's just Hollywood cardboard propaganda itself, which is hidden in 'true history'. <br /> <br /> I regret all who really believed in this show. Carlyle and the manufacturers did not get it right. <br /> <br /> Why was Hitler able to fight so many people across the county for his ideas when we were such a sausage? Why did people follow him to death? By depicting such a loser, they make their movie completely unbelievable. This film is a mixture of old WW2 propaganda and MTV city sales for one of the most important personalities of the last century. Imagine a movie about Churchill, where the director shows her only drunk 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie is shameful and I don't know how they could talk to this dreck like actor Carly.
