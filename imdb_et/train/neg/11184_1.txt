This is really a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I only write it so that some people are watching it. When I have stopped one person from wasting my precious life by watching this movie, I die happily. <br /> <br /> Endlessly boring, though, as he marks Al Pacino, I was frustrated to think that there was something interesting at any time. happens. Then they rolled out the credit and I realized that I had an incredible look at this incredible fire. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this movie has achieved the same score as IMDb (over 5 stars when I saw the vote). Are you voting ironically? <br /> <br /> Please, please, don't watch this movie!
