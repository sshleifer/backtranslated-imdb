It is unbelievable that the countless crimes that have been discovered and unequivocal on the Marxist threshold, from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag Archipelago to the Khmer Rouge Cultural Revolution, are still found among the admirers of Communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and are still in favor of propaganda.

Needless to say, neither his crimes nor his psychotic announcements were included. Because both the director and the actor expect the viewers to remain through this seemingly intermediate propagandist film, their tunnel vision of their object of worship is shown.
