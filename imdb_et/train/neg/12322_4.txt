As the general content of these comments seems to be, the film has some stunning animation (I watched it on blu-ray), but it really doesn't correspond to the actual depth. <br /> <br /> First of all, all the characters are pretty dull. I got a hint of a sort of Laputa situation between Agito, Toola and the main antagonist Shunack. Perhaps maybe my mind was going and it was wishful thinking (Laputa is my favorite anim√©, the original Engilsh dub). The characters are not really loved and, as mentioned in some other post, they love extraordinarily fast, leaving the poor old Minka jealous and rejected (he loves Agito who seems to ignore it). However, he seems to forgive Toola immediately without explaining another change of heart if it makes the end a bit happier. There is also a serious lack of explanation. Like who are the Druids really? Are they people? and who are strange women / girls who stand with them and spend the forest? Nothing explains why they are there and how they can give people the great tools they need. Plants from the moon do not fill the gap. It is almost like a strange version of the day of the triphides. <br /> <br /> And who is calling the Tool? why does it bother if it can't be explained? <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie, but I found a plot where it's not as close as a movie like Ghost Shell or having a real character like those of Miyazaki. I don't mind watching it, but I don't want to buy it yet. My advice? Give it a go if you have a couple of hours to spare but borrow or buy it cheaply! Maybe if your new movie is filming and you don't have much to go, you will enjoy it. Certainly it is visually pleasing.
