I bought this movie on blu-ray because it allowed great visions and music. I was also a big fan of a similar movie ... Baraka. The film is very much designed after Baraka, a wide-angle, very similar camera that has been recorded for a long time in every frame. Even some scenes were identical (on a traffic street). Baraka spoke of a great story, combining nature, anthropic environments, spirituality and world horrors in an attractive way and with great music, this movie jumping off the punch without including a complete story, mediocre musical score, and then. ... POOF, it's over! I thought there must be some mistake! World History? Half of the movie is Egyptian and the landscape (looks like Arizona, but I didn't check). Seriously people, it's terrible, rent it if you need to, but don't buy it. Filmmakers should be ashamed of this.
