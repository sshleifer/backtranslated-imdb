It's really very bad. Lamas shows how another actor acts on his speed. But what deserves to be looked at is the scene where OJ angers his infamous colleague because if they kill, when the jukebox plays a song with a lyric, "I got the evidence for you!". (I like to hear the rest of the lyrics - attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren, but I couldn't find it on iTunes). Talk to the future for viewing ... Too funny for words. The rest of the movie is forgotten. Score and songs are more interesting than script. Continue on. What raises the question why they continue. My understanding was that foreign trade controls many of these B-films. Not much to talk about the habits of watching the world.
