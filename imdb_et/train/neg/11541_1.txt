This movie is the worst I've seen in the last 5 years. Surprisingly, the brilliant actors like the two main characters of this film have promised to act in such worthless peace. The film is a genre of rape / beating and revenge. The couple has gone to the party and upside down they hit the deer and he went out to finish when he came to a bad full jeep. He did not go into his car, but was beaten and beaten when he was trying to drive his engine on a treacherous engine and he was raped. Then she is in her father's house and one of the bad guys is her neighbor so she took the shot and wanted to kill her ... So stupid! Bellow Hollywood! He was against this revenge, but "He's raped" "They laugh at him," so he must kill them all ... But when inside the house, he was pleased by pushing the rifles in malignant ancestors and going away when he went crazy and Fill the bad boy. Personally, I think the director will stop making money before it finishes because the movie ends before they meet someone else who is involved in this rape and that isn't a big surprise, because the sponsor has probably seen it and wanted to withdraw their money. LoL This film is not even for people who enjoy rape, because they don't see what they're looking for ... This director should be banned ... It's annoying that this garbage peace has been made by a British cinematographer personally I like it and that's why I watched it. Don't do it yourself, you have better things to do to watch the stupid scenario ...
