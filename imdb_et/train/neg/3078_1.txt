I didn't think the horror comedy on both sides was so abysmal impossible ... really terrible. The fact that it does not take itself seriously (usually a good thing) is against it, mainly because the actors are so trees that you really swear that they read smart cards. Nevertheless ..... the MST3K version always has a laugh.
