I don't think they did this movie. Completely unnecessary. The first movie was okay. But there was no need for a sequel, certainly not after the TV series, which was already the first movie. This film looks like a soap opera. Writing is so bad, it's quite simple. Jokes don't come over, the actor is flat, it's like soap, it's not in every direction. Behind the first film was a good emotional back. Each sign had a small arc. It was very simple then, but somehow it worked and I saw the value of this movie. But this time, there is no single story. Characters are the dullest stereotypes and nothing interesting happens. One good thing: The Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleire's son is pretty well cast. It was the creative success of these films. I hear they have already taken another TV series next to "Team Spirit 2", but please God, don't let them do the third feature ...
