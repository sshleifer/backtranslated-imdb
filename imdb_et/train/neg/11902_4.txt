The hysterical thing about this film is that, according to the director, he finds it difficult to find a distributor in the US because most of those who looked at it could not agree with seemingly contradictory messages of Christianity and American anger. The idea that someone sees it as a religious film anyway is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Because the mission minister prays homeless or wants someone "speed" to make it a "Christian" movie? It could be interpreted as being really a glimpse of religion in "many lands" with all of its material surplus, the best organized mission might be to extract the bowl of soup and the Bible verse. Maybe there are many regrettable or fallen? A lot of useless homeless missions? How Much Vietnamese Veterinary Animals? As a masterful "pink" is a rebel-like delusional survivor, do we have to think that America is "many lands" of paranoid patriots? Maybe we have a lot of psychiatric patients? Certainly, we are not concerned about Palestinian politicians about phone calls to the main characters of the film. Of course, if you work in a German homeless shelter, you would be more unhappy about peace in a remote country than your own personal survival because the world knows how Europe is "Plenty" on the continent when it comes to complexity. Indeed, I finally agreed with the title because the United States is "Plenty Land" and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of bad scripts, amateur actors and disassionately directed films. Life is too short and one, even the American, has no "much" time to watch this work.
