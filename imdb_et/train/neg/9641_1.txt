When you watch this movie, are you Fred a Ray fan, you found it on the $ 4.99 shelf in Sunco and you thought I had to lose? and rented the first movie that the finger touched. <br /> <br /> This movie is hysterically bad. It has all the terrible film needs: a scenario that includes jaw-down dialogue and uncomfortable drops in the plot, an unpleasant science that involves psychology and other dimensions, the consistency that seems to travel through ages and space, not just wood, but also seems like that is bounded by invaded, free nudity (not all that you would necessarily ask), and of course the 5-inch monster played by what I expect is a Fred I am a Ray child. <br /> <br /> Below it all is similar to the heart - as if Mickey & Judy had chosen all the neighboring kids to come together and make a monster movie (hey! My father can run it! Yes! johnny's father's hardware store and I know the ex-stripper who can act on it!). <br /> <br /> See what a fool roller is - you know why the final cut of the movie was so dirty. By the way, Biohazard II ... Alien Force is also worth it, but doesn't have the same enjoyable plywood.
