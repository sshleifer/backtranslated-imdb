This movie was exactly what I expected, not big, but not so bad. In my opinion, PG13 movies aren't scary enough, so I already knew I was bored all over the film. Of course, there were terrible things in the hotel room, but something we haven't all seen. I think I didn't like it because I thought there were too many turns; it became old and repetitive. I did not understand whether all the things that Cusack had experienced in the room were real or not. No events explained. The movie just pulls on and when it finally ends, you want to continue, because you still expect someone to tell you what the whole movie was about. What I did was special effects. Moreover, it wasn't much of a joy. Maybe it's just me, but I thought it was below average.
