Anyone who thinks that this movie is not appreciated for their comic gene must have smoked a movie with two stoners. This movie is NOT REDUCED ... it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> There should be no comparisons between this movie and Naked Gun or Airplane, as the last two films are well written and funny. Class Reunion is not one of these things. Unfortunately, this is the potential (good cast, good story), but the good jokes are little and far. Scenes that were supposed to be funny came more annoying than fun. Stoner boys, vampire, blind girl ... Nothing. The only funny character was Delores (the one who sold his soul to the devil). <br /> <br /> The National Lamp has made some very good films (Animal House, Vacation), but it is not one of them. I certainly expected more from John Hughes.
