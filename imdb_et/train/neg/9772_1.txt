Too many cases of violence. <br /> <br /> Film goes from one scene to another and almost every single violence breaks out. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not the one who is under violence and for me the film without the fight is missing. But please, not one after the other. My reaction was not shock or horror, it was, "Here we go again." There is a story between the scenes of violence, but two-thirds of the movie I had turned off was completely turned off and couldn't wait for the end. <br /> <br /> If this is the best thing filmmakers can do, they should find something else related to their unhappy lives, such as making shoes or sending mail.
