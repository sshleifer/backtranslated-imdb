I saw this movie in my premiere at Sundance 09. <br /> <br /> Because American Beauty was a movie that had something to say, I had hope for Towelhead. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, countless movies I've seen at almost ten Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the only Sundance movie I've ever wanted to walk on early. <br /> <br /> The worst problem in Towelhead is that it is obviously a collection of "provocative" concepts of cultural stereotypes, not the drama of an organic person. The scenario comes from Alicia Erian's novel with the same name. Reminiscent of the famous quote by Edith Wharton: I've never felt a novel good enough to be good, despite being adapted to the author's political views. This observation is particularly devastating to Towelhead, because his political views are so old and simple. Whenever it was time for Towelhead's white male roses, black blacks, ironic care of foreign cultures, etc., it was a long time. <br /> <br /> For more details, please refer to any of the many professional reviews available online. Almost everyone appreciates this movie badly and reveals the low and manipulative tissue on which it is based. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, amateur reviewers seem to be more comfortable. When you read the reviews of this and similar sites, you often meet with superlatives: "stunning", "breathtaking", "deep", "shocking" ... It tortures me to read, but it's not surprising to me. Indeed, I have experienced many people who appear to be some books or films dealing with racial, cultural, gender, or sexual issues, very moving, thought-provoking, deep-seated. If you are such a person, rent a towel head and move it. On the other hand, if you set your standards higher, you can safely convey it.
