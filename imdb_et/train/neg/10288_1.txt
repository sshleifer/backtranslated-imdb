First of all I want to say that I love this example !!! But this episode ... this episode takes a look at the whole exhibition. <br /> <br /> I don't know what they were trying to achieve with this episode, but they successfully created the whole series of WORST episodes. br /> <br /> There is no story, everything is chaotic and jokes ..... is a mess. <br /> <br /> How they tried to answer some of the rest of the game. .... For example, "how looks look like" creating this stupid "before ..." ...... is just embarrassing. <br /> <br /> It's clear that writers work out of ideas and it's really too bad.
