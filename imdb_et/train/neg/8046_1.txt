No? Didn't think so! Well, in that case, you have to stay far away, far away from "Do you want to know the secret" because it is only the eleventh pointless "Scream" that has no redemption value. The plot is extremely ridiculous; The characters are awkward fools, the gore factor is trivial and the whole thing is just boring! As you can deduce from the title, this film is mainly inspired by "I still know what you did last summer" because the events take place in a similar environment and the killer's motivation is equally stupid. Why would anyone want to steal junk ideas like "IKWYDLS" is a secret to me anyway. At least this film could depend on Jennifer Love Hewitt's valuable shelf, while the girls in this jealousy are terribly unpleasant besides nonsense. One year after her boyfriend, Beth Morgan, still unsolved, her new adulterous mistress and four more simple students went to Florida to spend her Spring Break vacation in a gorgeous beach house. The killer hasn't been moving all year round, but now he's going to Florida and begins to grind them, leaving the title aside as a business card. You don't really need to be a horror expert to quickly find out what face is hiding inexplicably behind a ridiculous mask and that the writer's attempts to put you on the wrong track are completely embarrassing. Since the plot is so thin, most of the film is a purely irrelevant padding, including the underscores of incompetent Floridia police forces and a 'mysterious' FBI inspector who seem to have a personal result. Slaughter inexplicably takes place under the screen (don't you hate it when it happens?), There's no free R&D. Suffering from such a devil only makes you realize that the pleasant spirit of the 80s slasher is good.
