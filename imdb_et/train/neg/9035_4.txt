Born in the 1960s, I have grown up looking at the "Movies of the Week" in the early 1970s and loved the terrible movies that were routinely shown, including "Crowhaven Farm", "Bad Ronald", "Satan School Girls", "Kolchak Night Stalker ", etc., but it's just plain. This is probably the writer's attempt to use the terrible murders of Manson a few years ago. The movie stars Dennis Weaver "McCloud" and "Duel" celebrity father who takes his family camping on the beach. The family encounters some hippies who decide to terrorize the family for some reason. The reason for this has never been explained and it is hard to swallow Weaver's pacifist attitude. For God, call the police, beat their hell or something, just don't sit there and saddle it. Action is pretty flat, the story is incredible, and so on. Susan Dey sees bikini cute, but that's it. Ignore it when it ever appears on television.
