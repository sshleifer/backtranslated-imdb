ATTENTION: RETURN TO MINORS (1998) Â½ * <br /> <br /> Starring Scott Bakula, Eric Bruskotter, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Haysbert, Jensen Daggett, Written and directed by John Warren 100 Minutes Rated PG-13 (for Language and Violence) <br /> <br /> Blake in French: <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, the new John Warren comedy "MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK TO THE MINORS" is one funny scene. It consists of a sequence in which a bright trainer throws baseball hard behind a wall just to hit it and hit it back and smash it on the face. It's not much, but except for some single liners, it's all that movie you have to offer ... enough said. <br /> <br /> This movie is not only structurally damaged, characteristically undeveloped, predictable, and poorly written, but also just bad. Even non-critical audience members hate this movie with everything they got. It's so familiar that it's just not funny. <br /> <br /> How many times do you have to make the same movie about the movie? In recent years, we saw the same material as "Air Bud: Golden Receiver" and as bad as this movie, it is even worse. At least "Air Bud" was family. "Major League back to minors" is too vulgar for a healthy family to see together on Sunday afternoon. It's too childish for adults. So who is this movie? Teenagers? Elderly? People who are so desperate for entertainment would offer something like that? <br /> <br /> Film, like many others on it, is one of the main points he strives to make: teamwork sweeps everything. Yes, it is and what great morals to try to prove. It is too bad that we have seen so many talents and intelligence so many times that their cheerleaders are men in ballerina costumes. When foolish announcers form their "comedy of friends", which bites one lining to themselves, such as "They suck", "This baby's fast ball is timed with an hour glass," "This man fell for a while to find something he lost - maybe it was his mind, "" Somebody needs a sunset "and" never see the sunset as beautiful as this game. "If the characters are so small that we never know them by name. And if the only hearty lecture room about teamwork is so unknown that it is almost funny. <br /> <br /> "Major League Back to Minors" is so bad; it stops the trit that ends in the middle of the better closing sequence. A good baseball team is on their way back, they will win, and - power goes out. I thought for a moment that this garbage had come to an end, but in reality, this wrong final scene exists only to add minutes to the current time. The film basically consists of a number of independent sketches that throw so many funny jokes that are not funny. There is also another funny line of dialogue with the coach and the player talking to each other about why the outfielder no longer wants to be in that position for a long time. Trainer's answer: "You're too old, too slow and too thick." The player's reaction is to die. But this scene does not make this movie remarkable to you and certainly not worth the money. So here's another terrible enthusiasm for this movie genre, the second one that has been condemned by its script that has failed before seeing it, and the other, which is so familiar, seems like deja vu again. <br /> <br />
