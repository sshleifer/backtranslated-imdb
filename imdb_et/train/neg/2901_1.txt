The fact that Dan has positive comments on IMDb's real life makes me realize that their spammers are hard to work with trying to get people to watch this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I have no words, no idea where to start describing a really horrible movie where I sat last night - Dan Real Life. The characters of Steve's previous films made me believe that I felt something about my character and enjoyed the dialogue, but like other posters, I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so natural, the family was this cookie cutter Walton's family and the movie has been so many times that I'm shocked that someone thought it was the original idea. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and take this frighteningly bad movie Believe everything you read about IMDb, because the first comments are written clearly for people in a different theater watching a good movie.
