This documentary is based on inaccurate evidence, in which Brian Flemming, perhaps deliberately, does not mention significant contradictory evidence. Perhaps his most important mistake is one of the first: His allegations of revocation of Paul's testimony of Jesus Christ ignore important facts such as: ** The existence of some formulated beliefs in Paul's scriptures. These creeds suggest that most of the central claims about Jesus were already formulated as statements of faith that may have been in the years after the death and resurrection of Christ. ** Early Christians' testimonies cannot simply be thrown away as a fantasy. There were indeed many people who claim to be the Messiah during this time, but only one of them remains: Jesus. Why? Because it would have been reluctant if someone had actually believed that Christ was a Messiah and would continue to die for these beliefs if they knew he had not been raised. ** Even though the Gospels are dated more freely, we still speak of Jesus' accounts written during the lifetime of other witnesses, which would have revealed inaccuracies in these gospels. And there is evidence that the gospels have been written much earlier. <br /> <br /> I say that Flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and self-serving work that puts various arguments and evidence in the podges to serve his anti-Christian view. Don't be badly explored.
