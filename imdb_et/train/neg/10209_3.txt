Having been pleasantly surprised by Sandra Bullock's performance at Miss Congeniality, I decided to capture the number of murders. Although a decent, happy, self-improving role, Mr Bullock's performance in "serious" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed ​​2, 28 Days) leaves much to be desired. At the same time, his character is all-knowing, confused and sexually poorly adapted (Sandra's sub-region of the past is the same unnecessary filler that lowers the development of his already small character). Two teenage boys gave decent performances, although their forensic expertise and attitude-me-attitude is suspected of foolish mistakes that scream "We did it!" Chris Penn as an all too obvious suspect is wasted here, as is Ben Chaplin's symbolic partner / character of love interest. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler Ahead *** Medium abandonment, the biggest mistakes can be watched on a weekly TV that has never been fully bought into murders, and as mentioned, foolish mistakes (vomiting rare food on the murder scene) too comfortable and framing) the school keeper, the two boys procuring with the public, the comfortable interests of love to create friction, etc. etc.) make it hard for the murderers to get intrigued and bored. The end was strictly "numbered" and this was probably the most disappointing aspect of the film. Now using climatic tactics to show almost the climatic scene at the beginning of the film, and then filling the audience with the way we arrived at the moment, the last scenes will not exceed anyone and they lacked any so-called intelligence that the film claimed to reach that conclusion. A somewhat promising concept that is poorly filled and weak in almost every sense. * at the end ****.
