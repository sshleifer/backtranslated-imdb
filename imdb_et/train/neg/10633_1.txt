I watched this video in a friend's house. I'm glad I didn't waste that money when I bought it. On the cover of the video, there is a scene from Capricorn One 1975. The film begins with a series of rocket hit clips that are no longer linked to a manned flight. Sibrel Smoke Gun is a short video clip of astronauts producing video transmission. He changed his voice, instead of letting us listen to what the team had to say. The video ends with an interesting show of Zapruder. His allegations about radiation, shielding, star photography and others make me believe he is very unaware or has some ax against NASA, astronauts, or America in general. His research is bad and so does the video.
