Some brides are murdered at the altar and later their bodies are stolen. Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these mysterious killings. He discovered that just before each ceremony, the bride was given a rare orchid (supposedly a groom) containing powerful drugs that gave them away. Patricia is told that the orchid was first grown by Dr. Lorenz, who lives with her husband in a separate building. In reality, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for crimes by placing brides in a suspended state and using his gland fluid to keep his wife forever young. Patricia, along with Dr. Foster (who works with Dr. Lorenz about his wife's medical mystery) tries to force Dr. Lorenz's hand to create fake horses that eventually lead Patricia's mad doctor clutches. Opening this movie was very good, but basically ended with too many frames and other weak scenes. Well done, Walters and Coffin deserve better, but it's life. Russell steals the show (even through the fact that Lugosi is worshiping who does not give any of his most memorable performances, even considering his monograms) when Countess Lorenz plays a role in the stereotypical qualities of many of today's Hollywood prima donna. Weak and thoughtful end. Rating based on B movies, 4.
