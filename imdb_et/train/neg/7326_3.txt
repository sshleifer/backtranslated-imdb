This movie has an interesting plot, but the action is pretty bad and the script is bad. I was very disappointed. The moral dilemma faced by the protagonist is intriguing, but due to poor writing and casting, this potentially winning assumption is looted. 2 of the 4 other theaters left after about 45 minutes and the other 2 smiled at how bad the film was. I ended up with it, but I have to admit that I played Blackjack on my mobile phone to last 30 minutes.
