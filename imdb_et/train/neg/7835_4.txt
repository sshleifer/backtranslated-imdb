Man, I really wanted to like these shows. I'm hungry for some good TV and I appreciate TNT for these "opportunities". But unfortunately I am in a minority, which I think when it comes to filmmaking Stephen King. As brilliant as King's writing, it is irony that it just can't screen, big or small. With a few exceptions (very few), King's experience cannot be filmed with the same effect as reading stories. Many people disagree with this, but I am sure that in the heart of their hearts they have to admit that the best filmed king story is just a myriad of memories. The reason is simple. The average story of a gift is in the characters of the story. He gives us a glimpse of his inner thoughts, their emotions, and sometimes broken or unrealistic perspectives. In short, the king takes places in the reader where you can't put the Panavision camera. As filmed for the king's audience, we have less than half the data when the reader has access. It is not too far to claim that one gets the story that is written in what they read, while one is limited to filming a small voyeur with the same character. As long as the king writes, Hollywood tries to shoot everything that comes out of his text processor, regardless of whether they should do it. I do not blame the filmmakers to try, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and caution to pull the hard-to-use adaptation of Stephen King. The task is similar to turning gold into gold or some understanding of Zen's mastery. Oh, better next time.
