It was a short disappointment. The worst adaptation of one of my favorite novels. Dialogue was terribly clumsy; I don't know what the characters were saying. The lines were delivered too fast and felt rather away. They could also be mentioned as well by statues. Chemistry between George C. Scot and Susannah York was non-existent and looking at the American Rochester's strangeness. He could have tried at least a British accent. I like George C. Scott as an actor, but it just didn't work. I felt I was looking at the highlight of Jane Eyre, where the main pieces of the story were randomly assembled, disregarding the story flow. The landscape and music were all very nice, but I couldn't feel any passion and love that should be between Jane and Rochester, and the film left me completely immobile. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good version of Jane Eyre I suggest you check out the 1983 BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or 1997 with Ciar√°n Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now these are two brilliant adaptations.
