I saw it on Melbourne's premiere. <br /> <br /> It's low, two-dimensional, unaffected, and hard to believe because it's boring. The actors are satisfying, but they did not have much work given the very devastating and unimpressive script. For those who would be worried that Ned Kelly would be too intellectual, you can comfort the fact that this story speaks completely without any literary depth, is completely spoken of, and full of central casting standards. But it doesn't work as a popcorn. Its pace is too deactivated and its craft is too short to satisfy even the daily actor level. <br /> <br /> I doubt Gregor Jordan could sit down and say to himself: "It's the best I could have made this material. "<br /> <br /> Ned Kelly is an exciting figure and equally a national answer to her. Perhaps a national genius, perhaps a class warrior, perhaps a psychopath and probably all of these things, dominated Australia's true mythology 120 years, again, his story on the big screen has succeeded. <br /> <br /> This is life.
