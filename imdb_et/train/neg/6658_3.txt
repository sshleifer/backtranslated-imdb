There are some redeeming qualities for this exhibition. One is that the theme color has a decent melody. The exhibition has a nice premise. I'm also probably a minority, but I like Wanda. I like the fact that he cares and is Timmy's mother figure. Nonetheless, I don't like this exhibition, it's not stool, but I find it very annoying. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't say it's the best animated show on Planet Earth. When I use this term for an animated TV show, I mean Peter Pan and the pirates, I think Darkwing Duck, I think Scooby Doo and I mean Talespin. And I hope I am not the only one who really likes Wild Thornberrys and frustrates it for fun. I also don't think fairly odd parents are the worst animated show on the planet Earth. I agree that it is annoying and in some ways overestimated, but it is not the worst thing in Nickolodean. This is Chalk Zone, a god who shows that it is invisible. But the worst animated show I've ever seen is Shaggy and Scooby Doo: I get a clue that is sharply animated, ununny and frankly shameful. <br /> <br /> One thing I do not like about this exhibition is animation. Characters, forgive me when I insult, have very strange facial features and many backgrounds are boring and have no color that would make SpongeBob Squarepants and Wild Thornberry so nice. Signs, except Wanda, are very annoying. I can't believe that a talented voice actor like Tara Strong (aka Charendoff) expressed Timmy. Timmy I don't see it as a very pleasant character at all, it's annoying and sometimes patronizing, and it's also a bad decision maker. And his voice goes to my nerves. I like Strong, but not at this stage. Another annoying character is Cosmo, allegedly a funny character. Instead, his jokes are as inconvenient as they could change. They are either a) well-established or b) familiar. Timmy's parents are terrible characters who don't give their son a blow, and their personalities are very thin. <br /> <br /> Tracks are mostly original and I mean where I saw it before. Episodes after the arrival of the child I thought were irresistible. Even worse are scripts, very unlikely, kids, afflicted, and suffering from a total lack of energy. <br /> <br /> All in all, the worst show is not a bad show for an animation fan and quite uncomfortable to sit on. 3 / 10- have redemption properties and I fully understand how people love it.
