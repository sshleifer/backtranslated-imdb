Another "son who will not grow up" flick, and just other recent similar entries. Heder in another bad wig, directing Napoleon for what, third time? Anna Faris is forgotten as always; Jeff Daniels called that at least another country; and Diane Keaton ... how does it become a late career? Do not bother. There is nothing here that is not covered many times. I say this; it's about a hundred times better than "non-launch". There are very few amusing bits in the movie if you think that Eli Wallach's curse is funny. Ha, Ha! She's old and she fell into the f-bomb! Make, hee, hee. Calm!
