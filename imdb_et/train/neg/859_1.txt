Recently, I tried to smell the movie in the cable channel and reminded me how terrible I thought it was in 1980 when it was first released. Many reviewers are not old enough to remember the tremendous leap around this movie and the struggle between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King. The enormously popular novel had fans' legions who wanted to see the "master" director put this multilayered supernatural story on the screen. The "Salem Party" was already destroyed in the late 1970s as a TV mini-series by Tobe Hooper (his "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" celebrity) and was badly manipulated by making the book's main evil "Chiller Theater" "Vampire with no real The fans hoped that Kubrick's nature manager would succeed if the Hooper had failed, it didn't happen. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie looks good and has a terrible opening sequence, but after some accomplishments Jack Nicholson can't be anything but Jack Nicholson, he's always crazy and he didn't bring his role here. I don't care that many reviewers think he's all in this clinker, "Here's Johnny!" Despite this ... he's just terrible in this movie, so everyone else is on this issue. The character of Scatman Crothers, Dick Halloran, was important for the plot of the book, but Kubrick kills him in one of the flattened "shock" sequences that are ever in the movie I remember a theater audience who saw it repeatedly in the last 45 minutes of this evil flick, those who stayed there ... are far to the left. The king's books do not really change the film very well, because so many narratives are essentially with his characters and often metaphysically. Kubrick gave tension between living and dead people in favor of style, and the resulting confusion ends so far from the original material that we ultimately don't care what happens to whom. <br /> <br /> This movie is still stinking and why so many think it's a horror masterpiece outside of me.
