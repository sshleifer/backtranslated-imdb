When there was a low expectation, there was a pleasant surprise for the new film (over five minutes) opened by Husbands. I'm not saying that the new film material was a Class A material, but it provided a very strong basis for what "could have been" a good and original film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was put together in 1955, one day during the shooting schemes. After the new film, Jules White just made a short film about Brideless Groom to make such an uncomfortable story of the transition Jules and Felix Adler try to make up for a bit of the end of the material, giving us the end of the old, worn ends (Moe & Larry in this case), to get off the ass. <br /> <br /> 3/10
