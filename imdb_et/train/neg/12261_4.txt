A standard "color-by-number" monster ticket, filled with a bunch of routine piece equipment for great-looking movies. It's like someone who had cards that had graphics ideas from other films written for them that were mixed and handled. Whatever plot lines and characters came into the transaction, they were thrown into the script. <br /> <br /> The characters are so clever that you can play "Guess who gets to the monster for a meal" after the movie in less than ten minutes and probably get every right - including the order they can eat. Many characters are so unpleasant that you create a creature to close them. Some of the main characters are: a Billy Idol clone who surfs with sharks, a loudmouth brat who flashes on bankruptcies, Captain Ahab, a brother, and a Ahab girlfriend who dances in bars. Oh, and the big, big beast that needs anger control therapy. <br /> <br /> Along, people claim a lot, beautiful girls are flying with wet t-shirts, couples on exotic beaches, explosions appear in the temple ruins and fatty-shaped pirates are falling. <br /> <br /> Amusing, but one thing bothered me: that other people were killed. After one violent death they make jokes with one lining. I can almost hear rim shots. <br /> <br /> Generally, OK, if you have wasted 90 minutes and you want to laugh so bad-headed. Otherwise, you can skip this one.
