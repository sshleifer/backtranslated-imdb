Thumb's idea is not the second time the winner. ThumbTanic was not as good as Thumb Wars for several reasons. Most of all, I think Mr Oedekerk had a lot less work in Titanic. Unlike Star Wars, the Titanic movie (yet?) Has become a cultural tradition and has fewer references to the public. <br /> <br /> In ThumbTanic, holes are filled with one-off jokes that are not really related. For example, the hero's call for the heroine not to be "at the end of the ship" during the scene is not funny. Rather, you mean to yourself: "Did I leave something in the original film?" There were too many unsubstantiated jokes of this type (see pearls). <br /> <br /> By contrast, the smarmy ship designer had a meaning and it was funny. It was also a very funny movie sender who wanted to "go faster" than a maniac that runs around the demanding * all * to be "faster", including the ship sinking and himself the first to die. Such jokes meant something in the Titanic context and gave Thumbtanic meaningful humor. <br /> <br /> The thumbnail "media", faces and voices are still fun. The props and kits and CG animation deserve recognition. In general, although ThumbTanic proves that quirkiness alone does not work, this film still keeps you entertained and entertained.
