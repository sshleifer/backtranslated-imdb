I can say without a doubt that Going Overboard is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and yes, I've seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is abrasive when Schecky Moskowitz is working on a cruise ship. It's a plot. <br /> <br /> That's it! Nothing in the movie makes sense, it's all over the place, like a mad man's breakfast, and not clumsy with a naked gun, but rather frustrating, "throw both shoes in t.v.-style." even General Noriega makes a look, I can understand for no reason (it was definitely not humor). Add Miss Australia to the worst Australian accent I've ever heard of, and you have something I never call the worst movie because driving across the board is not even up to the original definition of the movie. I suggest you see this movie because it raises every bad movie. I guarantee that the first thing you say after seeing a bad movie is "at least it wasn't as bad as Going Overboard".
