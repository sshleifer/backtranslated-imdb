This is a Japanese film, but there is also a lot of English speaking here. This is a beautiful film with beautiful visual images that represent Hawaiian scenic beauty. The story was generally boring. Who wants to look at a young woman who holds 90 percent of her movie because her "picture" husband is much older than she had advertised? Allowed it could be a bouncer ...... but get it over! <br /> <br /> Only in the last 10 minutes does she make her face and love her. By that time, most viewers were too late. We are then asleep.
