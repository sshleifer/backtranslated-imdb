"Sky Captain and the Future World" (amazingly bright title) is just a bad film; it has no heart, no deep ideas, nothing very special. Yes, the CGI background is interesting, but the result is that the whole thing is shockproof in soft focus. In addition, the film uses music the same way as "Gilligan Island" or Scooby-Doo cartoons - it has never been. Terribly, just terrible. There are no fresh ideas about older movies and sequences. There's no goalkeeper here, the movie seems to exist because it can. Save your money and time. Not at all fun.
