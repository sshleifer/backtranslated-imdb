I hit Sorrows Lost at the New York Film and Video Festival and I think I had great hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, this is just one Visual FX calling card. The story is pretty flat. Bad lighting and the camera work together with less than great editing and music, which makes the movie bad. <br /> <br /> Is it really too much to ask for FX shorts to get better stories and to have the rest of the technical production equal to FX! You can't just get a cool FX in short short periods, it has been 5 years since "405" made a big hit. At least short fast, cool and was even a little funny! None of them can say about "lost losses".
