I have a DVD "Bogeyman" and this stunter was an extra feature. I assumed it was "Boogeyman II" because it was related to the original. But you know what they say about those who "assume": it makes "ass" "u -" and "me". I had read before watching that BII originally contained a lot of video material and that he celebrated actress Love. Looking at "Boogeyman's Return," I decided to stick to the original film to see the notorious death-tooth brush scene. Before I knew it, the movie was over. Rip-off. I think I thought it was BII because it has a similar title with one BII alternate. Well, at least it was just an extra feature, right? <br /> <br /> Let me talk about my mistake and start talking about the mistakes of the movie. Many, many, bugs. Who does this man Ulli? Does he really think that the same film is sold in different forms. There is nothing original in Part III. Basically, in the eyes of a psychologist, it is an original setback that gives us an eternally boring game of play when everything happens. It's a movie. Oh, and one death-stereo scene, but you can read it from someone else's review. My interest in "Boogeyman II" has been lost forever. <br /> <br /> Final Note: This is not a series of movies to look back on.
