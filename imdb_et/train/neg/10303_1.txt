*** Comments contain spoiler *** I barely seized this exhibition when they started tedious music under EVERY SCENE when Don Epps was on average almost every case, how very nasally Diane Farr was probably pregnant (but we didn't know) and when Colby was ***** g TRIPLE agent. But now, tonight's episode, David is trapped in a paranoid, nut job who is an OBJIOUS amateur with a gun, lift and .... HE can't prevent him. A trained, experienced field worker who has gone through the door several times and has experience in hand combat is NOT WORK. Not when the nut is blinking, looks away, the head falls, the eyes closes; not even when he looks around the ceiling around a fiber-optic wire, like a stripper on the pole at the 20th second. <br /> <br /> Then there came a scene that let me know that as much as I like to learn Chubby, frumpish but very charming Charles Epps and his sexy sidekick / love interest Amita, my Friday evenings are better to use otherwise to deal with. Don gives David the "emergency word" that is the code "The s ** t goes down"; David is ready, they kill the lights, fall down the elevator, rub the nut's work, and ...... <br /> <br /> David can't get on / kill / hit NUT WORK. A bad guy arrives at BOTH GUNS, David arrives at SHOT. <br /> <br /> I'm ready. I hope NUMB3RS is fun.
