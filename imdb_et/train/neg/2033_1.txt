If I could get it less than I would. Do not bother to rent; if someone gives you DVD burning. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible movie. Even the total balance of the digital "movie". On Youtube I have seen 12-year-old boys better. Lommel claims to have written it, if it is, it is a classic case when someone is illiterate. The story does not exist, the dialogue is basically shouting, the camera's work is some kind of tedious nuance, the endless cutting of which is completely unrelated to jumping on an industrial transport scene or a strange angry young woman. <br /> <br /> I can usually follow less than an obvious plot or see a goal in a "creative" movie - I like David Lynch. <br /> <br /> It is far from my limited competence, it is totally pointless. I think it is "lets see if we can get the title that will be coming soon and do it strangely and see if we can make some dollars for" con work ". <br /> <br /> I don't see why Lionsgate It was even worthless, it's so bad that I don't rent any of you with the same director.
