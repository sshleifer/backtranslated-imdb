From a child: Why wasn't a big brother supposed to be hungry or some food or diapers on the bottle? He would have had to shout without hope for many hours. Be sure to fool the child safely from the place he didn't. <br /> <br /> And why was the road wonderfully clear when someone wanted to drive somewhere? Didn't any kidnapped trees fall on the roads or block them? <br /> <br /> I can't imagine the policemen being on the roadside, just after every young person who blows it, after they said they were dangerous to go there. <br /> <br /> When you say this, it was great for the children to watch the film safely for the change.
