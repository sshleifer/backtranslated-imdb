The main mistake of this film is that it is impossible to believe that any of these people would ever be cast in professional production of Macbeth. Listening to David Lansbury's soft voice, which barely bothered the speech of the famous "Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow", it was impossible to believe that anyone could ever consider him for this role. I believed because he didn't get that part because he was a sad actor; not because there is a bigger name. When we see the parts in the sample, it is hard to believe that the director does not parody things with hopelessly unsuccessful, misdirected actors who are unable to express or even understand the verse and the directors who see the game through their own interpretations of the screw. Sometimes the directors want to make their own films (and writers think they have the opportunity to manage their works) that they live less. This seems to be such an example.
