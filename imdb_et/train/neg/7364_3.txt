In 1692, Salem, the devil of the devil's child, sends the slave into witchcraft, the uprising of the whole community. Costumes featuring Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray are not twilight, though neither is a vivid imagination of infectious hysteria. Three writers have worked (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead and Bradley King), the elements of the story are quite interesting (especially when coming out of Hollywood in 1937), but for everyone who has read Arthur Miller's "The Crucible" ever since, the melodrama shown here is not very long. The biggest problem with the picture can be casting: Colbert and MacMurray are a poorly matched couple loved by a witch hunt, MacMurray is too modern for their surroundings. * 1/2 from ****
