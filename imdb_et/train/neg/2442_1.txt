I don't know why I do it myself! I continue to defend the Dutch and Belgian cinema and say that it should get more credits and opportunities ... and then they beat you around like a junk! Intensive care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing ever done in Dutch speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our own horror franchise, based clearly on American classic classics like Friday 13th and Halloween. The producers and writers really struggled with it, but fell really low. Intensive care became an uncomfortable product for everyone involved and hence a true cult. Copying this original is almost impossible and will only be shown on special events, such as "Night of Night". In just 5 minutes, intensive care will try to tell the story and even create a line of lines ... then this flat and small brain will become nervous with a slash, but very fun and cheap. The whole cast works is terrible, although some recognized names are involved. The team's leading role is played by Koen Wauters ... This guy can also be the most famous and loved artist in Belgium. She is a loved singer, TV show and idol of many young girls. He never mentions the thing he celebrated. Like everyone else in the Netherlands, he tries to convince himself. Intensive care never happened.
