Geez, as a man living in NYC, can say thankfully that I've never seen the homosexual culture depicted in this movie - and I'm glad about it! Whether this movie was broadcast on television across the United States, there would be a big homosexual counter-attack and I can't say I blame them. The people in this movie do not represent the average gay American or even the average Trandgender America they represent, a thin and perfect nightmare. Obviously involving minors is terrible and obvious racist feelings (anti-white) are blatant and astonishing - people cannot be blamed for people who have opted for drugs, unemployment and rejection of education for the "cast" of the film - these people are not desperate but rather desperate. rejecting a speech similar to personal ambition and the will to do something about yourself.
