Once again, the film class has been meaninglessly redesigned with predictable catastrophic results. The title is wrong when it's all about this movie. The period has not changed convincingly, and leaders seem too criminals and too small. Arthur Penn's film had style, humor, a perspective, and was done by talented people. Even if the 1967 version didn't exist, it would still be an unnecessary film. The 1967 version, abandoned by the facts, introduced the glamorous version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was exciting and innovative in 1967 and had some outstanding performances that enabled you to take care. This 1992 transformation seems to be the original film rather than the known truth, and the participants in this version are sounding, unpleasant, and not the least interesting. Anyway, skip it and hope the 2010 version is better. Could it be worse?
