Awful. This thriller should have been buried. Which piece is. Terrible writing, characters are less plausible. Terrible Schlock! Put some B letters in a terribly written POS to try and give a little credit, but it's not unhappy. If I didn't have to write ten lines about this movie, I would have given him a word, it starts with 'sh' and ends with '' '. <br /> <br /> A terrible end, slowed down. Who writes this mess. Ending this movie is so weak, weak, if they had no idea what to do with the story line, or they just ran out of money. Probably thanks to this movie has come a lot. It is good that these participants are on the way out because it would be a career killer. Good for those who can hardly see it. At least someone important, like future investors. It could have ended a thousand different ways, but as it is, I feel deceived by my precious time. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about it, you feel you're wasting time if you never get back.
