Well, why this cinema was seen was a hidden preview, otherwise I would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie. I mean, do we have enough? Scream and Scary Movie at least did not take them seriously! The plot sucks and the actress is the worst I've seen. (Only Godzilla can be compared, which is the only movie that is competing in its worst cinema.) no it is not. (And you don't care.) The only one I knew before was Denise, and she was the most talented lesser I ever saw in this bad apology for the film. <br /> <br /> Stop as far away as possible from the movie. (2/10)
