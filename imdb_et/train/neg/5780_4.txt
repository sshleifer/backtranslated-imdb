I really wanted to like this movie and looked at it all the time to make it look better. Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst flick ever, but it never lives its potential. The premise is good, it is great (I was particularly inflated to witness David Naughton's return) and God's love, you can tell everyone who tried their best. It is short again and again. The "brutal massacre" should be a constant reminder to filmmakers that only Christopher Guest can make Christopher Guest's movies and, despite making it easy, you should probably just forget the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are fantastic in this regard and should be seen more often ... they are the reason it gets me 4 stars. If you have a "Spinal Tap" horror, I suspect you would like the man who made "Spinal Tap" to lead it ... just thought there was a loud voice.
