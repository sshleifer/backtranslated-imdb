This film was totally pathetic. The unfortunate scenario and the lack of any story left me to see three losers of bikini. Sometimes I felt like I was watching Beavis and the Butthead episode. I couldn't even sit through the whole movie. Emran Hashmi disappears and Hrshitta Bhatt is not at all impressive. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only valuable part of the film is Anu Malik and his obsession with shayar. It was quite fun. The songs "Sini Ne" and its remix versions were really good. You can always count on locking and splitting Emran's lips. All in all, Emran seems to have no good script from Bhatts to raise him back at that time.
