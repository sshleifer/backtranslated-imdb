I can't believe how bad this garbage is! I want my $ 3.99 back! Words can't describe this badly made piece! Duplication does not in any way change the shape or form of the actor's mouth. The film looks like it was filmed with a 1970's vintage camcorder. I've taken better pictures with my mobile phone camera. Gore is ridiculous thanks to a stupid unbelievable plot. Action is what you would expect when you called your friends on Saturday afternoon and started to hang up, then you tried to play in your garage. Don't get me wrong ... I don't expect O'Neil and I love Zombie movies, but the production values ​​on this film are so small that it is invisible. Avoid!
