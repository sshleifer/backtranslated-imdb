Except for sound, none of the above is really critical of this type of budget, (truly) independent horror film. The shaping effects and gore are very good and the leading actor was an effective, leading actor, although attractive needs some guidance because he was particularly bad. Half an hour is too long to be effective as sliding film making, primed wisely only about ten minutes from the first fifty is appropriate. for benefit. But if it is combined with bad sound like most movies, watching big parts is difficult. with some reasonable and ruthless editing, it plays in its current form as an unfinished raw section.
