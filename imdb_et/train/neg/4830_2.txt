Really? Really ???? I know when you make political war movies you notice, but this movie was just garbage. Terrible in every sense. Terribly inaccurate in so many ways. It is easier for me to believe that the President of the United States will fit, ride a jet and shoot aliens. It is easier to note some of the things that were right. My jaw dropped when I saw someone saying this film was the best of the last 25 years. It was a superfluous, seemingly pointless plot deviation, and sometimes was questionable cinematography. <br /> <br /> X-Box, YouTube, ACUPAT Utilities? did anyone verify that these things do not exist in 2004? It is not like you had to do extensive research, but only five years before the film appeared. I am a veteran of the Iraq war and if you spend one day with an infantry or EOD team, you will understand how B.S. this movie is. To compare it with a group or rescue, Private Ryan is ridiculous. Why don't you just drop Commando and Red Dawn there; I think they may be more accurate. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you see an incredible plot, historical and factual discrepancy, this film may be just OK. Nothing more. When you hear the "Oscar Buzz" and you need to add your breathtaking view, go straight on. As for me, I write to the director to see if I can get my 131 minutes back.
