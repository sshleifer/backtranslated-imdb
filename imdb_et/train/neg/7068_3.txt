The coolers start at a cold, dark stormy night when the bus falls from three passengers outside the bus station, a young boy named Mason (Jesse Emery), a college professor Dr. Howard Conrow (David Wohl) and a woman named Sharon Phillips (Laurie Pennington). Inside, they discovered that they had missed the bus and they were stuck at night. In the waiting room, they will find two more people, Ronnie (Jim Wolf) and the sleeping woman Lindsay (Marjorie Fitzsimmons), who now have a terrifying nightmare ... <br /> <br /> Swimming in the indoor pool Lindsay will meet and befriend a man named Billy Waters (Jesse Johnson ), next time Lindsay sees Billy diving into the pool, and then apparently disappears before her surface. Soon after Lindsay discovers that Billy Water died in a dive accident 5 years ago ... <br /> <br /> Lindsay wakes up and talks to others about her nightmare, all others responding, saying they have recently suffered a dream & decide share them for the passage of time ... <br /> <br /> Next is Mason, who talks about how he and two friends, Scott (David R. Hamm) and Jimmy (Will Tuckwiller) are then terrorized during a camping trip ... < br /> <br /> Then Sharon, whose story revolves around the journalist Tom Williams (Thom Delventhal) whom he puts the phones on, is not at his front door, but he actually turns out to be a vampire ... <br /> <br /> This is Ronnie's turn, and he describes how he discovers that he can bring the dead to life, unfortunately he brings Nelson Caulder (Bradford Boll) to the executed massacre Finally, Dr Conrow tells the story of how two of his students produced an ancient Aztec war god Ixpe (Kimberly Harbo) ur) back life ... <br /> <br /> Then this last (predictable) twist back to the bus station ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by: Daniel Boyd Chillers is one of the worst horrorantologies I I've never seen it and I usually like this sub-genre. There are no films in the Boyd manuscript, such as coolers to work, you see the final twist that goes to the mile and every story is really flat. The first one is completely pointless and does not seem to have ended, and the best thing about these anthologies is the short, delicate stories that are rounded with a pure twist. The second story is predictable and again ends with no payout. Thus, in the entire cooling unit, each story continues to be deeply unsatisfactory to see and have no charge for it. Character and dialogue are poorly written, stating that it has no original ideas of its own and of the whole. At least every story doesn't last long and I liked the idea of ​​connecting segments. <br /> <br /> Director Boyd probably worked with a very small budget and shows it. All I can say is if you want to watch the 15 odd minute story that is completely inside the swimming pool, then the coolers are for you. Stories are not wise, frightening, and no tension or anything. Having said that, it has some nice scenes and some surprising competencies seem to be repeated. There is not much violence and intelligence in Chillers, a ripped heart, a split head and a bitten hand are the same as it goes. <br /> <br /> Technically, Chillers is a bad thing that doesn't impress anyone. Cinematography, bad music, cheap special effects and below average production values. Cooling units also have one of the worst closures. Action is also very low. <br /> <br /> I am sure that coolers were put on a lot of effort as a low-budget movie, and at least filmmakers tried to give it at least credit, but it doesn't stop me from thinking. Similar anthology films like Tales from the Crypt (1972), Shadow (1972), Hirmu Vault (1973), House of Terror Horrors (1965), Creepshow (1982) & Tales from the Darkside: The film (1990) is much better than coolers, so check out some of them.
