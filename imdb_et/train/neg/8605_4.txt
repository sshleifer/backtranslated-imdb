It is somewhat interesting in the late 80's gore fest, which contains some disgust with the taste of human blood. If you get away with the ridiculousness of the whole thing, maybe you can get that little pleasure. Action is terrible and the plot is just there to keep the movie between a one-off attack, but the movie is not a total waste of time. Special effects are actually pretty good, and gore is well done. It reminded me of Blob's remake, probably due to its thinness. All in all, one hour and a half can definitely get worse, but I wouldn't want to see this movie if you don't have a strong stomach and are of that kind.
