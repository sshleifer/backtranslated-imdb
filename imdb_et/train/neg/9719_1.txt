Please forgive me, but did more than half of the characters disappear? In his original novel, Valjean is a 19-year-old imprisoned man who stole bread and tries to escape several times. He interrupts the password and the police inspector Javert continues to do so. There are many signs along the way that were not in this version. Some worth noting would be Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme. This time, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche and Enjolra. The only sign with the same name is Javert. I was confused and disappointed throughout the film, trying to see how it was somehow related to Victor Hugo's epic novel.
