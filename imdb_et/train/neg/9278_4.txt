The fact that I watched this whole movie says something ... or me. It's not a good movie. Actually, it's terrible. But it is terrible to keep my attention in this perverse way that looks like a tragedy and can't look back. That would have made an excellent MST3K theme! <br /> <br /> Most of the things that make the horrible movie enjoyable are: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, contractions, ridiculous awareness. You have the thrill of slo-mo death sequences, poor victims with foot agape and too much time to contemplate their impending doom, facing the terrible liberator of these deaths. Your heart is warmed up by old action clich√©s, such as when two women fight for a weapon and it goes down, but WHO SHOT? Both look at themselves, then another, then themselves, then (seemingly 15 minutes later), one eventually falls. You sing (of course in Latin) with street people who become a strange death-chorus that for a moment threatened to turn the film into a twisted music. <br /> <br /> So if you believe, as I do, that movies get better, it may be the right choice for you. It's not as funny as my current sci-fi schlock-favorite, "they're living" with Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it's more fun to watch than the lock-up movies like Omen II or III. <br /> <br /> I'll give him four out of ten.
