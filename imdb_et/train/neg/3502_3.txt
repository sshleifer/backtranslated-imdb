Sarah Silverman is now a "smell of the moon". Is it really worth all the leap? Yes and no. She is sometimes funny, sometimes hilariously (her standup routines are actually quite interesting, though not always funny). At other times, you feel the media fooled by the fact that there is too many different performers. He is one of those really cute comedians who men especially ran, saying they were digging their intelligence and intelligence. But when you get these corners, most men admit they want to sleep with him, and that's why they look at him. He reminds me why many men flocked Margaret Choi and Janeane Garofalot, although neither of them is really "hot" in terms of popularity. Sarah does not drink or smoke (at least cigs) so she should be 60 years old so her fans (especially men) can rejoice. <br /> <br /> This exhibition is very much like his comedy. If it works, it's fun. If this is not the case, it is full blown tedium and very, very boring. The AIDS episode is the best here. It's consistently funny and really good satire. Brian Poeshni's character is an unhealthy obsession with the Tab in one episode and it's fun to see him in a Tab T-shirt. But they will never go anywhere, and eventually it will be welcome. Sarah's series in the series is quite annoying, gay couple (Brian Poeshn and some other boy) seem to be facing and never do an exhibition as a whole or supportive players (including Sarah's real life sister, Laura, who doesn't look like she is ). When jokes hit, they're brilliant. If they don't, they are terrible and I really mean terribly. There is also an obsession with the lungs (namely, poop jokes), which today seems to have replaced the real spirit and intelligence in comedy. Should you watch this exhibition? If you have a crack on Sarah, go for it. You can look at her and pretend she's yours. As far as his exhibition is concerned, it is in the range between good and absolute.
