I was waiting for almost 25 years to see this movie, I thought it might be an underestimated job. From time to time, animation was no longer as good as it once was. It was one of the best film tasks all the time, based on a series of beloved children's books and was a production by Disney Studios. What could be wrong with this? As it turns out, almost everything. <br /> <br /> Not all. Vincent Price as Rattigan and Henry Mancini's fine scores are the two sustainable graces of the film. The price is malicious and Mancini is more professional than the material deserves. They bring a class project that is otherwise unclear. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the rest of the movie, full of inappropriately adult situations, still suffers from a dull script, forever generic vocal work, terrible songs, and lazy animation that wouldn't have been in any of Disney's mid-1980s Saturday morning TV shows . <br /> <br /> It was a total disappointment for me. It is amazing that this film was almost modern with the secret of NIMH. The independent studio paid a fraction of what produces more creativity in its trailer than the GMD has endless driving time. <br /> <br /> An additional star that keeps it "awfully" goes to Price and Mancini. .
