I like quiet movies, but it was a bit too moral. As far as I wish, I can say that it was worth what seemed like I couldn't. I don't think any version of the movie would even be close to the book. And don't try it for kids, they might be some. And the woman who played Pollyanna, how old was she? 38? I know the labor laws were different ... BUT COME ON PEOPLE.
