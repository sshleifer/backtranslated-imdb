"I know wild tigers". It only shows in big cities to be sure. It is one of those films SO artsy that it makes no sense whatsoever, except the director! I hate them! And all those oh-so-alternative / artistic people are trying to USE to find "metaphors" in what EVIDENT horseshit is. <br /> <br /> There was no plot, no story, no morality, no chronology or anything fun or even touching. For me, this was a set of scenes that were put together and had nothing to do with each other and all were "show" to show how they "artsy" and "visual" they get. It was still on ATTEMPT's second teenage film, but stayed human at every level. Then credit is considered! Waiting for this SENSE! I was waiting for a "good part". There are about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which could be called "art houses" for movies. It doesn't belong to them. You are very angry to pay to see this movie, the less you buy it on a DVD.
