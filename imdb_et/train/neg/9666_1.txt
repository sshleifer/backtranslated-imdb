Having seen the "triumph of will", I can only say that this film is strange, even when measured against historically low "standards". Of course, it is all completely made and damaging. This could be expected from German propaganda in the 1930s. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation itself is hackney and inexpensive. It is also so ridiculously ridiculous that even modern Germans have to leave their theater with their nose. In the case of this film, which is known for its baseball, lack of originality and non-geological misconceptions, this film is not even "bad". To achieve this status, it should improve significantly!
