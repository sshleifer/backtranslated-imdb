I ask its importance to Queer Cinema because it seems to be more of a homosexual encounter through violent behavior than of clear homosexuality and violence. <br /> <br /> The three tracks are quite sloppy. I found myself trying to devastate the dirty narrative in the first 15 minutes, which alone did not sit well with me. The weak test points were repeated indefinitely as we would not have received the first 10 times. <br /> <br /> There was a cushioned dialogue around the film. More than 45 minutes short short, not full-length film. It had some erotic elegance, men's nudity and sex appeal, but in general it wasn't equal to its parts. <br /> <br /> Part 1: The Boxer / Stalker story was the strongest, and yet it seemed that it was pulled thin. Bob has been watching Tim for four years and now he is facing him? I felt that their cat-mouse game was sufficiently developed to do so. We needed more information about them and fewer scenes for Parking / Lockers, where Tim constantly says, "What do you want?" <br /> <br /> Part 2: Danny wants his friend, Tony, to beat him up when he penetrates. Tony doesn't seem to mind, but he doesn't even seem to be interested in the effects of his gay erotic hobby - not even after they do naked. This story is not just an important transition: "I'm a straight boy who is hitting my guy's friend for fun" that "I think I can be gay and hit him because I would like to spread his ass and make him S / M style." Very important thing to leave. <br /> <br /> It is clear that these stories could have passed their points in half time. The third part, where a man and a woman cross each other, adds to that idea. In addition, it was unnecessary and did not add anything to the film. Yes, the actors did a good job in this situation and four men were very sexy. However, make-up was similar to the high school talent show. <br /> <br /> There was not enough meat for this story to influence gay policy. The film did not publish any statements, waste time or be thought through for investment. This deadly mistake is an amateurish approach that will eventually make it impossible to take it seriously.
