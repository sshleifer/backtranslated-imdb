The "House of Spirits" is quite terrible. I live in South America, a country that has suffered from a military dictatorship, such as what the film is trying to describe, and while everyone knows movies, it may be far from reality, this particular film treats viewers as both unknown and stupid. Things are not as simple and linear as you can see here, and of course the political process is much more complicated and interesting that the plot "In the House ...". If you can't show that the screen complexity is better then the movie is not at all. There are many examples of how politics can be taken seriously in cinema without so many common places. In some parts, I felt that Carmen Miranda could appear in parrots and palm trees. When you talk about certain things, you need to be careful not only to take care of your public intelligence.
