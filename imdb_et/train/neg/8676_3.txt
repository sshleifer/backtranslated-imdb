Avoid US version. It's added to US film footage and the worst copy you've ever heard by New York City amateurs. Duplication is so bad that it sounds like a Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think a black man from Bronx is making Chiba's voice. I couldn't watch the whole movie that was so bad. Instead of this American version, look at Chiba's other googles like The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.
