I can't believe honestly what's going on for entertainment. Death (and killing), violence, sexual eagerness, adults who threaten children, violence, juvenile alcohol abuse, drug theft, insecure parents, babysitter from hell, stereotypical jokes African Americans, police and fat people, and children in the middle of the house - yes, sure that i like kids movie - NO !!! Add to it the blind and frightening elements - a dead woman who owns and turns into a house and keeps her loving husband in prison for more than 20 years and also terrorizes the whole neighborhood - as sweet for children. Parents - is it really what you want your children to see - do you want to teach them about life? <br /> <br /> This movie is too scary for the youngsters and I fear that teenagers today can live in some of the scenarios of this movie - why rub their face? As for the adult audience - you can't find it scary or fun - just boring, viable and predictable. And the characters are just wrong - married parents, unknown police, stupid and annoying friends, nasty and manipulative babysitters, and beer drinking / female boyfriends. What a great material for kids - does it really look like a kid movie for anyone? Even computer animation and good voice work are not enough to redeem this terrible flick. Save Your Money, Save Your Time and Save Your Children's Minds - Go to Letting Time, Monsters Inc, Incredibles, Shrek, A Bug's Life - ALL of them are better than this horrible movie. Spielberg and Zemeckis - Shame on both of you for making such a disaster and then billing it for children / family movies !!
