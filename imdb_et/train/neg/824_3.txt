Gene Hackman goes out of prison without naming a government agency who wants him to be murdered. Of course, Hackman has the skills to do that. <br /> <br /> Nobody tells him anything, he is given because the audience is given information and bits. It should be tense, instead it is annoying and boring. <br /> <br /> Hackman goes through a mission, but the escape is confusing and the man at the top of this mysterious unit will give everyone the dead cover up. So all the cast persons die, and finally you don't care. <br /> <br /> One of the other reviewers noted that the film was originally twice as long, nearly three hours, and was down. a little bit. Maybe something was really lost in the translation, but I think it was a merciful act for the audience. <br /> <br /> Very talented prisoners with people like Richard Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Eli Wallach and Edward Albert are so wasted, this is a crime. <br /> <br /> And we'll never know what the federal agency is doing, FBI, CIA, DEA or even the IRS.
