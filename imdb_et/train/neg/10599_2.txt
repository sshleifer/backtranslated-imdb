** HERE IS SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The government has continued to develop the UniversalSoldier program, now called UniSol. The soldiers are now stronger and able to take more damage than before. But the government is cutting back, the project is in danger, and the supercomputer is at risk, so it takes steps to ensure its security. It activates and controls UniSools and starts to work. The only one who can stop them is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This movie is one thing. Choreographic struggles. The story is bad and soon drowned in all the struggles. Whatever happens and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately, it is not fun to watch the fight where you know that part of it is indestructible. Usually you are pretty sure the hero will win, but you still want to feel that the struggles are between two equal fighters. Not where one is indestructible and cannot be lost. Then the struggles just change the time. You wait until the final battle if Deveraux looks wonderfully at winning his invincible enemies. To further reduce your opinion, there is a desperate and definite sign of a bad movie, how many clad women. Well, they aren't really that much, because the characters are most men (at least one woman from UniSol), but almost every woman is unnecessarily shown with at least one bra. Women run it, but we also pass a strip club (to use the computer no less) with much more unpopulated women. These moments do not give anything to the story and are just there to try out the adolescent audience. <br /> <br /> So, finally, a boring fight. No more, no less. Well, maybe less ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
