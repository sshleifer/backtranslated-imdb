I don't even want to call this movie - it's a movie that shouldn't have won prizes. Operation was terrible, as were foolish scenarios. This is exactly the kind of film that so many people think they are seeing the NRI audience, but in fact it's overseas in terms of their discomfort and the "trying" of an overwhelming film. I find it strange that so many English-speaking participants have such a hard time so convincingly in front of the camera. I am sure many readers know what I'm talking about - all the English phrases that have been thrown for the cool points of film, Hindi and regional cinema. There are a few Indian movies where English is absolutely genuine - being Cyrus last. Although it wasn't a big movie, it was a good movie and the language didn't seem to be "put". <br /> <br /> I am ashamed that P3 got NFA in 2005. The only semi-enjoyable part of this garbage was Konkana and a somewhat memorable backdrop. Moreover, this movie doesn't even waste its time.
