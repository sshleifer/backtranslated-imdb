Elfriede Jelinek, not yet a home name, is the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. His novel created a film that won a second prize in Cannes and prizes for male and female leaders. Am I a dinosaur on aesthetic appreciation or is this art so corrupted that something goes wrong? <br /> <br /> "Falling, Tearing" is Turkey's prone orthographic representation favored by noise. In the film world, turkey is a monopoly flop, which is measured by either a box or a critical reception. Gobble, gobble and piano teacher are perfect partners. <br /> <br /> The embarrassment of this widely acclaimed movie cannot be overestimated. It starts very badly as if it had been disturbing the viewer. Authors interrupt irrelevant scenes for more than 11 minutes. Introducing Professor Erika Kohut, probably a well-established author, a piano professor of the Eight. She lives with her husky and her dominant mother. The Father is an institutionalized madman who dies invisibly during this activity. <br /> <br /> Piano teacher review is difficult, after recording this inconvenience. In the film, we see (and can read everything in the book I know) is a tawdry, exploitative and pointless story of an emotional pendulum that moves here and beyond. <br /> <br /> Erika, whose name is minimally used, is originally shown to be a person with a strong musical sensitivity but otherwise completely repressed. Not quite, because there are handbags at two speeds, where in the early days his gravel-shaped maman ends with strong excuses. If the reviewer has to (seize) the leitmotif of the extract (why not use the intentional word, if it were easier to do), Elrika would be a violently intermittent mood. <br /> <br /> A young hunk, Walter, is a "low-voltage" engineer, no matter what, and playing hockey at some of his free time is also a talented pianist. She meets Elrikat in an old-fashioned apartment in a luxurious apartment that may or may not be Paris. With so much art in fashion, she's in love with her and starts "cherchez la femme". <br /> <br /> Repressed Erika is a nice hardcore pornography that is shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds when she sniffs a fabric taken from the private cabinet in the trash she looks at. <br /> <br /> Walter performs excellent listening and is a special student named Erika, whose teaching style is characterized by distance, hostile intimidation and humiliation. Soon she will declare her love and will continue for a long time with a female Erika, where they are engaged in mild hanky and incomplete oral sex. Erika retains control of her love. She promises to send her an additional pleasant exchange organizing letter. Meanwhile, jealous of cooling, because Walter is pleased with a nervous student who is literally at the forefront of some upcoming concert, Erika fills the student's pocket with broken glass, causing serious tears on those delicate piano-playing hands. <br /> <br /> The next big scene (through genital mutilation, etc.) is Walter's Erika's apartment with her mother. Erika wants to humiliate, tie, hit, etc. Sensible Walter is currently firing and marching for the night. <br /> <br /> Then it's about an hour to go. The viewer can only fear the worst. Erika follows Walter for skating where she does her hockey practice. They're back in the back room. Lusty Wally can't resist his hands pulling his pants. Her "baby dressing" will soon be sent to other stomachs. Ho hum. <br /> <br /> Returned, but hooked, perhaps for retaliation for a recent insult to the floor, Walter returns to the Erika apartment. Do you think what is happening now? It is not very deep or difficult. Yes, he becomes brutal, while Erika becomes a victim. At one point, she locks up a mama in her room and strikes Erika, next to hitting her face, having sex with her and renewing her love declarations. <br /> <br /> Are I unfair in this summary? Watch the movie if you want, but I would recommend you not. <br /> <br /> Everyone can see the eternity of sand grain when they are in the right mood. If I would, I can reveal this challenging display of interpersonal relationships by the film. But I don't want it because it's a cheap and nasty movie that invites instincts and says something. <br /> <br /> I have to say that Erika, repressed from the parent, longs for love, inefficiently searches for it in pornography, rejects it inappropriately when she literally appears pink and pins down, understands late that she doesn't like to hurt , blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> The world has not been explained for reasons, refuted him. He probably looks like someone in the monster who seemed superficially loving - but we all know that every human being is a potentially violent rapist because it is his essence, but he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise. <br /> <br Finally, if you have the patience to be there, there's a little twist. Before entering the final scene, where he has to lacerated his underwear student substitute, Erika wraps a knife in his handbag. Walter? <br /> <br /> Yes, you are in front of me. She sticks to no life-threatening areas and leaves. Roll-credit. <br /> <br /> If it earned a second prize in Cannes, how bad were the rest of the entries?
