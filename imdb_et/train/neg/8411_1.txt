We waited for something big when we saw this bomb. This is basically a Broadway game that is put on film. Music is just terrible. No memorable song in the movie - have you heard the hit of this movie? You can't, because there's none. Some musical numbers continue so long as I went to the bathroom and got pop maize and it went back when I got back! When they were good songs, but they suck. The pace is slow, terrible character development. Lead preached for his song, but sounded like he shouted every song - almost impossible to stand. There is NO MOVEMENT in this film to offer to anyone who has died Broadway enthusiasts. This is undoubtedly the most appreciated movie I've ever seen in my life. Perfect time and money. There's nothing memorable about this movie, except Danny Glover - who wasn't enough on the screen and whose character wasn't developed enough. Video rental and you agree - this movie was expensive, over produced, polished dog.
