Anyone with a great interest in science fiction should start with the basics. Everyone says that STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best fictional movies that are good, but the truth is the TERMINATOR and this film, SOYLENT GREEN, is much better than the series. SOYLENT is probably the best secret of scientific literature. It's one of the biggest, but unforgettable movies, but the effect of setting it up is becoming a reality every day. Charlton Heston classifies his role, but it works. Edward G. Robinson, who is in his last role, is using it more in SOYLENT GREEN than anyone else and his latest scenes. <br /> <br /> Manhattan is in 2022, the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable happiness (a small jar with strawberry juice costs $ 150). The great murder of Soylent's company is being murdered and the police detective Thorn is on the scene. <br /> <br /> The secret of a stylish green is no secret when you study the movie. SOYLENT is an enjoyable watch, but the whole scenario is a joke. It's as cheap as the whole production. The scenario and drama about the actors made the film, but they were completely fun. Everyone seems to be a moor and no one knows the rules, especially the policeman Thorn, who just likes to roll people into the apartments, get shameless and steal something he wants. The character's communication keeps your attention on the film, but you realize that SOYLENT GREEN sucks. An enjoyable piece if you have time but don't expect anything more.
