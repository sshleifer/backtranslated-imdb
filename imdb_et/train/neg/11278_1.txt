This movie is just one of the worst films ever made and is accusing not only the British film industry but talentless hacks at work today. Not only did the film get the mainstream, but also the good light of British actors, so what went wrong? I don't know and just don't care about dealing with the debate, because the film was so terrible that it wasn't at all thought. warn and stay away from this waste of hell. but I probably have to write ten lines of text so I can describe the plot in detail. Man's glory has set his evil friend and co-worker out of his father's business and will therefore meet with the accents and fools of the Russian mafia and the bad guys, very stupid. I should have asked for my money back, but I was still shocked by the experience. if you want a good criminal movie, see the usual suspects or the godfather, how is the lock, the stock .... this is the tip of today's British criminal movie .....
