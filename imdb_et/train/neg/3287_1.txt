If this film should be renamed, it should be "Hazard Jackasses". All in all, this film is not just 88 minutes from two immature beasts of joy that delight the famous 1968 Dodge charger between the city and the country, with the search for girls and the abolition of the law. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of "Dukeside" and what's filming is characters out of the key. The overthrow of intimidation, sexual references and drug use has made Dukes a good name in the trailer trash. <br /> <br /> By comparing it to a TV show, the actor was terrible. The only actor who got it right was the famous 1969 Dodge charger, General Lee. Others have exaggerated the role of the character, which has overwhelmed the film. <br /> <br /> "Dukes" has been another disaster of the 21st century Hollywood television screen transition tragedy. Leave this movie out and buy it just on the TV series DVD. <br /> <br /> My class: F
