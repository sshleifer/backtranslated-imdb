Darkly comic serendipity about cosmetics salesman, with strange ties to Elvis Presley, runs the sea of ​​Elvis impersonators while talking about conventions in Nevada ... and accidentally killing each of them through a small guilt of his own. Kim Basinger, still an attractive actor with remarkable values, wants to play horrible movies, but this terrible scenario (by Mitchell Ganem and Adam-Michael Garber) is not good humor. Stereotypes and low-pitched gags are not meant to be a classic comedy stuff, but even in dim light, the shameful level is raw and sloppy. When you look, see if you can read how many extras from Basinger on his pink Cadillac wheel, hands are always in the same position and face on the face. Hopefully, he and Elvis are well paid. NO STARS from ****
