This movie should not be classified as a cinema. Although it is now over 10 years old, it should never be funded, and it is a blast to the Australian film industry, which is currently producing such great films as "Dishes" <br /> <br /> Actors can't act. Music is ... is blunt, not music, the story is completely non-existent and there is a fight to sit down. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. This is a complete waste of your time.
