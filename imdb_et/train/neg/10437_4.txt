Amazingly odd, though, the average witty comedy-drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through Houston Astrodome. The comedy comedy led by Robert Altman, with eccentric characters, is so superfluous that it starts to lose weight early. Some filmmakers are fictional, Shelley Duvall is her guided seam, and Sally Kellerman sees every customs like Bud Cort's vision of "motherhood" (imagine Altman and producer Lou Adler who explain this role to her!). Bud Cort is once again the real original after "Harold & Maude"; In no way, such as, say, Michael J. Pollard, Cortil can be geeky, crazy and unpleasant. Unfortunately, this is one of the Altman attacks. She can put together a cast and an exhibition picture like someone else, but let her unleash some misguided inspirations and down her spirals. ** from ****
