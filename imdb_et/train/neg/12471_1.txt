I lived in the Middle East (Israel), I was excited when I bought a ticket to Syria. Having seen the trailer and being a thriller-lover, I was expecting to see first a fast moving, breath-taking film that wisely falls into a global policy-making relationship between oil, power, and corruption. Well, I was almost in the middle of the movie. This pace was painfully slow, almost all the characters were stereotypical, interwoven editing made it logical to understand the logic, but as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, it doesn't end up being interested. Save your money, save time, choose another movie. <br /> <br /> Robi Chernitsky
