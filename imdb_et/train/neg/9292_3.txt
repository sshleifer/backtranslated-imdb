First of all, I waited for another hero - a fantastic work of art that works for the genre. I have only seen parts of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I can imagine that it is better than HoFD. <br /> <br /> The main elements of Hero are found in HoFD: Great Landscapes, Cinematic Cinematography and Sincere Action (I mean, if you don't understand the word they say, without subtitles, but you still care - that's good action) - <br /> <br /> What went wrong? What starts with a political intrigue, the love story goes. What's worse, it's a soap opera-like triangle of love. You have three characters who think you fall in love with each other - for good reasons. basically after escaping from prison (I slept after about 40 minutes) It is almost the same as they would have changed the writers, the rest is about how the character is like the wind Ick. It is not unique to this genre, but because the story is weak, you can't wait for action, and when the fighting breaks, it wasn't so good.
