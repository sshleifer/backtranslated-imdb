Maniacally, he touches on the mechanical trick of picking up random news topics and joins them with no legitimacy, but only collects interference that can't follow the least story. The level of the script is similar to the "Cântarea României" amateur game about the brilliant feats of socialist realism - but turned backwards: although the Communist line dictated strictly to positivism and the sugar festival, now Daneliuc is so obsessed with negativity and nasty scatology. The content of the idea is zero, the message at the kindergarten level is infantile and didactic. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he also forgot the most basic professional beliefs. He can no longer organize a dramatic situation, order it in the right movie scene, properly delineate and edit it by following the simplest rules of cinematic grammar.
