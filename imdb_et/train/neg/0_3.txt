A story about a person with an unnatural feeling for a pig. Starting with the opening, which is a terrible example of absurd comedy. The official audience of the orchestra has become a crazy, violent mobile with the crazy songs of its singers. Unfortunately, it will remain absurd all the time without a general narrative that will eventually change it too. Even those who are out of time should be turned off. The secret dialogue would make Shakespeare easy for a third grader. At the technical level, it is better if some great cinematography could be thought of by future great Zsigmond, William. In short, the stars of the future are Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest.
