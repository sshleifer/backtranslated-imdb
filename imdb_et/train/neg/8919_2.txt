I saw it for the first time when it was selected from my TiVo system. I like Danny Elfman and thought it might be interesting. In addition, I'm a fan of Max Fleischer's work and it started with his 30-year-old comic look. For both, I thought it would be in my interest. I was wrong. Just a few minutes and I had a quick back and forth button. I ran it after about 15 minutes and thought it was. <br /> <br /> Later I read some other comments here and I thought I didn't give him enough opportunity. I saved it again and watched it. My life is 75 minutes, which I can't get back to. <br /> <br /> I can't believe there are no more bad comments. Personally, I think it's because it's hard to get 10 lines of comment. How many ways is it to say that this is a waste of time? <br /> <br /> The film comes out as if some young, taller kids were ready to think about the world outrage and think that they can joke, rage, and joke. The characters are flat. The "Alphabet Swinging" parody is flat, essentially worshiping the tuning, passing through A-E, obviously capturing "F" and then wondering where to go. The journey through the intestine to the expected landing does not work for the first time, let alone the following. <br /> <br /> The entire movie has the whole movie you expect from someone trying to remove the "South Park" stone and Parker without being able to determine what is and what is not funny. It can be fun if you are high. Otherwise, this is not the case.
