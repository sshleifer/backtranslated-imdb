This film reminded me of the "History of Violence" topic of violence and violent behavior, but ended with a situation that is an insignificant thought film that is violence. Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride go to a small town in England and meet with endless harassment of local drunks who do nothing but hang out in the pub all day and make problems. Don't they have a job? Anyway, Dustin takes everything he can, and at the end of the film he keeps in his house and fights off every drunken attacker with such harsh means as boiling whiskey is poured over someone, his feet are blown up by a gun, and somebody's head grabs a bear trap. It's funny that somebody needs such a big bear trap for a little British city, except maybe it'll have a head on it. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah, who made "wild", which also included the subject of blood when he wasn't saved. But it was done with style and you believed it. Straw Dogs are not plausible. First, the location is wrong and does not work. Why put it in England? I think maybe in some parts of the city or small town in the south of America in the 1930s or something. Secondly, I have never really explained why these men are violently violent, except maybe they got drunk and felt the need to kill Hoffman and rape their wife. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah missed it.
