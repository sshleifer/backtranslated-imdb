Mostly On Demand offers really horrible horror movies and offers only other horror films that everyone has already seen and already has an opinion. It was either this or Invinicible (I like Mark Wahlberg's films), which I haven't seen, and I was actually watching the movie with a mood that doesn't happen anymore because I've been watching all of my movies a million times, and it's a lot of movies, and I have no new movies and no boy, this movie made me regret. I'm not going to put any spoilers, I just tell you that only a few very few players in this movie are half decent. I think the main girl, the dead who kills everything, is very annoying but convincing; I'd take her for a psycho-female so she fits well on her roll, though it's flat. Blood is not so big, but a few kills, or you can say that wounds are fine, but you don't see much, and there are no body part props to make the injuries more convincing. At the end of the movie, I asked my girlfriend to turn it off and, as a member of the band, the "recording" parts were not very interesting, although what happened would really be when recording. I'm ready, if you want to see it, fit yourself.
