Dave goes through a divorce and his mind goes back to his first love. "Wanders" is probably not the word. I should say that he confirms the past. He recalls the day of the end of the relationship. The sequences of dreams only have no blurry transitions. He recalls his favorite songs and the places they went. I'm not an advisor, but maybe it had to do with a failed marriage ???? Dave goes to a support group and meets a woman who is half of her age (also divorced) who is starting to "get her" out of her creepinette. Did I mention how horrible Dave is? Sometimes it refers to a third party. Nor does he move his hand as he walks. It's just weird. Too short story, Dave plots Mary (old gal friend) hunt and kill him ... bug ... I mean to him. He does it. What was really horrible. She believes she is married, but she still flies half way to meet. He puts his house in order to be alone before he falls on him. He has an uncomfortable conversation with him, ending with the sharing of the gospel of Christ with about ten words or less, and returning to a new young girlfriend. We enjoyed the movie mostly for involuntary comedy value. I still have Dave's impressions of her entertainment ... "I heard another Dave & Mary song!"
