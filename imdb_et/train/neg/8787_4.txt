I first heard white noise when I saw television advertising. Before that I didn't even know it. I looked at the trailer online and decided to go and watch it. Now that I'm like the Sixth Mind, like a movie fan, I thought this film would give me everything I wanted. It has Michael Keaton and his stones. Unfortunately, the movie didn't. He tried to be the second sixth mind or Echoe mixing and failed. This is a very promising start, but in the middle it simply pulls itself back and ends with a bad twist that every monkey could have thought of. Unfortunately, like most of today's "Scary" movies, it relies on loud noises and bangs to jump to the audience. This movie could have been so much. It is a shame because it was a good idea.
