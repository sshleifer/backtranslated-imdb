ENTIRE MOVIE has setbacks from the first Boogeyman movie, as well as inexplicably other Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love Brainwaves. It has been framed somewhat in the current (early 90s) films that are boring, malfunctioning and inexpensively captured. The film is not nearly a setback, they restore the same film's feedback on the entire film. This way you can see the recycled material over and over again as if you have seen it. As if the originals were not bad enough. I've never seen such a cushioned movie .... Someone milked the last dollar from these films. The whole ripoff. And talk about cushioning ... why do I have to write 10 lines on this trash? If I can tell you that this is a rubbish in two rows, that should be enough.
