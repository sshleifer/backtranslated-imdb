Despite the great fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers' films, I did not see about 6 years ago that I saw the "Fleet" for the first time. I knew all the songs from the old Astaire / Rogers disc (yes, vinyl) but didn't know anything about the plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, when the songs are nice and the character of Ginger Rogers is sweet and funny, you just can't like "Bake Baker." In pursuit of a long-term partner, she is constantly sabotaging her career. His character has no ordinary humor and no Astaire characters in other films. <br /> <br /> Ginger Rogers is worthy of stories and a great solo tap.
