Maybe it's not fair because I made this movie halfway. One of the few movies I've been unable to watch because of stupidity. <br /> <br /> Action is terrible, camera work is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy. For example - during a coke the cook is not open in the suitcase - I am not an expert, but I think people will put that bag at all. <br /> <br /> They use the same foolish sound effect every time a punch is thrown (that is, there is a "sound" on top and they use a toy with duplicated sound effects. <br /> <br /> The worst movie.
