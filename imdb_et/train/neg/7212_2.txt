Why every horror director wants to imitate "Exorcist" is a complete mystery to me, as William Friedkin's "classic" is a very overrated film and I find it not all tense or shocking. And here's another clean rip-off, Spain, who repeatedly repeats the story of a young girl who gets in the hands of pure evil and turns to her family. Paul Naschy (whom I have to admit seems quite hot) plays an honorable priest who turns to John Gibson because his sister Leila's behavior changed drastically when she met her new boy. At first the priest does not believe this, but when John's body is discovered with his neck, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable ... "Exorcism" is not only very uneven but also uncomfortable boring film! Here was an open opportunity for Naschy and director Juan Bosch to make a shock and gore full of religious-themed exploits, but the result is a tedious and general bloodless drama that almost puts you to sleep! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, though very stupid, and there are quite a few stylishly filmed female nudity and slease. The absence of a budget is not a real excuse, because Paul Naschy has already proved that he has enough imagination to make up for the lack of money. It's just a terrible movie, the end of the story. Other European "Excorcist" rip-offs are "Antichrist" and "Door" and they also suck!
