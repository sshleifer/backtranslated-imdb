Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov are a very unlikely couple in a very non-pleasant movie at all. <br /> <br /> The film shows a promise to get Ustinov out of jail. He convinces Robert Morley to go away so he can start his identity and start hacking on computers that are a very proud company led by Karl Malden and Bob Newhart, another unusual movie duo. <br /> <br /> Morley sounds just like he did in "Marie Antoinette" in 1938. Maybe he had to go back to this genre. <br /> <br /> This movie is at best ridiculous. It is hard to believe that next year Maggie Smith completely changed her way and gave a breakthrough Oscar performance "Prime Minister of Miss Jean Brodie". <br /> <br /> ms. Smith has been put out here to be an obvious stupid red head, but at the end of the movie he has clothes. Too bad that writing didn't go to him.
