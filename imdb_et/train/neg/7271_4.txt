It could have been quite the opposite of Gone With The Wind, given its epic length, but instead he was happy because he was a huge chain of empty episodes in which nothing happens. The characters are one-dimensional and do not have any other story (no story) than finding and kissing each other. It is a shame that an interesting aesthetic proposal, such as almost any dialogue, is completely wasted in the film if it does not attempt to measure the psychology of its characters and achieve real emotional resonance. In addition, he seems to be an "art" film using the worst naive clich√©s of cinematic snobber. But anyway, if somebody can identify with your hard banalism, I think it's okay.
