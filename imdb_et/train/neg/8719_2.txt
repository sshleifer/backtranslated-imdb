Well here I go to another B industry film. It's sad enough to see some badly made movies, but I don't care if the B industry or C industry produces the film. Showcase some effort in your work. The characters are really bad. Action is not a question (surprise) but a plot. How can a tightly knit group recognize two of their fellow citizens and then continue to do something. What was ill was how the writer was thrown into the scene, even in the rest of the members, where they joked how cute the doctor was. Leave me alone.
