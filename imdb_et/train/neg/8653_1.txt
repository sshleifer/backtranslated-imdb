I went into the hope that this is a "provocative" little pearl that people have looked at. i love indy movies and i also hope to complain about it. Knowing what a hot button this theme is supposed to be entertaining might even see a stranger perspective. you like it. personally I do not like the idea of ​​being a pee or cutting myself, so I thought it was garbage. bad script, bad behavior, bad story, bad management, bad editing .... i could go on. I have no idea why the evaluator claimed that he made a political point by giving this film 10. It's misleading and unknown. IMDb movie voting doesn't set a precedent! it just lets other people think that a bomb bomb is as good as it is controversial (this movie is not, it tries to be very difficult but not successful). <br /> <br /> You know that the movie is bad for 15 minutes in your prayer that all major characters will die terribly. unfortunately, they die but not in painful ways that would have given the viewer some justice or justification for looking at the 2-hour mess they just suffered. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, just bother. I got this movie in a favorable trash at my local video store.
