This 30-minute documentary, Bu単uel, made in the early 1930s about one of the poorest regions in Spain, is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. First of all, we acknowledge that 70 years later Spain is much richer than it was (and if I say so, I fully admit that wealth can lead to problems such as excessive individualism and consumption, although everything is in a better state than the extreme poverty shown here) . And when poverty fell in Spain, Bu単uel was not favored by such socialism, but Western European-style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the film is this: in one scene, the narrator tells us that the school teaches children the value of Pi. Teaching mathematics to poor people, horror! The short-sightedness of Bu単uel is the most striking here, but does not understand that it has access to the latest knowledge and technology that helps the poor to overcome their situation. What is he doing? That kids are taught exactly at school? Does Bu単uel not understand that the lack of modern technology has made them bad compared to other people?
