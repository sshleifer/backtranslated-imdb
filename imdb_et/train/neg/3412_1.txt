First, IFC manages the city and the country and now it. The difference between this stinker and the pink Panther rip-off is that the city and the country were traceable. It is not like that. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the cast is registered for this purpose so that they can drop someone else's dime in Europe. Belushi is particularly irritating. His scene with Candy (doing Z-Class Dom DeLuise) was torture. Talking about torture, five minutes of talented shepherd and I can bet on Gitmo prisoners like walnuts! <br /> <br /> The real "crime" (besides being green) is a shepherd dog: a mousy woman who takes the Monte Carlo casino for half a million dollars! If you buy it, I have an oceanfront accommodation in Arizona that you might be interested in!
