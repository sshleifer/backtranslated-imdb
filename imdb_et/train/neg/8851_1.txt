Have I always been under Joe Dante's original THE HOWLING (1981)? so I was not particularly interested in controlling my offspring; some time ago, did I catch HOW III: MARSUPIALS (1987)? the same director as it is? and found it to be traceable but nothing special. <br /> <br /> The second installment, however, is pretty bad and I knew I had that time to watch? if it is mostly expensive but the symbol of a pompous horror symbol Christopher Lee, who all symbolizes it (the gracefully obsolete star has repeatedly said that it hasn't appeared in a horror-oriented price since its last picture for Hammer Films in 1976!) . Anyway, this movie should have been labeled "Your movie is turd"? in all departments is amazingly intuitive (starting with all the important werewolf makeup)! <br /> <br /> Plot (and Dialogue) is not only terrible, but is it the most limited connection to Dante's movie? Strangely enough, the author of this original, Gary Brandner, wrote! However, one of the undisputed highlights of the movie (er ... lower points) is the meaningless elliptical editing? which tries to give the whole style a similarity, but only highlights its embarrassment factor! Similarly, the transitions of scenes, sneaky punk rock song, and lowjack special effects are top-of-the-line! <br /> <br /> But the characters, then?: Lee is a werewolf expert, of course, to whom everyone thinks it's nice? until they come into contact with monsters; at least, however, one must admire the ingenuity of the creators (or gall) when it produces double-meaning fool subtitles! By the way, Sybil Danning (like Stirba, the female subtitle of werewolves, which is known in the UK!) Is quite unpleasant in the assortment of S & Mi things ... but her character is not allowed to do anything (except for presiding her number of followers and occasionally participating in fun) three-way lycanthrope sex!); her two nervous lieutenants (one of them is a bitchy black girl) are particularly irritating. <br /> <br /> Lee's good side is the two yuppie heroes (he is the brother of Dee Wallace's brother from the first film and his colleague) and the dirty transilme party (they still manage to easily cross Danning's pretty foolish artists). Among them is a significant knife-throwing dwarf, who becomes particularly disgusting (but at the same time sideways); he has later revived under Stirba's control to trap Lee (making childhood all through the village streets) trap. The last scene must be career-oriented for an outstanding and powerful actor? well, is it or the early discotheque, where Lee has a couple of ultra-cool sunglasses, so it would be inconspicuous among the youngsters kept? <br /> <br /> Finally, if I were to mention elements that were not completely dissatisfied, I think I can say that the ossuary set (where the heroine should be sacrificed) is interesting or that the hybrid werewolf / bat creature (Danning's pet who wants to live the "body of his victims" is just too weird to despise him ...
