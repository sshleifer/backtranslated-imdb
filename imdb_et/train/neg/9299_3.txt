When I watched this movie, I tried to figure out why they did it. Although the main plot of the film is potentially good, there are all kinds of interrelated / unnecessary sub-blocks. Hollywood distributors need to be dictated by many bad guys, forever double crosses and men and women who are too close and having sex. It's strange that we see more of those who have sex than the president and his lover. Many plots and sub-blocks make the film too broad and no characters have developed properly - I really didn't feel I knew any character except everything was corrupt and evil. The end is completely incomplete - it left me more than just a wish that might have been, but what was supposed to be. Finally, there is really no explanation as to why someone does what they do, except to earn additional corrupt characters that commit a double cross. I'm surprised that so many well-established (and good) participants agreed to make such a hollow movie. It seemed like a film made by college students working on their 2nd or 3rd project. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time if you are not in a movie class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie.
