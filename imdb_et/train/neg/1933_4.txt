Final score (average of different classic cinematographic features - actor, visual, creativity, profitability, humor, fun, etc.): <br /> <br /> 4.3 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> "Atlantis: The Lost Empire "Coming a few years ago, it would have seemed a bold and serious new direction for Disney's animation. But it is only a year after the innovative and almost genius "emperor's new groove" and marks the step back to release Disney from this repetitive "Disney Formula". I am a fan of large Disney animated films. You must love or hate them all. "Atlantis" is an animated setback for "20,000 leagues under the sea" and similar 50s and 60s live sci-fi adventures. The problem is that this version hardly contains one original idea. It seems like something more, even more than real Disney remakes (Tarzan, Notre Dame Church). The characters are a bit more than the usual suspect clocks that are usually found in this type of film (odd mechanic, gung ho general, sassy harsh women). In addition to Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner), supportive cast is uncomfortable. The film also suffers from this short pace. Instead of highlighting this epic story, Disney clogs a lot of the usual short running times, brushing the possibilities to develop ... stop, signs, really. They take us to this new and wonderful world and barely let us have our barriers. The uncomfortable tempo sometimes confuses what is a relatively simple story. Animation is dark and harsh and cheap. This thing looks just like a Saturday morning. We hope they have not forgotten that 2D traditional animation can still be wonderful. "The Iron Giant", among other things, proved it. <br /> <br /> Negatives: Visuality, lack of pace and originality. <br /> <br /> Positive: Disney can be the coolest death scene. villain for a long time. This is the creative highlight of the film.
