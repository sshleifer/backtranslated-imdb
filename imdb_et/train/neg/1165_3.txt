I keep it short because I know I don't have to say much. <br /> <br /> "Alive" is a strange little movie that obviously calls some, but I found it to be shockingly cute at almost the beginning. The film did very little to make any symbol pleasing and sometimes the story became so complicated that I completely lost interest. As I said, I know others enjoyed it, but I found that Kitamura's "Alive" is something other than - a flat, extremely boring drama that is hidden in a sci-fi flick of thoughtful action. I felt like I was watching this movie on the basis of this intriguing space and the uber-exciting cover design. <br /> <br /> My proposal? Put it on Kitamura's much more enjoyable innovative effort "Versus" or his 2004 "Godzilla: Final War". <br /> <br /> ... And don't get me wrong, I'm always ready for a good thinking man's movie, but that wasn't sure. At the moment, it was a moment when I really took care of the event that took place in this excessive sermon, in a dialogue-difficult film. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about something ... talk about boredom.
