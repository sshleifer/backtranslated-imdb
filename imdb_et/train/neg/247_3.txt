Last night my friend's camping camp was at 9.30 am and we were so fun to see South Park (new episode). The thing is that in my country, South Park's atmosphere is at 10.30, and we decided to kill the time, following the example that now boasts, Father of Pride. I start by saying that I've only been watching episodes. For the first time, when I looked at it, I found it to be uncomfortable and raw, so I thought '' Holy sh * t, I have a football game tomorrow, so I have to stop the foolish cartoons ''. But yesterday I tried to give another pride to my proud father. I find this a complete burst of The Simpsons, replacing only the yellow human characters with lions. <br /> <br /> Another thing I wonder is why he got this TV-14 rating. I find that the Simpsons are much more vulgar and the only true vulgarity in this show is some homosexual jokes. Simpsons are also much more violent (Halloween special offer) and crude oil. I also heard that the creator of the series was also directed by Shrek 2, well, I have news for him: Shrek 2 was better and I think he stayed too much in family. However, I must admit that the father of pride made me smile three or four times (even laughing once). <br /> <br /> All in all, I don't mind pride. I don't hate it, but I don't like it. I've seen '' Simpsons '' better. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
