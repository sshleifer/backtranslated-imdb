The boys who even see this movie have already got some interference through their heads. This movie has nothing to do with Jack Ripper (incase you think) with his other B, I mean an E-Class movie that consists of a bunch of horny teenage sex scenes being viewed just before they go on the tree spleen going. It's not scary, funny or fun. If you feel really crafty, if you don't have a plot, look at the cab fever, at least the director did not sleep in the meantime when you drove it crap.only watch it only if you have absolutely nothing in life and the only thing on television is Oprah Winfrey cries out of the TV.
