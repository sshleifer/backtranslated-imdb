... but the keyword here is "usually". I'm known to worship movies. But in the world of B-rated movies, it has one Z rating. Absolutely ridiculous. The honest thing I respect for most of my favorite B-movies is that they don't take themselves too seriously. The makers of such films treat the film lightly, even if it is a difficult subject. However, I have the impression that the producers of this film took seriously, as they put together the 10-star classic, with the shattered lines and foolish shots of the bad breaks. Nonetheless, despite the fact that I gave STILL its 4 out of 10 stars because I am biased to such films. If you are a B-rated fan, I would still try to find it too hard.
