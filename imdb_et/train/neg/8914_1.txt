I had to stop watching this movie (pseudo-intellectual product for pretentious movie viewers) twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and boring to inspire spiders, not to mention that I was soon tearing over $ 3.99 that I had wasted on Blockbuster. Joanna Pacula's actress and her terribly closed Slavic accent are scary enough to put them on the teeth. I knew two hours would be too much for two hours. Both Breuer and Nietzsche play remarkably little talent. Although we are on talented topics, it seems that Breuer's superfluous assistant has been pulled out of the local troupe. He has probably not learned his craft. In fact, he's really terrible. All the public scenes were staged, the extras were mechanically walking on Sunday. Turning off this movie was much more satisfying than turning it on. Don't try this terrible movie. You're sorry you spent your money.
