I say one thing about this movie: there are no scourges. It cannot be forgotten. The problem is that it is too intense. It Is Too Much And POSSIBLE TO LULLS! This is the risk you take in modern movies. You want it to be interesting, but not superfluous. It's so redundant. <br /> <br /> Even if the actor is good and has a few "names" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, he still has a "B" movie feeling. The best part of this is the Scheider dialogue: the only "A" part of this "B" movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is strictly Rambo's mindset, but it has some stylish scenes. Especially it was a very innovative scene with mines. It was memorable. Other scenes were not enough to keep it for a long time.
