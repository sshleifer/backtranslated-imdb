badly targeted garbage. mediocre nihili sadistic gorefest ... if you are such a person who likes it ... look shrinking. Even if you are this person, this is not a good movie, the actor is really bad, the story that is full of holes in the parcels, the director should just give up and find a real job because he has no talents for it. I see why people don't like uwe boll .. we've had some of his movies lately and it's the best of them that is really sad! The complete absence of any kind of humanity seems to be suitable for some people, but here it just grabs. Horror movies can be full of destruction, they can be miniature works of art, they can be just good viewing if nothing else ... SEED is really very bad.
