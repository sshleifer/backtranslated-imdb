I had great hopes for Troy and I'm so bitterly disappointed. The film was so bad that it made my abdominal pain. This pace was so slow, the dialogue was ridiculous and the film - in addition to the nice fighting scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest were low. <br /> <br /> And why, why Hollywood always requires rewriting songs to suit consumer approval. Agamemnon did not die in Troys, the war lasted 10 years and Achilles killed in Paris outside Troy's walls, with an arrow ankle! It irritates me to such a classic story as it has become soap. <br /> <br /> And don't even start with the "absence" of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was a woman who was fighting for war, and it didn't even look like two of you had taken care of. There are no sparks, no emotions, no hope. <br /> <br /> I have to say about movie protection, Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O 'Toole were working very well with a bad script, but that's not enough to record this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me where they spent 200 million pounds? Maybe all the trees they used for funeral traps - where did they get all these trees? <br /> <br /> I am so disappointed that it is painful.
