Yes, a cheap story I know, but this movie is a great example of how to collect the hallmarks of depth (political confusion, love / craving) to collect randomly with critical criticism (see also "American Beauty"). Kaufman's film plots with free sexual scenes that often have painful dialers (in one scene I counted three different "general Europe" accents that affected the accent) and the country's displays may behave, but don't tie them into a single meditation. kundera is offered. and during his thirty-hour period he can almost completely shine over the Franz, lost the fourth piece of the triangle of love, which is at the center of the plot, and thus sacrifices the central mechanism of the novel to display the spectrum of emotions and the power relationships that get in love. it does not even reflect the time of the symbolic screen for the Tom son used in the novel to show some political points in the Kundera novel. Combined with an amazing soundtrack, these bugs make the film's three hours unbearable, but the content is light.
