I thought it was a New York movie that's wrong! This is a small British rural setting. <br /> <br /> I thought it was comedy: wrong! It's drama .... Well, until the last third, because after the story becomes completely "abracadabrantesque", the symbolic word of the French president's mandate. This means that it is almost useless even for motives to bring a sincere feeling. <br /> <br /> What have I left? Maybe it's a good actor actor: Yeah, I know they're 3 friends, but the redhead policeman is a little invisible to me. The high doctor surprises his punch and McDowell usually offers a fine, all with a gentle, soft and almost silent attitude. This tenderness allows me to understand, because like other beautiful artists or directors, the same pattern is repeated over and over again. In her case, it's like a film that is always the same as her feelings, her values, who live infinite different stories. I still don't know how to define the boundary between artists and works (or fusion). <br /> <br /> Another positive aspect of this movie is its feminine touch and interesting views. Women have their own way of life, even if they are single. It brings a lot of tolerance and learns how the same and unique reality can be perceived in so many ways as humans. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie is quite visible, but the big one cuts the next vision.
