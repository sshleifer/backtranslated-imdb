Inappropriate. The PG rating that this movie receives is another huge mistake made by MPAA. Whale Rider gets PG-13, but this movie gets PG? Please. Parents should not be deceived, taking a primary school child to this movie is a big mistake. Many times I found myself uncomfortable not only because humor was inappropriate for the children, but also because it was completely blue and unnecessary. is still a terrible movie. Casting the film and the overall look are the only rescue work. Beautiful Kelly Preston and always pleasant (or angry in this case) Alec Baldwin are both good in their role, although Preston is almost too beautiful for such a role. Children are conditioned actors and this shows, especially with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only human aspect of the film that kept me looking and not throwing things on the screen. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there was an oversized guy in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely unfortunate. I did not like him as Shrek's voice, and I really believe that Myers should never be allowed around childrens movies. His depiction of a cat is a lightly tinted version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers. <br /> <br /> Finally, the cat shouldn't have come, she should have stayed away, but she came, even if just one day she destroyed 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and quarrel. <br /> <br /> Cats may have the worst children's film.
