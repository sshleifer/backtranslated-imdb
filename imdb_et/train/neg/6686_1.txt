There's no entertainment in this movie. There is no scary, funny or even interesting scene in this movie. It advertises itself as a horror, then calls itself a comedy. It doesn't even reflect humor. Nor does it try to be scary. <br /> <br /> To make this movie dull, you should be one of the easiest in the world of entertainment. If you like this movie even LITTLE BIT if you don't have any standard on what you are looking at. It is very difficult for me to try to understand what the filmmakers were trying to achieve. He's not funny, scary, shocking or intriguing. Was it supposed to be a drama? Because it wasn't dramatic either. <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. Life is too expensive to waste 90 minutes.
