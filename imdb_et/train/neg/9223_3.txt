One of the world's capital of nepotism becomes another junk in the fictional envelope. "CQ" speaks of a flat, ripped confusion story that is a little more than silly silly cartoons, a babe and a straight guy Davies who is trying to make a stupid sci-fi flick. I don't think for some reason that someone would like to spend time trying this ridiculous movie. (D)
