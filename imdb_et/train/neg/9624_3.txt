Given the potential, it was disappointing. Although it is always nice to see Jennifer Aniston's movie, even it couldn't turn it around. Most of the activities were predictable. The jokes were flat, lightly entertaining. And the characters were not very interesting. I wanted to like this movie, but it didn't happen. Ben Stiller was fun "There's something about Mary". Here he seems to be just moving through the movements. If they wanted to raise the plot points from "friends", they should have known that something was wrong. Toilet humor should have been kept in the closet :-). <br /> <br /> See "50 First Date".
