I remember when I was little when I was away from the camp and we drove under the stars. There was always someone with a good story to say that it is related to us that surrounded us and they always climb me. Well, when I found Wendigo library, I checked it, hoping that I was one of those films that had a supernatural creature who haunted people in the forest, like the stories spoken in the camp. Well, for my fear, I was so far from the truth. Wendigo is really bad. The story begins when the three families are driving their winter cabin, which looks like your ordinary suburban home and something like a cabin in the woods, and they get into the deer. Well, local rednecks seem to be quite upset with the hunting of this particular deer and the people of our city. It takes too much time for families to get to the movie instead of going to the movie. In just about 15 minutes, we actually have some activities that include "wendigo". My suggestion is that you stay far away from this movie. It leaves you that you would want your half an hour ago.
