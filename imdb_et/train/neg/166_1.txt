First of all, I didn't sit in front of the "Star Trek" series premiere to see a cowboy running around in the room. so the normal Enterprise episode works. 1 Archer finds fog or something that wants to look at it more closely and wants to look into it, but it can destroy the ship. <br /> <br /> 2 He blows fog and shuttle gets injured ... <br /> <br /> In all the visible episodes, all the problems arise due to Archer's foolish mistakes. Oh, and did you see a preview of one episode showing Archer and T'pol kisses?!?!?!?!?!?!? I was planning to watch this episode, but after that I completely abandoned my business and immediately turned to TV. Come on!!!! This is star trek !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> What was the banana slope? In one episode, Hoshil was hungry for bananas, but he had to leave it for some stupid reason. Okay, good, little stupid to bring pet fools in the room, but whatever. Okay, that was what I thought until they left this desert on the planet !!!!! BANANA SLUG DOES NOT RECOMMEND THAT !!!!!!!!!!!! How stupid are these writers? All sorts of ways, just to say if a company is underway is NOT A VIEW! !!!!!
