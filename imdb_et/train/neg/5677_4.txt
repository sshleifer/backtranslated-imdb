"Seed" is torture porn ... no doubt. But strangely enough, Uwe Boll has written, produced and directed a polished film like any other thing he has recently remembered. the script must be lost. Story and dialogue are just big gaps. Of course, there is no point. Movies are somewhat surreal about this. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> Why do the six police arrest the seeds and go in their different ways when they arrive in a dark place, unlike the actual policemen who entered and cleaned the house in pairs or triplets? Why doesn't the police use their radio? How can institutions decompose so quickly, a process that usually takes several months? (I know this is occasional photography ... but Seed can never stay on schedule to kill people if he has always waited for the previous victim to break down.) How can Seed wear a chest and mask waiting for deaths instead of typical prison forms? How can Seed enter the maximum prison, walk around the cell block, and then walk again without stopping or even noticing? If nearly 80 people have been killed (according to some newspaper articles published in a newspaper), why is there only one investigator in the case? Why did the investigator suddenly decide that he should go to Seed to look for in Seed's house, where he was initially arrested and killed his victims? (Didn't he think about doing it before?) Why does the police detective alone, without backing up and without sending the message, know what he is doing and where he was headed? <br /> <br /> It is especially frustrating if Boll is obviously far from his way to make sure we understand why an electric chair is not working properly. He spends it setting up several screen minutes if he could have made them, making the other aspects of the movie at least a little more logical. <br /> <br /> ***** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> In short, the film is just a framework for some assorted scenes (maybe Boll would think about them) as your "visions"), which is a brutal death that is bursting, head-on, electrocution, and peeling of live animals raised on their skin. (The scenes of opening the animals left on the skin were indeed unnecessary and distracting, but I understand their purpose in the context of the film.) The death of a medieval woman, which Seed uses with a hatchet, is undoubtedly the key. It is obvious that it took a lot of time and it reminds me of the classic "Reservoir Dogs" scene, though without the Steely Dan soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Is this a good movie? No. Is it worth it? Only if you are a dedicated fan of the torture pornography genre or if you have absolutely decided to see torture porn. As I said at the beginning of this review, although this film is quite disgusting and may be ill at points, it is indeed more competent than most Bolli films. Perhaps he will continue to improve as a filmmaker. I can only hope that he will go further than torture porn and continue to "post".
