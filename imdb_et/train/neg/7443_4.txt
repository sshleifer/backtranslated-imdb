There were some scary scenes that I always liked more than straight out, but otherwise the film was quite weak. There were too many questions that remained unanswered and when they tried to explain something in the movie, it was still quite unclear. After watching this movie, I still had a lot of options. It reminded me a few years ago of Silent Hill. This film was also dissatisfied but still better because it tried to work and the story really made sense. It's not so much. <br /> <br /> Most of the abandoned action was decent, but the movie pulled on and never gave any satisfactory conclusion. As I said before, there were some scary scenes, but otherwise the film was confusing. Sorry, I can't recommend it.
