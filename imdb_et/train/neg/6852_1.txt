This movie is really incredible. I've seen so many cheap trash bins, especially lots of "Full Moon" pictures, but "Dollman" is very difficult. So much comes together: a ridiculous story, actors always at the parody and special effects! How long can I talk about them! This is really a bad movie, but also one of the funniest. If you are a laughing fan of bad movies, you have to see it. And don't miss the Dollman vs Demonic Toys. It's really funny and worse.
