I know that there are other things in this episode than what I am discussing, and in fact I think it has some virtues; for example, after Jin had been given a very negative opinion of seeing Sun's setbacks in "Rising Sun's House", we see Jin's things and get a new, more balanced understanding of his life. <br /> <br /> But there is one element in this story that made me so uncomfortable that it greatly reduced the enjoyment of my entire episode. Before that, the scene where Jin appeared in the blood and in the shirt suggested that Sun's father was someone who was rich in shady and illegal methods. I thought maybe he was the mob's boss; mobs are operating in Korea like almost all other countries in the world, so it was a reasonable option. In this episode, we learn that Sun's father is actually a Korean car maker boss (or top manager) and that what Jin had done was a physical attack on a government official (who was actually murdered). I can especially feel this because I work in the car industry, but I would say it is SPECTACULARLY insulting and racist even to assume that such a thing is happening in Korea; that big serious companies like Hyundai or Kia (which must be the model of this fictitious car company, because they are the only ones that actually exist in reality), work with these mafia-like methods, not like any ordinary automotive company. West. for me it is just incredible that writers would have a letter to write something like that, and that Korea is not against it. It seems like a stranger to "Buy America!" propaganda depicting foreign car manufacturers as a criminal, unreliable third world outfit.
