Dan Duryea, a perfectly decent B-film actor who made a lot of looks in the 1940s, can't do much of it: the young man is accused of killing a married singer unhappy; when he is understood to die, he decides with the help of the wife of the deceased wife. After the dazzling opening image, flick quickly lives on the B-film formula. Certainly it looks good, but the twists and turns are colorless and cast (including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford) are just a bit stiff. Based on Cornell Woolrich's novel and one-to-one view satisfactory. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
