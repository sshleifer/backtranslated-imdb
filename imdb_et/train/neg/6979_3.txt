I also watched this movie, and although it is very well done, I found it as a heartbreaker and would not recommend it to small children. the train is truly heartbreaking. And the sad thing is - inside dies. Finally he goes back to the Applacia Mountains. The whole world of money he makes from making dolls does not hide his grief. I remember the face of his despair when he pulls his fabric out of money to try his baby healthy. I'm surprised that this movie is in Detroit, because when I watched it, I thought people had come to Cincinnati, Ohio. It was also the way to the poor mountains.
