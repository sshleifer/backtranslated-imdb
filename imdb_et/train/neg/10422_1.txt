First of all, I am not afraid easily ... Something except my little phobias, but this movie is absolutely terrible. It's not suitable for kids at all! I had my mouth open all the time, it just shocked me. Could not believe how it was for a children's movie where the bunnies were murdered brutally! It's just unnecessary to be so terrible and appreciable. But don't get me wrong, it was probably a good movie when I wasn't a mental child like a child. I can't believe a parent would say to say, a 4-year-old child. For young children, it is simply intense and difficult, not to forget. I'm over 4 years old and I was shocked by the violence. I do not recommend
