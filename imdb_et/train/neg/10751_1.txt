Why did I waste this money on Sundance's last day? I want a refund ... Can I get my $ 16 back? When I watched this movie, I was expecting something to happen, nothing happened. The only way I even knew what it was supposed to be was reading a plot that didn't like the film. Why did the director zoom in with his camera and then zoom in? It was not very artistic. Why did the director show Lulu fifteen minutes of his nails? Why is it when the actors tried to talk so they sounded like they were? Or was that point? I felt that Phantom Love had no story at all, and it was honest that I felt that my friends' vacation videos were much more entertaining than this movie.
