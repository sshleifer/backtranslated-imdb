What was dealing with clothing? They were all dressed up in the early 1970s. Cars were even outdated. The school was out of date. The Nuns' attire was outdated and the hospital looked like in the 40s, with its churches and wooden stairs and stuff. Nothing in the film included the fact that it happened in 1991. My mother laughed, saying, "Geeeee-od! When was this movie?" When we pressed "INFO BUTTON" on the remote control, we were sure that 1991 had to be a typo! Did anyone notice this? But my favorite part was when she talked to her husband about her resurrection by phone in the mirror of an inverted cross and she just says, "Well, look, I have a congressional meeting. I'll tell you later." This line was just classic. JUST THE SAME MAN! My mothers favorite was when they gave "Fucking Child" to their own Rottweiler. My mother said, "Just what the devil's spirit needs ... rottweiler" He also enjoyed all the people who collapsed in the church, linking their chests. His MUU favorite was the boy on the parking lot, driving 5 miles per hour, driving directly to the garbage truck / truck / front loader. He had about 20 seconds to just stop the car ... but he just went, with a real foolish look on his face. I mean how fast can you park at school?!?! What ever!
