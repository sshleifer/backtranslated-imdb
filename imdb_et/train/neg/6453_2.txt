There is nothing at all to recommend this movie. Chase Masterson is always nice to look at and actually act, although his role in this clunker is waste. Unfortunately, the rest is out of the wrong average. In many such films, someone shines through the material and makes them aware of them for the future. There is no such happiness here. Creature Unknown "clich√© monster-on-the-loose flick with kids can be knocked one after the other. The monster is a man in a rubber suit that listens to the day of Paul Blaisdell. So bad it is good! The rest of the exhibition is so bad that it's bad. humor could have made it more tasty, but everyone plays deadly dull material straight up, eventually twist or two, but then you don't care anymore.
