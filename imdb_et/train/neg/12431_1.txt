I would like to say that curiosity was the best for me. If only I saw the trailer, I would be able to tell the whole plot of the movie; I would have been able to save myself the least pointless and forty minutes in my life and about twenty dollars. This movie was a catastrophe that was supposed to happen, and it is embarrassing for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Film shows lively ignorance of reality. For example, this car's remote control car goes over the neighborhood and even enters that home. It's even covered with clothes. Isn't it reasonable to believe that the remote control can no longer transmit the signal in these circumstances? Hollywood probably didn't believe it. The common concept of logic and electronics says the opposite; I doubt the racing car would have even reached the street, not to mention the house across the street. Another unrealistic feature is the lack of intelligence that criminals have. Why are all these films, these criminals are rocket scientists until they are in contact with an eight-year-old? The child is meant to be the most intelligent person in the film instead of professional terrorists? Please, Matrix has more reality. Also, the driver puts his true gun down and "randomly" chooses a plastic gun; he probably couldn't say that difference. Even with a glove, it should be possible to do so. Just because they look the same, it doesn't mean anything; then there are other senses. Traps are also unrealistic; if any of them actually worked, the criminals would have died. But Hollywood is going to "laugh" us in the "funny" results of the traps. I didn't laugh; I sighed and drove my eyes. <br /> <br /> But I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie; the movie they saw seems like that to Citizen Kane. Otherwise, skip it for pride. Home Alone 3 also raises the question. We all know the stars of Alex D. Linz, but did he write it?
