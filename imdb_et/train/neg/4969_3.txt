First of all, it's not as close as it is as bad as some other Sci-Fi Channel trash bins; that doesn't mean Grendel is a good movie, but it's really bad, but it was definitely much better. The drawbacks of the film come from the character's character, character, absurd story enhancements, visual effects, music, and mostly: actors. Of course, this means how our heroes and villains see. Beowulf and the other Danes seem to be ridiculous Vikings, not brute-strength warriors - the helmet that the main protagonist carries is just too silly. Grendel looks like Hulk, but his elbows have strange tentacles. <br /> <br /> Characters are very limited. Beowulf is the same from start to finish, but Finn - a meaningless sidekick - achieved some two-dimensionality, thanks to his romantic subfield and Unferth also has a concept because he becomes less cautious. <br /> <br Like the Finns, this story has unnecessary additions to make it stand alone while retaining source material. Beowulf's gifted cross-section is so ridiculous, I'm surprised that the cast did not go. In addition to the improvements, there are also drawbacks such as the main topics of Christianity and paganism and the consequences of lying. <br /> <br /> Special effects are awful. Grendel and his mother Hag are poorly prepared and therefore they are less plausible on the screen. <br /> <br /> Music is superfluous, especially when a character dies. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's not the worst movie ever. No. It's actually one of the best movies, though it's still a trash, it's a good trash, making it a blame for the joy at best. The only thing that works is a dialogue that is still wood here. Grendel) is only half the story, not the whole thing that gives this movie three stars.
