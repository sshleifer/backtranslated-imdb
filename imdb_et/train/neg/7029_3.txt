The Phantom Templates is a film that best suits the "just forgotten" category. The famous story of opera phantom by Gaston Leroux is a pretty sad option. It is not a bad idea for itself, but the plot and production of this movie is weak to bring that story to a proper glory. On the bright side, Gaston Leroux doesn't have to turn to his grave yet. It could have been much worse. Phantom Shopping Center has too many useless setbacks and too many boring sequences to make it memorable. The scriptwriters also wanted to tell the story too much if needed. And while there are many secrets about Eric's character, the basic piece is normal and déjà-vu. *** SPOILERS *** This is about a young couple who brutally breaks down because the boy is killed in the fire. This fire set her house because she and her parents refused to sell her home to make room for a large shopping center. The boy lived over the fire and hid himself in the mall. Meanwhile, she watches her girl who is now working in the mall and is trying to forget her loss **** END SPOILERS *** It's quite simple - but rather effective - the plot thickens many pointless elements and annoying conspiracy theories. Although it should be just a fun horror movie, it desperately tries to be an intelligent thriller ... and that's not what fans are looking for. There are some innovative killings, but they don't respond enough to people who want to see a relaxing horror movie. And moreover, Mall Mall would have given at least some humor! This whole production - including - is too serious. <br /> <br /> I will try to finish with some positive aspects ... As for example, it also marks Ken Foree !! Serious horror fans will surely feel him as the threshold of Peter's dead! It's like a horror's milestone that has to find another place. Although her role in this film is limited and even totally unnecessary, it was good to see her again. TV movie fans also recognize Mayor Morgan Fairchild, a good actor and an elegant lady. Pauly Shore is also in this, but I can't tolerate him ... so my opinion about him can be a bit biased. And finally, a bit of praise for the leading actor named Kari Whitman. She is a very beautiful girl and has a little talent ... too bad that she never did it. In fact, this film is his greatest achievement and it says enough about his career ...
