<br /> <br /> As usual, I was very looking forward to a new TV / movie from my favorite subject - making a nice change * from a strangely familiar * documentary about Kursk or Stalingrad on the history channel. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to the Pearl Harbor and the enemy gate - but it had fallen naked on the ground with the realization of Hollywood's malicious, buggy-toning power - and its ability to spend absolute happiness So I got excited again for "Evil Rise", especially when I heard Ian Kershaw was involved as I enjoyed my book. I see why he gave up. <br /> <br /> Citing a man in charge of this garbage: <br /> <br /> "Kershawi's book was an academic work," he said. "It was <br /> <br /> quite dry. We needed more incidents." <br /> <br /> Incidents? Are they completely nuts? Hitler's life cannot be said without an "incident" - yes Kershaw's two volumes Hitler's biography was long and detailed, but they were supposed to be. </p> <br /> <br /> Hitler was a very bad man - no, he was a very bad person, HATED jews, and just in case you forget it, we emphasize this movie in the EVERY scene. <br /> <br /> There was no effort to explain the time's rationale and why Hitler was able to accept his views and strategy. Needless to say, unlike the generally excellent Nazi - a warning from history - this film overlooked the fact that almost all of the communist uprising leaders in Munich were Jewish, and that it could be an absolutely important aspect of his views on this subject - and his axioms of bolshevism and bolshevism. understand a bit of Nazi time. <br /> <br /> But there was not much understanding of what to do - the filmmakers are not going to go there, so we got all the things we knew anyway. Surely we will not be excited that Kershaw refers to what Hitler is shortly socialist / communist right after WW1. It would, of course, be too complicated to handle the film and could even worsen the relentless "he was very bad" mantra that endlessly strikes. <br /> <br /> We know he was a bad man. But we also know that he was an enchanting figure in both the public and private sectors. He may be polite and even sympathetic, and of course he supported some views, such as vegetarianism, anti-alcohol and anti-smoking, which many Guardian readers could accept. She was also fond of animals, so the scene of dragging the totally invented dogs was so absurd. <br /> <br /> He was also a brave soldier from all my accounts, WW1. Although we saw him with his Railroad, we never see how he won it (the deeds of courage was not in the script, it goes without saying). We also get no idea why he fired his war experiences so much, while Sassoon, Owen, Brook, Remarque and so many others thought he was so repulsive. And again, as is the case with the Jewish / Bolshevik links, it is imperative that anyone understand the subject. Why did he love the war so much? Why did he think it was always a good idea, despite the massive contradictory evidence? Why didn't he care about his colleagues who died? Or maybe he did - but he made the wrong conclusions. <br /> <br /> There was no such interest in this film either. <br /> <br /> As too often, in days, the film is a classic example of "dealing with current history" and finding things or leaving inconvenient facts to fit with the "current", which is too often to satisfy the lowest common denominator audience by inch, so you just pull your throat down, knowing (unfortunately correctly) that you will always get away with it because there are so many fools in the world. <br /> <br /> History is really about making our past relevant and seeing it as our current, better and worse color. This garbage was a great opportunity, disappeared again. They spent millions on it, places and big scenes were impressive, but they didn't tell us something we didn't already know and promoted the understanding of this dark time in human history. <br /> <br /> WT
