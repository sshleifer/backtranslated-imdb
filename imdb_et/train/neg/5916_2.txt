The gently slow pace of this film was probably the director's explicit intention to pass on what life was like serving the village in China. But I found that the combination of the slow "plot" of the glacier and the general filming style is so personal that it would be completely unfamiliar, especially to the western audience. Sometimes I really had trouble differentiating some characters because they were filmed at such a distance. Two hours and I was completely gone. Since no one is interested in music but is also very much in Chinese history and culture (and is not a Chinese cinema otherwise), I couldn't deal with a single character and found nothing to get my teeth. This raises the question: if I don't want the one who would like it on earth? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me some other Chinese director I've ever seen. This unfortunate effort does not understand at all. I am sorry that the Chinese cinema is valued by this benchmark.
