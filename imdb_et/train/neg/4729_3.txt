LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE is one of Elvis's strange films. Part blow, part fluffy, part surreal and partly strange. Elvis meets the girl with a very nervous voice. She looks like Jennifer Aniston. The story doesn't make much sense, as is the case with most Elvis Presley films, and there are a lot of odd characters. Not much music in it, but I liked it, though none of them are memorable. Strange consistency. Elvis and Michelle Carey go to their beach at night, but a few minutes later the boy arrives and it is a tough day! What ?? This is the nature of the film. What ?? Oh, two good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks good and B) The dog steals the exhibition.
