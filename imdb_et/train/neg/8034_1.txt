I know that slashes should always be bad, but come on, what the hell is that? It's like a bunch of 10-year-olds who saved their lunch money and started filming their weekend. In any case, six young people all go to the same house to get killed on the screen. We have a brain, a bitch, another bitch, a black boy, a killer, such stereotypes. shaking the boat, others get everyone wearing a mask who carries the mask back in the poor box. There's one pretty decent mourning somewhere in the middle, but then it's more boredom and more of a lie. we really know it can't be a killer when a person can attack because a man will definitely love his sweet time for everything. <br /> <br /> After every character you died, a normal ugly blonde dies and her up-and-coming boyfriend finally gets to the killer (they get like, pressed down and then weak) and the killer reveals herself. that the writers of this film took the blind and the pencil and put it on a list of characters somewhere. The motive is just flat and can't even get me a fucking secret. too much time to explain everything (and then about ten minutes extra when he cuts his hand for some reason) and finally gets a gun guy. Hey, it's not fair! <br /> <br /> Really one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. I can enjoy myself more by watching Lindsay Lohan's movie, I swear. I'm sure most of the 80 slashers suck too, but at least they threw in some R&D. he has nothing to do with it.
