You have to be joking !! Let's entertain the chance that Parker Posey is really an actor, and not just some entries for "Quirk's Month's Club" actors. Really, if it is not meant to be a tongue-in-cheek satire, David Mametil, a tangled, confusing dialogue offered alternately in the speed of a machine gun or monotonous (think of Ben Stein) tenderness - or flat dry comedy; this movie must be on the Rotten Tomato Award (or worse). <br /> <br /> If rigid and uncomfortable Posey is not enough, we will have a tougher and even more uncomfortable Jeff Goldblum. This film has more wood than a toothpick in the factory. <br /> <br /> Adding this bizarre casting has a number of other roles played by unforgettable actors who look or sound like America's next best model, Don Pardo, or even a child who says "was" like " beans, which simply draws our attention to the fact that there is so little to remember about this film, we analyze his accent so he thinks he is Canadian or not !! I think I smiled heartily at places that should be serious, and took seriously the sections that are meant to be humorous. Even the soundtrack sounds like Alarik Jans' music for Mameti's "The House of Games". If it is considered stupid, the film is almost stupid; seriously, just a self-aware piece.
