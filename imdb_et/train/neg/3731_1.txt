I was born in a "very Christian" household. I was rescued before I saw this movie and the rest of the series and I was forced to watch it in a youth group in my church. This movie was very disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and literally had been a nightmare for years. I slept in bed awake and listened to the upper part of my mother's footprints. If I didn't hear his traces, I'd be up to make sure he wasn't kidnapped. I prayed so hard every night that I saved my salvation because I was scared that Jesus forgot me. This is certainly not something I will show to my children until they are much older, if any. It took me years to shake the fear that this film gave me.
