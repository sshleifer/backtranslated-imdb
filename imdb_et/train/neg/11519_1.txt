This is the most stupid movie I've ever seen. What a great cast waste. This is James Cromwell as the ignoramus who plays the deputy. I could continue and continue, but I would probably spend more time on this review than someone who ever did with the script. The only thing this film talks about is us and against them and how to eat in a prophetic blow outside reasonable human tolerance. This is one of the 10 worst films I've ever seen - and I love James Garner.
