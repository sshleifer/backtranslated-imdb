First of all, I loved Henry Fool, which makes me a very small filmmaker. Parker Posey is today one of the best actors on the screen. But this movie was the perfect travesty. Looking at Hartley and the actors from the movie to extremes - both proudly and making meaningless analogues to Star Wars - was a stomach appeal. It was part of the producers (HDNET). A real example of the emperor and his new clothes. Most of the time, I feel Hal has broken HENRY FOOL forever. I don't think I can see it again in a clean and innocent light. <br /> <br /> Remember Hal, you can schedule some people ... etc. Today, if everything he did was a pointless garbage removal. Unfortunately, this is a pure example of the lesson taught in ADAPTATION. The story must be exciting and active, or the hopes of its post offices are dim. Don't forget a decent story. For the actors it was like trying to act in a hurry. <br /> <br /> I think the score is tasteless. Walking through the drum hits all over the dialogue. There was one Apple Soundtrack loop that I felt gave me a smile. <br /> <br /> When I saw the trailer, I thought they were just trying to catch a new audience. But this is really a ridiculous journey. I'd love to spoil this movie for you, but it's done. It's rotten. The FOOL franchise is dead. Long live Henry Fool.
