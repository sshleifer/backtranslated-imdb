Slash flicks are few and far from days, so when I heard about Cut, I had great hopes and heard good things about it. The good things I heard were all wrong. This flick is bad and I mean BAD. It's just stupid. All about that. Especially the origin of the killer and how he lives and how he is finally cared for. There is nothing original or outstanding about this flick. Just another sliding wannabe with their "Hip", "Self aware". "Movie savvy" characters. I'm so sick. Someone else does something because the slash genre needs new blood, literally.
