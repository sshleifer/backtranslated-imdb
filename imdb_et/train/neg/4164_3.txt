<br /> <br /> The planetary world has left some poor and hungry rag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever, after a war of war or something that has almost destroyed the civilization of the whole person. In these dark times, one of the few people in the Earth who still can live comfortably, we call him All the Conscious Big Boss, a great effort to avoid some of the secret spores of seeding into the air. It seems that all the knowledgeable big bosses are the last person to know that these spores exist. The spores are far from every living soul and are protected by many layers of deadly defense systems. <br /> <br /> All knowing Big Boss wants secret spells to remain in their secret sheltered containers. So, he plans to send a moco team to remove spore containers from all defense systems and secret locations. Sending people to the location of secret spores will no longer make them secret. Sending people to turn off all protection systems makes it easy to release the spores. How to sleep dogs to lie?! <br /> <br /> The ENCRYPT's delightful feature is the radiant and elegant Vivian Wu. As unobtrusive macho action team members abandon mechanically rapidly predictable timing, involving Vivian Wu's charm accepts the plot idea that his old employer wants him so much. He is the object of love, the object of desire - a very credible concept. <br /> <br /> Fans of Vivian Wu may wish to see a remarkable B-film he has named DINNER RUSH a few years ago. DINNER RUSH is highly recommended. There is no ENCRYPT.
