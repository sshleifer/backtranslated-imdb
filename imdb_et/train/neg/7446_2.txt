I have two words for you. Sean Bean. He's the only worthy movie in this movie. But it doesn't even see this movie. Although he is a good main villain, you don't want to waste your time. <br /> <br /> I don't care about the characters (except for the little boy), and in fact I didn't care if the stars crossed lovers or died. The film didn't care about me and I don't think these people take care of each other at all. I've read a lot of "classic" novels when I read the movie, and this movie doesn't even let me read the book. The story seems so boring. But I can go ahead and read it to try the end of my story. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Doone. The actor who played Lorna was also in sense and sensitivity, and it was much better. Watch Sharpe, Horatio Hornblower, A & E have great novels like Pride and Prejudice. Or ministries like the Forsyte Saga. Check them out, don't worry about Lorna Doone.
