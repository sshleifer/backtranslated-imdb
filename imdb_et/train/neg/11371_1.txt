"Documentary" and we use this concept loosely, agreeing that Muslims are trying to take over the world violently. Then it claims that all Muslims who do not recognize it are aware of their faith or lie on their faces! Every person interviewed in the film has also found their market of ridiculous reality by selling claptrap to conservatives who want to let others think about them. What you need to know in the West is that it is nothing more than propaganda directed at the mental shore. If you are looking for a real documentary about the current situation in Islam and the Middle East, I would look elsewhere. Try something that provides many perspectives from qualified sources.
