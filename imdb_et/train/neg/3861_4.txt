I am not a big fan of roms / coms in the best times. Some have been pretty good (Dream for Insomniac), but it's just the same, but less. <br /> <br /> With 100min running time, I expect more than 1 laugh every 30 minutes. The only real stomach to laugh is when male assistants and friends help Lee's character. <br /> <br /> Everything I can say is OPEN. I have at least 10 other shelf movies that deserve you $ <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (and only cos I'm a big Lee fan)
