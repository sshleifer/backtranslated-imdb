The sentimental school drama "We Surpass", which took place in Denmark in 1969, offers a deplorable Danish culture in US culture. Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), a buggy, naive 13-year-old, leaves half of the ear hanging from the brutal master Lindum-Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Lindum-Svendsen, the director of a school depicted as a fossil tyrant, has a local community. Lindum-Svendsen has gone too far during this time and recovered with his father due to mental degradation (certainly not enough drama already ..) and too stereotyped by Hippie music teacher Mr. Svale ("Hi, call me Freddie"), Frits stands for justice . <br /> <br /> Tell you what. It has been so convincing, over (methodological), and so full of suffering that the "family" image is not a grotesque filled with a clich√©-apologized film, convincingly persuading non-Scandinavian audiences. Sorry, readers who are Danish to get together for your sentimental trips. But it is definitely not a story that "a boy becomes a man in the fight against the system". The boy never becomes a man, but remains naive, big-eyed crying. When you call a small entertainment small town, led by a dictator, such as the multimedia system "system", I am sorry if I am missing something. <br /> <br />, look at Happy Feet instead.
