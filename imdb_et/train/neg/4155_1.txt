Okay, I knew it would be the back of the F-movie (below B-movie standards), so I thought, "Man, I could use a good laugh, so let's see some creatures kill each other." I could have found it in your local "love toy" store. Random lesbian scenes, very little fight and no plot. For example, I remember, for example, one scene (only because of this stupid fool, I have seen better porn in ABC). characters (I don't remember their names ... big movie, do they?) drive along as they usually did, and the driver was tired of driving and stopping: <br /> <br /> Driver: "Let's pull over, I'm You want to take over? "Passenger:" Of course, I can drive for a while. " (When the driver is pulled, the driver begins to catch the rider's chest.) Passenger: "What are you doing? I'm not so!" Driver: "It's OK, everyone will do it sometime." Passenger: "OK then." (Continue to remove shirts, pampering, kissing, and pampering) <br /> <br /> Now that I last checked, horror movies at the Hollywood video porn section (if you haven't been into S&M) are going to go elsewhere) and it shouldn't be sure to be blockbuster mainstream videos. Don't do me wrong; I am certainly not one of those people who hate porn, but I only look at it when appropriate, and certainly don't want to watch it when I search for a movie in mainstream stores because what I rented was one of two retailers I called (and probably the other when I went and watched). <br /> <br /> The worst film ever, no one should rent it and it should only be purchased for a public burning ceremony. If I give it to 0, I'd like it, but I can only give it to 10.
