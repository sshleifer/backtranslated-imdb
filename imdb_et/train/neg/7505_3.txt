This long-term film turns out to be less of a Berkowitz and his influence on NYC, but rather of a certain Italian-American group of paintings known locally as "Guidos". The problem is that "Guidos" is uninteresting, no matter what story or setting they put in. They are already living cartoons, so Lee only amplifies them instead of just imagining them. <br /> <br /> When someone has done the caricature themselves, they won't go home and say, "Hey, let's make the ears bigger and bigger!" This is what Lee has done in this movie. The most interesting characters of the film are two (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito) who want to escape the "Guido" lifestyle. Type it into memorable characters, especially John Leguizamo, and you can get a nice movie to sleep with. Especially since it is a long-term working time. <br /> <br /> Another hit: somebody who declares himself a fan of Yankees and has grown up in New York, Spike Lee should know how Phil Rizzuto, which is the closure credit, is wrong.
