This movie is so much that it is the hanging of the "demons" of the masterpiece, and that is the only thing that makes it worth watching the movie. Acting is terrible, action scenes are accelerated, the script is almost painful and the budget doesn't exist. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is good, you haven't seen a real horror movie, skip it and get a copy of the movie demons.
