Spiritual and not Christian. I thought I'd really adhere to my faith, but what is the burden on the spectators. I thought the film would have great arguments, but only unilateral views of atheists and Jews? And who are all those people in the street with whom he interviews, who doesn't know his hand behind his head. Where are the right theologians and priests and the things he would have received. Not retired nuts who wrote books and graduated in 1970. Personally, it was a waste of DVD time and wasn't worth my time to check if the facts were right or wrong or should I believe, because anti-Christ told me so. I think he came to the conclusion that he could not find God because his own ego and demons were better than him. Not im not saying that the film was a stunning aid to atheists who read it, feel better. But if you really want to show the world what we care about, the poor souls who believe in Jesus will attract us with their worth, not their drum.
