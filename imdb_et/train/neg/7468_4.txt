Probably the only thing that got me a movie up to four is that I love Peter Falki. One of the world's greatest burdensome incompetence imaginators. . . and yet it is one of the only anchors that prevents it from a chaotic disaster. Like Pops Romano, he offers a respectable gangster game and a straight man mix with Chris Kattan's manic fool. Richard Roundtree, a respectable performer, a Venera Shaw talented female FBI agent who bounces off her head from a glass ceiling and Fred Ward as a Falck advisor and Benedict Arnold also offers the honorable director. he has some great opportunities and the young Steve Martin or Chevy Chase could have been a great comic. Katan, who seems to be an idolizer of Ernest or Pee Wee Hermann, just offers confusion. Unfortunately, Peter Berg and Chris Penn, who represent their wrong brothers, are far from having proven capabilities. <br /> <br /> There are some very funny scenes, but they are too small and too much boring. What I'm not really talking about here is what always attracted me to Leslie Neilsen's films. There is no other degree of escape. There are no cultural references that only adults can get. . double participants. . it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> And by the way, that doesn't mean I would recommend it to your 9-year-old because I hope they have a better taste and less charm for some of their body parts and their functions.
