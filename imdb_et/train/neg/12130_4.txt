Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi (funeral area) and produced by the legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci. Now that this is a great talent mix, you think this movie would have been a real gore fest. It can't be further away. Massacre falls to the right because it is one of the most boring films I saw in the Italian cinema. I was really awake during the movie and I've never had such a problem with Italian horror movies. <br /> <br /> The massacre begins with a whore who is killed by a roadside ax. This scene was used at Fulci's nightmare concert. This is not a bad scene and it will raise your expectations for a movie that is killing. Of course, the next hour of the movie is SO boring. The film goes on filmed in a series of fiction films, and all of these scenes have a lot of character, but the characters in the film are so empty and badly acting that your interests will leak. The last 30 minutes of the movie are not so bad, but it could have been much better. The film's gore was pathetic, and since Fulci used most of the Nightmare Concert gore scenes, there was nothing new here. At the end of the movie, there was a nice twist, but there was still a lot of unanswered response, and continuity falls directly on the floor. <br /> <br /> It was not a very good movie, but a freak of a real Italian horror (like me, this movie is black because it's very rare. 4/10 stars
