Lynch. The man has some very good things! He knows how to distract us, reward us, thinking us differently. However, this is completely different. Dumbland's reward is 1% absurd comedy, earning 99% stupidity. Maybe I laughed once, but somewhere around episode 4, I started to look quickly. There was nothing left behind. I felt relieved when it ended, and that is part of this series. It is a tedious number of annoying symbols in annoying situations that are rounded by annoying animation, voices and sound. But recognizing this and its other absurd qualities is not yet worthy of Dumbland.
