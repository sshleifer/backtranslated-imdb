This movie is bad. When you look at it, there is only one good scene in the movie and it takes about 5 seconds (Amanda Carraway topless scene). The rest of the movie is terrible. I think playing high school is probably better. The plot doesn't make any sense at all. The set was pretty flat and it wasn't even good. It was just boring and very bad! I watched it on Starz, so I thought it should be at least decent. A little description sounded like it was good. The girlfriend will probably kill her for some reason at the beginning of the movie after you have to watch some terrible music videos. The transitions between the scenes are very steep, and like anyone just puts a lot of clips on the movie without even thinking about how to convert them. Just cut from one scene to another, uniformity. Like my accidental transition, talking about how bad the film is, explain why the plot sucks. The sound falls on some points where you can hardly hear it, then the sound sounds "screaming in fear", which is thrown into the random places of the film. This is the same sound every time. This is now officially the worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> By: 0/10 Effects: 1/10 Story: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Lame-meter: 1,000,000 / 10
