There are people who are getting worse! This is the only explanation I can offer why a dead house exists. And it's just a scary part of the whole movie. It is so bad that you will miss movies forever. I wanted to turn it off seriously and transfer the TV to the color cleaning channel, but my word forced me to suffer. I don't know why I'm doing these bad things myself. <br /> <br /> As it is important, here is the story. The twenty-fold group is so desperate to go to some of the Pacific Northwest Islands (in fact, it is cheap) for a century's rave (consisting of about eight people and unforgettable music) to pay some $ 1000 for an old fisherman to get there after the main ship absent. It must be nice to have it all worth the dough! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the island of the dead (hanging-I thought it was a dead house) and that they are all doomed by the yadda. <br /> <br /> First errors here. Why are some small islands considered a small small robber (my century leg!)? Why should someone pay peacefully to get it? Why pay even more to older fishermen to take them back when they came back with others? <br /> <br /> When they arrive, they discover that the rave (consisting of about 2 tents, a small stage) and a port-a-john are broken, there is blood everywhere, and no one is around. What does each rational thinking do? Create your life of course. But no, those helpless, obviously blind people decide to look for them. Soon they will discover an old aging house that is 50 times bigger inside. The next twenty forest stumbling in the woods is an excuse for killing some of the smaller stars, and after a lot of tedium they come back to the house again. Characters, like a movie, go somewhere. <br /> <br /> In this strange catastrophe, a gibberish dialogue, a scary, mumbo-jumbo exposition, and zillions of clips from a one-time popular arcade game will surprise you. same name. Why it was generally recognized as a good idea for filmmakers I never know. The clips do not point to any scene or even worsen the trash if it is possible at all. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with a game saved on a cheap, thrown line. end. Resident Evil looks like kinematic splendor. Hell, even the Double Dragon movie seems to be worth several Oscar, compared to its spam. Jurgen Prochnow is the only one out of this dignified human dignity. He could have just taken his money and ran, but he was trying his best with the terrible script and bringing his character to a small number of sins. The rest of the cast suck afraid. The characters are idiots and deserve to die. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you cut out the oath and nonsense nudity, I see no reason why this movie on Saturday morning television cannot be shown. It's not the least scary. Pirates of the Caribbean are more frightening guys in the skeleton of this film. And where did all these bad guys come from? To begin with, there were only a few people on the island. I think it justifies the reason why they chose the video again and again. I don't make you, you see the same zombie death ten times. <br /> <br /> Who is ultimately guilty of scandalous cellulose waste? Nothing but Director Uwe Boll. He has no control over the film. You can clearly see that the actors do not know what they should do and that the zombies do not really take it seriously. Actors look like they read smart cards because they stop constantly in the middle of long sentences and continue to talk as they see the next card. It all seems very unnatural. <br /> <br /> The plus is filmed as a two-part mini-series. I've really seen better TV shows. And don't let me start editing. The film is inconsistent with thousands of thousands of meaningless shots and dozens of meaningless camera panes. No real skill or talent was at all. It really repels and talks about how the films that it is unlikely to get, and George A. Romero, can't even take any of his speeches. The House of Death makes some idiotic references to Romero's lazy attempt to be postmodern, but it only irritates them to think it is in the same league as a real zombie movie. <br /> <br /> It is worth the 1.85: 1 anamorphic image to look good and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and is only used to pronounce a heavily used ADR. The DVD has extras but why you torture yourself. Isn't this review warning enough? Stay away! You are all condemned! Destroyed! Destroyed !!!
