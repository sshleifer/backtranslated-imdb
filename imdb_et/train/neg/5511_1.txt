I have to agree with the first comment: this movie sucks very, very hard. Despite choosing a very large B list, the film's cover (for those who don't see it on Comedy Centralis on the day of the week, which is probably the only exposure to this film), is to blame Dangerfield, but in reality it is just a comedian of the 80's who has been. Randy Quaid? Check it out. Ed Begley, Jr.? Check it out. Lisa Simpson's voice? He can now say that Maximum Overdrive was not his only terrible flick: double check. And so many, many others. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this fucking thing is that it was so lax written with jokes already spoken. Something about this movie outside its existence is funny. You're better off drying. This is definitely a direct scrap of video that still believes in old video chat: throw the old letters on the cover and get the money back from renting. Considering the change in the days of video rental, consider this as one of the last, for example, removal of garbage. <br /> <br /> Only use this movie if you have trouble sleeping. It will take you there.
