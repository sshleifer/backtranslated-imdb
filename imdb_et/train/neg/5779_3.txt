I saw this movie a few days ago ... what the hell was that? <br /> <br /> I like movies with Brian O'Halloran, they are funny and enjoyable. When I saw the title and genre name, I thought perfectly, it might be good ... some parody to slashers or some other gore movie ... but ... then I read the preview and thought it might be good .. but it wasn't ... <br /> <br /> my opinion: when movies look like documentaries, try a little comedy to try Moore movies or alien autopsy, they are really something. it was empty. <br /> <br /> and put a comedy on the title ... no comment ... really a bad joke
