Yes, it is. This movie was terrible. Two minutes I wanted my eyes to go out. It has been praised as "innovative LDS comedy", but it is not good for even members of this church! I don't think any person should be so victimized to watch this low quality movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, you can say that no effort was made in this movie. It seems that the terribly drab, glib, tritiated plot was thrown away by two mad farms that were somehow strange to give a coherent (at least semi-coherent) thought. Then there is the activity that is * all involved. Even cameos didn't enliven anything. <br /> <br /> Let us not forget that our main character is the low jerk whom we would like to believe can change, but this path is full of embarrassingly bad dialogue, terribly outrageous "gags" and many "Mormon" jokes that anyone who is in their right mind, LDS or not, should consider purely * stupid *! It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen!
