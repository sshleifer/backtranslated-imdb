We have an average family. Father is a famous rapper, we have a "supernatural teenage daughter", a white boy and a cute little boy. And we have a careless housekeeper that has such a household at the show? Do we have a hidden Brady Bunch? Yes! When it first came out, I thought it was really cool, mainly because I was young. The music was bad. The rape was so bad and they were too g-rated. All his rapes were related to his family and friends, and problems. The father was a kind of "Danny from the plenary" father. Always give advice. But he was not a pure freak. They had a housekeeper for that. Remember? The plots were basically Lil 'Romeo was in some kind of trouble or ... it's not. Oh, and maybe some preteen drama. Yes, this stuff is good. Not quite. But this is still a good show for children. But Nikelodean could do better.
