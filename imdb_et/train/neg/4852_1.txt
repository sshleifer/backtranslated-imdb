I saw this movie once and I thought it was OK. Then my friends said at work: "Follow it again, it's better". So I did. And for the second time it was a WORSE! There's a limit to the word so I can roll the ball out of here. Why on earth is anyone waiting for an explosion to start? - None of the characters here are far from pleasant. Not the first time, not the second time. <br /> <br /> -We and the last time I checked, the car does not explode from one firearm, nor does it get a fire that pulls out a small fire extinguisher ... does the above-mentioned 3/10 viewer actually watch the movie? - The camera is so shaky, I barely say what's going on. This scene, opened on a robot, was left in my belly, the rest of the film wasn't much better. <br /> <br /> - Sniper scene. McManus Brothers (from "Boondock Saints") rolled his eyes, it was so stupid. First, why did he plant his weapon where one person had shot? Besides, why would he spend a lot of time cleaning, reloading, targeting balls and not shooting if there was so much chaos around him? -SAS Types RUNNING Rather than Stay And Fight Back ?????? Ah ????? Are the soldiers ... gay ... ??? I didn't want a homophobic sound, but honestly, this scene was so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> -Too long for your own, but too short for material. Bigelow seems to think that the more action the better. He seems to be wrong - the film is filled with superfluous operational conditions that are thrown into it to disrupt the absence of a central plot. I know Watchmen is 163 minutes longer, but at least this movie didn't drag. But this film, on the other hand, feels longer. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was Renner, who was the best. But do yourself a favor, just skip it and don't let the jump.
