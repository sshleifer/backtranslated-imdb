it is not possible to express redemption characteristics. I wish I could get my time back. a nice skull face is genuinely smiling, the camera is bright when the illness has already disrupted the ill-informed script. I was ((spoiler) happy to see all the signs that were dead or severely incapacitated, especially the party poopers who drink the smashed juice on the alleged sunset. Eli Roth may shine in ten moments, pointing out the theory of how well weeds smoke in the forest, while others are actually shrinking beer. in general, I found most of this meaningless, though not without unreasonable violence and not enough nudity, rejoicing that they mostly saw death, wanting the trip never to happen (apparently supposed to be provided instead of delaying TBS) at night, ugh).
