How was this trash on a movie? The only actor who is known to me is Judge Reinhold, an actor whose presence is just a justification for producing it. <br /> <br /> I don't even think it's a worthwhile candidate for a rotten tomato prize, this movie really makes B movies for cinematic enjoyment. A car driving along the highway with the police, and no one knows how to stop the car, yes, right. <br /> <br /> The script must be written on the back of the cigarette box. Most TV movies are terrible, but it defines the word again. Explore the operational skills of the bridge operator, the pure Oscar material.
