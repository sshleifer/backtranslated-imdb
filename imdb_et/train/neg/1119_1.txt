Even though this film was said to be a joke in response to critics, it is still a terrible movie. If anyone is going to do at least this thing, this good joke ..... first out, Jeroen Krabbé is probably the poor man Gerard Depardieu ..... of course I hate Gerard Depardieu, though he was a very funny three musketeers "Iron Mask" . Otherwise, he is a poison box and Jeroen Krabbé is worse than that. The poor man's office poison is really that it is not fair to the economically unfair. If the "fourth person" should be some kind of civic criticism .... what am I saying? it is not. Let's say hypothetically that if it were to be, it wasn't sharp enough. Satire is a tricky thing, if it is not sharp enough, the viewer will become a joke ...... I think it happened. The story just ends up as a bunch of worse criminals who do nothing that no one would care about and not in an interesting way ..... (for any more interesting and valuable application, see any Luis Bunuel movie .... very sharp satire) > <br /> [potential spoiler announcement] <br /> <br /> Really blow the job at the cemetery, which Jeroen Krabbé's character is so difficult to achieve ... do you care? is it funny? since Mr. Voerhoven should be a good filmmaker, I give him this doubt and I assume that it was a misanthropic joke that was out of control ... although I think he didn't choose Jeroen Krabbé because he is the worst actor and everybody the one he played has been a terrible civilian ass. So it's like a weird cartoon. Do you think Mr Voerhoven did it for the purpose? and Jeroen Krabbé is also a joke butt? I just don't see it ...... So you understand the dilemma I've come across here? This is the worst film because she should be a good director. So it's a sort of duplication. I knew "Patch Adams" was terrible, not even seeing. Don't be disappointed with the "fourth man" deceptive package or Mr Voerhoven's reputation as a good leader, etc.
