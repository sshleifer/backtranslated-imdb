I liked it in 2004. Then it was very stupid. This shows that children are braided. It offends children. Cartoon Network was great. One of the exhibitions I liked was Hamtaro. It was successful and imaginative in its approach to children's programming. Foster's Imaginary Friends is like 20 spoons of sugar for your Sprite. It seems that today's television producers are only interested in earning money, rather than engaging in the imagination of children and making money! Recently, my kids set up old exhibitions (60s) to find something interesting to see. Perhaps, in the absence of originality, the television would look at its past and recycle the programming of children from the past days.
