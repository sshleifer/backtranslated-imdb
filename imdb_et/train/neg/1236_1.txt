What happened to one of our most innovative and brilliant storyteller of our time? Well, he did a typical summer feed that could have been led by a film school ... and actually they would have done a better job. At least they would have turned to a pointless script. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some kind of wormhole and landed on a planet ruled by monkeys. (Don't!) Except for this time, monkeys are harassing a worthy dialogue, meaningless drawing and an obvious special effect that, in my opinion, constantly confirms that this money could have been put on about 10 independent films that would have been considered "next to" the masterpiece. br /> <br /> As much as I like great actors, Tim Roth, his theatrical perpetrator, Thade, is more than an intense breathing and heavy breathing. The dialogue is hidden behind his storms and scourges, and unfortunately there is always a reliable Hollywood tradition of taking male and female wires and joining them at the end without any kind of relationship or reason. And "haha, we are so smart, aren't we?" Sigh ... <br /> <br /> Instead of seeing it, spend the night and call your friends and rent Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, Batman, or even to a lesser extent, Sleepy Hollow, and recalls the days when Tim Burton had vision and originality ... not ashamed and ridiculous.
