Terrible. I see many user comments about the size of this exhibition. It's really Wanna-Be-Friends - made in Taiwan. Jokes are flat like ... and the plot is ridiculous. The actors are obviously in difficulty to be funny and apparently burst when they hit these terrible punchlines (if you call it). Most other commenting users are probably from another planet (or at least another continent). There is obviously a reason for the TV shows to cancel exhibitions ... and none of them when the shows are fine. Is it logical? Anyway, steer clear - even when it rains and there's nothing else to do on this planet ... go down instead of rain - more fun.
