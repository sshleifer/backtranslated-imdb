The stage director's husband hopes to endorse an American singing and dancing man who is familiar with his wife's last show, an American girl who is making her living modeling in social circles. Unfortunately, the couple has already met independently - the girl thought the boy was actually an exhibition producer married to his friend (the fact that he did not wear a wedding ring should have prevented any misunderstanding!). With the music of Wafty Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers, there is finally an idiotic script by Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott, full of juvenile behavior. Astaire and Rogers are not just "cute" - they meet ridiculously (she dances like a crazy hotel in the suite above and she complains). The 1935 target groups probably don't care about how the two came together - as long as they did and happily. Nowadays it seems that there is no motivation to get into each other's central position: he slips it with flowers (after telling his friend he wants to stay "fancy" in the love department) and he gives him a brush. . Something that little dance could not cure! This glamorous twosome is as deliberately unrealistic as the London and Venetian settings, but we just look at being Fred and Ginger. It's a fantasy for those who aren't ... those who don't talk stupidly. The musical moments break the monotony of the established scenario, but cannot overcome the surrounding stupidity. ** from ****
