It's just a terrible, really terrible trash. Yes, we have beautiful naked women dancing and having sex. But while it may work in the porn movies mechanism? maybe even hit as a porn movie? it tries to hide itself as a "movie" with real emotions and struggle. This is not. This is an excuse for getting some girls naked and fun. I am sure that all these women (and men) in this particular film could have done well in the 1970s porn movies business. . . but not in the real movie business. <br /> <br /> Operation was scary, so bad, I mean real terrible. Writing was even worse. Can't I blame these makers? they had nothing to do. A very broad structure or plot of a movie could be done and done well by good writers and competent actors. A very broad structure or plot is a person of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting people away, sniper. These shootings were motivated by men who did not respect their women enough. If there were more writing - better writing, much better writing - and less free sexual image, we might have something to do. <br /> <br /> This movie should have shot, made and marketed hardcore porn movies all the time; it would have made more money. It's a virtually hardcore porn movie, and it's the only non-porn movie I saw that shows a man's penis.
