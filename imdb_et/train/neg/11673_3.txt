1 review 17/17/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): The quite flat account of the Titanic Disaster is the first filmed version of this very famous event. The disaster replication is not bad, but the drama around it is sometimes stupid, malfunctioning and too much soap opera. The story is very similar to the recent Oscar winners, except that it shows how the team tried to hide the real disaster that occurred almost too late. Good for nostalgia and feel what James Cameron competed for during his vacation (barely?).
