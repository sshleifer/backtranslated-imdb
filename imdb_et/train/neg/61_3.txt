The "sunshine boy" is not a sunshine that makes this alleged comedy Neil Simon the only ironic moment. Simon, who adapted the script from his game (which goes illegally), equates old age with irrational behavior - and worse, clumsy, galumizing, avidly avid irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is ruthless when we play an outdated Vaudeville speaker who spoke to television on the former comedy partner George Burns (it has been said that they were a team for 43 years, which raises the question, "how long did the last have been on the lap?"). Burns, who won the supporting Oscar, has a misfortune to come to the film for about thirty minutes, after which Matthau has already hacked the material back and forth. The more noisy film becomes, the less tolerable and observable. Directed by Herbert Ross, he was only doing a great job when he was not involved with one of Neil Simon's scenarios; Here, Ross creates gags like thudding amateur, hammering away from militant routines that can't afford to pay off (as the semi-confused Matthau shows up as a mechanic in the garage audition TV ad). At this point, Matthau was still too young to do this task, and he compensated for it and hollering. Ross and Simon were supposed to suppress their character, to give their temperament nuances to give the "Sunshine Boys" a bit sunniness, but Walter continues to work as if we were all deaf. The picture looks terribly drabina and climbs at a spiritual pace; one loses hope early. * 1/2 from ****
