Return is a game played in this drama, and the plot of revenge is canceled by an absurd storyline that sets fireworks on the stage later. Why should a person participate in the gangster's own mansion with a terrifying mobile trophy who has dubious doubts everywhere? Why should an unhappy woman encourage full stranger attention and wait for her to take her away and leave her husband and boredom to live happily after their new love? Certainly, the hero, here Kevin Costner, must wait for a male spouse to react, which gives the film an excuse for meaningless brain and violence. A great actor, Anthony Quinn, she certainly deserved it, and Madeleine Stowe is a tragic figure that suffers greatly when she locks in with her prince. Stowe is okay, but his Spanish accent doesn't work. Smaller player lights are good, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland are interesting as a silly rock star.
