If this should be a black experience, let me out at both the front and back doors. <br /> <br /> Mom's boy looks one day with 2 young hoods, and then everything is under his mountain. Angela Bassett, one of the brilliant arm of this film, plays over her defensive, religious mother. Despite his anger about how his life has changed, he decides to approve it in the middle of the picture. She allows her friends to come and maybe it is all right to use if it is not for the children. <br /> <br /> This is a sad situation associated with gangsters. You knew where the film was going. <br /> <br /> I laughed literally loudly when Bassett sent his son off to bury his body, he states that although his life was shortened by the age of 24, he had become a man. What man? He had been convicted of an offender, wrote the most brutal rapeseed with constant vulgarity, and a frightening society. This class in the classroom, where she tells her teacher that she serves more than a teacher as a health worker, is a great example of what's going on in our schools. Lack of full and complete respect for the teacher. The east coast, rap rivals of the west coast gang have never been fully identified. All we see is the beating of weapons. <br /> <br /> A terrible picture that doesn't do anything to stop gang violence. What terrible role models are those rap singers and their unpleasant music. The African-American community should rush by nature. Who was this classy fat slob who represented Biggie? He made the old TV show thin. I know it was on the streets of Bedford Stuyvesant, which made it a chubby little boy a vulgar monster. What a disadvantage is when it is called movie entertainment.
