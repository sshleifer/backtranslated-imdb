This film was more effective than convincing me of a Zionist conspiracy as a Muslim. And I'm a Jew. <br /> <br /> One person goes to the press school? Read the editorial? New Year's Rhetoric? These shameful claims that have been presented tastefully can be convincing. But if it does not accept the recognition of possible contradictory arguments, or viable (or at all) solutions, few sources and suspect origin, it makes the argument ineffective. <br /> <br /> And thanks for the goodness - I wouldn't want anyone to leave the theater, taking some of this racist attack. <br /> <br /> A good lesson for me - and hopefully a warning story for you - to read a movie before you see it.
