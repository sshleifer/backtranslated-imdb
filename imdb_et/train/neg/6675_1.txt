Just this weekend I watched "28 weeks later", which was very good. After that I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> I have told you that this is one of the most boring horrors you might ever look at. The scenes were unrealistic, the script and the plot were not. The alien creature was unreal. And fighting scenes light compared to school yard fighting. And to make it worse, Cody was called an uncontrolled loose dirty language that drew attention to the main film. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie; rather go and watch 28 weeks later. <br /> <br /> Welcome, Mesake C.
