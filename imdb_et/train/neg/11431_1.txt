It is important that this is not undermined by a lack of logic or reason, and those with "gray things" agree that this film does not work. <br /> <br /> The problems were aimed at the character of building options and the lack of depth. The word comedy was very difficult to say when I was waiting for these words to be used. Let's look at the direction / script of the problems. <br /> <br /> Brother and sister in their mid-thirties seem to be well regulated. They meet in the park as a complete stranger, and Heather Graham's character moves to him and asks the most intimate questions that even a half-hearted person runs differently or at least shouts to a police officer. He then walks uncomfortably and makes stupid statements and falls on him. Then after one date, when they all went together, he falls in love with him and decides to get married in Vegis after a week ??? Hi, does anyone feel stupid yet? She goes out to thousands of women and she meets one of the people who says about 10 words we see on the screen and she wants to marry her. Not only was it chemistry it just didn't make sense. Of course this is a romantic comedy and I want to believe it could be, but the direction made it completely flat. <br /> <br /> Now, Heather is headed down to her and as Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (very low) kiss or more so that it was a more cunning kiss that chemistry may be there. I found it to be unromatic and uncomfortable, and while many say Heather can't act, I think reality is Heather's obviously the wrong person for that role. <br /> <br /> It was Sue Kramer's debut as a director, and it was just too much for me to chew. It would take a lot of craft to make this film, and IMHO could do it with a better writer and casting and directing.
