If you do this through an open credit, it may be your movie type. From the woman's first screen that keeps her hands on her face, the white pages in the background are reminiscent of pretentious perfume. It's all down there. <br /> <br /> Leading actor is basically a block of wood that uses his computer to reach the past and reconstruct photo memories to talk about the genius of history, Ada, who foresaw the first computer language in the 19th century. <br /> <br /> Low budget graphics would be forgiving if it were interesting or even somewhat inseparable with the script. <br /> <br /> Poor Tilda Swinton is wasted.
