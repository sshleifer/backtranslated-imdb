I saw the movie trailer several times in the theater and I'm excited. It looked like a classic watchdog like in the 1990s. He also reminded me of Fugitive films, a cat and mouse game between Douglas and Sutherland. But Sentinel is the most delicious thriller of all time. As I can see, many people say it's like a TV movie. Not exactly. First, there are many better TV movies in this genre. Secondly, TV movies can sometimes be very fun, but this film is exactly the opposite of good times. It's not at all visual and most important, the film's tone is unpleasant. This is not an action film, there are two operational states that consist of tracking and collision. Nor are they big scenes, but the worse is that these scenes are very filmed like the whole movie. The love relationship between Douglas and Bassinger was very unnecessary. Moreover, the president's murder card is also the most clich√© story in this genre, but they demand it. And it's not a cat and mouse movie, as it should be. Although Douglas is now very old, he still has the ability to operate in an action pile. In the film, Michael Douglas cannot be like Tommy Lee Jones. Sutherland is the wrong choice because you feel that if you look at Jack Bauer and somehow, its character is one of the reasons that make the movie a TV movie, Eva Longoria Parker is a strange choice, of course she is too passive or in the movie because she is a soap opera actor . The film wasn't even fun for me for a second, so I couldn't move for a while.
