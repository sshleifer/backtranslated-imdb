This movie seemed too long even after 75 minutes. The problem with Jungle's horror film is that there are always too many video footage (through the jungle, rocky cliff, river or lake) to drive time. The film is worthy of a ridiculous and naked native zombie with large swollen and bloody eyes, accompanied by strong breathing and a lot of reverb. Eurotrash fans are a lot of entertaining monster and native speakers of bad English copying, free female meat and very foolish makeup jobs. For Zombie / cannibal flick it was quite easy, but then I probably didn't see the uncut version.
