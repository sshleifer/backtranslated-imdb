I saw it in the theater when it came out, and just yesterday I saw this cable again. I could feel myself again, knowing how this film was disgusting. The whole bunch is self-absorbing narcissistic princes. The worst thing is that it reinforces every negative stereotype of about 20, even if he wants to celebrate people "himself". Nice guys finish up last, funny boys make big, jerk boys do the best. Girls are all boy toys. Only one character ("Wendy") is something useful for society, and it will give up its long-lived virginity in a one-stop, lushly filmed scene that we should think romantic. It's really a Hollywood young American concept: promising, divorced, promising, conceivable.
