I like a movie that has at least a story. It doesn't happen in this movie. It is a series of vignettes with no cohesion. <br /> <br /> A man with pineapple capsules has scenes. A woman with a blonde wig does not remove her sunglasses. This woman takes other people at the beginning of the movie and we never know why. It will disappear completely after about 30 minutes. There is another ridiculous woman who cleans the man's apartment indefinitely. The fast food joint has endless scenes where Mamas & Papas 'California Dreaming' has played a lot (I liked this song). The dialogue is mainly about food (pineapples, cooks salads and ordering drinks). I expect most of the participants to gain weight during this movie because they consumed a lot of fast food. <br /> <br /> There is no passion in this movie because there is no story. It's supposed to be romance - it's not such a thing. I just don't know why I didn't hit fast. Waiting for something important to happen? this is not. Perhaps this is the only consolation for this film - the scenes shifted so quickly that it tricked you into assuming that all the mess was revelation.
