I saw this movie during my time when the child was not only destroying your life, but made your child tremble. In those days of "single mothers" that may seem very distant, but it was very true. And I'm not crazy to laugh with someone who's fried. Between these two problems I had a hard time finding this movie. At that time, I didn't know who had run it or what wonderful reputation he had. I knew who was Betty Hutton, and she just made me nervous because she was so crazy. I loved "bringing the baby," but I find this movie just embarrassing. I'm sure the punch of some of the church functions is probably out, but I was the one who looked at it again. The idea that a girl should be married and conceived should simply be added to the misery. The whole city could turn you on in such conditions, so the result of this movie is really a funny part. Of course, shoot me, I don't like "It's a wonderful life".
