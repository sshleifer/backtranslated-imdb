I'm sorry for the fans of this movie, but that's the worst thing I've ever seen. Slow, poorly cast and badly acted as a film that tries to escape the dead romcom of recent years and not! McDonald and Parker are unable to convey real emotions and are inanimate. They seem to be paying a fee for what they get for it and not because they thought it was a good idea. The plot is DULL !! i love big chick movies as much as next girl and this is not one! If you avoid one movie this year, be it
