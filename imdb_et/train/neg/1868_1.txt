This movie is terrible. Each line is stolen from 8MM (Italian duplicated version). If you like trash ... real trash, try it; but be careful: this is not "so bad it's a good" type flick. In her cheapness it can really look like porn, but believe me if you are looking for "snuff", s & m, hardcore, softcore ... or even a normal erotic thriller. I'm telling you this, because absolutely uninspired and convincing shooting, acting, plots, dialogues (the only good things I have already said are the ones they stole Joel Schumacher's 8MM! -St!) "is totally disgusting! I give him one star: half-shot at the back, suddenly following the "eyes of the victim" monologue (also stolen by 8MM) and half the sexy body of the mother and daughter (which couldn't keep me awake while watching this turkey!)
