A somewhat uncomfortable spy mystery with a predictable plot of the dangers of two world wars. The mystery is whether Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) is amnesia. Raymond Massey, Dr Ingersoll, makes the best action, a good doctor turned to evil. He is the leader of the spy chain who is trying to get information about Amnesia Jane, which is related to allied activities. Does he say? Does he remember? Moroni Olson (Mr. Goodwin) is convincing as Massey's accomplice. The role of John Garfield (Dr. Lewis) is not catastrophic. He seems so badly confused that casting must be one of the worst in film history. Unfortunately, such a talented actor is filled with a role that is not suitable for his talents. The film is worth a look, despite being a half-spy and half-gangster film, and despite the fact that it contains stereotypical signs. It's easy to forget, amnesia is not needed.
