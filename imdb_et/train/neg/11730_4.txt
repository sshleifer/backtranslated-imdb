Investigative reporter Darren McGavin (Carl Kolchak) is back; this time he is after "night strangler". Moreover, police officers and journalists do not believe or want to cover a supernatural corner. Producer-director Dan Curtis presents the same basic story as his last night, obviously less successful. <br /> <br /> Mr. Curtis is gathering fun support, including "Dark Shadows" alumni George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis. Jo Ann Pflug (Louise Harper) is the leader of the sexy belly dance collection. And although I've never mentioned it somewhere, it must be Roger Davis as Mr. McGavin's cafe during the early scene, trying to believe in vampires! <br /> <br /> **** Nightclub (1/16/73) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Jo Ann Pflug, Simon Oakland, Wally Cox
