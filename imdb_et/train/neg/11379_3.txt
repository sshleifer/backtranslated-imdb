When I saw a small scene for the first time in some messages, I thought this show would be fun. A little robot boy looks cute. The style of animation looks familiar to some classical exhibitions. Before the show, I learned it through some sources. There I became slightly outraged. Three children (Tommy, Gus and Lola) are appropriately expressed, but Robotboy is an exception. It would have been much more beautiful if she was a young boy. One good example is Robot Jones, the character of the robot "What happened to Robot Jones?" The exhibition is not really bad. But how Robotboy is misrepresented is my only criticism. So, I don't look at that much.
