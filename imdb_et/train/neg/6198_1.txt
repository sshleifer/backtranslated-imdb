This coward and offensive film was interesting to me at first. Characters are familiar young men who are lost, often seen in a city close to the sea to get bored. Robert is an outsider, but he has his own music that could have been his soul. Instead, Clay puts a frieze on Robert who starts a cannabis and ecstasy journey and a wrong crowd. Clay seems to believe in "reefer madness" and Robert ends the movie as a murder rapist. One wonders how much experience the real life of this young director is. No one can save poor Robert. Clay leaves us with a message that young British men are out of control. A very unclear relationship with Iraqi rebels; during unnecessary graphic rape, we are subjected to explosions and war images. The film shows the male group extremism that has reached its limit. London's young bombers pull Clay in parallel with the modern man's hate imagination. Clay means that men just can't afford to do terrible acts of violence. It is a miracle that the British film industry allows money to be invested in films promoting such sharing propaganda when we are still talking about recent attacks in London. This is Clay's first movie, I'd be glad it was his last.
