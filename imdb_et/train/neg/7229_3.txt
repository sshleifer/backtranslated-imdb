It seems that this film begins in the middle, introduces peripheral players as they are remarkable and present the main character without any material and paper-thin and / or impenetrable backgrounds. Almost no one in this film has a credible or noticeable motivation for their actions. From the plot and finally going somewhere, the dialogue is dirty and tricky, and the director has little idea how to get the best from his actors. It's almost like this movie is in the first half, but it's never been done. <br /> <br /> We were told that a mysterious pyramid has appeared in New York and that the Central Park has become an inexplicable Arctic wasteland. However, none of this seems to have caused great confusion among the general population and is only minimal for the government. <br /> <br /> We are presenting an "evil company" in Eugene, but it is really a simple idea that the universe would be with a few power-driven minions. The whole "Eugenics-Is-Bad" double participant is heavy and never put here. We need to take care of the average characters, but we don't know anything about them to find out why. So many of this world are underdeveloped or fully developed to arrive at 1 hour, 40-minute fatalistic rationalization. <br /> <br /> "Landscape" in the digitally animated world created here, all I can say is that around the time this movie was made, many other directors did the same, unsuccessful and more credible results. <br /> <br /> After you had time to watch this movie on the most burning question, I thought it was "what?"
