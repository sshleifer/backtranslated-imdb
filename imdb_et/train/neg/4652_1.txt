It was a painful example of the cheap, boring, and unfair examples that Australian TV channels provided local content to meet their quotas. Writing was really terrible and I am not surprised that writers are the ones responsible for the worst Australian film of the latest memories of Wally Norman. <br /> <br /> Nothing about this TV series was funny - never - even lightly amusing. It was just tired and BAD and worst thought it was funny. It was just an embarrassing look. <br /> <br /> There is a great deal of doubt that this exhibition will be given to 10 in IMDb. Try to find (real) overview (i.e.) of the Australian viewer (not much) and that is impossible. Or crazy. There is bread that is more fun than this show. <br /> <br /> Avoid displaying at all costs and when it appears on the DVD, remember that the laughter that you deserve was inadvertent.
