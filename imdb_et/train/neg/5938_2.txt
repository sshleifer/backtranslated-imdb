if you did not live in the 90's or did not listen to the rapper EVER !! this movie may be good for you, but any fan or any person who listened to this rape film was bored and there was no point in the movie where I said it was interesting or I didn't know it. another thing that bounced on me was that it looked like it was in his life, when he was very simple, there was no fight he made in the jail, selling drugs, and even stealing was not realistic. I think if a film that has been released after about 15 years maybe has more impact! good rap films are pushing and flowing, enriching or dying, trying not to be notorious
