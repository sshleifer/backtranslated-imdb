This film begins slowly, then tapers. After watching about an hour and absolutely nothing happened, I went out. Nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. No story. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people we know. Producers of this film can be sued if they try to sell it as "in motion". There is no movement. I could have said the same "story" with a couple of photos with inscriptions. The script is a joke. It's just terrible. I doubt that any of the world's scripts could save it. My biggest regret is not that I wasted 60 minutes of my life watching "Love in Money", but I was a great leader. I could have walked first, but I waited a little too long. Instead, I watched about 20 people go before me.
