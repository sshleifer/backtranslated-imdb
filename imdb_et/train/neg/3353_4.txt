A pretty bad movie offers something new. Ordinary wrinkles and moans are trying to make a mess, but a thin story. Action is barely pathetic. Why did Liam Neeson sign it, somebody thought. Owen Wilson has indeed turned to one of the worst performances of the last fear-film history. Catherine Zeta Jones is fun to watch and much more, even though Lili Tayor did a job above average. The special effects were quite memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and haunting. But they can't do poor deeds and stories that seem to have been shot at the last moment. Do not worry.
