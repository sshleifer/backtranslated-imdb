I didn't even know it was originally a movie on television when I saw it, but I thought it was in the current time. It has the same blown colors, black characters and terrible synthesized music I remember from the 80s, and the "social platform" that practically punishes Afterschool. Rona Jaffe (thank you) Mazes and Monsters were made in Dungeons & Dragons, a lace and paper RPG prosperity that took over millions of geeks hearts in America. I read myself as one of those geeks that I've never played D & D specifically. M & M was also prepared for the prosperity of D & D's great contradictions - that it was so appealing that people could lose touch with reality, worship Satan, unknown, blah blah. I think it was a legitimate concern at one point, when it is extremely rare, but it is a daunting film. <br /> <br /> We meet with 4 young college students who play aptly named Mazes and Monsters to interact and have some time in everyday life. Except that M&M is presented, it is more boring than their daily lives. There are no game offers here - and Jay Jay's request to take M&M to the "real world" comes out. It's just a pretext that one of the characters will fail somewhere - though we don't really care at this point. Jay Jay, Robbie, Kate and Daniel should be different, but they are all rich WASPy prigs who have problems with no one really. <br /> <br /> But things continue, more than one worsening. The low budget is terribly clear (I love turning off the badge and carton into the forbidden caves). Tom Hanks' s blubbering "Jay Jay, what am I doing here?" made me laugh in minutes. Certainly, his career is a low point. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it as a striking satire, but a ridiculous 80's TV trash, and you have a good time. That means if you can stay awake. Most of them are mostly boring, but it's all worth it if Pardu breaks down at the end. At least Tom Hanks has improved. Not that he could get much worse here.
