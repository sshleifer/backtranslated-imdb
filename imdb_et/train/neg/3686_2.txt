I'm surprised that everyone (even the critics) thinks it was a good movie. It was the most clich√© thriller I ever saw. We have a "bad boy" who wants to force a "good man" (or girls in this case) to do something or face the consequences. The "good girl" of this movie must use her smart and skill to win the "bad boy" and save the day and his loved ones. Using charisma, bravery and even happiness to save the day. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Well, a woman named Lisa Reisert meets a young man by the name of Jackson Rippner (nice name) at the airport. One coincidence leads to another, and soon it seems that destiny brings these two together. Drinking drinks, sitting next to each other, seemingly seeing in every direction ... Is there still this strange thing? Could these two be for each other? Does fate have a strange and random meeting? Well, as it turns out, unfortunately, yes. Jackson needs Lisa to help him murder an internal security director by moving him from one room to another so his men can attack him. If he doesn't, his father is dead. Although we never learn exactly why and who is behind this madness, Jackson explains more about how this happens and why to help him with this Addiction. <br /> <br /> Lisa will obviously strike her evil plans with her smart stuff and in this process, she will pinch her, travel to the chairs and hit her in the field with a hockey stick. Oh, and before that, he drives through Miami Airport, where he gets behind the 9th security and steals the car he uses later to drive a man who told him to kill his father. <br /> <br /> Yes, right. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is strange that, as Jackson, who can handle high-tech weapons, needs the help of a hotel manager. Didn't he just get into the bomb building? Wouldn't it make her and her team safer from third parties? And why does Jackson, like Jackson, explain everything they're going to do to someone they threaten? Does it not make it easier for them to stop by the same people? <br /> <br /> The participants did their best to give them the movie. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still the players to look out for. I also believe that Jayma Mays (who played the loved Cynthia) is someone we see more. It's just too bad when they were all stuck with it. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
