Ben & Arthur OR would have been 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, starred, and filmed this movie. Sam should have given his idea to a good writer, director and left the actor to anyone who could act. this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production. no one told him, "Sam it's bad, really bad". <br /> <br /> Jamie Brett Gabel's action was the only good point, but he could have been as good as a good director and better to act. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I think Sam Morovich should be involved in viewing the chair and his movie (twice). the act and the direction were so bad, this film turned into comedy. you just had to laugh and in the wrong place. Another good point ... it would make a great date for the movie. After the first two minutes you stop watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!
