I thought it wasn't the best re-cap episode I've ever seen (although my research partner gave me the tissue for Brendan Fraser in a moment ... * sigh *). It was nice to see Cox incessantly next to the brutal "Coxism State" where he is these days, as only for short moments. I also liked to try to put the characters' lengths (or height, JD) and the youthfulness of the earliest episodes in the characters. I also see how Zach can be very chevy chase or is Matthew Perry? prat-fall induced chemical slide (already confirmed in Conan). The small side note, the song (which is now stuck in my head) by the janitor caused by the dance, was Martin Sexton's "Diner".
