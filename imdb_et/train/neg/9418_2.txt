It is a weak film with alarming cuts and renaming. It doesn't work at all. First of all, dramaturgy is all wrong. It moves very slowly at first and then moves quickly and unsatisfactorily to the end. But there is also (and may be related to cuts) an uncomfortable movement between genres. It starts with a thriller, which must be taken at face value and then degenerate into a farce rather than a satire. The end may be funny, but it is so blunt that I almost felt it offended my intelligence (little is). Thus, the film tries to be everything but not at all successful at all. You can also see that the very uncertain nature of the evolution. You will almost get the impression that Connery plays three roles rather than one.
