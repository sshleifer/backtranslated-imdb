Anyone who wants to be an editor should watch this movie! This will show you every mistake that is not made when editing a movie! My grandmother could have done better! But that's not the only reason why this movie is very bad! (It's actually so bad that I can't write a sentence without an exclamation point!) When Les Visiteurs' first episode was a pretty good family comedy with funny jokes and intercultural dialogues, this order copied badly from the first. Funny parts can be read on the one hand and maybe half about it. Clavier plays his role even more than in the first part, Robin tries to act like Lemercier (because he replaces him), but it's grotesque. Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Even if Muriel Robin can be funny on the stage, he is not in the film because he does not act as he used to be. I know it should be difficult to replace someone who played a good role (Lemercier got the César Award for the role of the first movie), but he made a big mistake: he played his role in playing Lemercier, who played the role of him! is just too much, of course we knew at the end of the first movie that there would be a sequel, but Poiré and Clavier should try to write a simpler story like the first episode. The only good thing can be costumes and some special effects. So you have only two reasons to look at it: 1) if you want to learn how to edit the movie terribly, 2) if you want to waste your time or if you really need a meaningless moment! / 10
