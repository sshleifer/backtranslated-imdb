I didn't really expect this type of movie outside of America. How can someone sexually abuse and turn it into a "thriller" is just sick. Auteuil (who I admired before), like some child-friendly Rambo, was unaware and offensive to all the children who were sexually abused worldwide. <br /> <br /> What is double-depressed is that stunning and grounding-breaking film "Happiness" appeared a year after this movie. Menges and his cohorts should be ashamed. It is admirable to read some of the smarter viewers' comments there. They saw the dirty and ridiculous behavior of this issue. Those of you who think this is a great cinema show nasty ignorance and you have to look at "happiness" to open your minds to the real horror of pedophilia. <br /> <br /> Is your child more likely to be abducted and sold into sexual slavery, or to have a neighbor, teacher, friend or even relative? Hmm ... I don't know. If they intend to make a film of any kind of international child slavery, they owe it to everyone for its realistic and emotional engagement at the touch of a button. 1/10
