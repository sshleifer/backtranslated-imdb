This movie goes around and the viewer does not know where they are. First of all, I thought it might be a little cool movie, but it just pulls on and on and finally you don't know what's going on. Lead woman is a good actor and played her role well and the psycho fella is horrible, but after a while she doesn't care what happens because this movie pulls on. Shame really, it could have been a lot better. <br /> <br /> It would have been said that the leading female and psycho fella have a good career in front of them, but do they remember this movie for their making or for the film they will ever regret.
