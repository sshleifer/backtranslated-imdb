very good story, good excitement ... but in the last 10 seconds they destroyed the whole movie ... what happened? extremely well done and destroyed in the last few seconds a good story ... sorry to say but 1 vote ... this is what it deserves, i think chris shadley could come to a better end ... but maybe next time :) all this meaningless blood does not give anything? Finally, this story would be close to 10, but it wasn't .... the whole story was destroyed, I think most people are not sheep and when they go to the movie, you want a good ending, even if it's complicated ... but the only one lame here is the end ... sorry
