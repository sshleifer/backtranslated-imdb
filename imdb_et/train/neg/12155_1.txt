When this movie is written and produced with the aim of creating a bad film, it may be (maybe say) hit. Have you ever sat down and watched a movie that was so frightening that it was exciting in terms of mistakes? Well that's it. Every actor should apply for the worst-performing prizes. It would be difficult to find another film with a production budget that contains so little value. The whole thing about opening scenes doesn't create logic. The dialogue is absolutely incredible and illogical. Like the film's behavior and overall style. What's really outrageous is that some bridal shops in the canteen actually made money for this trash. Wow.
