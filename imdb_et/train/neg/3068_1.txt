Such films are the originals that Album Oriented Rock Stations have for what music used to be - a repetitive, boring, and run-off drain all the original energy. I am pleased that Aragorn did not have this P.O.S. Go back and see the 1971 version, read the things NEVER contain the modern version, and thank every god you worship to have in the distant past balls for writing and shooting the original concept movie. someone else's ideas and did not go through the company board before seeing the light of day.
