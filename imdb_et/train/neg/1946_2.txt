2 The mother of a small child who is or should be saying has grown with many of Scooby's reincarnations. I feel well positioned to comment on Scooby's historical and current version. <br /> <br /> As a family we hadn't seen any episodes before Shaggyi and Scooby to get the idea that we could enjoy it as a light weight, nothing special on Saturday morning. But this is essentially a problem that is so light in the current format that it is not "old" longevity of Scooby and gang. I am sure that it can be successful with a quick return of money, but I am sure it is very dangerous to lose the long-term purchase of old and young people. My 6-year-old son, who saw the new version, was really pleased and without any encouragement it was said to be really badly animated and why it wasn't like the last series (where you are). <br /> <br /> Scrappy Doo was an anomaly, but still endlessly better. We hope you get the idea that it is related to the manufacturers.
