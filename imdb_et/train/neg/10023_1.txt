Shame on Yash Raj's films and Aditya Chopra, who has lost his intelligence over the years and has offered permanent tickets in this cinema that is not even worthy of You Tube standards. I started with the teeth with the whole skillophrenic direction, drawing lines that were never quite realized, and in the last scene I was ashamed that my country and his filmmakers would "notice" such stupidities. Shame the participants on this work and even comment on it as some of the work they may have. Saif Ali Khan has completely chosen the choice of film. Kareen shows that there is enough skin for puberty and Akshay appears dim. Anil another slowdown with hairy charm in English. His cronies were commendable in their pursuit and the odd movie scattered over the past 15 minutes, it was enough to pop a blood vessel. DON'T LIFT Brain cells, energy or money to go see it - Go to SEE / Rent instead of AMU-Konkana Sensharma - a beautiful piece of independent film that has ever come out of India. The intense, brilliant and brilliant story it touches all intelligent participants and gave me the hope that not everything was lost when making Indian cinema.
