One wonders why this picture has been made at all: the plot as such is absolutely unbelievable, if not ridiculous, characters (experienced loner cop versus younger, quite fascinated) quite predictable, the end is completely dim and impossible to understand (maybe after several views) but it must have a masochistic tendency, an idea you need to read the book to fully understand what it is all about and the action is bad. Was the basic idea to show that French filmmakers can do both Americans and "seven" and "lambs silence"? If so, it is a complete failure. But it was quite successful (and has a sort of cultural status as the first French serum killing film) and seems to be considered a good product for export. Weird.
