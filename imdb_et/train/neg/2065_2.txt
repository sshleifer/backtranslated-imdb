Rent it last night. Opening (2001) was too long for WAAAAAAAAAY. The receiver scene was not practical. Some sketches were just slowing down. I knew beforehand, Chevy Chase was less than 2 minutes. No problem. Here are the best parts: <br /> <br /> SIZE, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield song <br /> <br /> Total: 7 minutes of good material from a 75-minute movie <br /> <br /> Everything else was hellish or stupid. <br /> <br /> Allow me to advise: If you want to get raw film spam and movies, rent a "Kentucky Fried Movie". If you want less raw TV and movies, rent "AMAZON WOMEN ON MOON" or "UHF" <br /> <br /> Otherwise, don't worry about renting this movie. You save 2-3 dollars. <br /> <br /> IMHO: Ken Shapiro's Best Film is STILL "Modern Problems"
