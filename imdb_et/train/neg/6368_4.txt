This is the last time I borrowed the video without checking for IMDB reviews. Limey is headed by Steven Soderbergh, who also wrote Ewan Macgregor with a truly dreadful Nightwatch and led such a trash as a talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a good actor and it is a shame that he participated in such a bad film. Often there is confusing editing that seems to be the last-minute decision to make up for the shortage or story, filming and just plain common sense. This movie does everything wrong. What did they mean?
