When I was younger, I liked this show, but now ... BLECCH !!! This exhibition is cute, badly written and rarely funny. Three of the leaders were all good actors and funny men (it was much better to stand up to the stand, as it was better than Coulier, and Stamos was better than the average actor). After a while, Stamos wanted to show because he wanted to do more serious things (who could blame him?). The exhibition was finally canceled when many actors demanded more money. <br /> <br /> Here are a few things that show me crazy: <br /> <br /> 1. Fishing Catches - How many times can a person who is tired of fishing terms like "how rude" be in a 24-hour period? " do you have a guy, "nerdbomber", "cut it out" and "grace"? <br /> <br /> 2. Kimmy Gibler - the most annoying character ever written on television. <br /> <br /> 3. Written and clicked as oreo cookie. Good clichés and spelling are described. Full House had a bad cliché writing. <br /> <br /> 4. Three men living with San Francisco - Enough said. <br /> <br /> 5. Unrealistic stuff - Too many reminders. <br /> <br /> 6. Trendy Kids - Girls had all the latest shopping malls and see the posters of trendy posters. <br /> <br /> Now this is an exhibition at Nick @ Nite. I would hardly call it classics. I have nothing to say about the people involved, because I think many of them are talented in themselves. But this show was just as sweet, sweet, I couldn't stand it for a while.
