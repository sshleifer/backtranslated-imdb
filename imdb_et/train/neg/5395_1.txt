Kenneth Branagh attempts to transform William Shakspeare's hidden, rarely produced comedy into 1930's music, resulting in bad Shakespeare as well as bad musical comedy, as actors are rarely adept at one or other styles, and in some cases bad at both. Particularly painful is Nathan Lane, who seems to have the impression that she is completely hysterical as Costard, but is wrong, and Alicia Silverstone, who deals with the Shakespeare language with a full-fledged Valley Girl authorization who reads the script aloud in her High School English class. Musical numbers are staged in the "Dames at Sea" high school production profession, cast in search of inconvenience and amateur singing and dancing, with a single exception from Adrian Lester, who proves himself to be an excellent singer and dancer. The only other grace to save the movie is the contribution of Natascha McElhone and Emily Mortimer as an eye clip, but they have yielded much better results than in this movie and you would be wise to look at another title in your filmography and make it meaningless confusion.
