There's something frustrating about watching a movie like "Murder By Numers" because somewhere inside the Hollywood formula is a good movie that is trying to get out. However, it hasn't been saved while the credit was added. The whole thing is pretty much blown up by the story of the "police side", where the killers of Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin's interfering with an uncomfortable sexual thing that is becoming more and more trivial, the longer the movie continues. Although Bullock has a strong role to play, it is not enough to save a weak script and lazy stimulation. Ben Chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgotten role (he made a much better birthday girl at the beginning of the year) and Chris Penn, who is so thankful for knowing him for a similar talent. Anyway, the plot is not even a factor in this movie. Two servants played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to watch this movie. Their talent and chemistry work pretty well and they play quite well with each other. It's too bad if they weren't in a much better movie. Barbet Schroeder goes too safely to the filmmaker here too. Bottom line: It is worth renting if you are a genre, but all others live a full life without seeing it, except maybe with convenient commercial breaks on online TV.
