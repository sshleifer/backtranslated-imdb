The film is about two stories: one is an appeal, a political assassination of a second-class party. The crossroad is the character of public relations played by Al Paccino because he is a witness to the crime and an initiator of the evening. <br /> <br /> If the script is terrible without proper dialogues and instructions, any drama feeling is a memorable one: how many spouses can be as persuasive as a powerful and feared person (such as "Godfather") as a little servant here (see also "Donnie Brasco"). <br In fact, a big young lion has become tired old. This passage of times is very touching, as it makes the audience admire. <br /> <br /> But his slowness is just a make-up because he gets his energy back to church. > <br /> Perhaps it is good that the movie is so terrible that it put a starlight on Al's talent!
