The book is fantastic, this movie is not. There is no reason why this film would not have a futuristic technological vision of the book. Hell, a complete recall, appeared a few years later and it did a good job, even in the 1970s, the orange color, did a good job of making a futuristic world. In Germany, expressionist colors, black and white material from visual displays, have not caused this approach when the film was made in 1984. The main character is written ready for work but sounds like oil and fat in the garage. This film decides on a communist approach to design, atmosphere and theme, but the novel itself did not cause a communist, worshiping-humble worker. This book needs to be seriously adapted in today's context, as this book is more important today than ever before. I couldn't look at that mess for more than 20 minutes. The soundtrack is annoying, the lack of foresight is annoying, this film seems to have been made to deny the feeling of reality or plausibility if it is exactly what is needed to capture the novel's messages to the viewer.
