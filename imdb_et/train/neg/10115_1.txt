I have made it my personal task to go after those responsible for the film. I even got a rental company to give me my money back because I claimed they made the wrong advertisement. <br /> <br /> It's not enough that the movie itself is p.o.s., but the cover design is what was sold to me. I've done better make-up effects for Halloween than what the film actually does compared to the cover art. Do you say "raccoon eyes?" <br /> <br /> I'm not going to waste more time completing the details, but come on, the main character of the movie is LA policeman, born and raised in Alabama - but has a German accent!?! It's offensive.
