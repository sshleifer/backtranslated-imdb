In a movie that follows a fighting actor, obviously the fighter's actor, Chris Klein doesn't like it. He tries to bring something memorable and curve through the low scripts that can display what could only be described as a fairly leading man. The story exists, but it is all, and does not show any basic beginning, middle and end, and the viewer is left on the shoulders to feel like something happened in the last hour and three quarters. <br /> <br /> One bright light in the middle of it is Fred Durst, who can stand out above his seemingly average talented stars and do a half-decent job of bringing Legde back to life. Can Fred re-create it if you work with a higher cast caliber, but I'll look at it in the future.
