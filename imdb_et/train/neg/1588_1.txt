It was the worst film I've ever seen in Billy Zane. I understand that this movie was mainly about introducing newcomers who did a good job for beginners, but the whole movie was not believable. <br /> <br /> In the event of a fire, you think the police would have intervened. Even the coin that was the fault of the Sea was stupid. Soon suddenly realizes a coin error, was not realistic. Poor work. Better writer. <br /> <br /> The list until the end was nothing in sync. The fight lasted longer. And what a coincidence that every time Billy was going to break the Sea, he would be out of the bullets. Once, I can believe, but not twice. <br /> <br /> In fact, Billy's character was funny. It was as stupid as Sean strikes at the end. It was like comedy. Bad! Bad! Bad!
