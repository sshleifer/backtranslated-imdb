This film could have been an interesting character training and could have given an overview of its subject, but the real problem with this film is that it does not have it. It does not give any understanding or solution to the problem. It is just the depiction of the "old" male addicts and the problems that arise in his daily normal life and family. Why do you want to watch it? It's all so pointless and pointless. <br /> <br /> It does not really help the main character to be a somewhat wrinkled 50+-year-old man. It is hard for you to feel yourself and compassion. She just looks like a dirty old playboy who's a constant wife and sex hunt. She has any sexual intercourse about three times a day with a different woman and not just prostitutes. However, it's all better than most other direct video productions. Who knows if better materials would be given to filmmakers, this film would deserve better faith. <br /> <br /> The story really comes. There are really some pointless features that are often more ridiculous than they should probably be. I'm talking, for example, about the entire Ordell schedule. Things get worse when the movie begins to finish. Also, how the story is spoken, cutting back and forth between the events that have taken place, and the main character's sessions with his psychiatrist seem a bit cheap and simple. <br /> <br /> But for bad movies It's not just one of them. It's not really better or worse than any other casual direct-video movie with similar concepts. <br /> <br /> Still, it seems strange and quite amazing that they managed Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. simple little irrelevant production as it is. You think they were very desperate for work and money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
