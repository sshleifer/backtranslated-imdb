This film was surprising. It's frightening. I often get together with a group of friends and go to the cinema to find terrible movies to see their comedic value. My friend suggested this, but when we watched it, people started to leave. I really wanted to stop it, so I can say I had, but I couldn't. It's so bad. Dreadful running hands, flat acting. The main characters are the annoying dinosaur klutz and Whoopi Goldberg. I'd rather look at the defendant's mailman twelve times in a row to see that part of that movie. I think they are trying to deal with some of the dinosaur discrimination issues, but some of the film that really looks like is a dinosaur who knocks things all the time with his tail and then blames him. It hurts. See if you are aspiring to masochism, otherwise leave it alone.
