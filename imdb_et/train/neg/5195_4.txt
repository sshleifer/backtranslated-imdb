I had heard (and read) so many good things about Weeds that I was waiting for another series of big cables (like Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men), but it slowly weakened with every episode I watched on Season One. (did not do it after the first six episodes) <br /> <br /> Writing was an original, lively and embarrassing representation of blacks. The dialogue seemed forced, as the writers were trying too hard to be smart and clean. It was a rare moment when I actually smiled audibly. <br /> <br /> The characters have never developed enough to take care of them, they were selfish and unpleasant. I was absolutely HATED that adding Brother-in-law (who would have to go to To Catch A Predator) and removing Hodes daughter Quin from the election when she sent me to a boarding house in Mexico was so unique and clich√©, I had to stop being writers tested the viewer's loyalty. <br /> <br /> Episode Episode I liked the characters less and missed many technical mistakes in the story line. <br /> <br /> Add that I heard the second season wasn't so good, so I lost all the motivation to watch it. <br /> <br /> If you are a good choice and writing fan, I suspect that this exhibition is a challenge for you unless, of course, you are stoned and then all bets are turned off.
