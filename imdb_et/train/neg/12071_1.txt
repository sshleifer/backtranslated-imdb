Terrible ... just terrible. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And I saw some pretty bad pictures over the years. Sound absorbs image quality, direction, actress etc etc. Only good races (which are funny because they are so bad) have special effects. In general it is a laugh about 5 minutes. The rest of the flick gives you brain damage.
