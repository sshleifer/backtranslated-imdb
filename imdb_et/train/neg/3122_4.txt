I couldn't give this movie badly or badly for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collete. The film has the potential to be a thriller and has some light distracting elements based on a psychological situation that the film might focus on. Robin Williams plays the storyteller at night, who travels through personal issues, Gabriel Noon: his lover moves out and Gabriel has what seems to be the story of a storyteller block. One day he receives and reads a story written by a dead 14-year-old boy named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pete talks about her life and the abuses she had to her parents. She lives with her mother and social worker Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel is fascinated and starts with friendship with Pete, but things seem strange when Gabriel tries to meet him and finds that Pete Boland may not even exist. I'm not going to go into detail because I don't want to spoil the movie, but I'm telling you this is pretty predictable. An exciting atmosphere that tells the story of Robin Williams and Toni Collette and the good performances I thought it was the key to the film. Collette is undoubtedly one of the most talented and loved actors. His ability to get into the psyche and personality of these images is very unpleasant and I hope to see him win the Oscar (hell, I think he can draw the best supportive actress for a little better script). The film begins as a psychological thriller, but predictable. If your curious knowledge of the end of the movie and the twist seems to be, check out the movie, otherwise I'd rent another predictable thriller called "Hide and Search".
