One question: why? First of all, the assumption is not funny or pleasant at all. They use taped interviews and take sound to animate these parts with talking animals. First of all, the interview is not funny or fun from the start, and even if they were, I am sure they would be much more entertaining than they were initially viewed without becoming comics. How does it add some fun to it? I switched on CBS Monday's sitcom (which has become the usual way to relax after Monday's workday) and found it. Of course, the composition of sitcom would still be repeated in the summer, but reopening these episodes would have been more fun. I tried to give CC a chance. I really did. When it started, I thought it might be funny. No. And then it continued. It was a long half hour. <br /> <br /> And I can almost see if there is a goal when the interviews were shown as a whole and they had comments. But no, it was just one line of clips, cut and pasted really fast. It was like a horrible terrible version of Cartoon Network's "Robot Chicken". I wasn't a CBS 'canceled "The Class" fan. When it was turned on, it was a half-hour line I would bother. But if it fell for me, deciding all this season or three more "Create" episodes .... let's say I'd take "Class". Given that it has been a few hours after it was, and I come here to see that I am the first to comment ... I think this is a good sign that no one was following it and that won't last much longer. Multicolor.
