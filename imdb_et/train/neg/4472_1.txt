"Smile LIke Yours" is a pathetic comedy that really doesn't make sense. I do not mean that the story would be difficult, but the whole plot is based on one thing: a couple of desperate and expensive to try to imagine children. People who struggled hard have to forget about the possibility of receiving this film, which is not kind. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly plays Jennifer Robertson, a complete contradiction with the opportunities offered by the women's liberation movement, which has almost no sense of independence. She's a pretty boring character like a dreamy housewife with absolutely nothing but children. Like the comedy of the 50s, Greg Kinnear is his wife, who also shows no personality, independence and no interest in us. <br /> <br /> They are the two most boring and often annoying signs and they hardly do comedy topics that should present themselves with many ailments that should come from a couple doing everything to get pregnant. Except, they really do nothing but go to the fertility clinic and spend a lot of money to do what they could do in their privacy (except for this in vitro fertilization number). The plot does not make any mistakes, because the couple does nothing to create a strange situation. They just go to this clinic. So what? <br /> <br /> The sub-blocks are designed to test a couple's loyalty, which is the necessary moral element of this story because the couple is not going to think about the children together. Jennifer works in a new age shop with a friend (played by Joan Cusak) and they work on aphrodesiacs. Christopher MacDonald plays an intrested buyer and Jennifer is a promising negotiator for a real price for her and her friend's product. The sub platform doesn't interest you (though Joan Cusak is pretty funny in the game). <br /> <br /> Danny (Kinear) is an architect who has the opportunity to make extra money to cover the clinic's bills, work in Seattle, where his boss is a crass seductress (another hopeless, helpless female figure) tries to influence Danny (as stupid as he is) to treat him when things are rocky with him and his wife (for reasons I don't care to give away). Jill Hennesy is good in this role, but her character is too predictable and too formal as a necessary element to create a conflict with Danny. It's stupid and again hardly interesting. <br /> <br /> The overall movie itself is completely boring and hardly funny at all (save recovery mode and airline). The plot does not offer something that is really attentive. Even if the story was about two people trying to imagine, the writers would have been able to bring out a lot of fun. Secondly, the main characters are completely boring. They are the perfect silhouettes of the 1950s comedies, with a happy husband and helpless husband. So, even without any damage to the plot, the characters themselves offer something interesting, not to mention the fun. <br /> <br /> Joan Cusak should have been in charge and someone else should have taken part in Kinneal. Cusak would even be a funny story surprisingly funny (as he sometimes does in his co-staring role). This is definitely one up.
