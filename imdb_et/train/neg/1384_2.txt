Jet Li is one of the best hand combat fighters in the world. She's been over 20 years and she's embarrassing others. Although he is big in Asia, he is almost unknown in the United States. <br /> <br /> The black mask is a breakthrough film for him, but it doesn't work terribly. First, it is duplicated. While this may be a bearing value (duplication is not even close and is toned flat), it seems inappropriate for a normal film viewer. Secondly, the director of this film, Daniel Lee, is doing a terrible job. She cuts scenes so fast, at times, you don't know what's going on. At other times, the camera shakes and infiltrates. Fans see Jet Li movies for fantastic martial arts. At the same time, the director edits scenes so quickly that you don't even know who is half the time! At other times the scene will hang (ie Li has begun to cut a hole on the floor of Jeep, while badguys carry arms, two seconds later, both Li and love are already under the car!) Other scenes are so unlikely they will cross a completely ridiculous point ( killer CD-ROMs? Just give him the throwing stars !!!!). Li needs a director who is less prone to cutting a machine gun and rather creating a movie-a-scene. The added rap / techno music is quite disgracefully intrusive. The plot has opportunities, but everyone is busy with cartoon characters that take away the credibility the film is trying to achieve. And do we really believe that the interest of love does not recognize Simon because he has a half mask? Could hair, jaw or voice not give it? <br /> <br /> If you want to see a Jet Li movie, try Iron Monkey or his classic Shaolin Temple. This confusing confusion is a complete waste of time ... 2/10
