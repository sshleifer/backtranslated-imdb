SEVENTH SIGN has a great opening hook because the Israeli Defense Forces are exposed to a terrorist base. It is a type of hook that is mandatory when writing a script, it grabs the reader / audience and introduces David Bannon when he rents space from Abbyst and Russell Quinnn with a telegraph that it's the man who is not he who says he is. But after the big opening for the third time, I found the rest of the movie confused and confused with a lot of plutols and it doesn't differ from all the other supernatural thrillers I've seen
