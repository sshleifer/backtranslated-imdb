Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante's Broadway exhibitions have been going on for years, but the evidence of this power and charisma disappears in the film adaptation that is probably due to the director's choice (Richard Attenborough, as far away as the B-road, when you get) and the leader actor (Michael Douglas, who plays as a director-choreographer as a slim corporate lawyer). The thin story about the exhausting exhibition of Broadway's exhibition, which becomes the actress-dancer-singer therapy, is pushed right towards us, with hard and brass talented talents. Nothing is modulated or subtle, especially a ridiculous sub-block of a former dancer who returns to the theater and the old flame with Douglas. Extremely enthusiastic hopes are full of promise and heartbreak, but their personal stories are a bit embarrassing; it responds to Attenborough's slow momentum, disrupts the catastrophe, and even now famous songs don't break the artificial wrap. * 1/2 from ****
