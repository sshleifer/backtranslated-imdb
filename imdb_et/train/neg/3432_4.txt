The killer, the cannibal rapist, is being killed by the police for his last murder. In his grave, the cult has accumulated plans to put him to the grave. It works naturally and she wakes up the boys' penis, and she's back to her old ways of killing with a new zombie look. Both police officers, one of whom is a little crazy about the humor of the city and who have a drug problem, are back to the case. Two original cult members are also trying to stop the killer by lifting up another dead thing. Thinking that they have been, they leave the tomb, but come with a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection. It seems a bit confusing, but not just garbage. <br /> <br /> The actor is terrible and one of the policemen is the same guy who plays the face of Dr. Vincent van Gore's gore series and he's just as terrible as the tedious policeman. Another policeman just fights to get out of his terrible lines. Now I'm all in a low budget cinema, but this movie is just terrible. If it were not easy for the eyes, they would probably have fallen asleep. It is a little clean, but it is never more than some of the intestines of animals placed on the abdomen. But the zombie makeup looks good and her leg's long penis, which she uses to rape her victims, is sometimes funny. There's also a half-dignified scene where the killer falls in love with sex. A voice with music voice is the stupid thing I've ever seen in the movie. It's just a plastic toy that has a fishing line. <br /> <br /> The end is extremely bad. You expect the killer to do a lot more than he does. God knows how they made enough money to come. <br /> <br /> 4/10
