But it has some good activities and a plot that is somewhat interesting. Nevsky acts like a bodybuilder and he's not all that attractive, actually IMO, he's UGLY. Joanna Pacula plays Saschat very well, but she needed more rows than she was given, her character had to be developed. There are too many men in this story, the novel is zero, too much and the end is too stupid. It's very violent. However, I loved the landscape, this movie takes you all over the world and it's a bonus. I also liked how it had something about the mafia, not too much or too little, but enough that it drew my attention. The actors had to be more beautiful. The biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was too normal, not sexy enough. I think for most boys, Sascha is hot enough, but for us, ladies who are fans of deeds, it can't be cut off. In general, this movie was good, I didn't love it or hated it, just found it to be another normal activity.
