You know what kind of movie you get when the main character of the grabber is transported to an electric chair (which seems to be a bakery) just to get the jailman (and I don't do it) to the genetic engineering tanker. Goo, which shines forth, melts her and blends her DNA with snow, creating our main character, the killer snowman. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie, however, is a snowman who casts some poor blows, where his hands are suspicious of a pair of white oven-potholder gloves. <br /> <br /> Mmmmm, schlock ...
