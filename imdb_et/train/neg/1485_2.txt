In your own interest, it would be best to ignore the positive comments about this movie. It pulls STINKS. Now, I like (at least theoretically) low budget horror movies, but it makes the worst mistake when a small budget flick can be done: it takes itself too seriously. And unfortunately this is not just a problem. <br /> <br /> This is the story of the British Ilseus murderer Beane clan that has been taken over today. An interesting premise, but there are two things that instantly treat this movie when you start watching it. <br /> <br /> # 1- Why is the biggest name in the CD box Jenna Jameson? He is below the average woman who can't act and has a small role. ANSWER: He is probably a well-known porn star (as you undoubtedly read from other reviews), so I think it's a "comer" for him. He seems to give the film a much needed "name recognition". His top settlement doesn't refer to his talents, but it shows how the untalented rest cast is. <br /> <br /> # 2- How can filmmakers be so stupid that Canada can be in Ireland? It doesn't even look far from Ireland. And the house that the guests / victims will be is the great North American wooden frame Edwardian. They should have skipped the whole Beane theme and worked out a story that also took place in NA. If you intend to make a movie in Ireland, it is probably best to have more than one character with an Irish accent (and it was really really an Irish accent). "but it looks like he was. Damage. He could have had fun with him. In fact, some scenes were far from being unintentionally comedic as they were. Just like the infamous gutting, whether the woman is chained to the table, naked and then sliced ​​open and removed from the internal organs. It's funny, you ask? Well, in the deleted scene version, the mutant killer pulls miles out after the mile. After a while it's funny. And what does the self-respecting cannib eat anyway? Do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens? Heck no, we eat ham and ribs and drumsticks. Well. <br /> <br /> Some others cast who were annoying: tiny, horrible, Howard Rosenstein. I'm not sure, but I think he should be STUD. In fact, he is as big as a loser and a fool like his name means. What explains why the equally annoying character of Gillian Leigh has fallen for him. <br /> <br /> I checked Gillian Leigh's link to IMDb and it is probably important to know that he graduated from high school with environmental training. I can't decide if it's more fun or pathetic to know that just a few years after graduation, a student will make a nude soft core porn show with Howard Rosenstein. I wonder if his former classmates have seen this movie? If they have, hopefully they will get a message: OUT OF THIS FATE! Go to a colleague !!! I could go ahead, but why. If you like gore, you'll find something redeeming in this flick, but not much more.
