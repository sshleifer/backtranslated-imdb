When I was younger, I thought the first film was very good in my childhood, so I decided to see the sequel. This is an example of why some films should not be followed because the first film is usually the best and it is. Basically now, when Ariel and Eric are married, they have a daughter who is not outside the house because they are worried about Ursula's sister (an octopus with a foot-fooled movie), Morgana with her. When a child goes out, he asks Ursula's sister to become his mother. It makes Ariel back to the sea to find her. The same good vocal artists, it's just a story that could have been a little more thoughtful. Enough!
