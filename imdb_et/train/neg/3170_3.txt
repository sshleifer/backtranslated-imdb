Some funny movies come out of Hollywood. Cary Grant was an angel "Bishop Married" (1947). Of course, the best Topper films were in the early 1930s at the end of the 40s. And recently, Warren Beatty's "Heaven Can Be Waited" (1978), which was a remake of 1941's "Here's Mr Jordan". These were well-written, funny, fun comedies that all focused on supernatural beings like ghosts and angels. <br /> <br /> Now, writer-director Jeff Lowell is making his feature film debut with an improbable story, a young woman, Kate (Eva Longoria Parker), who kills her wedding day and then comes back to harass the spiritual cleric Ashley (Lake Bell ), who falls for Kate's fianc√©e Henry (Paul Rudd). One thing that is clear from the beginning: Longoria Parker is not Constance Bennett (Marion Kerby's first two "Topper" films), a standard against which all female ghosts are measured. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, when Henry's sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) says to Henry, "You're not smiling." It described my situation throughout this film. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie is that the script is not just funny. But it is even worse for Longoria Parker's presence, which rubbed me in the wrong direction every time he appeared on the screen. Just to start with it, stirring up the lack of his comic talent, is he covered with so much pancake makeup who knows what he really looks like? Kate kills when he falls into a frozen shape at the wedding. He is so unreasonable that an angel who instructs him about what his descendant is going to walk on him (well, he actually just disappears), so Kate finds himself on earth as a ghost, without knowing what his mission is. <br /> <br /> Chloe wants Henry to come into the funk where he has naturally descended upon Kate's death (what I saw from Kate would have had a wonderful relief) so he introduces him to Ashleys, who doesn't actually do it. t you know what he's doing as a clergyman (he's also eating out to meet you) to see if he can contact Kate with Henry. There's a lot of mesh gas that goes on. <br /> <br /> The film's enthusiasm is characterized by the "B" story around Ashley's assistant Dan (Jason Biggs). It's thrown to the end, but how Ashley tells it shows she's as much as Kate. Since Dan has apparently attracted both of these seriously flawed women, he deserves whatever he can. <br /> <br /> Finally, Kate Ashlee will appear and fun should start. This is not so bad, because in the second case it would have been pretty funny. Like Norman Z. McLeod, Constance Bennett, Roland Young, Alan Mowbray, and Co, they must turn over their graves to see their glory in the first two "Topper" films.
