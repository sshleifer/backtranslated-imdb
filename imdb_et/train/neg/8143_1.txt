I was in a clear mood to see this movie at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. I've been to the festival for over 5 years, and I've definitely seen some bad movies. However, First Bite has come to completely new movies. Despite the fact that the film has been shot in beautiful places, approaching random, subtle and enchanting food, there are too many plot twists and inclined marks in the film until I practically finished it. <br /> <br /> The main actor, David La Haye, was unable to show the evolution of any character in the film, depicting the original cheerleader. Additional sub-plates, such as eating disorders, were developed so badly and completely that they did not fit into any context the film had shown until then. <br /> <br /> The Mystic Theme was used as a bad attempt to hide a movie that does not achieve anything, goes somewhere and disappears completely.
