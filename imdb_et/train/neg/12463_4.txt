OK Hollywood is not liberal. <br /> <br /> Of course I am lying because it is. I'm conservative, but politics leave my opinion out of the movie. This movie was anti bush, was given to the Middle East, anti-big oil propaganda, but that's not the reason it was bad. <br /> <br /> Fist off I give credit where credit is due. I saw this movie opening night because I like such movies and I'm a big politician in collage. The cinema was excellent and the actor was as good as I could say. <br /> <br /> I could not decode the plot. I have tested and IQ has 138, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't make the story of the movie and what characters to put together. <br /> <br /> The story and scene order was completely inconsistent and poorly organized. <br /> <br /> If this is not one of the films you need to watch several times to get the full depth of what it may be, I have no idea exactly what's going on. <br /> <br /> What makes sense, because if you want a political argument and do not get any criticism, make your arguments impossible! If you can't dazzle them, drop them with Bull S..
