What the hell it was. Someone probably read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester. We can mix existential angst with cheap horror. There were moments that were disturbing, but everyone was canceled by terrible music, CGI, or acting. <br /> <br /> The problem with such strange narratives is that he feels lazy. Even David Lynch's work is sometimes like his interesting exhibitions and movies that are too far away. And unfortunately it's only 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> The cast was attractive and that is the limit. I think it concerns the feelings of adolescents and the fear of loneliness that we all have, but simply do not make these signs pleasant enough to take care of our destiny ... whatever they were. The final scene leaves the whole thing unclear.
