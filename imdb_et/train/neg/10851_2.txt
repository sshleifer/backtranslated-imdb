This film was made for Dani (and Filthle of Filth) fans. I'm not one of them. I guess he's just an imitator who drives a black metal tape (I'm still not usually a ferrous metal fan). But when I had to pay for this DVD, I convinced myself that the less authentic it is, the more he tries to convince. So I assumed I was running a roller track with a rubber gore and a do-it-yourself splatter with a bad background. That's what I like. <br /> <br /> I got home and jumped into it. My patience lasted 15 minutes. VERY PERFECT CAMERA AND DISGUSTING QUALITY. And it was then (2002) that it seemed to be made with a Hi8 camcorder. I left it on the shelf. Maybe evening beer and Bmovies will create a nice dinner for this picture. After a few months I got it back (mentioned around) and saw the parties. Then I was not only disturbed by these aspects. My nuisance has evolved. I noticed that funny Dani (1.65 m; 5'5 "height) looked at his platform in shoes hanging over each other. (Yes, ripping. His head was probably not a skull.) I also found that this film may not be. I still finished it so I wasn't positive. <br /> <br /> After a couple of attempts I finally managed to end this couple a couple of months ago ... (Yes, it took me 5.5 years). jw.org en Dani was really funny because Satan / Manson / super-evil-man HELPER and the movie DO NOT make sense, see our bad person uses Dani to do bad things. Why? Well, I think he's just very, very bad Actually, they're both and it's pretty much. <br /> <br /> We've got a couple of short stories about Dan's character, about the guy who's LAL in STEALS SAMEONE because he wants to use it on his own. And, exactly. <br /> <br /> Actress ROCK BOTTOM CGI is the worst and the boy is Stinger CGI Baaaaa. And the quality is ... Let's just say it's not The only thing that can look at you is unmotivated violence and gore. Blood and courage are done quite well. Why do you see the film coming from there and then moving on. (Example - Dani 'Meesfile' takes a stuffed cat - a fake that can be - and eats it ... and then eats what fell out. Why? We never know. But we know, however, that this cat must be illegal Because his heart is almost half his size.) <br /> <br /> It may be thought that after my comment this film is so bad that it is good, but it's just bad. Filthad of Filth fans can add 3 points. I added one for Gore.
