This film does not encourage children with more beautiful and better attitudes, because the family film should be and still is not considered a family because it has some things children should not see. Not the best ABC family movie when you ask me. If there were fewer sexual issues in the film, maybe it would be better. Hollywood does not make sex better by adding the movie to better situations. There is no reason for them. At least this is a TV movie. I wouldn't want to rent my money to waste this waste. If you have other things than watching a movie, continue with them.
