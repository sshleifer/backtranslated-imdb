Start with the script. I've seen cartoons deeper than "Envy". Every time the characters repeat what you have already seen, and it wasn't funny for the first time, the movie is in deep trouble, which is definitely "Envy". A movie based on a joke would be better to go somewhere. Here's a movie that goes somewhere. In particular, Christopher Walken would like to forget this bomb because his character is so weak. Ben Stiller has been in some pretty good black comedies, "Flirting with Disaster" and "Duplex", right now. Be sure "Envy" is not a black comedy. There are no double meanings, but a complete mess. "Envy" deserves this low rating because, as it is, it stinks. - MERK
