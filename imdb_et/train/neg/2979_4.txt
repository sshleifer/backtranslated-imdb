"Gone with the Wind" is one of the most overweight films in history. This is a movie that is loved by mothers, grandmothers, and lovers who go to movies every five years. Zombie movie blows it. There is no striking flange and it's terribly light. In contrast, "Zombie 3" is great for capturing corpses and quite generous with blood supply - so it's better than "giving up the wind". Nor has it been overestimated. Most reviewers have not been mistaken as a garbage. But this is not boring garbage. When a terrorist steals a virus, he falls to the helicopter and the chemicals leak into the ground. A terrorist who has been hit by an unpleasant excerpt hides the hotel in a room where he slowly morphs into the meat-eating zombie. One of her first victims is cleaning the lady. When he's bitten, Lucio Fulci's hell trademark breaks open. In the Fulci flick, it is common for the actor to be cruel, the story is looted with holes in the parcels, and there are many gore. It turns out that the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, which explains its rather schizophrenic nature. It is also poorly photographed, poorly edited, and smooth. However, it has been recorded due to gleefular detention for murderers and its impatient stimulation. Be sure to pick up when you're complete with Undead. Or don't like "Gone With The Wind", which is undoubtedly the slowest zombie movie.
