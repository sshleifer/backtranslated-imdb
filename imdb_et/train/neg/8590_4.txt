It's ridiculous. Angelic 9-year-old Annakin is formed by 19-year-old Annakin, who seems somehow attractive to Amidala, 5 years older. Now, the 22-year-old Jedi warrior hero Annakin has a couple of bad dreams, so kids, his friends and his entire existence framework, because the crazy old man convinced him a) his dear wife can really die, and b) only he can prevent it. Ludicrosity squared. <br /> <br /> I think people who like this movie don't pay attention. The story is ridiculous. The characters are incredible (literally, not "fantastic", "wonderful", etc.). <br /> <br /> Obi-wan Kenobi was a whole series of smart and confident anchors, but the climax, he strikes down Annakin's legs, lets him burn in the lava and leave him to suffer. Does anyone think this is a little out of character? Not to mention, it was quite stupid to live with her as it turns out. <br /> <br /> I had been waiting for at least a story that showed consistent signs of plausible motivation. None of this here. The story could have been written for 10 years. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, CGI is pretty cool.
