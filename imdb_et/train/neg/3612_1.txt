Nut case is the murder of college students, is the new teacher to stop madness?! <br /> <br /> Believe me, you don't care. <br /> <br /> With a title like the Splatter University, one would immediately gather that this film is not just high art. But worse than this Splatter University can't even be for fun rubbish. Splatter U is so badly done - the story is meaningless, the characters are thrown and the whole film has no imagination. Needless to say, there is no relationship or atmosphere, no fear. This generation is not even bold enough to throw nudity (for the cheapest excitement). So all this infinitely wrong slasher does nothing to entertain (not even a cheap laugh) and just becomes a complete drill. The bottom part of the barrel - even the dying hard fans want to think twice before talking, not to mention the flick for the money. <br /> <br /> BOMB Out ****
