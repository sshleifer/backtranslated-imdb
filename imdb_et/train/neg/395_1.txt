When I ordered it from BlockBuster's website, I had no idea it was as terrible as it was. Who knows? Maybe I forgot my ADD meds on that day. I know that from the moment most of the 70's wide collars, watches and delicate hair traveled, I knew that this disco misplacement was a brilliant bag. <br /> <br /> The first idea of ​​how bad things were was narration in the beginning, trying to figure out what cosmic forces had been playing to destroy the universe, forcing polyester and porn quality. future viewer. The opening scene with badly made effects on monsters from the other world, and then from the house that jumps from the universe to the universe, was so painfully painful as watching the primary school "Vagina monologues". <br /> The whole movie was a sure sign that something happened, there was a small ship appearing. The "ship" suspiciously contained what seemed like parts of an old VCR and camcorder and was attacked by someone on its way. Of course, when it was slower than Bob Barker's affected intestine, but it was a threatening pencil-thin armature and the ability to throw a grueling green glow that could stop the bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting the balsa wood in just one hour or two hours ( some help). <br /> <br /> Moving on ... As weird and the bottoms of the clock continue ... We found they were caught in "Space Time Warp". How do we collect this little scientific information? As the oldest male leader tells his son that in a more or less cuff fashion, "how did you win a big game" cup of Coca-Cola refreshing a cup or an ice-cold bottle? Was there a scientist? No, but he knew about horses and apparently intervened as an amateur in string theory and Einstein's theory. <br /> <br /> I watched the DVD almost everywhere. The sound was muddy and the transmission looked like it would have shot a theatrical plane with a video recorder, except that it was really, really, very bad. (Indeed, it is not "really" enough to describe it). <br /> <br /> I know some love this movie and compare it to other cult classic. I didn't see this movie in my original release, but even then I think I would have come to the same conclusion: bite it fast.
