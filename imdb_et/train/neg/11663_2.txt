WHITE CHICKS Stay tuned for dressing up as black chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't have seen it at all. Can anyone give me one Wayans movie where they're not women? Don't Threaten, Jack White and Michael Costanza wrote that (other Norton Trio members acted as directors). <br /> <br /> White chicks never have fun. It's just Wayans like girls for 2 hours. No settings, no punchline, no laugh. There's a lot of "I think I'm playing for a while in crisis 3." At least for me it was (exactly 5 times). <br /> <br /> Someone has to talk to Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (the only talented), Kim, Rakeesha, George W. and Osama Bin Wayans to stop making movies. This will only damage the O-zone layer. <br /> <br /> VERDICT 1/2 * ****
