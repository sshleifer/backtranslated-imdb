Genghis Cohn is a (very) lightly entertaining British film about a German police chief at the end of the 1950s, haunted by the ghost of a Jewish comedian he killed 15 years earlier when he served under Hitler's SS. The spirit comes back and wants his killer to live as a Jew to agree on the killings he did. <br /> <br /> The German policeman actually knows this ghost name, because the last thing he did before his death was in Yiddish, "Kiss my ass". The policeman did not speak the Yiddish language, so he asked around until he found the meaning. The "mouth of my ass" had the impression that all the people involved in this killing learned and remembered the comedian name, Genghis Cohn. <br /> <br /> There are a number of men who are killed under the jurisdiction of the police chief. and no useful tips. Men are murdered with missing knives from local butchers. The butcher says his knives are missing when the Commissioner is in the shop to get the liver and onion sandwich, so the Commissioner is a suspect. The first person is killed by the butcher, so the butcher is a suspect. But the butcher says he would be very busy if he killed all the men who slept with his wife. All men are killed right after the top of love. <br /> <br /> I think I could be a little nervous than the ghost of Genghis Cohn when I was killed as he was. He seems to be very kind about it, as if he was just a mild car accident. I can only guess that this is because it is a British film and they are known to be very polite people. She uses some of her material for her stand-up routing and I just couldn't find it very funny. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 4 because it was kind of funny. I thought it would have been a bit more serious than it was. The film turns out to be a mystery of murder (where does it come from?) And it seemed that Genghis should have been more useful than he was. The film gave me a little look at the Jewish culture, but it was only deep in the skin. Do all Jews love liver and onion sandwiches? Do they all say "shtoop" and "meshuganah" in their daily dictionaries? Are there any more important things we should know about culture? <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in the Jewish Community Center in Berkeley, CA, and I was the only person in the room whose hair was not entirely gray or white. (I have no gray or white hair.) About 18 of us and about 20 minutes after the film they were left to discuss the film. There were two major concerns: 1. The film was too light and future generations may not understand what happened, and 2. As the Holocaust survivors die, the future generations that actually happened do not know. I thought the second concern was ridiculous and I told them that I thought they didn't have to worry because there was a lot of literature and there are always people who want to watch movies like me. The murder of 6,000,000 people by a very bad person will never be forgotten. I'm writing this last paragraph because they accused me of telling others about my experience that day.
