An unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are being violently and terribly attacked by a group of two-dimensional psycho-bounces at a night on a forest road in Shropshire, England. A man and a woman who had been attacked by a plan and carried out attackers against attackers ... <br /> <br /> A completely repellent piece of voyeurist trash that somehow disguises itself as a "mind-boggling" drama, but actually rises as Michael Winner cr. * p (you just know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would have been so easily cast as it would have been in the 1970s). What happens to Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is terrible and devastating, but Dan Reed can somehow rub the viewer's nose from every last sexual nuisance. His camera holds Anderson against his bare body both during and after the attack, while the script leaves almost all characters inclined to the sea of ​​a two-dimensional cliché. His manuscript forces his signs to behave in such a way that the viewer alienates "from the victims" by moving his face to more terrible situations (Adams event after the incidents against both Sophie and Alice; Alice's attack on Heffer after his suicide - catching confession) . <br /> <br /> Fraudulent comes from performances by central protagonists - Dyer is a terrible actor who is not capable of light and shade as a young man in the initial attack. Celebrate my words) but Anderson is extraordinary. Even if a terrible script forces his character to behave in outrageous and ridiculous ways, he somehow offers an extraordinarily convincing and complicated character as a self-conscious, arrogant hedonist who faces such horrors and needs countermeasures. <br /> <br /> A vile and meaningless film that is almost, but not quite, a rescue of a female with powerful performance.
