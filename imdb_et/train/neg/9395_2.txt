This series is interesting to look at as the MST3K function, but for today's audience it is all. I was really surprised to see the year when it was made in 1952. Given that this fact alone makes it solid (low?) In my book. 2. Used cars don't even look modern, they look like things from the 1930s. It is basically Cody (lonely salvation of the world? Sheesh tells an insult to everyone, like the army) anyway, Cody is under his nipple ring that travels against Graber and Daley, two stupid * ss henchmans who are sporting and occasionally a quick pistol pretty flat independently , enjoy. If you want to look at the really good serial number of Flash Gordan, it is full of rockets that attack each other and good evil nobles as well as good looking women. And Flash was made 15 or so years ago, so you can relax it. Something that was done in 1952 is bad, it deserves 2. Nuff said. give him 6 if you look at this as an MST3K episode, they have fun for the guys; nipple tip here, tweak there and i fly! And now, as an extra bonus, I'll give you the command of Cody Theme, originally sung by Joel and his two-character bots Tom Servo and Crow on the eighth Enemy Planet's love satellite: <br /> <br /> (Singing at the Beginning Credit); <br /> <br /> (TOM SERVO SINGING) YOUR INTERVIEW HANDLING CODE ...
