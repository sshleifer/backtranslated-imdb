Now I had the pleasure of watching a comedy comedy Bachelor Party, one of my new favorite comedies, laughing until it just hurt the kind of movies. So I naturally wanted to see the sequel, hoping it would be the same laugh, but instead the Bachelor Party 2: The last temptation is made by the American Pie generation, where it is tasteless and loses the holes of the first film. Yes, the first film has nudity, but it doesn't appear in every scene. The plot is also exactly the same, it is not always a complaint to me, but it could have been a bit more original. The only thing is that I'm happy that at least the old actors of the original are not shown in this movie because it would have been cheesy or really foolish. <br /> <br /> Ron and Melinda are involved only after 2 months of dating, everyone is against it. Melindal is a rich family, but they are very happy with Ron and Melinda's brother, Todd, fears that Ron will do his job. So they go to Miami for the weekend and Todd is going to make sure he catches Ron's picture that makes Melinda think about his marriage. <br /> <br /> Bachelor Party 2: In the last temptation a couple laughs here and there, but not everyone can achieve what the first film achieved. These guys, Ron's friends, were more reluctant than Seth, he was a little funny. The only pleasant character after Seti is Ron and Melinda, all others just get more or less of their nerves. Want to watch this movie? Just look at Girls Gone Wild, it's just the same thing she's not trying to pretend to be a movie. Stay on the original bachelor, this is the film that will get you into the tears of laughter. <br /> <br /> 3/10
