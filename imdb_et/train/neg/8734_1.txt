Maybe I've seen too many crimes, or maybe I'm not taking the right drugs. <br /> <br /> This was the most clich√©, plot-deficient, plot-absurd, just plain stupid movie I have <br /> <br /> about the direction, it seems less time to show it when it was done to put it together. <br /> <br /> In fact, it looks like it was made for the video before it was finished. <br /> <br /> It's bad hanging from "M" classic Fritz Lang, starring Peter Lorre. You would be better off letting instead.
