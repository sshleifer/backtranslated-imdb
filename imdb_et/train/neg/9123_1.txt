I don't have much to say about this movie. It could have been a great excursion to Peter Sellers, but it is one of the most tragic mistakes in the history of the film. It was the final film of the sellers, which makes it all the more painful. The terrible scenario, direction and shocking wood performances all come terribly together to make this one of the most painlessly horrifying movies ever made. > <br /> I want so much that I even found a nose or a devil buried somewhere in this sparse gap, but it is a lifeless, humorous disaster. The truth is painful. <br /> <br /> Peter, why couldn't you stop?
