Don't get me wrong, I want to see that marijuana is legalized as much as the next man. I'm landing now. However, writing was unrealistic. A PTA mother dealing with drugs but is confident that her drugs will fall into the minor's hands. Leave me alone. The mystery of the very nature of Mary Louise Parker was an insult to my intelligence. The characters were not at all pleasant. Basically, the land lines went somewhere. I understand this only TV show. The hypocrisy was blatant. Mary Louise Parker should be a big mom and I should believe it .... WHY ???? I just got the feeling that I was proclaimed with an exhibition that speaks abundantly. Similarly, your OK says to deceive your wife, but who has legal age status. OK is not exactly the same thing, but I think you get your point. This will save the children who are wonderful for the campaign trajectories, but it will not keep the water on the cable sitcom's local mother, the local shop dealer.
