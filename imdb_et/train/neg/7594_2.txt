Given the history of this film director, it is hard to believe that it was such a painfully bad movie to sit on. I was in the premiere of Europe last night and one of the producers there was there. He was still watching the movie and the boy was surprised. I have not read a book based on it, and I do not know if it is highly appreciated or appreciated, but I have read "Captain Correll's Mandolin" and how badly it was adjusted and how bad this film was, I can only assume that something similar has happened here. Action was not bad, though Farrell had a couple of too many raised eyebrows. Frankly, I can't believe how little I take care of any character of this movie. Situations play in blank order on the screen. Donald Sutherland's part consists of some scenes where he opens the door, says something and closes it again. I looked at my watch when I didn't see a dialog on the screen. I have never gone out of the movie, but I was tempted to start with it. I gave this movie a score of '2' for reasons that seem terribly low for me, but these are the best things I can say about this movie. The first is that I really enjoyed a too short earthquake and another is that Salma Hayek got naked and looked beautiful. I can't say anything positive about this movie. Don't ask for dust, it can't speak!
