Over the past year, Uwe Boll, as a filmmaker, has shown a marginal improvement by pulling out a competent "King of the Rings" ("Lord of the Rings" Clone) and proudly Vulgar Post-9/11 Satire "But." keeping your bid for legitimacy and respect. And I'm a fan whose films exhibit uniquely the screw-ball vision and are never boring. a colossal misleading experiment with social commentary and even worse iconic creation of mythology (Boll often seems to have taken Rob Zombie's successful "Halloween" restarts). Antagonist is Maxwell Seed (Will Sanderson), noisy, brutal, who has killed 666 people and sits in death, waiting for execution; After the beast's failure, he rises up from the grave to seek revenge for those who put him there ... and so a completely free punishment string begins. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to create a new millennium creator Michael Myers or Jason Voorheese vein, Max Seed is too inaccurate and boring to leave the impression that eventually resembles a washed pro-wrestler, who makes Toolbox Murders progressively equal after boring victims. Moreover, Seed's character and Boll's "message" contradict each other: the death penalty is wrong, certainly, but do we expect that we feel sympathy with a useless killer who left a few hundred corpses awake? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Michael Pare, as James Remar's brave, long-lost brother, "Dexter", is a policeman who sits at the desk, through newspaper extracts, and looking at the meaningless stop-motion scenes of decaying animals and people in Seed's nest about. By the time he and a cluster of cardboard trappers rush into Seed's hiding, the sequence is so drawn out, poorly prepared (lighting is almost non-existent) and frustrating (despite a healthy gore dose) that it almost made me fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Dirty movie making is not limited to this sequence: "Seed" seems to have been nailed by a drunken operator as the camera bobs and weaves indefinitely, a technique that is still in the stomach as a gore itself; these protracted, very insignificant keys point to a nervous, almost non-existent story. After 90 minutes, the film is tortured enough to be considered a form of torture that could have been Boll's intention all the time. <br /> <br /> Fine genius ... I think the joke is in me.
