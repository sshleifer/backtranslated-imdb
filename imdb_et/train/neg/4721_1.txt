Before watching the movie, see the online comments on counterfeiting movie events, especially its prevalence, regarding the widely accepted fact that 7-8,000 Muslim men came out of Srebrenica and shot Serbian paramilitaries. The documentary also belongs to various Serbian-American organizations. Watch this movie critically and read the comments beforehand. Most comments argue that the documentary takes its arguments too far, even if it raises questions that are directed towards wisdom that is common to war. The NYTimes review of Stephen Holden says it is "inaccurate to label this documentary Serbian language," but it should be asked about the facts that many have taken from reliable sources, as well as the omission of the facts that will conquer Serbian forces. I do not recommend seeing this documentary, but I warn you to study it with a particularly critical eye (as you should always do).
