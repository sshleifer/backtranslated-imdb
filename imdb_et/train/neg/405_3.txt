This movie is worth seeing when you are amazed at the special effects. There are interesting visions. In addition, it is a typical ninety years / aughties dazzling hollywood price with no content. True headline. <br /> <br /> The story isn't worth it separately. It's like making a dental surgery in the brain. There's not much to get started. This is nothing original and not very special. So don't at all tell the story. Just look at the effects. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, at the end he became a little glowing by diluting the purity of the great external treatment of the invisible (and sometimes half-invisible) person. However, if you ignore the "standard" pyrotechnics, it is vision (or not to see). <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a decent FX movie that's worth seeing and alone.
