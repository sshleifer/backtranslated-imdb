Drew Barrymore sees his entire city over his ego-ego, and it has really begun to pain in the back. <br /> <br /> After Dee rents an apartment from a hacker, his meeting with another drew will become more frequent. The writer-guy feels that it is his responsibility to pull the "real Drew" out of his stupor, so he does what he can to help him when he attracts him as soon as he has free time. Not very interesting and even less frightening, but Drew is sexy as usual, especially when he gives a finger to a group of stupid construction workers ... yes, Drew, it's hot! <br /> <br /> The best scene can be where Drew pulls his real life mother, Jaid, a big kitchen knife ... hmmm ... and how was your day?
