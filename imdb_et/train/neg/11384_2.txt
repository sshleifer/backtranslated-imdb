From the time that Europe began to fight with World War II until the end of the war, Hollywood (with a significant sprawl of the government) made tons of films aimed at trying to involve young men in the army, making life a military "cool". It's far from desperate, which means that the soldier's life doesn't work, you get the best food, and you can listen all day listening to Ann Miller. I'm too young to participate in World War II, but I think it was more. There's a barest cat slice and a plot of musical numbers that include some of the leading events of the day. <br /> <br /> I think even in 1943, even the most na√Øve citizens knew more about overseas than the unpleasant hijinks depicted in this film. Although I am sure that it was intended to be seen as entertaining entertainment, I cannot be surprised whether the family and loved ones of war-fighting men were amused or repulsed by the sacrifice of their loved ones.
