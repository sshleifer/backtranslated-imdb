Well, with an endless search for horror, we are dealing with this film, which apparently was restarted on DVD recently for some divine reason. The transfer is terrible and the quality just sucks. I don't think this is due to a bad remaster or something, I think the film is badly done. <br /> <br /> Obviously filmed in an abandoned school whose budget is undoubtedly wasted on cheap beer and talent hacking begins, "Slaughter High" starts slowly and does not rush for about an hour. First, we see "nerdit" as it has chosen ... t don't even know what they were supposed to be ... jocks? The President, his ultra hooknose, is so ugly that he should have been kidding. Then there is a "big boy" and a few stupid losers and chicks who should be "hot" but not. It's a mystery why this group of attacks chooses one, but I think the viewer must assume they are "cool kids". Elections are terrible because most college students play thirty times. As other reviewers have said, the actors (if you can name them) are a bunch of Britons whose accents slip around all this mess. We should assume that this group of "children" was the only pupils in this school because their "reunion" is only for those schools that are now abandoned, just those. <br /> <br /> Kill is flat, gore is not big and script is like Scooby Doo with real people; such as "This place gives me climbing ..." and "Someone gives beer" is highlighted ... It's not just good. Leave it out if you don't waste your friends and want to laugh at a real flat test. If you want to see the good, get a Bava blood sample that was made 14 years ago and much better. If you want to see a good BAD batsman, check out "Just Before Dawn" or "The Burning". 2 out of 10, kids.
