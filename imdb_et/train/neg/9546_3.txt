If you thought 83 of the original were bad, try this contemporary masterpiece. How could it ask more? Well ... at least on the first place where Ally Sheedy was in the sports bra. With the exception of updated graphics, contemporary themes (such as terrorists), modern weapons, and a sexy new voice for Ripley, this is sadly the same sad tired story. Anyone who saw the first saw exactly where the story went to the next scene / line. And for anyone who didn't see the first one, I think I'm just looking at it once. Maybe Hollywood will try again after 23 years.
