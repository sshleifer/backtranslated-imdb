This film was made in Saskatchewan and Manitoba Park and returned to the world for what little "Wild Western Canada" has left. When Archie began writing her stories; The idea of ​​the day was to silence the desert and transform / swallow the peoples of the first people. <br /> <br /> The film presents a question and asks a question; why would an educated, obviously talented Englishman become an Indian? <br /> <br /> Archie, because English boy dreams of getting something, but the full meaning of this dream is unique and invaluable - no mater what it is. It seems like a famous doll story, no. <br /> <br /> I thought I saw Archie got my lively picture of "The Cigar Store in India", which is a very wooden character and is not at all real - very well done by Mr. Brosnan. He also depicted a natural indistinct in a tourist dance picture. Its completeness and reality were not understood until she met and married her husband Annie. Annie pushed Archie in the direction that would bring him to the forefront of English, not as himself, but from the border of Gray Owl-Canadian Native Desert. <br /> <br /> This is the closest Archie who will become a noble savage prototype. <br /> <br /> Mr Brosnan's interpretation and the directors are so well done. I watched the documentaries about Gray Owl and I think it's a big screen movie to add to my collection. <br /> <br /> Spoiler - I thought the last scene with Archie would meet with the Prime Ministers' Council. a very good moment on the film. <br /> <br /> Very beautiful Canadian lake landscape and real "gray horse" locations. <br /> <br />
