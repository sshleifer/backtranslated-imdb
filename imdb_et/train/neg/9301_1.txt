Front Spoilers if you want to call them ... <br /> <br /> I would just like this movie just so people can really see 1/10. Where to start, we start from the beginning ... <br /> <br /> NATURE: Don't believe in the premise - the film has nothing to do with abandoned cars and people understand what mysterious events are. It's basic, go to the cabin movie without intensity or "effortless". <br /> <br /> SCREENPLAY: I usually give credit to indie screenwriters, it's a hard job when you start ... but it's a mess. The story is flat - it leaves you with the whole movie unknown. The dialogue is extremely weak and predictable, which speaks of "Woah, you amazed me" and "I wondered if you wanted ... if you wanted ...?". It makes me smear all the hair cut out, one chain at a time and feed it myself. <br /> <br /> CHARACTERISTICS: Holy Career !!!! Some have described the character as an apartment, I want to go one step further and say they actually have the opposite characters. They start to work in a parallel universe and start to act almost back ... <br /> <br /> WORKERS: Worse than characters are actors. They already take the poor written signs and add a terrible high school drama. "Woah, with whom you completely thrown me" was said to be so monotonous and slow - as it was disappointed. I could complain about acting alone for hours. <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL: LIGHT: Eight years old would be disappointed with lighting this movie. Too shady areas, too bleached in others. The director should not use light as an emotion until he learns how to illuminate the basic scenes correctly. Childrens Steps! SOUND: How many sound sounds do you make for a really brilliant movie? 9. For many of these sonic boys, this should amaze, but the opposite is true. Especially there is one scene that really looks out, these guys are driving in the car and the sound of the car changes every corner of the camera ... WEAK! CAMERA: Learn to use it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I can't rent the room ..... rent - I dare you ... Rent it and learn about it ... give it 1 rating ... it deserves it. <br /> <br /> Logout ...
