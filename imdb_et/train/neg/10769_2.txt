I found it on the shelf during the household and boredom. How can people give it 10? It's not just that it should be a feeling-good redemption film (guess) because it doesn't work at that level either. Weak plot, bad dialogue, terrible action; there's nothing. Harvey Keitel is decent, but he has nothing to do, and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are just terrible. Plot progress (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) makes no sense. It seems the writers wanted the plot to go in a certain way and did it without writing the actual bit needed to flow. It's only an hour and a half, but it's 90 minutes of your life that you never get back.
