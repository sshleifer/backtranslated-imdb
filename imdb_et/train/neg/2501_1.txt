Did I see it on the TV the other night? or rather, I shook the other channel so often to look at the information sign when I couldn't look at it anymore. It was bad. Really, very bad. Not "so bad that it's good" just bad. How was it financed? Who thought it was a good idea? The actor's friend who was listened to and told him that he wasn't good enough to play a bad boy, but I think what they meant was "to save yourself and escape with this steaming stack @ # $%." I bet the rest was for that choice. To be fair, it was difficult to judge the terrible counterfeit of counterfeit America. The shooting was dullllllllllllll. The activity was uncomfortable and stylish. The dialogue was nasty. The saddest thing was the ship. In real life, the Interisland barge is a fluttering boat, and the film does not move well. Instead of trying to do it very successfully to look like a new team with a beam of incandescent bulb surrounded by stainless polls, I won't do it, they could have changed the script to explain or even mark the shabby. Dark, stupid, stupid. Don't look at this movie, not even a joke.
