Yet another of the many forgotten films that Poverty Row won in the 1930s rose up by DVD magic. <br /> <br /> Lionel Atwill, a universal player with frequent shades, is a pair of twins who participated in the murder racket. One kills the victims (the shareholders involved in the scam) and asks the witnesses for the exact time, the other is deaf and has been proved "innocent" because he could not speak to the witnesses. <br /> <br /> Of course, where it breaks down, is it congenital deaf, are they both deaf? Oh, well. <br /> <br /> Atwill is doing a good job here, deaf and silent. Unfortunately, no one else is worthy of acting here.
