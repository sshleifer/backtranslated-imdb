In his work, the writer / director Bart Sibrel relies on this film, which he says NASA erroneously sent him. He says it shows astronauts who fake the television material on their journey to the moon using camera tricks. The astronauts were always on the low ground, and the ground-based editors made the raw material just a few seconds after the finished movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sibrel's study does not understand his "backstage" footage is really a part of the 30-minute live broadcast (also on this roll) seen by millions, not NASA's repositories, as he says. And we have to think about why Sibrel puts his movie picture on the astronauts sound of his conspiracy, because hearing astronauts in his own words clearly shows that astronauts just tried the camera, not beating. <br /> <Finally, anyone can see the raw material for themselves without buying a hacked version of Sibrel. (She shows you more about the Zapruder movie about JFK's murder than her "smoking gun".) Sibrel thinks she's the only one to see it. Even more revealing are the clips of the raw material that Sibrel NOT used, such as those that clearly show that the land is hidden from the window frames and so on, destroying his claim that mats and films were placed in space windows to create the illusion of a distant Earth. <br /> <br /> Like most movies of this type, Sibrel relies on an enthusiast, expert assumption, misleading comment, and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer to accept the conclusion that there is no real evidence of splitting.
