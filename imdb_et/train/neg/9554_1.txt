That's the worst, and I mean the worst computer-based movie I've ever seen. The whole plot is completely convincing and silly. <br /> <br /> I mean ... <br /> <br /> The guy in this movie can actually talk to a real person with a computer. Now you think it must be a very good, high tech computer, but it does it with other very bad and weak computers that don't even have a graphical interface. <br /> <br /> And the main idea of ​​overloading a "super" computer by connecting a computer game online is really stupid. My mobile phone shuts down lighting to save energy, but obviously this genius will decide whether to use its resources to deal with national security threats or to download computer games. <br /> <br /> There are other bad things about it, but I just don't get that time. <br /> <br /> I just can't believe anyone can record a movie fool like this
