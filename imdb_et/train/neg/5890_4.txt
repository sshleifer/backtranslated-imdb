This romantic comedy is not too bad. Here and there are some funny things and there are some rather memorable signs. <br /> <br /> Action is amateurish (except the banker). While some scenes are very fun, others are simply embarrassing. First of all, I found the story of "romantic". All in all, I think it's worth seeing if you like football and romantic comedies. It's not really a bad movie, and the end feeling was pretty good. Just wait for something ordinary. Enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
