This piece, because I can't call it a movie, can be summarized as follows. <br /> <br /> -The stereotypical black criminal, black dwarf partner gets in trouble - a black dwarf pretending to be a child against a fully developed adult face, body hair, and genitals - a black dwarf is wrong (somehow) by a man and a woman who want a child - black dwarf when dealing with physical and sexual violence, white people, wherever he sees them need to do and more crimes - Happy ending <br /> <br /> Frankly, it could have been a good satire if would not be so weakly guided and would have such talented beats.
