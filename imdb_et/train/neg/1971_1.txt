This movie is very disappointing. Not only does Wenders only display a very limited musical spectrum of Blues, but its subjective and personal interest in the parts of the music that bring the film that makes viewing and listening completely boring. The only highlight of the film is an interview with the Swedish couple who were friendly to J.B. Lenoir and show your personal video footage and stories. The introduction of Wender's film material begins quite interestingly - referring to the world culture traveling in space (or actually American culture), but its limited journey, as well as the story of the 1930s, is not funny or completely exciting. movie as just sleeping bags. Yawn. I was expecting him more.
