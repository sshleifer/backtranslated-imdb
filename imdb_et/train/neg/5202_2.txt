Contains a spoiler The plot can be summed up in a few sentences: Three men go hunting in the woods. Two of them, along with other people, are left behind without explanation. The last boy can stand clear, shout and do nothing without firing. She goes for a walk through the old factory and the evil people walk without their struggle. The roots are comfortably black and look like villains. <br /> <br /> This is a whole story that has not been summed up but detailed. Everything is pulled out when a man is standing with a doorbell. We're waiting for her. A long blow where boys are in the woods and sleep. We can take them with them. A woman who pulled out a female runner could have been redeemed if we saw her butt or chest strapping. The characters just don't talk. And then they don't even have something nervous to say, "I'll be back." When my friend shot it at the weekend, I'd love her because it's a pretty amazing camera controls. Renting money for renting it on DVD is totally inappropriate. One of the things that is a little funny is what the director says, how they didn't know the local police that they were shooting and treating them like a casual man with a plug. If they had filmed it, I'd be sure the movie would be more fun.
