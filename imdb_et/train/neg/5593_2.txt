I love Draculat, but this movie was a complete disappointment! I remember Lee from other Dracula movies when I was younger, and I thought he was great, but this movie was very bad. I do not know if it was my youth who deceived me to believe that Lee was the ultimate Dracula, style, appearance, attractiveness, and under the evil. Or maybe it was this movie that deceived me. <br /> <br /> But can you imagine Dracula being with snobbish English accent and body language? Do you like when the plot contains unrealistic choices of characters and is boring and has no tension ...? Then this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> Otherwise - you can't see it! I only gave it to 2 because I managed to stay awake during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but if you liked this movie, you need to be alone in a dark room with a lot of hidden space behind you. Maybe alone in your parents' house or in a stranger home. The reason that even the flick's characters were not seen by fear, and I think it will bring the whole thing together! <br /> <br /> Or maybe you like this movie because of this place in the history of Dracula's cinema, maybe the fascination of Dracula's story with Nosferatu has been fascinated to this day. Because it's not appealing because of the movie, it doesn't pull you into the suggestive mystery that makes Vampyre so exciting for me. <br /> <br /> In addition, this sticky 70 has so much. The landscape looks like a cheap theater. And I'm not saying I pushed back everything done in the 70s. Because I can both old film and new.
