Knightly and O'Tool, as the leaders of this film, had good chances on this film and with McCallum as a bad boy after Knightly, maybe some tension. But they threw it all down for a foolish dinner and later for a maudlin war. Of course, it was completely superficial, beautiful English country and seafront or not. The first mistake was looting so early on in the film as if it had been easily played by someone a couple of years older than choosing someone ten years older to play a part. They were all-encompassing between the great conflicts that had been cast, and strangely, with the elements of light and cheap heartbeat.
