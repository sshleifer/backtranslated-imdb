Well, what can I say about this movie. I am speechless. I could go on, how stupid this film is forever, although one thing I really liked was music. And from above, someone commented on how much they like him. For them all I have to say is that it was ripped from one of the best martial arts films of all time to the Fists of Fury, which is played by Bruce Lee. If she was still alive and she'd ever met her, she would be scared. the rest of the film is completely ridiculous and a waste of tape. I'm telling the tape because it wouldn't be possible to shoot a movie on the film. I feel now stupid about watching my 30-minute life. The only reason I even saw was that my roommate downloaded this ill curiously. What the world is coming from.
