When I watch a movie about a zombie, I don't expect an oscaric caliber or write at the godfather level, but I hope the actors don't see at least their tense read their smart cards and it doesn't sound like it was written 10 minutes before the actor read it on the camera . This movie was just terrible, I got up and left about 25 minutes and went to the neighbor and looked at the Cold Creek mansion, which wasn't very good, but it looked like a Citizen Kane compared to the jade. On the plus side, the girls were very beautiful, this is probably the only thing that kept me in place for the first 5 minutes, I actually left after the hottest death. after that.
