The 1979 "Phantasm" was a very obvious, horrible, scary and very original horror stroke, and one word, a cult. The first order of 1988 was gory, witty, bustling and very fun. But after the first order, Don Coscarelly, the creator of "Phantasm", apparently lacked new ideas. The 1994 "Phantasm III - The Dead Lord" is certainly not a complete failure, even fun, but originality is no longer, and desperate attempts to bring something new are sometimes tiring, making it quite tiring compared to its predecessors. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> From the outset, the secret of mysterious sentinel spheres (silver balls flying to the brain sucking) is unveiled. In the future, several unnecessary and annoying new characters (like Tim, "Home Alone" - a little boy who will be very big, rocky, harsh and super-cool nunchaku-swinging black chick with a team.). The film also has its own features - Reggie Bannister is again cool when pony-tailed, the guitar plays Reggie. Angus Scrimm is still quite creepy than Tall Man, but the fact that Tall Man speaks a lot more about this movie makes him somewhat ridiculous. Mike's character is once again played by A. Michael Baldwin (he was replaced by James LeGros in Part 2), which I think doesn't make a big difference. Gore is also interesting enough to watch the film, but it is still a disappointment, especially as attempts at lack of ideas are trying to distract quite quickly. <br /> <br /> All things, "Phantasm III" is an acceptable timeframe, but it is definitely disappointing compared to its predecessors. The fans of the first two "Phantasm" films can try it, but I recommend not setting their expectations too high.
