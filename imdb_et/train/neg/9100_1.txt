Christ, oh Christ ... One of the watches is stunned, unbelievable, and probably unsuccessful, because this relaxing workout in a puzzled bellows opens with the whole galapagos tortoise. Can such things be? Is this movie actually there or was I an unwanted guinea pig in some shady international drug company who tasted my coffee without knowing it was equipped with a dangerous hallucinogen? I've seen a lot of movies and a lot of bad movies, but I've never done anything about it; At the end of it I was a butterfly, a despicable wreck, breaking my carpet with my teeth like a dog, clawing on the walls, bending down until my lungs were painful. I asked desperately, mercilessly for mercy (to whom this complaint was made, I do not know), and longing for a burning desire for Ozu Yasujiro's soothing balm. Dear Jesus laughing, memories ... sometimes they come back to me. When I'm the most vulnerable when I can do the least. I despise, break the tears, I bite my nails until my hands are broken with blood, but I can't suppress the terrible setbacks. I'm haunted. I'm injured. I'm a human shell. <br /> <br /> Other user comments suggest that I have not gone through this terrible experience alone, which can mean just one of two things: a) film, actually, or b) I'm just one of the victims of the true proportions of sins international conspiracy. It is quite reasonable that some people seem to have tried it, or at least it is not traumatized. Maybe they're part of the operation. God cursed, maniac! God fuck them all in hell !!!!!!
