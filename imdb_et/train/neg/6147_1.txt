I really don't get everything that this movie has got. It's mawkish, unnecessarily manipulative, and dodges many big issues - that is, Nash's stuff and his predisposition to have sex with men in public places. I think it is almost acceptable in the context of a commercial Hollywood movie, but what is all about commendable to Russell Crowe's performance? The man just seems to be stirring, fixing his suitcase and wearing a grungy hat, and somehow it seems to qualify for fine action? Anyone who has ever experienced a mental health problem understands that Crowe's performance is a little caricature. It is also quite offensive. And I dare say, right side, to be really terrible
