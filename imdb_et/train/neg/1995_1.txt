Well I just paid the dollar for this movie DVD and it wasn't even worth it. It looks like it's from bad publications and is in the public domain, I think. <br /> <br /> Neagle - despite her glory, prizes and reputation - is a home-made British gal who can't sing or dance or act. <br /> <br /> Some fine old Hollywood characters who are shown here have to think they're doing classics. Director Herbert Wilcox (Neagle's wife) always thought that Anna was the most exciting and talented fan of the screen. He's wrong. He was extremely popular in Britain before and after World War II. His "serious" roles are even more ridiculous than his musical appearance. <br /> <br /> Only a few famous songs have been added and neither of them is well presented. Leave it out and find the one that marks Doris Day. At least you can get real comedy and professional style dance!
