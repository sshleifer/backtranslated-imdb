The only connection that this film has to make to horror is that it is terribly endless. I would pinch my finger with a rusty nail if I have to sit it again. Even for TV, it's flat. The cast is boring. The scenario is as exciting as a sand bowl. How the two directors who had agreed to create such a film remain the great secret of the 20th century. Omen's franchise is still quite vaguely involved, and it is a blow to slo-mois and a shorter expected return. If you are tempted to see it, pop it in, set the alarm clock for 90 minutes and use comfort. Whatever happens, you start out quickly, and the alarm wakes you up when the worst is over. Namely this movie.
