He was a director by the name of James. He brought us wonderfully fascinating scientific literature like Terminator and foreigners. These films were things that were made, and he saw that he had a fantastic future in front of him, because the dawn of computer-based special effects arrived at the film industry. The Terminator 2 showed us a glimpse of what was possible in the new age. <br /> <br /> ....... and then countless awards ................ ... 1997 ........ ......... unspecified sums ............ ...... maximum profit margin ........ Titanic was here! <br /> <br /> I've never (ever) jumped on a jumpplane and too critical it's actually just the opposite to get an argument. But Titanic was a movie that I took only one positive thing - Kate Winslett is absolutely proud! <br /> <br /> Quickly - the dialogue was like something from the Beverly Hills 90210, the actor was more of a wood than my nephew, the terrifying images were actually comic (a man fell from a ship and hit a propeller), historically wrong (not even getting me started) because there is too much), he had terrible music (cheese with the bodyguard up) and the story of meaningless love was so annoying, self-absorbing, and pathetic that he didn't want to paralyze everyone involved (I was glad when he died and deceived) if he did not). <br /> <br /> It was clearly evident that this picture was meant to watch MTV, chew bubbles, search for a boy's car, teenage girls (DeCaprio himself recalled something less heroic than a boy band's rich member). Hungry boyfriends for three a nd and half an hour chick-flashing hope later to be happy! The worst aspect was that it didn't stop. Millions of dumbed, cultural vultures went to see this expensive waste of celluloid because "it costs so much to produce it must be great" and "Steve and Barbara said it was good and they know their movies". <br /> <br /> Chronic glory arrived when Titanic swept boards at Academy awards. Hollywood King James had a serious silence for the deadly victims of his three and a half-hour farce. It looked at me as if he had prayed for forgiveness, having misinterpreted the circumstances that led to the death of many people after blessing. <br /> <br /> But when people are foolish and sentimental to buy this garbage, they deserve to be ripped off. Good luck to Hollywood, if it is, how they want to make money, I'd do it if I had such a chance! <br /> <br /> This is where there are other stupid, historically false / human interests in the list of the worst films of all time, like "The Patriot" and "Pearl Harbor".
