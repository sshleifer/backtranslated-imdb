I was glad to hear that someone had made a documentary about what it was like to be in Puerto Rican. When I heard it was Rosie Perez, I wondered if she might know what it was like Puerto Rican. As far as I knew .... he was Nuyorican. Anyway, I sat down to watch my popcorn. I realized within 10 minutes that my initial fear was right. Rosie Perez has little knowledge of what to do with Puerto Rican. This "documentary" is more than the first hand, a very personal account of what it is to be Nuyorican ... and all that comes with it. He (like most of the nuvi people I know) has a watered, partial, and sometimes twisted sense of history. (How they couldn't ... they live here.) Yes, they're all proud. As they should be! But much of the REAL does not know much about culture, history and political background or language. It all became very obvious when he participated in the Vieques issue. Regardless of my personal key, there is ... at least I know what hell is fighting. He has been arrested for what he knew little about ... and just because it was "Puerto Rica". I really do not understand how he does not recognize it. For those who are not in Puerto Rico, look at it partly as a way to discover and accept a woman. Don't take it for the gospel ... not even true. Please see the source. Rosie is an actor; not a historian. This movie is not and should never be the basis for the information of other Nuyoricans. Instead, just step on to find out more about finding, learning and discussing what is reality. Not only who comes from this woman's sight.
