I thought the main character, the astronaut, who runs badly (in his case, his skin, hair, muscles, etc.) can always get more movies than he was in a bottle. All he has to do is get a job at Blobina. The assumption of this flick is pretty flat. Astronaut is exposed to sunlight (I think) and starts like a ice cream cone on a hot day. Not only is it complicated, but it probably has to kill people and consume their flesh to maintain some sort of cell integrity. Ah? Have you ever noticed that if any radiation accident or attempt occurs, will a person become a machine for immediate slaughter? Why is it like that? <br /> <br /> Astronaut links came into the night from a secret facility (with no security), deleting parts of itself. Obviously, it will keep enough memory to launch the launch pad, perhaps because it wanted to return to space. <br /> <br /> This is where the part of the movie that is quite a filler begins, with the Geiger counter-moving doctor trying to find the fusible man he's giving out. He kills a foolish fisherman like Bill Gates, scares a little girl out of a Frankenstein monster movie and ends up with a mad parent pair (punishing them karmingly for stealing some lemon). Then there is a short scene where he carries his former general, and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and rides around his girlfriend. You would think that, after he cuts his hand and runs away, the scene would change. But no ... we treat about ten minutes when a woman has been intimidated and intimidated by terror, even though the monster has gone. All I thought was a conductor girlfriend, anyone? <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is even lamer than the rest. The melting man ends the perimeter of the pile and then ... nothing. That's it. This is the end of the movie. Well, at least it meant there was no sequel to space.
