Warning that you should not be seduced by the names Bigelow and Red. _Undertow_ is meaningless and unassuming and often led me to think of the Twain phrase to want all the characters to sink. If someone highlights the category of the worst movies, I don't like the fact that I think _Plan 9_ or _Attrile of Killer Shrews_; it's like that. What a waste of time - me and everyone who dealt with this flick.
