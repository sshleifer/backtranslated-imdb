I saw this movie two weeks ago in Paris at the festival des nouvelles images du Japon. Although I did not expect much, I have to say that I am disappointed just like many people in the audience ... if I wanted to summarize how I felt, I would say that I compare it to princess mononoke and nausicaa from start to finish. Of course it is stupid. But I couldn't help it. The stories are quite different, but the captured worlds are very similar. And from this point of view, the "palm tree" certainly cannot be compared to the masterpieces of Miyazaki. Even if it is technically quite good, boredom is left ... finally the complete lack of originality makes me recommend not to take care of it. I appreciated it from 2 to 10 (a little rough, I think it deserves 3 or 4)
