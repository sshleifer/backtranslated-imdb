OK, I looked at the original French version. But I can't imagine that it would be better with subtitles. <br /> <br /> Everything I have to say is the most boring film I've ever seen. There is almost no redemption property for this film. That's why I don't understand all the positive comments. It may in some sense be realistic, but some real stories are best left out. <br /> <br /> I usually like a slow paced movie when it serves the purpose of the movie. Tarkovski Solaris is at an extremely slow pace, but it makes you feel and sets the mood for the movie. But in this case, the movie is simply presented with a meaningless dialogue that can tell us little about characters. None of them that I can identify or take care of. In many scenes I found myself thinking, "When do they start to shut up"? Operation was pretty bad. Not in an excessively obvious way. But no one seems to be interested in their characters and they all looked like they wanted to be in most scenes elsewhere. This may be due to the unetspired dialogue they gave. The whole stream of the film also seemed quite mechanically. Going from one scene to another. It seems that this movie was just written (badly) but never directed. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies I can say that did not create an emotional response to any scene. There is no tension, fear, no expectation, no sadness, no self-expression, no intellectual stimulation, no interest in it. <br /> <br /> A great example of what I call anti-film.
