Bad performances by Sinatra, Martin and Hyeri. Generally underdeveloped support characters. Nice annoying without real plot. Completion leaves you flattened than a pancake, more open when you can tie in four queues (that is, even if you look after their wooden characters). MacLaine is the only real asset. This penultimate sequence, where the "Chicago hood" looks for the character of Sinatra, is ridiculous. Music in this order is also bad. And in the last scene, when Martin's character removed his hat from his wife, he called "pig" almost me out and found a stone to throw at my TV screen.
