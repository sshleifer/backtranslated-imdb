I wrote down a review of this movie after I bought it from a DVD and I was barely disappointed. <br /> <br /> I tried to look at it again when I read some comments made since then. Being a student of film and making similar budget films (ie, no budget, digi cam), I have my initial comments. It is not a budgeted student project (and not particularly good) that is published on video / dvd to look like an award winning film (if you read the cover). So destroying the public thinks it's not something. I want my money back according to the description of the transactions! Complete garbage!
