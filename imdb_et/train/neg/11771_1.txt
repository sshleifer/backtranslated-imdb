It was shown as part of the 59th Edinburgh International Festival, although for the reasons that were the best powers. It seems that much has been done to be the first Thai film made with Thai actors and the team, but run by the West. No need to be honest because this movie is boring, boring, boring. Why hesitate to think about a mysterious idea, how to rely somewhat on the feeling that you can grab a point at home with terrible voices, obvious images, and a top scene> Nothing is over and again, the Spurrier left over to the head crumbles endlessly in clich√©s. No hint, no idea, it's all on the screen, no need to use our imagination. I wonder how "scary" a bit arrives? No, you wont, because the soundtrack is getting more and more threatening, rising maliciously. Hell, I do words to describe how bad it is. Interestingly, is the imprisoned demon real or imaginary? Why tax yourself - it's really a snake, and yes, it's biting his feet, and there's blood everywhere. this is a strange, restless movie for several reasons. It should be a horror film, but it's not scary - the fools are marked and obvious. It may be a dirty attack on the side of Thailand, but the director has barely a slippery and dirty style when showing teenagers. Perhaps it was the innocent key to the birds that planted doubt in my head. Or maybe the whole thing was just pants. Unknown, Uncomfortable, Repeated, Attacked - All candidates are the best, but boring seems most appropriate and honest. It's all seen before, probably better, often with more thinking, rarely less imagination or burning. Sorry. Illuminates for each census. Really terrible.
