Finally I was able to watch this experimental Lynch for a short while after waiting so long ... and unfortunately it wasn't worth it! Even for a dead hard Lynch fan, I found it really annoying .... <br /> <br /> nothing happens, there are long, long, long painful breaks where nothing happens, long, monotonous calls where nothing is said and the whole thing ends when the viewer does not know or cares what the hell was, what happened before and what happened later. <br /> <br /> I had a hint of Mulholland Drive - a blonde girl and a brunette girl were very Diane and Rita-style and lost a Highway moment with clues to some important event that didn't happen clearly. Unfortunately, it is all very uninteresting and very boring, nothing happens, it is very forgotten and I think I will delete it from my computer and forget that I have ever watched it. Sorry David!
