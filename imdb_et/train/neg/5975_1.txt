I never wanted to see this movie, one day, after joking, I watched it see how bad it was; my previews were confirmed. <br /> <br /> For beginners, I would like to ask for a movie policy. It hides a woman behind masks because it makes the city big, but the only way women can do it is to use their sexuality rather than their intelligence or skills. These women are no longer whores. Can little less attractive girls be successful? It's not the only right-hand message in the movie, there are hundreds of American flags and huge cash. An exemplary example of how capitalism is the only powerful thing in America and something of a spiritual, moral, or artistic value does not even reflect this film. Money is portrayed as the only one important for young people. <br /> <br /> The bar manager says he won't allow drug addicts in his bar and then he will go to the poor gallon of hard alcohol under his neck and then his staff and clients' neck. Anyone who knows something about drinkers knows that liquid can be as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs. And finally, why are scenes where the lead is a sexual point of interest to the audience (if he starts to dress or his boyfriend), is his father always involved? We look at how he's dressed when the camera practically worships his feet when he's one phone with his father. He "auctions" his father as he "auctions" his boyfriend. I find this to be the most strange. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this movie is immoral, fascist, humiliating for women, and frankly disturbing. But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
