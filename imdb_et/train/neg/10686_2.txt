Please help the economy - spend your money elsewhere! The movie's conclusion is: the first lady has murdered her husband because she was cheating on her. That's it. No one, except Cuba and Angie, has noticed it, plans and implements a massive murder conspiracy that no one knows ... and goes completely free. <br /> <br /> Some specific points are especially fun: Cuba, the incumbent president, is targeting an assassin ball that then enters the president's head. <br /> <br /> Cuba and Angie watch the movie from the news camera and see ... a clue. They go a long way to protecting the film, believing they are the only people with a copy of this very public movie. <br /> <br /> Cuba talks to a member of the presidential staff. PSM commented on the lack of conspiracy. Cuba claims that more than one person participated. The PSM then asks that the conspiracy includes FBI, CIA and NSA. Gosh, I don't know if it's PSM. <br /> <br /> Archer, the first lady, is a craptacular artist. Cuba can't paint, and he says, "You're too close ... stand back ... look from another perspective, look from my perspective." Does anyone understand this?
