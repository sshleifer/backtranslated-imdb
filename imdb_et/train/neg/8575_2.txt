****** SPOILERS ****** <br /> <br /> An unforgettable radio quiz showing Receiver and his mediocre band is an excuse for Lugos, Karloff and Lorre to take this happy salary ride . Sporadically Traceable Haunted House Fraud. Lugosi is a mystic whose seances are exhibited in a fraudulent attempt to succeed the heir; Karloff is a butler and Lorre is a professor who publishes false media, but it turns out that they are both conspirators against Lugos. Of course, Kay Kyser and his 30-year-old "children" discover the truth as little as possible with humor. Not recommended for anyone, but for an absolute horror graduate.
