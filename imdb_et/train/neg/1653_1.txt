It just seems strange that someone reads this script and thought, "It's funny! Who was that person? Is he actually the person responsible for it? Are they the ones who owe me for my time, more than the director / writer?" There is no good dialogue, no pleasant character, and a story ... <br /> <br /> I prefer the worst movie ever, "Hulk Hogan's" No Hold's Barred "pretty much. It's almost like Shakespeare." cast members laughing at the funny mistakes they have made and the things that went wrong with this comedy I am happy to see someone laughing somehow, with some connection to this "movie." Something. It's really flat. I love movies that are so bad that they're good. It's so bad that it's ... something, but I don't know what and hopefully I'll never find. <br /> <br /> Amanda Peet does not suck directly and is actually the only side of this movie But it really means little. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
