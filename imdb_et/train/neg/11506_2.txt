This movie story is bad enough to happen in real life. I don't understand when they show us this bad movie. I say it was bad because there is any reason. 1. When Madonna was rich and able to do whatever she wants, why does she fall in love with this bad man. 2. How can the story script be so weak? He was so rich, able to do whatever he wants, but he doesn't dare to divorce his wife, which is very impossible. <br /> <br /> The words I love do not mean anything in this movie.
