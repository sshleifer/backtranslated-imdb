The first half hour of this movie that I liked. The obviously silly romance of Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was lovely to look at and I wanted to see that it was inevitable between them. But when the action went home to the groom of Ingrid, it all broke down. Instead of romance and charm, we see some exciting parallel signs that destroy the film. The foolish son and military attach√©, who took the servant's attention, seemed stupid - in a way like the old Love Boat episode. How the charm and elegance of the first part of the film can give doping is beyond me. This film is Renoir's obvious attempt to restore the success he had with the rules of the game, as the film is very similar when the action goes into a country house (just like another movie). I was not a big fan of ECONOMIC RULES, but ELENA and HER MEAD had to evaluate the art and nuances of the original text.
