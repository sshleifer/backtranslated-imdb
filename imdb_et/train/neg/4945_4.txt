Of course, this is not really a split, nor is it a position. "Dieter" is the name of a rather popular German musician who loves or hates his actions and this film. This based autobiography "Dieter Bohlen" wrote a few years ago but is not meant to be accurate. The film is full of sexual offensive content (at least American standard), which is either amusing (not for other "actors") or stupid - it depends on your individual humor or being "Bohlen" -Old or not. Technically, there is not much to criticize. Speaking to me, I find this movie an OK movie.
