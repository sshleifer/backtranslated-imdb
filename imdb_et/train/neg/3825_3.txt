I saw this movie at the weekend and, although I was impressed, as always with the beauty and polishing of the films produced by the church, I was disappointed that it fell so short that it did not inform the members and left the investigators with many unanswered questions. > <br /> The film is a 70-minute vignette of Joseph Smith's life. This is not a true biopsy because there is no real coherent narrative. Most episodes concern Joseph, doing good deeds, playing baseball, running competitions and laughing with children, often in sloooow movement. What's great, just the people Joseph was? Look at her carpet for her wife Emma. Well, how about her 33 plural woman? Nothing is mentioned about Polygamy. Dazzling omission. <br /> <br /> And just like the flaws where the film tends to. It does not give enough information and leaves the audience of critical thinking to think about why Joseph is getting feathers and feathers, why is he imprisoned and why does this mob want to kill him? The climax of the film is, of course, the track of Joseph and Hyrum in Carthage prison (riding along the true United Nations, which looks out of Nauvoo's door). But WHAT has never been mentioned. Something from the Smith to Nauvoo's exposition newspaper and the commissioning of this press were destroyed by exposing the polygamy's secret teaching. The audience is left to think or assume that it is just more unjustified persecution from the church. It has not been mentioned that Joseph is charged with a coup to fight for a declaration of war and to summon Nauvoo's army. <br /> <br /> Of course, I certainly didn't expect this film produced from the church to present Richard Bushman's recent biography to Rough Stone's Rolling, but I was surprised and surprised at how little material was actually presented. <br /> <br /> And worse, the substance was often inaccurate. Two examples jumped to me. First, the translation of the Book of Mormon. The film shows that Joseph read the golden plates of his double binder, which were actually far from the plates. It is well known that Joseph did his translation by hiding his face in the hat, looking at the stone of the seer there. Another inaccuracy is in Carthage Prison, where mob mobilizes a cell. In the history of the Church it is reported that Joseph had a six-shooter and even fired a few rounds before jumping out of the window and giving the Masonants a distress signal (as noted in Times & Seasons). <br /> <br /> Maybe the showdown of the reality of the fight would have crushed the heartbreaking mood that the filmmakers had created, but left them in a failed history and couldn't show Joseph when he was really: comfortable with a weapon and able to defend himself. In fact, the film has the impression that Joseph was a nice boy, but also a milquette that everyone beat, imprisoned and finally murdered with cold blood. He was far from it; Joseph was a disciplined and decisive person who suffered a lot of trouble and effort to carry out what he believed. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie, but I know it's a cotton candy. Then get your meat and potatoes by reading the Bushman Smith biography, a rough rock rolling. PS: Films produced by the Church have no credit, but experienced eyes can choose a few familiar faces. Rick Macy is great, like Joseph Smith, Sr and Bruce Newbold, who are loved by Thomas as a believer in Christ;
