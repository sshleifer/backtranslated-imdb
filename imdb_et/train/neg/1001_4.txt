I rented it on a DVD and I feel bad because Dawson and Lugacy are so serious about DVD comments. It's not exactly a bad movie, but it's one of those films that desperately wants to comment deeply on human nature, but doesn't understand that his story is practically a genre. In addition, this is much easier with the problem, but the behavior of the characters often tends to believe. I'd say this movie that you get something out if you don't have a lot of movie / television / literature / life behind you (let's face it, I've even seen exactly the same story in horror comics even). Otherwise, its point has been made earlier and more artificially. And this is going to be a big problem, because there is no cinematographic interest in it. Ultimately, this is quite a fun movie that invests in the idea that the main story is shocking and convincing and it doesn't really cost.
