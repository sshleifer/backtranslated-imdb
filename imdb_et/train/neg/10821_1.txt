I first read the novel Jane Eyre in 1986. It was round at that time when I saw the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was a great version and very similar to the book. Years later, I put my eyes on this version and was terrible. William Hurt is completely dirty as Rochester. Mr Rochester is a passionate character where William Hurt depicts him as an ice block. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together. This is a story of love and passion, but I didn't see it in this version. No, back to the BBC version. Great time is guaranteed.
