Once again, like Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbirds, the TV series shows a full-length movie and is being destroyed by all the hundreds of people who watched. In principle, the Duke's cousins, Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) spend a lot of time in Hazzard County driving very quickly to The General Lee. But they have to agree with their actions and stop the destruction of their family farms with almost all the city with the unpleasant Jefferson Davis 'Boss' Hogg (Razzie named Burt Reynolds) to make the way to a big coal mine. They get help from their sexy cousin Daisy (Razzie called Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson), while being equivalent to Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (Lost's M.C. Gainey) and the police. In addition, Joe Don Baker Governor Jim Applewhite, Jack Polick's Deputy Cletus Hoggina, David Koechner Cooter Davenportina, Michael Weston Deputy Enos Strate and Lynda Carter as Pauline. I think the only reason I give the extra star of the movie is because of a couple of impressive car stops and, of course, Simpson's wonderful body (I admit that his legs aren't quite Catherine Bach, but still!) Besides, it's quite boring. It was set as the worst picture, Jay Chandrasekhari's worst director, worst remake or queue, the worst screen pair Simpson and his "Daisy Dukes" and worst-case scenario. Pretty bad!
