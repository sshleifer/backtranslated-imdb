Drew Barrymore plays young Holly Gooding, who is moving with ambitious hack script writer Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) and interrupts his life completely, claiming that his "doppelganger" or evil twin is killing him and his family. <br /> This silly fear movie is hard to take seriously, even if the filmmakers and the actors themselves seem to be dead seriously. "Doppelganger" is confusing, having an unpleasant stupid dialogue. <br /> <br /> Some viewers point out that Drew's name has been taken from Audrey Hepburn's role at Breakfast at Tiffany, and that the name of the Newberg character is the name of the famous author Patricia Highsmith (he is actually trying to write a "Breakfast" horror movie, believe it or not!). <br /> <br /> I think it deserves some credit for not being your typical horror movie - I think, writer / director Avi Nesher really looks after her characters and gives her film more plot than a regular fare . <br /> <br /> After a foolish fool-teller - everything - the audience's confrontation, the film will continue to have a terrible climax that must be seen as believing. This movie is definitely not worshiping. <br /> <br /> But hey! Drew kills his mother. No, I'm not kidding. Jaid Barrymore will only appear violently killed in the beginning. Drew is always very observable and very sexy. Newbern comes as a pleasant, "nice" sort of man. But the high point of the movie must be a scene with Sally Kellerman, an attractive veteran who is very professional in his single scene, like a former nun who has started sex on the phone (!!!!!!). <br /> <br /> The film is basically junk, but quite amusing, the varieties with little level of fun are quite fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
