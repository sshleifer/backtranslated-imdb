I am a great fan of Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard. And besides them, Charles Butterworth (a very enjoyable supporting actor) in this movie ... so why didn't I enjoy it? Well, despite the good pain, this is one of the poorest written and most clever "pictures" I've ever seen. Considering the talent and the money spent on making this film, it is shocking when the sliding letter was. I knew the film would be annoying when I prophesied myself from time to time at the beginning of the movie that exactly what would happen - and I was always right! And that is not because I am a "filmmaker", but that it was almost no imagination or effort. In fact, it seemed almost like the movie was just a long cliché that all died! I also found a little annoying that Fred treated Carol so badly and again in the film, that he had to run to him. Uggh! There is much more tension in Lassie's film ("does he bring people to rescue Timmy or does he rope hang?"). <br /> <br /> Despite the very tired and cliché script, there were some positive things about the movie. It was pretty cool to see Fred at the end of the movie see a broken lush - it was quite plausible and he saw that he wouldn't have eaten, shaved or slept during the day. Charles Butterworth's "prattle" also gave some humorous moments. But it wasn't all enough to make this movie different from "B-Movie". It's a shame ... it could have been so much better.
