This movie is all lightning and soul. The actors put a lot of passion into the figures, but these numbers were often not connected to the film and felt like independent music videos. And not trying to make numbers as if they had happened to you, everyone sounds like it comes from the studio, basically sucking the whole life of the songs. In the stage, the performances were all dull and unrealized, especially Hudson, who basically plays the same anger, "strong" (he is stubborn and selfish) a black woman we've seen before. His character had no depth or any other female. Although I think the film wants us to believe that the character of Hudson is in difficulty because of its difficulty, it is indeed his own refusal to do what is best for the team that manages him in trouble, making the end of the film completely meaningless. The Hudson Academy Award is a joke, there was no justification. When he sang, he made emotional emotions (though it was often misplaced, but it was the writer's / director's fault), but when he was just acting, he didn't do anything that was already written to improve the character. Eddie Murphy's character is the only one with an arc, and she did a good job, but not worth Oscar. The only actor who really brought something to the roll was Danny Glover, who took a small, relatively insignificant character and did something real about it. There's nothing about drowning teeth, drama or heart, or even laughing. The placement of musical numbers was so bad that the film sometimes seemed to be musical fun, not one; The number of Hudson discussing with other girls is so long as it would have been possible for a family member to skate. The film has no idea what it is, and I felt guilty in the last few minutes. It's a big, boring waste of time, and it's really the worst movie I saw in '06, and last year there was nothing to start with.
