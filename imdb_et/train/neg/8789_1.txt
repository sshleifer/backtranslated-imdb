I checked this on a DVD for one dollar so I could easily smile when this terrible movie emerged. every time you think it can't get worse, it's inevitable. The actor is absolutely terrible. The plot doesn't make any sense at all. The title "Cold Revenge" in the US DVD version has nothing to do with the script. Active scenes are so obviously made in their first key. There are many mistakes during the dialogues that show that there is no intention to take another to at least do this to make this movie. I don't remember having seen a worse movie and I get bad movies from time to time - well, except for the unstoppable Wesley Snipe. No, who I am joking, while bad, Unstoppable deserves the best prizes for the Oscar compared to that thin.
