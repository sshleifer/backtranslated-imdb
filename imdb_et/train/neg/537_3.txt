I went to see "Evening". That's why I went to look at "Norman's Space" - the movie that offers Diane Keaton, Leonardo De Caprio and Meryl Streep - and loved it every minute. The same goes for "laptop", though it was a chick. And my feeling was that everything that Vanessa Redgrave, Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson and Glenn Close had performed would be at least as good. Instead, I found that sometimes even the biggest actors can't overcome the trickery, the simplification, and - once - the truly offensive material. <br /> <br /> Now I had no problem with the movie's structure. I really enjoy movies that drag back and forth over time ... as long as one era illuminates another and vise. But even though Vanessa is a character in her dead chamber and recalling the past event, she was a "mistake", sometimes swallowing a part that actually shows what this "past mistake" does nothing to explain. In fact, in a more striking "girlfriend, boyfriend, girlfriend, loses boy" way, it makes a pointless and unbelievable cliché in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> And here are spoilers, so keep this in mind when you continue reading. <br /> <br /> First, Claire Danes was brutally unsuccessful. Not only does Vanessa Redgrave look like a younger woman like her. Don't do it wrong, he may be in the right role - just not. And Patrick Wilson was unsuccessful, though he has almost pulled out the acting pieces. He would have been more suitable for the part played by Hugh Dancy - the rich confusing WASP - and not the object of sexual attraction for one and all; he's too WASP-y for that. Hugh Dancy? One note: "I'm tortured drunk and wait until you know why." And "why" (I'm a chapel in a sexually repressed world so I have to drink too much and make myself stupid for everyone I know) was so offensive to me and the way he died (as you knew he was because it is the only thing that can happen to jokes in the fifties) is so ridiculous, false, and misused, I almost threw my candy on the screen. <br /> <br /> As for the modern part of Toni Collette and his sister, his fear of dedication, his jealousy of the "perfect life" of his sister, his sister wondered whether he had made the right choices, his pregnancy, and his too perfect boy - A friend (which could actually have been more interesting) and meaningful when Patrick Wilson and Ebon Moss-Bachrach were playing could be more interesting in Harris considering his dreamy eyes - all in the 70s and 80s. And much deeper. Do we really have to resubmit it and all the way it would be fresh and meaningful? <br /> <br /> Up, Meryl Streep doesn't even appear in the last ten minutes of the movie, all the old lady's makeup that hides many of her facial expressions. She's still good, but only because she is Meryl, and Meryl can find a way to pull even the most smooth dialogue under the most difficult makeup. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this film has all the clichés "a really meaningful message" in the movie book, and it adds some that really were not business trotted. Two hours of successful "Lifetime Movie-of-the-week" music that is guaranteed to be rubbed off is a complete failure of both "meaningful" and "movie" aspects. I'll give it "3" only because of Meryl and Vanessa. <br /> <br /> Now, with everything you need from your movies, it's twadd down, please set my comments aside for "evening" and let me have time for life. But if you want a truly meaningful experience from great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with the simple story of life and death, and all the nonsense it brings, rent a "Norman Room" and find out what a great deal of action is.
