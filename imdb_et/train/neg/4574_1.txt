I went to this movie, assuming it was similar to Matrix or Pi. Boy, I was wrong. Yes, the film has a poorly written, poorly-functioning graph (with CG-animated cells and peptides to trigger them). But the real focus of the film is on "expert" voices that lead to a new era of hour-head hogwash. At first, there is a bit of real quantum physics. For example, it is said that electrons exist in the form of particles as well as wave, and that the atom is usually an empty space. But the film has a gigantic (and unscientific) leap, saying that also the atomic quantum effects of the atom also occur on large scale. Talking heads take it even further. According to them, the following are: <br /> <br /> - When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the natives could not see their ships because their minds could not perceive anything so differently. -Meditation can reduce the rate of murder. - With a positive idea you can walk with water. - Your thoughts may change the formation of ice crystals in water bottles. <br /> <br /> Hey, it's just the first 40 minutes. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie was torture. This movie seemed like a movie they would show you to join the cult. After doing my homework, I realized that this is basically just that. > Save time and money: don't see this movie.
