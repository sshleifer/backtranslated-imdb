I left this movie in the cinema, but I had the idea behind my head that it was worth the picture, so when I saw it on the shelves of DVDs, I thought it was time to watch it. Big mistake! <br /> <br /> The long list of stars can't save this turkey, certainly one of the worst movies. The incomprehensible plot is poorly communicated and poorly presented. Perhaps it would have made more sense for me to read Robbins novel, but if the film is not completely different from the novel and if Robbins, who helps the script, doubts, the novel should also be a scary reading. br /> <br /> I hope the actors were well paid because they saw that they were in such a celluloid and recently in a DVD disc, like Pat Morita. It's even time for Thurman to look at it from time to time uncomfortably. <br /> <br /> Save yourself for about 98 minutes to make something more valuable, such as fork-nail trimming or sock drawer sorting. Even if you see it in the local shop "below $ 5", please answer!
