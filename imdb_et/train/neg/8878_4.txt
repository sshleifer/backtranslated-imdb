Judy Holliday hit gold in 1950 with George Cukor's "Born Yesterday", and since then, his career has been trying to find enough material to allow him to capture gold again. <br /> <br /> Never happened. In "This should happen to you" (I can't think of the blender's title by the way), Holliday makes another variation for the foolish blonde who may not be so stupid, but everything about this movie looks warm and cordial. Even Jack Lemmon, which, in my opinion, was his first film role, cannot collect enough energy to revive this recycled comedy. The audience knows how the movie ends from the very beginning, so in most cases it's just waiting for the movie to catch up. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you are in love with Holliday, you'll enjoy it; otherwise I will not worry. <br /> <br /> Rating: C
