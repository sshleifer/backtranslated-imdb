This confusing confusion could have made Bosagh's career a Shakespeare adapter for the cinema. (Released 4 years ago, not from adaptation.) I stopped watching this cable - holy God, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> I agree with the opinion of the evaluator below who said that looking at something so obviously and unfortunately terrible is an unrenerous act that comes up as fine. That means I take the risk, if only because * The lost job of love * is the perfect reward for those who have overestimated Branagh's past leadership. Branagh has always been a pretty sad director: polished literally; starred; ungenerously ungenerous to his colleagues (he loves his American letters but loves himself more, making the damn sure he gets all the good lines). <br /> <br /> Besides these lines, it is a sad fact that * The Work of Love Missing * is hardly worse than the hostile, terrible, bloated * Hamlet * since 1996. In fact, this film may be preferred, if only because it is about 1/3 of the length. Branagh decided it would be a good idea to refresh Shakespeare's bad early work with Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, yada yada. So he put it in 1939, leaving some eighth text intact for the thirteen interpretations of the thirty standards (wait until you see how "I am in heaven" toward the impact area), and puts actors who are not known for their dancing or singing (including included). The result is a so surreal disaster that one is stupid to simply not call a terrible stop for the whole thing after viewing the first diaries. I'm not even blaming the lie. Paraphrasing Hamlet: "The scenario is a thing!" There is no good thing to do in this hodge-podge: the beautiful price of RSC alumni is not better than Alicia Silverstone. Who could do this thing? <br /> <br /> Branagh's first mistake was to think that * the lost work of love * was a movie worth filming. Believe me, it's not. This is the anomaly of Bard's canon, which is explicitly written for educated coters - not the usual audience for which he wrote. So there is a lot of valuable (and TEDIOUS!) Word-game, references to modern scientific meaning, to Lyli * Euphues *. . . in other words, hardly any material to turn to a wider audience. Hell, it doesn't like the audience that has already tended to Shakespeare's comedy. The game cannot be staged without a sharp cut and desperately "updating" any trick. What raises the question, why bother? <br /> <br /> Branagh's second mistake was to think that Shakespeare's crust can be played with Gershwin's marmalade by-arrangement. It is clear that the idea or hope was incomprehensible for the contemporary audience to carry out the Elizabeth exercise while managing the nostalgic American pop culture. But again, this raises the question why? <br /> <br />
