I am a big comic book fan, but this movie fell below my expectations. I expected Heavy Metal 2000 to be sure ..... slow movement, bad dialogue, a lot of blood ..... but it was worse than I could have imagined. <br /> <br /> The plot line is almost the same as the comic, but good points stop there almost. The characters have no energy or spirit that drew attention to the comic. The film only covers a small part of the comic and the used part is slower and boring than later. The focus of the film is on the most important events instead of the more interesting general plot of the comic book. <br /> <br /> The right people involved in this project could have been amazing. Unfortunately, this was not the case, so now there is another terrible movie that few see and even less love. My copy collects dust for years until I finally get out of it.
