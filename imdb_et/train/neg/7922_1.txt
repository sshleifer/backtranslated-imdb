The distant galaxy has a planet called Ceta. It's natives worship cats. However, dogs are fighting against those loving cats and have no choice but to go to Earth and grind people for food. This is one of the stupides f # @ k! Ng about the ideas I've seen. Leave it to Ted Mikels to make the film more incompetent than what he did in previous films. It's like he enjoys playing in Limbo cellulite game. How low can he go? The only loser in the scenario is the US viewer. Mr. Mikels and his stupid little handlebars must have people who buy this pill. <br /> <br /> My Class: F <br /> <br /> DVD Additions: Ted Mikel Comment; story (9 and a half minutes); 17 minutes, 15 seconds behind the scenes; Ted Mikels filmography; and trailers "Worm Eaters" "Girl in Gold Boots", "Doll Squad", "Ten Violent Women" (featuring nudity), "Blood Orgy of the Devils" and "Corpse Grinders"
