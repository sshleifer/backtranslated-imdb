Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) has decided that he is not lonely at Christmas. Not only is Drew a millionaire; but also disgusting and guilty in great magnitude. Drew goes back home where he grew up and offers a living family, Valcot, for $ 250,000 to be his "family" at Christmas. Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) is reluctant, but is greedy to take Drew's offer. Christine Valco (Catherine O'Hara) has little to say about this, but she is learning like Drew ... not exactly the same lesson with her daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate), but she also has room for change. Drew's Missy (Jennifer Morrison) follows Drew and wants her people to meet her family. Genuine fun is in stock because lucky Noel becomes a fun dysfunctional horror. Other cast members: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Faracy. Affleck is comic, though weird.
