After 30 seconds you already realize that there was no real budget for this cheap attack. The story is taken from big movies like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Hills have Eyes". I like these movies even when they are well copied (wrong turn, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /> <br /> But the "Side Sho" is hard to watch: the actors are really bad, the dialogue is cheesy and the music is stupid and completely misplaced. You don't care at all about the characters that happen. The so-called bad guys are not at all interesting and rather stereotypical. So, how's blood and gore? Well, there are some, though it is quite cheap and it is very bad. 2 points, only gore and blood, but don't realize it's hardly worth even gore-hounds.
