As a former Kalamazoo resident who loved the city, I had seen this film. But what a disappointment! Although functional and product values ​​are not bad, the script is terrible, the plot is unrealistic and the topic is disturbing. <br /> <br /> The main message of this movie is that women are not without spouses. children. I can't believe how regressive it is for women. Has the writer lived under a stone? <br /> <br /> Although I liked to see my beloved city on the big screen, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It's terrible. It is embarrassing for the city that is called.
