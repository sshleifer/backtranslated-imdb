In the first, it was mostly giant rats, but also some wasps and a giant chicken. However, this is only a giant period of rats, well giant rats and one really growing little boy. It is this growing boy and scientist who is trying to help him to accidentally create giant killer rats ... you know how it is. This movie has some killings and moments, but I think it's the same as the original. Well, this is not true ... I like like Antssi of Ants, maybe I just don't care about giant rodents. All in all, quite strange events are a rather strange event that is really odd. I just can't recommend it.
