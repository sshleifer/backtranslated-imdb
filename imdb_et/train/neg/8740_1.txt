My friends and we rent this movie last night and we had one of the biggest smiles for a while. The film is not funny at all, but it is just so ridiculous and it lacks any realism. First, Phillippe (I forget what his character is called and I really don't care) uses his usual employee ID to go through all the top security terminals. Not only this pathetic, but also when his tremendous efforts culminate in finding such a scary Lego room with supercomputers. It's just funny. The exterior-looking room completely undermines the intense mood we should experience. The end, like everyone else, is very very cheesy, especially when a bad guy from a lawyer appears on time. Anyway, this movie is laughing. If you need to have fun, be sure to see it.
