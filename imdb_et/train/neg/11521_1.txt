This movie is really one of the worst waste. It is really surprising that something so terrible could be done. But if you can control the spiritual drawing, the evolution of character and the direction, you can get an extract from the soundtrack that is so terrible that it is funny. The film begins with a terrible and fast change. Someone should give all the people involved in this film some comfort, because their career was probably destroyed by the inclusion of this film. If you see this movie or have already seen it (I feel your pain), then these words are too late. For someone else, stay away from all the costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it wastes 2 hours of your life. Then you can at least watch or watch something while watching it.
