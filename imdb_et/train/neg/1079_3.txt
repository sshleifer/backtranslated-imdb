I feel like I'm the only child in the city that Branagh's power is annoying. He has most of the accounts as a beautiful actor, but he just couldn't pull the southern accent. I mean, it was unfortunate. It would have been like trying to be too hard for Yank. One of the previous reviewers questioned why there are no US films in this movie. I'll bring this concept. It's wonderful when actors / actors want to expand their horizons, but it's another thing to try too hard to make the performance tense. Maybe it was Altman, but he's such a big director ... <br /> <br /> Well, I don't want too much of Branagh's absolutely outrageous accent. Everyone deserves it here and there. But it is hard to see anything so annoying that you prefer chicken bone or eat a bucket full of buckets when you sit through a gingerbread man.
