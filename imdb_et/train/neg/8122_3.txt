Painful to look at and not entirely with the struggle of characters with empathy. Two of the main characters, Cynthia, Mother and Monica, a recognized daughter, spend most of the movie pathetically bitter and bitter. Their characters are so confident that their salvation as a permissible personality after a quick family catharsis is incredible. Weren't expecting it. I wish families to be worthy of sight.
