This TV movie tells the story that Frannie suddenly returns to Silk Hope to visit friends and family, but is not aware of her mother's death. His sister runs in a family house but plans to sell it and leave with her new husband. Frannie is firmly opposed to the idea and promises to keep the family's heritage as it was, by creating jobs and maintaining responsibility. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Ruben and two will soon fall in love (as you do), and it is from the moment I lost interest .... <br /> <br /> Farrah Fawcett has more than just blonde hair and looks like she can imagine her character extremely convincingly when she thinks about it - and it's definitely proven here as well as some of her earlier efforts like extreme and small victims - a great force from the legendary Charlie angel. <br /> <br /> Silk Hope is a movie that never disappears from its cheap and joyful TV image, and you know there was a limit in the budget, but it is never the worst movie. Positive aspects exist; you just have to find them.
