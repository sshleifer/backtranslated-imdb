This movie is just one of the worst I've ever seen. And I don't understand it well. We wanted to see a dirty horror / thriller so we chose what seemed to be the most widespread in the shop. Once upon a time, the film was all we were expecting. And more! (or should I say less?) <br /> <br /> Participants look like they read their rows of posters behind the cameras. The so-called special effects are created in front of the camera with red diameter plastic to give the impression that we are seeing the killer in the eyes of the rats. And the script? Don't even start a script for me ... And just when you thought that it didn't get worse, it turns out that the first part of the movie was the end of the Oscar. <br /> <br /> Take it from me, this movie is fun when you're out of dirty horror movies, but if you want a good movie, look on. It's not for you.
