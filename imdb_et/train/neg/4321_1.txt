It was the WORST Christmas movie I ever saw. I took my two little kids to see it. It was a darker, most unpleasant plot - the family has no money, the mother loses her job, the father kills in the bank, the bank robber steals at the back of both children and after a quick chase of the family, drives off the bridge and drowns them in the river. Mother stayed alone. No wonder his Christmas has gone. Christmas rings will not save the sunken children and Santa will not bring the dead! I thought it was a WORST message to send children. It is better to tell them NOT to be Santa if they show them a movie!
