I'm not sure who writes these films <br /> <br /> but I believe this is STOCK. I've seen hundreds of horror films and slasher cinemas and that's LAME, it's only about 80 minutes long and believe me that I can do it. The plot is terrible, action is even worse. And there is no development. <br /> <br /> Even David Cocteau's movies are better. RIGHT FROM JIGSAW. I was looking forward to hating an actor who can be forgiven for video movies if the plot is good. <br /> <br /> It wasn't scary, very small Gore, <br /> <br /> and really unpleasant to cast. <br /> <br /> I watched it with three more friends with whom I hope I'll still talk to me! <br /> <br /> They wanted me out of the window. I can't believe anyone could have reviewed this failure properly.
