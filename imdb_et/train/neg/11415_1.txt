Well, AWFUL is just a first name. This movie is spam with clichés. High school comedy in a military training camp. I'm sorry I had to give this 1 star he didn't deserve. <br /> <br /> It can include spoilers: <br /> <br /> Almost everyone is completely forced, convincing and unrealistic. HEPO (Military Police) will not come to you if you do not make your appearance, especially not on your wedding day. The actors were quite embarrassing during this scene because the scene didn't work so unlikely. You can feel it with your voice. Even if they weren't such bad actors, they would not have been able to record the scene. Next, the guy has to wear a suit at his wedding. No, there was no time to get him first. Man, it's great cinematography! I remember this scene for the rest of my life. <br /> <br /> The camp also has GIRLS - an exciting one - even a model, although it's not as big - and the worst actor I've ever seen. I doubt in Hollywood that they would allow him to say one line in B-film. <br /> <br /> Okay girls in the army! It's fun now. Girls are even placed on the same floor, so we can sneak into the room at night! In reality, they are placed in a building next to the second quarter, which is separated by a two-wire wire. <br /> <br /> There are tanks available that can be used for leisure time, of which we have a lot. No, tanks are not locked and ignition keys are inserted. No one notices the engine, especially not at night. <br /> <br /> There are sexy scenes and pointers and everything is below the waste lines. We need them so that sexually obsessed Germans also like the movie. Switzerland is too small a feature film market. Well done! <br /> <br /> One sex scene takes place in the kitchen. Certainly none of these facilities have ever been locked. Military routines are as slim as they can. <br /> <br /> At the end of an endless flick, mafia has hit men with revenge against this poor boy who is trying to shoot him! Because he gave up his fiancé! Of course I buy it, the Italians are so - jealous of the bunch (not). The bad guys are trying to do this in open daylight with two dozen witnesses. Not at night in the dark alley. Again, military training locations (where live ammunition is photographed) are open to the public, everyone can travel freely or walk there. There are no such things as guards or gardens. <br /> <br /> But the good captain stops the action by launching the missile into the Italian car in time. The explosion strikes the hit men and the fury of the frantic fiancé. No distance of 40 meters is hurt if the car is blown to the forges. That's COMEDY, remember. <br /> <br /> Okay, okay? It's comedy, I got it and I can live with it. There is no need for reality. Filmmakers can easily get on the road if it is fun, funny or fun, interesting, difficult. Unfortunately, none of them are. It's just embarrassing. Unexploded American Comedies. The latter are at least professional, without amateur actors. <br /> <br /> It's quite boring and unpredictable, a waste of time and energy, especially for those who sit through the movie, as I unfortunately did. Yawn.
