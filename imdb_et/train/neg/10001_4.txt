There was nothing in this film that I couldn't put on my finger first: the charisma of the leading actor. This inevitably meant the absence of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading person. Even romantic scenes came together only as players. It would have been great if the director had guessed what the participants needed. I just don't know. <br /> <br /> But would it have been a scenario? Just exactly who was the cook in love? He seemed to have his culinary skills and his restaurant and ultimately more than himself or anything else about himself and his youthful exploitation. He's never convinced me he was in love with the princess. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed in this movie. But do not forget that it was for the Oscar, so the judge himself.
