I'm terrible how bad this movie is. At the beginning of the 20th century, Hollywood artists postulate it as a new lower - even to the past The Moderns or (gas) Cradle Will Rock - and I never thought I could see the film inferior. period. However, the intentions and results were amazingly similar. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is a terrible casting: Eddie Izzard as CHAPLIN? Excuse me? Peter, do you owe this man? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies ??? Holy smoke, these people do not even try to capture the appearance or sound of the period they supposedly represent. <br /> <br /> Well, the last picture show was a decent film, but it's a disaster. And the rest of Bogdonovitch's pictures aren't much better. Guessing rubbing against Welles & Hitch and Ford was a long time ago. However, it is good to receive TCM.
