KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963, which I remember when evaluating BOMB) was my introduction to the work of the cultural figure Honda; is it not necessarily better? It's just that I've learned to be more tolerant of such an internally low timetable! <br /> <br /> Here we actually have two blocks for one price: a ugly and thin-looking giant monkey and its robot change that seems even worse! The Simian creature lives on Mondo (!)? showing a fight against a couple of other monsters and people with friends. Of course it falls for the blonde (and gentle) heroine; is actually more intriguing in the femme fatale cahoots with the movie evil crazy genius? named Dr. Who and the sport anemic look and cabinet, usually associated with a vampire! North Pole; Apparently, a giant monkey is more impervious to radiation than its mechanical counterpart (and to ensure its full co-operation, even striking its three associates)! Then the female agent has a change of heart, helps heroes (one of whom is usually an unclear American) and who kills. Kong finally flees to Tokyo, where he has a final showdown with a robot. Does the doctor escape the resulting chaos underneath? which has gathered a giant monkey at the request of a Kong dreamer.
