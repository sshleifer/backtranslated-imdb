Scotty (Grant Cramer, who goes to the star B movie "Killer Klowns from Space") agrees to help three middle-aged men learn how "bad" 80s comedy women like. Not bad as in the 80's lingo, which meant good. Bad as bad. Without pleasant signs, including, but not limited to, a child who is looking for a freakiest man, because "Friday 13th part 2" is a girl who drives men and then goes to the elevator if she wants to touch her and a symbol of fat slipping because after that , what would be the 80's sex comedy without fat slip? Well, it has two. This movie is pretty much in the 80's sex comedy barrel. And then came the sequel that deepened the jargon of jargon. <br /> <br /> My Class: D- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Too Much To Count, You Can Even See A Nice Top View With Breasts Think "Bachlor Party" But Not That Funny and very disturbing. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Comcast Moviepass
