This is the worst movie I've ever seen. This film matches the quality of films such as "THEY" and "Cabin Fever", but even they had name links where it failed. The "eye candy" of this film was seen by 50 women with a bad face. (high quality example only). I would have evaluated this film, if possible, negatively. Ladies and gentlemen, I have to tell you that men were not bad, but also many. If you are planning to see this movie, I would strongly recommend saving money.
