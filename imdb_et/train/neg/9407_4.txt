"Houseboat Horror" is often considered to be the worst Australian film ever made and described as a typical film that wore a promotion "Watch a movie that doesn't receive the Academy Award." Death from a burned maniac because they are trying to shoot a distant video of a distant lake in the back of Australia. the cucumbers are cut and the woman is killed by a horseshoe. If you like the hair color films, you can try it, but you have been warned. At least that's better than the Swedish "The Bleeder".
