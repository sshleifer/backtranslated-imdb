I don't know who, how, and more importantly, why the decision to invite Richard Attenborough to lead the only feeling to capture Broadway for many years? He is the Academy's award-winning director. Yeah, he won Ghandi for the one you moor! Jeremy Irons is the Academy winner you want to play with Rocky Balboa? Has musical experience. Really? "Oh what a lovely war" have you forgotten? Yes to answer the question! The film is disappointing, clear and simple. The procedure of a heavy handle did not survive an ounce of living energy. Every character danced beautifully, they were charming, but their projection was theatrical. I didn't know anything. But when I saw it on stage, I felt everything. The film should have been cast with letters, unknown, newcomers, but the stars with memorable unforgettable are faced with even the most invisible group. Great actors who could dance beautifully. Well Michael Douglas was in it. True, I forgot that I'm completely wrong and you are absolutely right. Nothing is Richard Attenborough Michael Douglas.
