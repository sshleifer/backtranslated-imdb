OK, forget all the technical contradictions or the physical impossibility of a space shuttle discovered by an unhappy robot with a golden heart. Forget the nervous special effects and poorly designed one-dimensional characters. Just look at the story's premise. The primary reason for the film is that you see how badly this film was put together. <br /> <br /> I know 9-year-olds looking at this intelligence and just laughing at it. The story is terrible. Action is comic and the message he is trying to show is incomprehensible. And worse, the fact is that Cable Film Channels KEEP SHOWING IT! It's twice a day every two or three days! Why does somebody who thinks they want people to see this painful piece of cellulose several times, less to see it at all? <br /> <br /> My suggestion is not even a hassle of energy to watch it. He's just not worth it.
