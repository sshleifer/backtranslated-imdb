As far as B-films go, SCARECROW is one of those that is so bad that it's incredibly annoying to sit. A lonely loser high school student, whom classmates are constantly choosing, and girls reject, comes to the trailer drum for a mother who has sex with a drunken red neck. Then he pursues the boy out of the nearby cornfield and kills him. Apparently, the child's soul was carried to the scarecrow, which then destroys the tempters who tormented him, as well as the teachers. This scarecrow, in addition to having one gentle lining for each victim, can also provide matrix-like reflections through the air and kill the broad daylight on sidewalks. Also, why did he always see a rotten body? Just like these two sudden sequences that follow, it's not even worth laughing.
