The banned siren is based on the Siren 2 Playstation 2 (so many 2s) game. As most video games turned, I would say that most do not change the other environment very well. And this also applies, painfully. <br /> <br /> There's a pretty long prologue that explains and determines the story's premise and the mysterious island where the writer (Leo Morimoto) and his children, daughter Yuki (Yui Ichikawa) and son Hideo (June Nishiyama) come in. The villagers do not seem too friendly and will soon give reliable advice on the island's siren, stay indoors when the siren starts to burst. And our siblings are going around the tug to discover exactly what this unfriendly island is going to happen to this strange inhabitant. But really, you don't worry about what's going on because folklore and fairy tales are being thrown to put the plot even more together. What really distracted the comedy was his inadvertently-out-of-the-ordinary moments that simply pulled the merciless gaze out with his empty stupidity until it was explained much later. This is one thing that tries to do something smart but to hit another thing convincingly and insecure. <br /> <br /> Despite being less than 90 minutes in length, I think it's a horror movie. Runtime Benchmark - This gives you almost two hours of slow feeling to say what it wants. Things start to pick up in the last 20 minutes, but it's a classic case that is too little too late. <br /> <br /> The thing that records the movie is how it changes to the end and its appearance at the end. Again, this is an ordinary device used to lift a seemingly simple horror film somewhat extra in the hope of the audience. It turned out to be quite satisfactory, but it leaves a bad aftertaste because you feel somewhat cheated. There are two ways to twist you to feel - it will bring the movie to a memorable level or give you a feeling. Unfortunately, Forbidden Siren belonged more to the latter. to avoid it.
