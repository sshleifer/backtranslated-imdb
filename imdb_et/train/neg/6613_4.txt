Iam a big Mr Ram Gopal Varma fan, but I couldn't believe he did this movie. I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag doesn't come close to real Sholay. It doesn't leave the viewer with a lasting impression. Ram Gopal Varma is unable to create chemistry between the characters. There is no divorce between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant raj). There is hardly a frame with more than two people. The outside order of the outside courtyard of Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal is remarkable. Amitabh Bachchan shouldn't have made this movie. Ajay and Sushmita tried their best, but not of any use. Rajpal Yadavi's voice modulation - ineffective and pointless. Mohanlal made full justice and proved it again to be a face and body language. The remaining majority was below expectations. In this film, the original sholay adapted comedy. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma could have worked on the script, but because of the contradictions surrounding his confused and just interesting movie He did it Aaga. But there is no fire.
