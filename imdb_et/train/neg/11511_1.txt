I had the (wrong) happiness to see this movie in the USA for shows. Responding reluctantly to all the grief, I am shocked to see so many good comments on IMDB. <br /> <br /> The original film was turkey but interesting. It was installed in the early seventies after the 1969 revolution. this movie stinks just ......., well, nothing. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> Imagine a bad perfume irritation - see what I mean? She looks worse and worse for every year, which is more and more like a skinned blade. low, poorly cut, fashion shows. Here too, he is not disappointed; he wisely led his wife to this attack. They are probably quite business enterprises. <br /> <br /> Don't encourage Ritchie to humiliate her by giving her money. <br /> <br />
