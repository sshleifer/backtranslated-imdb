As an engineer, I have to say that the first season of the exhibition started very promising. Most of the applied mathematics was somewhat plausible and the relationship between the Eppes brothers and the father gave the exhibition an interesting side. <br /> <br /> But after the first season, the play began to humiliate, heavily. Most of the mathematics and technologies used to solve crimes are now completely dirty and very ridiculous for all science and technology people. <br /> <br /> Involvement of participants still feels good and I can imagine a fair amount of money for producing every episode, but it has finally deteriorated to a very unpleasant delicious dish, a blend of C class action drill and CSI style police show. <br /> <br /> You look at it, just go to the first season and maybe another part. Then I don't waste my time. I myself, I gave the exhibition in the middle of the 3rd season. <br /> <br /> Season 1 - 8 Stars Season 2 - 5 Stars Season 3 - 3 Stars <br /> <br /> Let's say up to 4 stars. Since Charlie no longer knows his math, I am not worried about my righteousness either.
