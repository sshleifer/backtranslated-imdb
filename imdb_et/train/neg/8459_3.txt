Some very interesting camera work and lots of potential story. But it will never come together as a student at a film school. <br /> <br /> There are two main reasons for this. Fist, there's no pleasant character, not even a scraper we could admire for our chutzpah. Second, all the actors are terrible - even veteran Willem DaFoe. The ham is so big, here you feel like a picnic, but one of those unpleasant company picnics where you can drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking. Then you eat the underdog hotdog and throw it up. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'm a little tough young director who can still go - as I said, the camera's work is pretty good. br /> <br /> But I feel cheated - the bursting of this movie suggests that we can look at the "modern west" and the DVD packaging also has pictures that show it - but no one really is involved in making the film seem to know that this is a movie they should do. <br /> <br /> This betrayal is painful; but even without it, it is true that we do not like those characters, we feel embarrassed for the actors, the story is hopelessly confusing, and in the last analysis we just don't care. <br /> <br /> I took it out of the DVD player about half way. but the rental store doesn't give me my money back. <br /> <br /> It's really painful.
