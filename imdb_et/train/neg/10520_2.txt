Angels who got a bit icky were banned from heaven and now live in the British woods where they seduce and chop teenagers. Talk about a high concept. On the plus side, this little mother gives us Tom Savin, but as her range of action is limited to two minutes of screen time, her five-minute presence seems rather long. Angels drive most of the nude in the forest, but even though they may have an angelic body, their faces will definitely see a bad day for Joan Rivers. Medieval actors and amateur gorefolds don't help and night scenes resemble deadly Parisian most famous movies. So bad it is really bad.
