I promised a long time ago that you NEVER look at a movie with ANYONE, who once was the regular cast member of Saturday Night Live. I didn't rent "Corky Romanot", but because of my compulsion, I had to watch it for half an hour. Then my good behavior failed. Stupid, not funny. Annoying, not fun. Bad, not good. This is, in short, what I can say about this video.
