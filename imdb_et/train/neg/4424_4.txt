Uh oh! Another gay movie. This time it's black. Contribute to your last dollar that you have an unfortunate ending! But why? In less than half a dozen exceptions, all gay movies have to end with death or "addio" finals. It's like all European film Noir in the 40's, 50's, 60's and 70's. Lead ... male or female must be forgotten alone. Why do God, in the name of God, need writers, directors, and producers to listen to depression from the theater? After all, it should be gay ... not ugly. Maybe the category should become a "glum" movie. A lot of gay relationships DO last and couples ride with sunset! No matter who writes or produces, he only shows gay life and gives a false impression of a gay lifestyle. This movie just proves my point. When you rent a DVD, take the antidepressant because there's another "gay" movie here! It is wrong!
