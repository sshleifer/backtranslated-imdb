I have to agree with most of all that this exhibition was badly produced and written. Operation was not much lower than lower production values, but I feel that the actor can only rely on the material given to them and do it best. Based on this idea, it is important to note that one actor has risen and has remained on the side of this campaign's tasteless production, which has become a respectable and fairly talented performer. I refer to Laura Harris, a Canadian born actress who has etched her way through many ill-produced exhibitions. and movies to find a place in the HBO hit "Dead Like Me" where he plays the role of Daisy Adair and his credit deals with this role effectively. I remember having a typical fracture for a young actor in this series, where he played Ashley's softly spoken but intelligent 7th grade. I felt that if someone could "do" this series, it would definitely be Laura Harris and his nature, that he looked at the field to win the respect of many manufacturers who know him for his talent as well as for the unique Nordic blonde allure. If you ever have the opportunity to watch this series, I suggest you see something epic to look at churches like "The Godfather" or "The Beaches" to remind you that there is a lot of true manufacturing integrity and value there and that this series is just a little a budget reminder of what Laura Harris just says about her time in the show, and I bet she cites many young actors, saying, "This is the beginning!"
