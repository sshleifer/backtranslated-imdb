This is the reason why many people remain homeless. . . because stupid manufacturers are paying their money to make such horrible movies to donate if they can't! <br /> <br /> This movie is even worse than white chicks! A small man has a flat apology to portray baby characters. The story is terrible because it has been written by six people. However, the idea would not be too bad if it were an original and not a cartoon episode. it has funny moments, but some of them are too much and some are just fools. Operation was very bad. So was management. Anyone involved in this movie should be ashamed. it is racist and very offensive to the middle. I mean, they are being shown to be entertained by filmmakers! It's really nasty how they do it. They see medievals like children. And for the character who is the dwarf, pretending to be an abandoned child to get a certain family diamond. It's his flat excuse to show something like that. It just wasn't worth it. Don't look at this movie. This is a great waste of time and money.
