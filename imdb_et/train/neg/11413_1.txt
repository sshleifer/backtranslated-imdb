Seriously - Avoid this movie at any price. I just saw it in my first "sneak preview" and even though I paid for the irretrievable money, I went to the cinema only after 15 minutes. With 2 minutes of discussion between my friends, whether to leave or not. For the first time, EVER went out of the movie. And I lived through some pretty bad ones. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that are dubbed (and badly) even though it is shown in the original language. It is based on the oldest, simplest and cheapest jokes in the book. About the military ("What do we do when we reach the battlefield?" - "You get out of the car and die", it is actually a lot of fun to read about the way it was made in the movie, about drugs (man eats some "space cookies", behaves truly foolish and leaves his wedding or must live through how high - all badly written and acted), the army for women ("why do we get only trumpets? guns!" - "this is, it is as it is") ... Argh. Okay, you can find them really funny, but in that case, you're serious about me. <br /> <br /> In addition, I've seen better action in the soft porn movies you receive in late Europe. So it was flat fun (delivered poorly), beyond the lower average acting, lacking pace, was poorly duplicated and edited? It just doesn't work. At least not at any level that the movies are used to, I would be so brave to say that this flick proves that there are people who may be much less funny Germans. And it says something if you like stereotypes. (What I'm not doing is still nice to play with them. If someone thinks I'm not a computer enough.) <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this movie, do something useful. Try to teach crochet shrimp, paint your toenails in a really irritating color, dismantle a bike, change a light bulb, try to understand Einstein's theories, convert to another religion and back - actually go and listen to "Last Christmas" by Wham! endlessly repeat. Something, but don't look at this terrible flick.
