Just a good old fool. I really mean stupid, not a good fool like Killer Tomatoes, or Ed Wood movies, this is probably the most stupid movie I've ever seen. To give this movie a golden turkey is an insult to turkeys. Even the foolish people are silly to call this movie. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of American cinema and art, we are better off to really start World War III and World War II and let the cockroaches launch after the show. <br /> <br /> Now I have to get drunk to wash this insult to one of your braincell ... <br /> <br /> It's really a good movie if you're suicidal.
