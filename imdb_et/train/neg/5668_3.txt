First of all - there is no flirting in this movie - Anthony or anyone else. These people don't flirt - they just do it. Your first endurance attempt is to go through more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion. It would not be so bad - hell, I like violence and perversion as much as the next reviewer, but without this context it is repulsive. So you're doing this torture and chaos. Then we meet with Donn and the film becomes something else - not better - just different: the road without heart. Comedy experiments have been done thanks to the fires - widely written and widely played by wide ranges like Judy Tenuta and Mink Stole (and some whores and dragons queens). They all deserve better. Photography is deliberately inconsistent, so if you get a movement disorder (or really a disease) - this flick isn't for you. Come to think, I'm not sure who it is, if it is - except maybe gay and bi-sexual S&M fans who like badly written, poorly filmed videos themselves.
