Wow. I went to a video shop tonight because I was bad for B Horror's movie and I found this Gem. I looked at the cover and I thought it looked like my mood. I brought it home and put it in. <br /> <br /> This movie wasn't a B Horror movie I had to keep in mind. It was much worse. I wanted a bad movie, but what I got, I didn't know was such a mess as a man was. This movie seemed to be 5 years old, wrote and directed it, and that's nice. <br /> <br /> I am an ambitious director and this movie made me so mad that someone is actually paying for this guy direct movies. He must work in the rubbish bin to which he belongs. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of renting it or buying it. I'll tell you the same thing I would say someone is ready to commit suicide. "DON'T KNOW! I really have nothing to say about this movie. DO NOT KNOW!
