This show seemed good. Kyra Sedgwick is an OK actor and I like the police series, but somewhere in the production this program was wrong. First of all, writers should have more suspects than one, you know who did it every time !!!!! It makes it boring. The protagonist is incredibly annoying and in no way plausible. I know they wanted him to be tough, but that means stupid and bad driver. Crimes are uninteresting and wonderful and just flat all the way. As stated above, I hate it .... <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a big disappointment and a very bad thing ...
