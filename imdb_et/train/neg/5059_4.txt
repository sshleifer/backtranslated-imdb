If you want to see a movie about two completely atypical characters, this is one. The actors are great, both in John Cassavets and the crazy paranoid who, as they say, are really getting, and Peter Falk as his best lifelong friend to whom he turns to rescue. A big mistake, but because they are both immoral mobiles and misognistic bastards, it's hard to decide who to root the LESS. Only writer / director Elaine May could have got it. I thought it was interesting that in a long interview with the producer Michael Hausman on the DVD, he stated that both of the letters had a "very different idea" of the script, that the director was almost impossible to work with, that the director of the photographer had his impossible demands for the team was constantly angry while sitting and so on. This mood of a large OPTIONAL Dysfunctional family clearly appears on the screen.
