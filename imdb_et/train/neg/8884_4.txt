"Dominique" is one of those films for which the term "slow molasses" has to be considered. Too many endless and repetitive sequences (many times we see Robertson walking slowly down the stairs because he hears someone playing the piano?). This is ALMOST redeemed at the end of a surprising twist, which unfortunately follows another twist that manages to just leave a bad taste in our mouth. Not a very pleasant movie.
