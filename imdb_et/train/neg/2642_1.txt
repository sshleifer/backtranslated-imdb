Slow, slow, slow ... There's no secret or excitement in this movie. If you do not understand who the "mole" is in the first ten minutes, you must be brain dead. The secret service must also be too, because it took them together to put it together. There are no compelling characters in the movie (not a movie). The pace of the film is slow, there is no tension. A hired killer is a great shot, except when he catches Michael Douglas if everything he seems to be able to hit is large glass panes. The more fun of the movie is when the president's spouse says the code word to the antimicrobial end. It's ridiculous ridiculous. At least six people got up and left the movie early. I would have joined them if I didn't sit in the middle of the row. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
