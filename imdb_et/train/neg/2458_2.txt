I can't describe how this movie is terrible. Am I the only one who finds this animated totaly nasty? Rohan's men see 100% fakes with their poorly colored hair, which doesn't even match what the actors see. The orcs saw terribly. Why does gandalf walk with a bad hip? Why can't they pronounce things right? Saruman is not Aruman. Others sounded like the terrible pronunciation * sp * of Tolkien's stars. Everyone and everyone is glad that the studio that did it pulled the plug out of the series, it was just a terrible terrible adaptation. Go see the hobby comic for a better copy of Tolkiens's work. Hell, even ROTK's chances are better than this drift. 2/10
