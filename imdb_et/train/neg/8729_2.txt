It is a thriller with a good concept, good effect, good photography and good intentions, but it is confusing and separate from performance. <br /> <br /> Garcia stars like John Berlin, LA forensic detective who has moved to a small California town with his friend's finger on it. Soon he will go unexplored to investigate the unresolved murder that will lead to his theoretical killing of serums that no one else believes. A well-known victim is theoretically blind, leading a novel with a blind girl - believing to be a witness - at a nearby school of the blind. <br /> <br /> Despite the intriguing story, there was too much quantum leap and plot holes in this movie, where I thought, "How did we stop hell here?" or "how did we find it?" I found it confusing and divergent, despite good deeds, and so on. John Malkovich has a small part of F.B.I. investigator to get Berlin. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
