Much of the scenes should be interrupted. There are many scenes that should have been cut off. For example, a scene where hunters mention "I got my spiders", "I like the dick", playing mud in the arena or bar scene where a professional dinocroc hunters main job is a snake charm. <br /> <br /> How would other terribly inconsistent women, Diane, want to lose her innocent boy who walks as he wears women's panties in three sizes. Although they love, did they not realize they were doing it next to a little boy who would soon drive away and lose his head? Why were they in the living room? I mean, he's really slipped. How would a beach scene be very reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's jaw scene at Grant Lake. All these strange scenes could easily be redesigned and computed for comedy. <br /> <br /> In my local town, the cinema houses had announced Dinocroc for several months and I am glad that I did not watch it because I later learned that it was only shown 1 or 2 days before it was canceled. The film was what was bad. I suspected Dinocroc wasn't a good movie when looking at the preview. It has a Dinocrock leg that looks like a child wearing green pajamas and slippers with candles and walks up and down like a 2 year old. It can easily pass through as Baby Geniuses. <br /> <br /> If any film student wants to know what not to do, this is a real classic trash. Like Diane's boy who walks like he had developed with a syphilis, you think of what a poor woman sees in a boy who sees himself already before drinking beer. If this happens, who cares about Dinocroc? Panties looked more interesting than the entire Dinocroc movie. His behavior was so bad that he made Mr Bonn much better. MOVE OVER ROWAN ATKINSON, here's a guy with a better comedic talent for horror sci-fi flick. Perhaps worse in Hollywood history.
