This minor, uncomfortable flick is strictly in the hands of young older men in the body, desperate to live their hormonally challenged teen years. How? Gas burning and fast, careless (or airplane) comparing freedom. <br /> <br /> The plot lends heavily to Mister Rogers 'neighborhood (if it was my oil conglomerate) and to Logan (if it was heavily calmed and had no clear sense of style.) <br /> <br /> Tackling Lee Majors' i and Burgess Meredith, this film is placed in a post-gas post-crisis world where the omnipotent government does not want you (* ahem *) to drive your car and burn gas. The opposite of today's Enron Bush, the oil gripping machine, the SUV's government. <br /> <br /> This placement alone makes the film ridiculous. But wait ... there's more. Although the film is set for the future, we will not see signs of future technologies beyond the return of bicycles, golf carts and horses. You believe the future looks just like today. The same dress, the same suburban houses, the same greens as the lawn and the film making today. There are no solar panels, windmills, alternating energy exchange. <br /> <br /> Operation is smooth and tasteless. Even scenes that could have been sparse or moving, friend-flick, glory, romance, horror ... all coincide as paper dolls under the suitcase. <br /> <br /> There is no continuity - the Burgess Meredith symbol changes colors and configurations from the moment filmmakers offend again and again with unbalanced film material. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <br /> <br /> Even a dead car movie and SF fans should avoid a movie like a six-lane lane unless you like Exxon leaders trying to make the film as empty as the hero's gas tank.
