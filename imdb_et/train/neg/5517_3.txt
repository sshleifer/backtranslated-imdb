I only regret this movie because it tries to be worth it. I love to boast a big movie and I'm not biased against "male" movies. Legally, the blonde was a great movie. However, the Georgian rule was an unpleasant, weak, poorly written, and unrealistic example of making the film worst. finally the film didn't care who lied or if something was solved. <br /> <br /> The most important is the good STORY in the movie. This story is weak and never develops (just because the subject is deep, it doesn't mean the story is good). A good story is dynamic. The dynamic nature is one that is experiencing a greater character and has changed for it during the film. The Georgian rule changed dramatically and was not developed. Second, there were too many dynamic signs of ATTEMPTED. Giving a really good dynamic character is hard work and takes time (only a few hours in the movie). This means that too many dynamic signs are trying to draw too little attention to their personal change. Even if I ignore the poorly written story and the litter of weak dynamic characters, I can't even say that I liked someone. Every sign was confusing. It's good to write American beauty, but not when you try dramatic comedy. Georgia was a terrible mother, her daughter was a terrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a terrible apology to the human being (I didn't cut her in any way because she was molested, messed up with everyone and we are all responsible for our own actions). "Dudley Do Right" The son of Mormon should have forced his religion and responsibilities not to be compromised ... and Simon, I mean seriously, who a 17-year-old girl who is molested will occasionally overcome (unless she is an actor or politician). This movie is worth watching if you want to remind yourself of how good movies are NOT!
