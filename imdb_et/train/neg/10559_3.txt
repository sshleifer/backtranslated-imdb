"I don't understand. No one makes any sense!", Cries out one murdered character at the end of the death-smiles, having just been confused by this thoroughly crazy movie, I know exactly how he feels, film director Aristide Massaces (good old Joe D ') Amato, who uses her real name to change her name, is a clumsy mixture of supernatural, murder / mysterious and pretentious artificial rubbish, those who admire the trash of the thirties, like the odd efforts of Jess Franco, but that tried to stay conscious. <br /> <br /> Opening up with a terrible grief with the death of her beautiful sister (with whom she had been an insane thing before she finally lost her deadly doctor), Death Smiles will soon become very confused as the same woman (played by Ewa Aulin, who is equally strange) Death Laid an Egg ") is alive and strikes - the only survivor of the bus accident going outside the estate of Walter and Eva von Ravensbrück. when he was invited to live in his home and recover, where he tends to scream with Dr Sturges (Klaus Kinski, who plays in his role), begins to worship with both Mr. and Mrs. Ravensbrück (that is, viewers are treated as a short but welcome nookie and lesbian lovin 'scene). <br /> <br /> "So far, so good," I thought at this point, "We have had fears, incest, some blood and guts, and female nudity, which are the ingredients of the big, terrible Euro-horrors; the next is Massace's flat attempt to combine giallo-style killings, ghostly and even elements of Edgar Allan Poe's 'The Black Cat' to tell a very foolish, totally astonishing and ultimately extremely boring revenge this film seems to be quite a few admirers on IMDb, but I would look much more at the director's later films later in my career; I guess the incomprehensible, prone, surreal 70s Gothic horror just isn't my thing! 2.5 out of 10 (only for cheese color and nonsense), rounded up to 3 for IMDb.
