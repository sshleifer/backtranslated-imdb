View 1 of 2/16/2002 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery? Despite the very talented films, this film is too predictable and simply undervalued by this audience. The constant publicity of the film is not stupid and I hope that it will not fill some stars with pockets over and over again, regardless of what they are related to. We think that this movie starts from the beginning with a Connery conviction for capital punishment, but it is nothing more than a standard designed for the audience, running a mill, never getting it, thriller. We are pulled into every stupid switch because they are depicted to us when this is a story, and we are ready to move this thing before its end. Yes, there are some good deeds here, especially Blair Underwood, Fishburne and Ed Harris in a psycho-supportive role, but the story doesn't work from the very beginning to the very long-awaited end.
