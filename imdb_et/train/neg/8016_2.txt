First of all, this film GLACIALLY is slowly moving and I can see that most viewers lose patience in the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> The theme of the movie was what I think would be a great movie; Most of all, there was no plot to promote the main topics. <br /> <br /> This is unfortunate, because, for example, writer Lanford Wilson thinks that the symbolism like mountain lion penetrates a school campus can be a big, tragic proportion without a heavy hand. <br /> <br /> I think a good script that supports a movie, the same filmmaker, the same taste, and even the same actors (who couldn't even impress) could have provided a meaningful and touching image of the pains and struggles that boy goes through when he develops into a powerful "crush" parent boy he admires. <br /> <br /> But I am sorry to say that without this base and armed with a vague, eternal and remarkably uninteresting script, without any visible plot and having no reasonable structure (for example, after viewing it, you find that you can't refer to climatic scenes and instead find yourself "well, maybe this scene, or one that was extreme ...") - the result is 95 minutes of tedium. <br /> <br /> Without a good plot we will never be terribly interested in any characters; their trials and difficulties are just boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Without a good plot, dramatic equipment and surrealistic director freedoms will not become confusing and confusing, not a story of reality. I can never believe, for example, of "Leah", and I think most viewers would be completely confused with the usual way of filming their phone calls. <br /> <br /> As the movie is standing, I'm afraid I can't recommend it at all. I can never understand why a movie like this has not been made by an enterprising filmmaker, not the mediocre revaluations of all the films that were very good in the first version! All this needs is a good manuscript written by good writers, and I think that this movie can easily be transformed into an unforgettable classic that is related to the men's future aspect that is rarely processed in drama. All the elements that were so annoying and appearing in the movie (boy's stomach messages, "Leah" scenes, TV screen fantasies) could get rich if supported by a good STORYLINE. <br /> <br /> I can see in quite a few comments that people are talking about this movie as a "gay" topic and I think it's wrong. Obviously, the boy who is the boy of the older adolescents has been portrayed, but the character of Logan is too young to be confident in making sexual choices, and in fact, we see any sexual and non-sexual stimuli in our imagined masturbation fantasies as we expect from a very young man. I believe that "breakages" such as Logan are common among young men who grow up to favor female partners.
