The last Johnny Weissmuller from Tarzan's movies and the good thing, because it's just the worst of the 12 movies he did in 16 years. There's no mermaid here, because the beautiful woman on the island is trying to escape the clutches of her people who worship God and try to force her to bride. She finds Tarzan and Jane trying to protect her. George Zucco is present as a potentially miserable high priest, but is not used to his full benefit. Also at hand and worth mentioning is the very annoying guitarist / singer who goes song every time so often. Even "big" Robert Florey can't help. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (of 4)
