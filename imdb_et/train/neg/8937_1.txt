In general, I like horror movies, but unfortunately it fell to one of my friends in a pound discount. We sat down to look at it, be prepared to be scared and finally sprayed food wherever we laughed so much. The concept is not so bad, but why did they decide to be happy in the seventh series that I didn't know. The worst thing about the movie is the actors. The work of the camera was bad, the special effects are not really bad when I'm generous, but generally the story could not be combined at any level, because the actors were as effective as a small number of poorly recessed feet. They were wooden in size, especially a young man who was too young for fifteen years to be taken seriously by any government. In fact, he seemed to be a public schoolchild. There was really a fun sex scene where she saw her as an apple when her busty lady drove on her chest and later her diaper panties were hysterical, but then remembered it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. I desperately want my brain to find something positive about this movie, except for the casual flash of the breast, but it just isn't. We hope that ten were a happy number and they don't do the other, I'm not sure my ribs could take it.
