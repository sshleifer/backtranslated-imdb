Elephants Dream was supposed to be the flagship of an open-source community. And while this was a very interesting idea in the concept, it has actually failed. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully rendered, which is probably the only redemption factor. However, their tremendous problem is the overwhelming overuse of light bloom. It is terrible, though I think it gives the film a dream quality. <br /> <br /> One thing is to mark a terrible voice. Though Proogi's voice actor is at least half-hearted, Emo's voice is HORRIBLE. I think if you have a budget that basically reaches zero, you can't afford to be a real voice character. It seems to me that they hired one of the animators to make their voices. <br /> <br /> Film does not go at all. It seems to me that this is a "look at what we can do" rather than a movie instead of a movie. The plot goes somewhere and can't really show any interesting point. The whole movie seems to have been made as an excuse to make interesting sight fields. <br /> <br /> Generally, it can be a quick download from the official website, but don't expect anything except beautiful graphics.
