Slow, boring, extremely repetitive. No wonder Weinstein Company didn't buy it. This Spurlock should film more McDonalds while filming and give up production. You can't watch and enjoy it. The preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can't make a 2-minute movie with this idea. I'm so sorry I rented this movie. I never look at something called Spurlock. That's completely garbage. Such filmmakers should be on YouTube and should never be awarded a distribution agreement. The film states that American consumers and their purchases are guilty of current depression when you buy and buy products, money circulating in the system is the foundation of the whole economy.
