The social comment was overwhelmed and the mystery itself was built and solved by a series of incredible coincidences that were absolutely unbelievable. Nothing has changed in Fitz's personal life over the last ten years, which makes it far more interesting. <br /> <br /> I even had problems understanding why he complained about staying in Australia compared to the possibilities to solve secrets in England. Can't get himself into Australian police? This seems to be a very artificial plot point to get him to investigate a crime. <br /> <br /> The latest episodes from the original series were quite melodramatic and improbable, sometimes confined to foolishness, and it pulls this coat up instead of focusing on the first series. Sad.
