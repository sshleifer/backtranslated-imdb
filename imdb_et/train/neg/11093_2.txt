When this film was about a fictional character, the film can be independent and can be objectively evaluated. Unfortunately, for the viewer, the film is based on "facts" that are hidden from Ruben Carter very unfairly. Many smaller facts were ignored (Carter was not the number one candidate at the time of the murder, there is no evidence that he saved his young child's molester friend), but some of the larger facts, such as the decision taken by Joey Giardello for "racist" judges, are unforgivable to them, who has seen the struggle on tape and Giardello completely disrespectful. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who, at best, was in trouble and much more trouble than any ordinary person (arrested several times for beating women) is strange to me. Ruben Carter did not see his actions in the 60s or even when he refused to talk to his son, the person people can watch. Everyone knows that the Jew can be led, and Washington can act, but why did they choose the story when their vehicle is outside of me. Does Hollywood need so many black heroes that they have to bend the truth in all their bio images? (Here's a suggestion How does Denzel play the film about her? Now it's inspirational.) Based on all the inaccuracies in the movie, I would recommend passing it on.
