I'm trying to decide if jumping into a wood dopper would be more enjoyable than that. It stops what was once a classic pair of movies. With Jedi, Threat, Clowns, and Sith, we have the death of Lucas's career. He wants us to swallow Annakin Vader crap? I never believed it was true. This film confirms these feelings. The story hasn't worked after Phantom Moron, and every new movie looked at the instrument until everything that was left was the parade of the toy. I have to go. I know where there are some new rocks. You want a spoiler? Here they come. Luke and Find are not related. Vader is NOT their Father. Duke Countoo should have changed the parties. Yodal has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra. His advice has never been good to anyone. Obi Wan lied to Luke for the first two films. Annakin didn't build C3P0. He found him in the desert and lied to his mother that he had put him together. Chewbacca is a flea. This whole confusion with Vader and the fall of the republic can be blamed for this stupid b *** h Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If he had had a brain, he wouldn't have come during the year of Annie's light, but he had said what George Lucas wrote to him. What a glory!
