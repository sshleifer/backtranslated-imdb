This movie was terrible. The script is completely unrealistic, but it is written in the real world, editing and light effects are worse than most of the first film school projects. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone who: A) knows the details of the police or hidden operations world. B) knows any details about making or recognizing films. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to a medium or medium mindset, I think it would be enjoyable if I were fucking. If you have to think completely about this movie, I suggest some inebriation.
