A pretty obvious thriller-by-number, where the only possible twist is nothing to hide. I mainly looked at Isabelle Huppert for performing English. It wasn't great, but it was a strange role. I would not be surprised if half of his contribution would have been on the floor of the cutting room with the rewriting of several last-minute scripts. <br /> <br /> The actor is the least attractive thing about this movie. Steve Guttenburg looks like he is trying to complement his role with the charm that everyone told him. There is a sensationally stupid order where it is suggested that his sexual ability can cure PTSD. This is an interesting performance. Elizabeth McGovern is a pull of true charm and character, but it is a little consolation. 3/10
