Usually, every movie goes with Sylvester Stallone sucking ass. Rambo: The first part of blood II was no exception. The only movie Sylvester Stallone had was good were Rocky and First Blood. This movie is extremely unreal and boring. It has action, but not very good action. I didn't enjoy watching it and I would never see it. No wonder why he won the Razzie Award for the worst picture. I'd give it 3/10, the only reason he got the third because it was somewhat good but not good enough.
