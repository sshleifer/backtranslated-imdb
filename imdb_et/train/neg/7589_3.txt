What do you think, if there is no script at the beginning, and therefore there is nothing the director can do. Hayek and Farrell and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they just have nothing to say or react. Even the earthquake was pretty bad. And I don't know how close the film's novel follows, but two Jewish girls don't look out, but show that Arturo is a nice, warm heart, but some stereotypes are nothing. And he even bursts into Camilla in the desert, instead of bringing him back to L.A for a nice Catholic burial where he could at least bring his flowers from time to time. Pathetic. And L.A. the set was ridiculously graphically created. Something good? His apartment window was real, curtains, sounds, wind. And Donaldson is always great. He has been from the snatchers or night of the body of the living dead, whichever is.
