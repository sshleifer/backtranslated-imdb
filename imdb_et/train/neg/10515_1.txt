Well, this is a typical "straight toilet" film film. <br /> <br /> A short story, a bunch of teens / young adults who are left in horrible forests and naked nymphomaniac demons. <br /> <br /> This film has all the basics of this basic principle: <br /> <br /> -Experienced women, children, or young adults who are kept somewhere horrible â€” designed to die, - the last survivor is a well-built young woman who is always their medieval, but never less bra, - horrible, crazy guy who knows evil, - lesbian kiss scene, -x is killer, -no plot <br /> <br /> Even if you want cheese hair the movie, it was really terrible. The atmosphere is completely dead. Nothing, not even the sexual scene and nudity, was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested. Looking at it, it seemed that it was followed by a nasty head with a deadlock or a nasty head cold. <br /> <br /> Give the demon ..... 0/10.
