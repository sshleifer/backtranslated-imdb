When I first started to watch this movie, I was looking for some fine metaphors, but soon it gave me that the movie was really about people on the train. People-to-people relationships are like what you see on the street every day, and when sometimes it is a little more interesting, the dialogue becomes boring and boring. It's not that I can't see how this film tries to portray how people interact, but that they're very boring in this movie. If you want to see and analyze such relationships, it would be best for you to actually buy a train ticket and buy people on the train. It's realistic, but you wouldn't go to the movie to watch the movie where you watch the movie.
