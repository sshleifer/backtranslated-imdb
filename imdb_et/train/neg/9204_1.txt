I've seen this movie many times (and recently I read the book that is the basis of the movie) and every time I see it, I want to hit just four. The fact that they don't know that Tom Hank's character is his D & D (oops M&M) :) persona ("Oh, he just acts as a character.") Outside the game session. And the fact that after three months of treatment, let us destroy all of this and eat our frustrations! Such people give a bad name to RPGs. almost enough to set your teeth on the edge!
