This movie was terrible. The end was absolutely terrible. There was no plot for the film. The only thing that was decent was Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were great! The only problem was that the film did not bring any justice to the performance of its actions. If the script had come to a semi-decent story, it would be worth it. Instead, the performances of Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones are wasted in a terribly divine way ... or its absence. Not only did he wait for something that would happen to make a movie .... even a real movie ... not just between the characters of fictional dialogue about what ended for absolutely no reason. It was nothing more than a normal dialogue that would have come back during that time. None of the signs was anything special. The only special thing was how Robert DuVall depicted a robbing, older, drunk, old man. Nothing is worth it all over the film, including the end. When the movie came to an end, I was surprised ... surprised that I was sitting across the film, waiting for something interesting that watching the movie would be worth it. It never happened! The number of characters began to run suddenly, explaining that the movie was really over and I realized that I was just wasting my life for two hours, watching absolutely no plot and no meaning in the film. It wasn't even a story. The whole movie takes place at the value of the day. That's it. It was one day in some southern living (and death) plantations. How much of a story can one day (except for a movie training day)? The show's show performances were great, but they were extremely wasted for the film's frustration ... if you could even call it a movie.
