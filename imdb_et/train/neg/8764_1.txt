This movie was absolute torture. First, it's a 4-hour whopping! True, Kargil's war may have had several points that were caught and fought, but each one of these battles does not have to be shown. So maybe it's a documentary, not a promotional film. Of course, it didn't seem to be because there was not enough background information and there were some mistakes. The battle sequences were so poorly executed. I'm a terribly disappointed man who gave Border well done sequences. Each battle was the same as the previous one. It was so predictable. (It may be a spoiler.) The whole army marches uphill, five or so soldiers curse five thousand times (they use the same words every time), one of the leading players strikes, someone hugs the stretcher, the actress says, "No, don't get a stretcher. 6 men, "and then the actor dies. This is exactly the same thing happens over and over again. Oh, and the songs are so bad and so long. Casting a movie is too good for you. Despite this long film, no characters were well developed. The actors were the smallest. They are all dressed and depicted the same. Two of them were crying synchronized. It was so comical. They moved their hands and heads at exactly the same time and then with their dupat. <br /> <br /> The list goes on and on. I know I forget something. Anyway, I think I've made enough movie to get the picture.
