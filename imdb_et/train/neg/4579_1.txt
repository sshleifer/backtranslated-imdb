"What do we know about Bleep?" was one of the worst times I've spent in movies. It was less of a movie and more after school, but at the same time there was nothing special. The test narrative in which they based their idea was completely pathetic about what almost everyone says to you. Marlee Matlin's underwear just shouldn't happen. I'm not living on it. I express criticism, which many are unable to formulate. This film, though annoying, also suffered a huge justification for the lack. It was terribly controversial, because it took such manipulative, became the creator of your life, the manifestation of abundance, the hopeless propaganda piece. Interconnectivity is explained as our big parties. But in the movie we are encouraged to check our surroundings with our senses. This completely ignores the fact that there are other people who have the mind who could control us, which seems to be more. Or at least the structures in which we exist limit us very much. In this way, the film was inappropriately solipsist. Solsism and interconnection are not just blended if you are not a omnipotent God. If you are, then all of the clean things that this movie shows you will be impressed (?!?). If not, you are very disappointed, moor or maybe both. Besides, the title is so ridiculous that I have people warning that they don't see the movie because I feel slowed down by naming it by name. Shame on everyone involved.
