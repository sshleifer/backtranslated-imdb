Examining some of the caves with her husband, the doctor bites a bat that causes some worrying side effects ... <br /> <br /> Sometimes a horrible atmosphere and some decent (though down) effects do not save it. B horror flick is a subtle of human-changed creature. The Bat People aka It Lives By Night suffers from a meaningless story that is clumsily drawn and weakened. The plot never seems to go anywhere, and the film never explains what is happening, or even a satisfactory conclusion about it. The cast is quite mediocre in its performance. <br /> <br /> I still give some points to the film about my haunting song and nice places to shoot. Even late, Win Winston's makeup is pretty good, but it's not much here. Certainly missed the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Certainly one of the smallest human beings there. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 Off ****
