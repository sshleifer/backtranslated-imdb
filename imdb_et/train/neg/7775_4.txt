I don't know trilogy, but I came to Showtime last night. The film looked very well done with design and cinematography, but the scenario was clean. The action was quite bad - I thought two female leadership was usable. You never believed what the supported actors said. There were stereotypical-dirty Reverend without nuance, authoritative captain, hot-head soldier and others. Telefilm Canada's final credits gave it away. I know I'm a terrible person. <br /> <br /> I may have missed something at first, but hostility to girls has never been explained. Here they are delineated by prison prisoners and men waste time and energy that does not cause two young women. FOCUS people. There is a little more stress on your walls than whether these girls are lesbians or not, this is just my conclusion of hostility towards them. If they can mount and shoot a weapon, you can also be beautiful with them. The question of their "immortal soul" can be resolved later. <br /> <br /> I also think it is related to the rest of the trilogy, these girls should be the main characters? One of them, at the end, murdered one Indian life who saved one's life. I think one is the victim of his condition, who cannot necessarily be blamed for his actions, but the other is just a murderer who does not deserve his happy ending.
