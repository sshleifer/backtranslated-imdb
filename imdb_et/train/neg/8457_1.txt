I just watched this movie because I was so impressed with Olivier Martinez SWAT. But it's not SWAT. SWAT had a plot and some pleasant characters and ideas. Bullfighter had none of them. <br /> <br /> I should have realized that this might not be good, always badly played by Michelle Forbes. <br /> <br /> One poster here called the film inconsistent. Another called it the worst movie ever. Both gave too much credit for the movie. I'm so glad I got this library for free, but I still feel hanged. <br /> <br /> IMDb must add "0" to the "rate this movie", which is one of those movies.
