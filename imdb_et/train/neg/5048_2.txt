I tried. I really did. I thought maybe when I gave Joao Pedro Rodrigues another chance I could enjoy my movie. I know that after seeing O FANTASMA I felt a sick and almost moody mood, but some reviews were good and good, so I was like, "What the hell. At least you didn't pay $ 10 for the Quad - give it down." <Br /> <br /> Sometimes it is better to go to your dentist and ask for a root canal without any prior anesthetic to relieve so much pain. I often do not know whether it would be better to go back to my childhood and to require my ex-bully really to allow me to do so. In other cases, I often think that the world is really flat and that when I travel far enough, I not only get out of it, but remain clear and that some evil, Lovecraftian grabs me with my 9000 tentacles and squeezes life - and some french fries since 1995, still inside my esophagus - out of me. <br /> <br /> Is there a reason for Odete? I wouldn't say at all ... just that maybe his Creator thought his central story (which makes Alex Forrest's vision of a strawberry shortcake) looks not only horrible, but sick of bones. First of all, he decides to leave his current boy (hysterical) because he wants a baby and he believes they are too young. Later, he runs into a homosexual man's funeral and - to get it - to get closer to him, he despises the pregnant woman, while he is ill in the lives of the dead human mother and lover. Oh, of course, he casts like a banshee and throws himself not one but good three times in his grave. And this ridiculous business that it is gradually becoming "Pedro", which summarizes some weak-as-bad road explanation that love does not recognize sex. Or something. <br /> <br /> I'd say he's nuts like cashew nuts, unsalted. But then again, so is the director. And I took the opportunity to do it. At least men look good. Besides, there is not much more here.
