Firstly, it is a very dated film that is not focused on the left-wing political revolution. Frankly, if someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to put an end to an intellectual (which in itself is quite pointless because the answer was exactly intellectual), it will reduce me to despair; as we should all return to the monkeys for the sake of equality - it's just ridiculous. Our intellectuality is just one of many human qualities, but that does not mean that we should not educate ourselves as much as possible. Undoubtedly, this non-educational message relates to the use of Godard's rock music; consequently, Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The song "Lust for the Devil", the creation of which we know and where the film takes its name, is really nothing special. Lord Zeppelin's "Thankyou" (Led Zeppelin II) used a much better chord order, which is not very original. In addition, "Sir" Mick Jagger refuses his usual jam (rather like Bob Dylan) - note how the first melodic phrase repeats itself to form a verse. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the black panthers depicted in this film do not seem to know what they are fighting, the most interesting scenes include the fascism equation with pornography; a message that actually undermines the sexual 'liberation' of the 1960s and today's (indeed, a message that would have lied to Rolling Stones' behavior at the time of the film). <br /> <br /> No wonder DVD came free with The Sunday Times! To listen to the deep-seated historical exposition of left sympathy, listen to Luigi Nono's masterpiece "Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore".
