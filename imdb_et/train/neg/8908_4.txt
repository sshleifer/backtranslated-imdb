This series was the CBS response to Big Valley success. It was a 90-minute west just like the ABC program. Although this was the answer, it had nothing to do with the passing of season 2. <br /> <br /> The problem really became a reality. For example - in one episode, Johnny gets his eyes closed. Amazingly, at the end of the show, Johnny was healthy. Along with that, it wasn't as strong as Big Valley. <br /> <br /> It shows that I don't want DVDs, and I hope they're never released. I think because CBS had lots of lots, they used a lot of familiar settings again. It was one of the last Western series CBS produced in Western countries, not really popular in the 1970s.
