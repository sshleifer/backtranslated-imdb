Many runs around. A poorly understood opponent with very little complexity. A scientist working in communication that sends and receives signals to space receives the aliens. With his real wife, he invades his territory and is given secrets. He becomes quite treacherous in the process. In this case, he still has little choice. There's a scene where he gives them everything they want. It is a boring film that has many long distances where little happens. The plot is not technically bad. It's just that we usually follow the car, travel through the forest, exploring the buildings. That's just editing. I think the story doesn't support much more technically. Not much here.
