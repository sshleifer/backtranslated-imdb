Great CGI Effects And A True Oscar-Worthy Gary Blue Present When Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is one of the movie pony in this movie, how he became the best actor for the Oscar this year over Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br /> This film is a bit of a poor message for the baby boomer, barely hidden right-wing prejudices, starting with Forrest's service in Vietnam until the "resolution" with Jenny's end. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is a very fun and American movie through and out. I found some parts of this movie extremely insulting, Zemeckis slipping this film to almost Gump's level. . it may be the point he was trying to make. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and ask yourself, "What is Robert Zemeck, which says what makes a good American?" Forrest seems to have made the right choices and has been in the right place at the right time over the last 45 years. Those who have been wrongly seen by the director's vision will pay a high price. So Zemeckis has said that the idiotics hidden with innocence and naivety are patriotic, even the quality of AMERICAN?
