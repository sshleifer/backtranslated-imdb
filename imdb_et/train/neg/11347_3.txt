The Cobra cult is now available on DVD, a pristine print that is fully justified, no matter what the film is. Unfortunately, it doesn't speak much. <br /> <br /> He is competent for other runners who justify themselves and can be expected in this situation. It is effectively targeted, fully sound-phased and studio-backlit. It looks OK, but it is generally drawn and in a little 80 minutes it is still very cushioned. <br /> <br /> For example, a double-cage attack on a first geographical indication was certainly one attack too. <br /> <br /> A business that concerns Julia, deciding to marry Petra, not Tom, is never something. Tom falls in love with Lisa and he never has any reason to jealous Julia (nor is he). <br /> <br /> Julia's "feminine intuition" has been introduced as if she had come to an important plot but it is not. Likewise, Pete's study of cobra cults and the suspicion that Tom is briefly about do not have any purpose other than filling the screen. <br /> <br /> These are just the symptoms of the main problem. The film is structured as a mystery, but it is not. As soon as the curse is pronounced, we know exactly where this story is going, so that the characters remain careful to explain what we already know. <br /> <br /> The end is particularly flat. Julia is in danger only by chance. Lisa doesn't want to kill her - she just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong place. If Tom stays to save his time, it is not even clear whether he was threatened at all. Then he just loses the cobra in the way that none of the previous victims have done. <br /> <br /> This is an unreasonable little story I found that I thought it was the head of the studio on the ground. Then it happened to me. Someone said, "These Val Lewton films were very successful in RKO, so why don't we?" <br /> <br /> Cobra's cult is clearly designed for cat people: a mysterious, restless, shape-changing woman falls in love with a hero, is probably cold, kills people, harbors a hero's wife's friend and dies at the end. But "modeled" does not mean "as good as" - with a wide margin. It copies but does not understand what it is copying. <br /> <br /> This has obviously been catching the low key, recommended Lewton style, but this approach does not reflect the story. Lisa is not Irene. He must be strange and mysterious, but he has no secret. After the first attack in Asia, we get a glimpse of him so that he can immediately recognize him when he appears in New York. There is never any doubt about his purpose. There is also no ambiguity as to whether or not he actually becomes a snake. <br /> <br /> Then we get one, but two, tests for buses at night. It doesn't come out because the director doesn't understand what makes bus work, and in any case they happen to be a stalker, not a person who is kidnapped. <br /> <br /> Give the Cobra cult any small distinction, but they only point to the gap between the original and the imitation. <br /> <br /> Plagiarism can be a sincere form of entertainment, but I doubt whether Lewton or Tourneur was particularly attracted when this tiny little time passed.
