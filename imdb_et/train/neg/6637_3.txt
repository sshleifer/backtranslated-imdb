They should have called this movie ... Blond women who need their roots to color. Also the main character, geeze, too tight jerseys. Smiling. I thought the man did a good job. I hope we find a good 8-star Christmas video this week. Dart throwing. It was also a laugh. We have two more DVRs, maybe we'll be happy. Oh yes, I thought the guy was pretty fast and I laughed when he picked up the flowers, and then drove with his relative. I told my daughter they were on their way to the cemetery. And how stupid was it that the two gals followed them in spying? Creepy.
