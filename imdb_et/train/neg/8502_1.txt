At first, it seems to me an interesting film, the Spanish thriller in Madrid today, but there is nothing about it, is it really a movie that is interesting for future film directors, learning about not making a movie? In other words, it is not even worse, even if the existence of an Oscar winner (Mira Sorvino) is not enough to justify the $ 3.00 spent on watching this movie, it is frightening and it seems that the actors are just waiting to shoot home every day, which leads somewhere is bored, weak and bad, doesn't spend time or money on this film.
