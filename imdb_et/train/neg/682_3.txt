Note: I can see from various posts that the original movie had the original silent version and sound. I saw the sound version and it was aesthetically yicky. Considering some of the indications that the original version was LONGER and without breakable duplication, I think this review should be kept in mind. <br /> <br /> Although I know that Rene Clair has a beautiful reputation as a filmmaker, and Louise Brooks is also a bit of a cult, this is a technically poorly made film. Although Hollywood had already moved to sound mode already in 1929, in the early 1930s, until the mid-1930s, there were many famous films that were basically silent films - with some dialogues and sound effects, the film was hit very badly. Many, especially the lips of this film do not even come close to what is said, and it explains why America, like Mrs Brooks, could make a French film. It's just sloppy and I would have preferred them to have just made a silent movie - and as a silent movie it would have been the average movie - with great camera work (at times) and some decent silent style. br /> <br /> The problem I found with the movie was too simple a graph. To play quiet morals in 1920, it would have been good, but according to the 1930 standards, the plot is a bit (that is, "old" - not "slutty"). The woman wins the beauty contest and her macho fianc√© is unable to cope with it. She gives her everything temporarily, but she's attracted back to the fictional life and it is coming to her end! Is Melodramatic? And also a bit simplified and underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> Finally, I found the bride's friend's character (?) very disturbing and unreal. He looked like Harold Lloyd and spent a large part of the film that a friend and everyone else had abused and chose. Since she just passed the movie and didn't come up with a resolution, her character seemed superfluous and the treatment became mediocre. Was the audience laughed when abused? It seems to me that it's indirect and I don't like it at all. <br /> <br /> The best French films of the era are better (Le Million, La Femme du Boulanger, Fanny, Regain and others). ) as well as better silent movies. I just don't understand the high rating of this movie.
