Pyare Mohani can safely add a blacklist of one of the worst films of humanity. The film, which is one of many people with disabilities who, after Black's phenomenal success, has been mocking a brotherhood with disabilities. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are just handicapped cartoons. While Black depicted the discomfort and emotion of a woman with disabilities and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan shows two desperado-type monkeys, who have no shortcomings about the disabled and half-world to protect the interests of love in the world. Anu Malik's music is fairly fair. Vatek Oberoi, who started a promising start with Saathiya, unfortunately loses his balls quickly in the Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan was never an acceptable actor and deserves a ban on the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just those in trouble who have troubled times in Thialnd with whom no one will save them - except for the desperados mentioned above. Boman Irani, like evil Don Toni, is somewhat acceptable. Avoid the movie as possible.
