60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released full-length video / DVD) about rogue 1960s, seen by both the white family and the black family. The first part of the movie is Willut Taylor, Dutton's great performance admirer, and a steadily distributed story between families. However, Dutton's character is killed halfway and the black family is forgotten, inconsistent and even terrible. EVALUATION: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 video / DVDs).
