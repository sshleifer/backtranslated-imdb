I was joking! It was one of the worst films I've ever seen! It was so bad that it was fun. My friend and I hired it deliberately because it seemed so bad. For some laughter, there are always old horror waves with good cheese. The plot stunk, some votes were duplicated, the quality was terrible. But I was sure he watched it!
