1957 (yes, that's the right date) Production of J. Arthur Rank with the justice of James Robertson, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hyde White; it must be a crack comedy, right? Oh, it's just terrible. This is one gag movie: watching people is shocked in the eyes of a small alligator. Music is thrown most inappropriately and unforgettably. Jeannie Carson is a lively dancer and a competent singer. But what did he do in this movie? Diana Dors is also here, offering pre-used victims. His level of action is not bad, but he's in the movie to write to someone. Well, during this movie, something has to be done. The movie is now sold by VHS to e-Gulf people. Free yourself of cost and waste of time. Comedy without a smile. Music without memorable singing or dancing.
