Tobe Hooper is probably the biggest fluke offered by the fear genre. Like any other horror, I loved Texas Chainsaw, but I think you should have at least one hit to put your name on the movie title. I can't really think of another movie that Hooper has (independently, doesn't read Poltergeist), which has really influenced the horror genre or film world. And this movie, Night Terrors, only supports my point. <br /> <br /> Bad Robert Englund, I give him credit for at least doing a good job with terrible material. He did what he could. What about the film itself? Pure drudge. Nude scenes needed every five minutes, a story that must be ours and really just terrible landscapes, music and cinematography. Nothing in this movie is redeemable. Don't waste your time. <br /> <br /> Generally one in ten. I'm sorry for Cooper, his career seems to have ended before he really started. I hope he can pump at least one good flick so he can make his cult status fair. <br /> <br />
