Well, I like to be honest with all the viewers I bought because of the Kira family, but unfortunately I didn't see many of them. All the sexual scenes were short and made random, just like all other B-movies, like all other strange and dirty background music - it just doesn't look like two sex tools. Towards the end is a small piece - Kira's new lover is a killer. Whoa !!! how shocking !!! Why are we not calling this film for the Oscar Award? I can't imagine how bad a movie would look if it was an R rating (Mine imported from the UK, estimated at 18). Conclusion? Put it down and walk away, so yon won't reach me like me. <br /> <br /> Score: 2/10
