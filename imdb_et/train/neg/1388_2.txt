When we saw this movie hoping we saw Jet Li somewhat poor, we were surprised by the anti-death weapon 4. Unfortunately, too many of his fighting tunes are so obviously fake that he even took out this pleasure. A flying blow would be much more impressive if you don't see the wires that hold him when he flies through the air for 4 seconds and 9 beats. <br /> <br /> Too many cartoons and very disappointing.
