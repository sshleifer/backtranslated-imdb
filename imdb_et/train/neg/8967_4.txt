Follow the same path as most sequences. The first was great. The second was average and it was full of bad deeds and some foolish dialogues, but also an incredible stop, this film was weak. <br /> <br /> Too predictable and I just couldn't tolerate Henry Wrinkler - as a boss with this foolish eye - so much more they could have done with it. I liked the first one. I wish they had done more of these lines than what they did here. <br /> <br /> There were too many inexplicable explanations of what time it was and why there was an old-age phone in that room? <br /> <br /> I realize there is another in others. <br /> <br /> Blah!
