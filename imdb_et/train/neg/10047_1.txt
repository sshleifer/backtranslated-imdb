I've written comments on several MM episodes and this is one of the worst. An interesting assumption in the beginning is completely abandoned by the time of credit rollover. If you look at people they never live in real life, you will entertain ("look through the basement!"), Then that's your show. Except, it's not fun or fun - it's just annoying. <br /> <br /> The extent of the virus has never been shown. I can very much ignore the fact that it only affects men, because the resulting situation is very scary. But then things get worse when the daughter lets OBVIOUSLY slip into her father's home and eventually dies in her. The woman flees to the bottom and runs to some ten situations. Then there will be some spirit or alien, or something that will save him (things that go to you?). Or something. Then he worships for heat. End. <br /> <br /> Tough. These drivers post it out.
