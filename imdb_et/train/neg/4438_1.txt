I borrowed from this movie library I think it might be pleasant. How wrong I am! <br /> <br /> This is such a bad movie that I have to write about it. Mira Sorvino is so bad in the movie that it is very painful to watch the scene with her. She is a beautiful girl, but she is not at all seductive in this movie, but I have witnessed her uncomfortable efforts to attract almost all other big figures. It's so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Film dialogue is so pretentious and has no humorous fact that allows it. <br /> <br /> Totally failed.
