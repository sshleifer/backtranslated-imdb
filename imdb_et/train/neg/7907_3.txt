The excellent performance of Alix Eliasi brings out an otherwise misguided and confused track. I've seen this movie, maybe 12 times, and with every run I find less and less joy. Why is Munchies So Attractive? Has it ever been explained? Do they reflect our hope, nervous "animal selves"? If they are, why not make it more obvious? Why not just bring back some of the nuances that hit this movie and make this connection explicit? The second part of this movie that disturbs me is that it doesn't end with motorcycles. A small monster carries a front cover that seems to refer to a "street" trip. Sunglasses say "pretty cool guy". All this is ready for the Easy Rider to meet Muppets. All I get is Munchies (1987). What gives? Stay with the Gremlins series if you are a fan of little, clever, reptilian dolls - this will give you the treatment you deserve.
