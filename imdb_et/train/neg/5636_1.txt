This movie was the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It doesn't seem to have a plot, but the time you understand it is far from the beginning of the movie, so you have to watch for a long time to recognize the director, the lamp that plays the swab chick in the movie, complete incompetence, and we do not believe Willem Dafoe in this movie, he is a clone, because the true Dafoe, as we know, "apocalypse now" and "blessing saints" never agreed to such a script. <br /> <br /> Duh, the (Da) enemy, wrote this bill with his twenty years minus the baby. This film begins with two main characters Dafoe and Colagrande, and then two scriptwriters with Dafoe and Colagrande, and then with Colagrande's director credits. <br /> <br /> Bottomline; The widow meets the boy, the boy strikes the widow, the widow breaks the windshield with the boy who banged him. <br /> <br /> Title in the Netherlands; Black widow (different title, same fool). <br /> <br /> DO NOT MOVIAT! It's a belt all the time!
