I ordered this very rare and highly overpriced movie on eBay with very high expectations. I think I paid about $ 50 for this movie. Like an eternal spooky fan from the 80's American Slavers to the European zombie films, I told you it would be great! I can't tell you how wrong I was. First of all, I thought it was pretty much gorier than it really is. After all, I've heard about this movie, I was almost afraid to watch it. Murder is boring. Functional ... forget it, don't act! The story, even if we don't care, is incredibly bad. They seem to have tried to draw your attention to some strange sexual scene and naked girl, but unfortunately this does not help the film. Why? There is no atmosphere, and this is the worst thing about this flick. It's just a bad movie from A to B. While it's extremely funny and fun to watch your friends and beers, don't make any effort to get your hands on. There are so many movies in this world, don't waste your time watching Necro files!
