I was honestly surprised in the dark. It was so bad, I hardly believe what I saw. There are no signs, but some stereotypes that travel around and kill. The extent of character development gave each character a name and occupation, and that's it. There was no real plot and no characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes started with themselves, which did not come with technical rails. When I watched this movie, I continued to ask, "Where's it going? What's going on?" The action was the quality of high school drama, rigid wood delivery, as if the actors had read the chip cards without understanding their line. Solving these problems was an even more amazing terrible sound. The ADR sounded like it was in an open room. The actors constantly took great care to track down their characters by looking almost at the robot in their movement. So, these innumerable automatic machines are thrown through a series of incredible and confusing scenarios, often without transition scenes. They were here, now they're there. It happened, now it happens. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I looked at it very fun. Certainly not worth nine dollars.
