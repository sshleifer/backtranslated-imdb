Well, this movie started funny but quickly deteriorated. I thought it would be more "adult-oriented" humor based on the first moments, but then the film turned into a Disney Channel-type mode, especially for an amazingly long racing car racing scene. Alana De La Garza is proud but has a really forged Italian accent. The film looked and sounded a very independent and low budget. It was a very lovely moment that I just call the serenade scene, but it was generally fun. The laughs are very little and far away. The surprise of Mr. Fix It is so ridiculous that he left me more crazy than anything else. You may want to check if you can catch it for free or with a TV, but don't waste your money buying or renting this movie.
