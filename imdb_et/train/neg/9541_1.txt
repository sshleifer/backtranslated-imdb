I think many people comment on their first movie from IMDb because the film was remarkable or terrible - I write thanks to the latter. <br /> <br /> I was excited about "Wargames". I thought the original was pretty good considering its time period and content, I felt it was worth more than once. In 2008, I had great hopes for this movie. Computers, gaming, terror, military overcrowding have grown so much since the first movie, and "Wargames: Dead Code" had the opportunity to bring it all into a great flick. <br /> <br /> The film didn't work quite well at every level, but I blame the writers and everyone who had any input on the realism of the game aspects. "The Dead Code" was a 1990s flight simulator where few people got their weapons. At the same time, the farmer's button is about 7,000 commands, none of which affects the screen. Finally, he "wins" by clicking his mouse on the screen box, which releases gas that instantly kills 20,000 virtual people (nobody near gas). As he beat 5 levels in 15 minutes, it tells RIPLEY (the real life war machine) that he is a high-level terrorist threat. <br /> <br /> Even though every 5-16 year old could accomplish the same task - the government believes it is a deadly threat to humanity. They say things like "He has the expertise of biological terrorism" ... He showed less knowledge than someone reading the first 3 paragraphs of the Bio-Terror Wiki entry. So the movie's long length is about 0.01% of the budget and the excitement of any Bourne title. They have about 1,000 chances to catch him and solve the whole thing ... sometimes they're crazy that they hardly miss him ... but at other times they create a masterly way to just let him go deliberately. <br /> <br /> Ugh ... I'd write more ... but I wasted it for 1.5 hours, looking at the Broderick and Joshua game tic-tac support for 1.5 hours.
