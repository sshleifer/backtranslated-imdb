Did Francis Ford Coppolal had a brain aneurysm for some time after "Apocalypse", making him a totally impossible movie? <br /> <br /> You have to think about what the "Godfather" and "Debate" director thought when he made this loose movie. It gives Kathleen Turner a starring vehicle, playing a woman who rides back in time and gets back in her adolescence, knowing all the things life adult has taught, and Turner, her soldier, does what she can do but can't save anyone. <br /> <br /> He doesn't even have any styles, and the director thinks that even if he had nothing else, he would. <br /> <br /> Rating: C-
