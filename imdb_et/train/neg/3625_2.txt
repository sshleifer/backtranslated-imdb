This is a film that definitely belongs to the 50's. It is very surprising that the American Film Institute has chosen this one of the best 100-year-old American films. I've seen virtually all of the movies on this list, and that is by far the most disappointing film. Musical numbers (and many of them many) are very long and boring and have absolutely no connection with the story. At the end of the film there is a terribly long ballet sequence, which, of course, has no real connection to the film's story. It has to be admitted that this is very well done, the music is fine and the dancing takes place with the highest professional standard - but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the film. <br /> <br /> The main character of the movie is extremely childish and unlikely and behaves in an uneven way. His spiritual age is about 14. If you want to see good musicals made in the "golden age" of musicals, go and see "Singing in the Song".
