I think it can be a summary of this exhibition and something. Batman TAS can be the worst thing ever to do with cartoons based on comics, because everything you get after it is compared to it and nothing has been measured yet. It's just fucking good. Was Batman Beyond good? "Yes, but it wasn't TAS." Is the Justice League good? "It's not too bad, but it's not TAS." <br /> <br /> Batman is definitely not an TAS, but I don't hold it against it. It would be unfair and, moreover, it has many other problems. <br /> <br /> The younger, less experienced Batman crime concept is good and sometimes art is very nice. But for the rest of the time, art is worthless Americanime and it gives a lot of display errors. It's a tempo, written and designed like Americanime. If I wanted to watch Jackie Chan Adventures, I would look at Jackie Chan Adventures. Or I could shine my head at any time and get the same effect. Joker is a killer, mentally unstable clown suit who uses his smart, unpredictable and smart gadgets to fight Batman. If he is forced to fight hand in hand, he either uses something cheap or is completely overrun. He is not meant to be a monkey who sees kung-fu feelings and can jump twenty feet into the air, accompanied by speed lines. If they had wanted to do this to the villain, there were other less important signs they could have used, or * they would have been able to completely new. And it's not that re-imaginings are a bad thing, don't get me wrong. TAS (there I go again) took Mr. Freeze from his standard icegun-binary B digger and made him a memorable and morally complex character. Of course, Freeze was not exactly the classic villain at that time, and they did the update, but the point stands. What Batman does, it takes everything you liked for Batman comics and legacies and takes them to a big, smelly dump. Guess? They eat corn. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that this exhibition can't stand against the TAS, but stands on its own feet and it still doesn't work for me. Plots are not good and they are not improving. They are written for demographic children under the age of 12. Should children be able to show? Of course they should do it. It should not be an adult show with passion, nudity, and free violence. But the sign of a really good show is that it can be enjoyed at different levels of all ages. This exhibition misses this sign. <br /> <br /> Does it show TAS? No, of course not. The problem is that it is not even JLU.
