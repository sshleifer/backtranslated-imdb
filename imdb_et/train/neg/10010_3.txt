It is not worth considering the plot even when it refers to corruption, murder, power, and other thriller issues. Badges are sometimes interesting. Not realistic, but interesting. <br /> <br /> Development is slow as tea drinking. Visuals are not stunning, but good enough to lighten the eye load. Watching a good movie after dinner before bedtime - nothing is shocking too much, nothing overwhelming. Movie sitcom-style. <br /> <br /> I liked Woody - great performance. She had to fight the plot inadequately and work pretty well. The rest are acceptable, though very predictable. The collection is traceable and better than most TV shows.
