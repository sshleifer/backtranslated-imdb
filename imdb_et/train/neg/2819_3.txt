Marquis De Sade, Egypt, ancient Gnostic cultures, Robert Englund in two roles, free sex and nudity, murders and chaos ... on paper Tobe Hopper's nightly fears seem to be at least a fun, entertaining flick, considering the ingredients. This is not. It's a plot of less, inconsistent shambles that brings little entertainment. There is basically no vague thing about the culture that follows the work of De Sade, who, for some unclear reason, feels the need to attract and kill the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist. That's pretty much - I think he has something with Gnostics, but who knows what the writers think. Most of the film is a messy mess, because the heroine is exposed to various wonders, dreams and erotic encounters related to Englund scenes as De Sade imprisoned in the 19th century. The makers seem to have tried something serious, but regardless of their claims, they were buried in excitement, bad behavior, sliding and fake tips. <br /> <br /> There are not too many good points. Robert Englund is fun to watch, as always and as a leading actor, Zoe Trilling, though not very talented, is attractive at different stages of the film, but watching Night Terrors is a chore. At least I got to see a movie about "If you're as criminal as me" a bit of the Australian film certification ratings guide that came with so many VHS tapes from the nineties.
