Where do they get the money to make such movies? I don't want to redeem anything about this movie. No actor is known, writing is terrible, photography is blurry, the story strikes between Repo Man's bad version and nickelodeon west, and the actor is incredible. Someone who looks at all kinds of movies, good and bad, has to admit that this film is about the worst I've ever seen since the attack of the 50s. I do not like trash for people who are trying to create some entertainment or heaven, art, but this film does not seem like anyone. The story tends to mysteriously contaminate a person who is a poor version of the Celtic Soul eater, although he acts more like a male sex succubus without sexual hints. Bad guys have to agree with the good guys in a city where they can't escape. Get it out of there, because it's unfortunately the best part. My advice is that if you are not in poor mythology, amateur writing, insecure demonstrative and tedious devices, you can best serve it by letting this video rental on the shelf.
