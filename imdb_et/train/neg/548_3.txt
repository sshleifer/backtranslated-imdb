I saw 7.5 IMDb ratings on this movie and based on that I decided to watch the movie my roommate had rented. He said he saw it earlier. "It's funny and sad! I screamed for the first time I saw it," he said. Perhaps it is worth 7.5 out of 10 compared to other Bollywood movies, but compared to all the other films I've seen in my life, it doesn't deserve more than 3. Any movie where I can constantly guess what happens next is not good for me . The characters are incredible, how it is not realistic and their motives are built. It's dramatic and the songs aren't that big. My biggest problem with Bollywood films is the lack of fineness. All emotions are too exaggerated and therefore realistic. Any emotions or links between the mark that are the least subtle must be increased with unnecessary songs. I think I realized that the relationship between the father and the son was more than one of the parents and friends of the children, without the need to pass it through a five-minute song. The stupid comic relief with the laughter belt was neither funny nor necessary (we get it, Laxman is not the sharpest tool in the shadow). When a film tries to tear the tears out of the most hateful means, it just doesn't make sense, just a little embarrassing. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ***** <br /> <br> Generally, if someone is in the terminal stage with lung cancer, they would know that their son, who lives with them, would know something wrong, without saying it. There are too many plot holes to count. At first, the movie was fun and cute, as Bollywood movies are for people who don't look at them, they're terrible, but it's just annoying. Making a fun and heartbeat movie takes a lot of skill and the best way to do it is not usually in all the fun parts of the first half of the movie and all the details at the end. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER OVER ***** Maybe it was deeper than the other Bollywood movies I've seen, but not at all. I spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the film than the parts that were supposed to be funny. I didn't put any tears or feel it, rather I was overwhelmed by the feeling that I was terrified of the dramatic end test. I do not recommend this movie if you want to see something good, I recommend it if you want to watch a Bollywood movie that is kind of sad.
