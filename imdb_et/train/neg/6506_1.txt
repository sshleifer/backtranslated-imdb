If you are not a geeky film student who needs to see everything, this film is not only a waste of time and money and a great disappointment, but it also makes you feel angry. <br /> <br /> There may be a story that deserves to be talked about somewhere, but Hopkins decided to hide it and encode it with so chaotic layers of so many apparently random audio-video microcycles, making the viewer patience for a very short time after a very short period of time. <br /> <br /> Why Would someone like Hopkins choose such a difficult, hardest and most unstable project because his first script, the first score and the third film can in any case guess. Perhaps he was so long in his mind until he realized what he was, not even himself. The result proves that it has little or no experience to achieve the desired result. <br /> <br /> Even the most strange Carpenter and Lynch films, to name just two unusual filmmakers, were 90% more cohesive, 95% less characters and 99% more stories. <br /> <br /> Sir Anthony, with whom you celebrated the stars, but unfortunately the couple stayed light for years. Please take care not to act, in this department you are an equal giant and no one should ask you more, not even yourself!
