this movie is outrageous. embarrassing, I mean terribly. I was more fun when I look at the color in my local hardware store in August, while under migraine and heat stroke. action became progressively worse than the "film" developed and the directors used euphoric drugs when the latest scenes approached. When the fog was killed, he decided that it would be wise to mordant after the mordem. it was not intelligent. really, stevie couldn't catch it. If you decide between playing a nail gun and drinking and watching this movie, remember that a nail gun is likely to give you a better story to tell your friends.
