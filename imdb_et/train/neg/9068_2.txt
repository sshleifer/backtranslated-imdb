In my opinion, the oscar is the "worst script ever". There is no decent story, reddening action, very bad humor. If you have little self-esteem, don't waste your time watching this movie. Although the actors you see can act, it leaves you looking after it. A little braincells are killed watching this mess ... <br /> <br /> I warned u <br /> <br /> DO NOT MOVIE
