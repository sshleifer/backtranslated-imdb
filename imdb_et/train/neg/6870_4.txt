A well-intentioned film from Sonja Horowitz (Ren√©e Zellweger), a spouse of a dedicated Talmud scientist Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). who is very unhappy. Mendel's brother Sender (Christopher Eccleston) sees it and hires him to work in this area, where he is already an expert in jewelry. He also starts communicating with him and when he spends time with an artist in Puerto Rica, he removes him and puts him in the family that turns him off. There's a sub-block where Sonja's dead brother talks to him and apparently this is a magical spinner, but why isn't it clear. Unfortunately, it is not very clear, including what is happening with Sonja, why she tells Rebbe that she has a fire and maybe it is not God, and what it means, and what the magic light woman talks about her resources. To a certain extent, this story concerns the situation of a woman in the ultra-Orthodox community, but Sonja has not yet been fully released. Nor is the concept of redeeming the love of another race man very well thought out. The title comes from the biblical definition of the good woman's value, but it is the bastard who quotes it to Sonja. Zellweger is fighting this part; he should be a Jew in the middle of the West and sometimes his accent is flat and at other times it will be taken by Brooklyn's characteristic sounds. He is his best when he is tough and responsible, but in the end it is a mess of the film.
