The only reason I watched this movie was because I recently read Robert Hough's less than perfect but interesting, fictional report on the life of Big Cati coach Mabel Stark. Beaty appears in the book as a character, less than in a tempting light. <br /> <br /> I didn't know that the movie was later verified by IMDb as being the original serial number. Anyone who edited the original 233 minutes of work time up to the 68 minute version available on DVD has done a good job. The short version plays a B movie of any period of the same period, despite many "duh-what?" a moment. For example, do we really believe that our hero digs a twenty foot deep tiger trap in the morning without being able to dirty his jodhpurs? Looking over the chapter titles, I see that number 5 is titled "Gorilla Warfare" and number 11 is called "Gorilla". There was no gorillas in the film at all. I think there are some cuts made there. <br /> <br /> Historically interesting.
