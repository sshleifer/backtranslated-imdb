I've seen (too much) a lot of clips from this company - it's about the middle of the pack. One good thing, its a little more stylized and controlled than some of their ticket prices - less sophisticated attempts to humor and more stories to follow (what is worth it). Many of their titles, such as the Sexy Sixth Sense, are buried with Baate performances and amateur sensitivity. On the other hand, I found that simulated sexual scenes are not as hot as some of their valves (like Vampire Vixens, Gladiator Eroticus, Spiderbabe or Mistress Frankenstein). <br /> <br /> Misty Mundae is always a 10-meter peter meter, as is Darian Caine. I found Barbara Joyce on a hot school trip and Ruby LaRocca's sexy little hottie. <br /> <br /> Watch it with your remote control firmly in your (free) hand at night when you need a break from porn. Don't waste your time to watch the story - you have a better life to do. It's not a movie, it's a pure R&D, but it's not bad with this standard.
