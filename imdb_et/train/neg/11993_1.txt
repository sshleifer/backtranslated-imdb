After seeing only half of the film in school this November, I saw today that it was on Flix's channel and decided to watch it to see the rest of it and write a new review of it. <br /> <br /> The book on which the film is based, Hatchet, is OK. This is a terrible adaptation. <br /> <br /> Charming (and I mean terrible), bad dialogue and average cinematography make Hatchet a terrible customization. <br /> <br /> The film starts with Brian, who is the image of a clich√© in the late 1980s (sporting a sports coin, hitting the 80's rock music), and his mother driving a car to fly on his plane to see his strangers fathers (his parents are divorced ... now create a dramatic break.) Now Brian has said goodbye to his mother and dog and flies up to see his father. The pilot is a fatty, ugly, rude man (not in a book like the one who in 2 minutes in the air) has a heart attack and dies. There is more gaze in the book, where the pilot is more painful and it seemed that they were in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attack. <br /> <br /> The airplane (in two more minutes)) is empty of fuel (leaving us, viewers, assuming it has been for hours, though the sun hasn't changed its position and the landscape looks exactly the same.) Now He has fallen landed. <br /> <br /> This is a movie point where everything is much different than it was in the book. The book said his jacket was crushed, but there are tears in the movie, without tears or lashes (he seems to have just bought it), he never said he was climbing the mountain, saw the wolf, and he was not there he has attacked the bear (it said moose, but not the bear), he never said he was eating a lot of the mistakes he was making, never mentioning another tornado or learning to get those sparrows, skin and eating them or that little the fish farming trap that he does (which has been destroyed by a tornado) and does not mention him when he damages his rib from a tornado. <br /> <br /> Don't even think you can call what was portrayed in the movie, the tornado. All this was just a wind storm that pulled down several of his things. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of this camp event was Brian's flat setbacks (never mentioned in the book), especially Brian's wake up scene. up, walking to the window and seeing his father (all his stuff packed, all fit perfectly to the back of his truck) and screaming "DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD !!!!" (but of course his dad didn't hear him even when he was out) and he knocks his fist through the window (wtf?) <br /> <br /> The end is the only thing close to what happened in the book ( I said in close proximity.) In the book, I think one of the main things that the rescue worker said to Brian was "you are the child they have been looking for!" but they left the film out of the movie. <br /> <br /> With Brian, there is some pathetic epilogue (somehow without counseling or treatment) to return to normal with his family. I think we had to expect them to come for Thanksgiving (because they had a counter in turkey.) Then she shows her temporary home (because which movie seemed to be three days, but it was several months in the book) and her hatchet, which is still in the tree where he left (it didn't happen in the book), showing where he moved the message, so perfectly done: "HOME" (where we really had to believe he carved that it just fits this hatchet? perfect description. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend it to anyone (who hasn't read the book) and just want to watch a movie and no one who has read the book (because they're frustrated and die of death. <br /> < For those who have read the book, leave your imagination in the movie, it is terrible and reduces your thoughts from the book.
