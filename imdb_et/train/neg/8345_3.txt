This film could have been so much better, especially considering the talents. Larenz Tate's idea of ​​Frankie Lymon was not good, especially in a musical performance. She doesn't lip well and her productions are Larenz Tate if she should have been Frankie Lymon. The portrayal of women as a bunch of gold miners has been written around by Hollywood. Obviously, the powers were imposed, but it made the characters just unrealistic. The film was made by Miguel Nunez's idea of ​​Little Richard and Little Richard himself. Lela Rochon is an eye candy, as usual, even in a conservative role. It is too bad that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox were wasted. The whole Frankie Lymon saga was exciting in real life. Too bad this movie was a wasted opportunity.
