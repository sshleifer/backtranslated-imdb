I bought this DVD for $ 1 in Walmart. After I saw it, I can just go back to the store and try to get my money back! The only reason I gave a a 2 and not 1 a movie is that the story is some of the novel story elements, although it really never gets interesting. This movie has everything for theater markets - an extremely low budget, an amateur actor and a liberal dose (60's film). In fact, I don't know if the only reason why the film was made was to make a quick doll AND because someone knew some of the strippers they could use as accessories. The film tells a wacko doctor who wants to transfer his girlfriend's interrupted head into the body of an unsuspecting donor. Most potential donors are skank removers or a model whose only real purpose in the film is to titrate when they remove most of the clothes. However, they keep too much to watch the movie even watching naughty bits and the movie is not terrible enough to be a bad movie fan.
