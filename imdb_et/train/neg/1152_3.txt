I understand what this film was trying to portray. How often old people are ignored and treated like trouble, which means they feel wrong and as their lives are empty. <br /> <br /> I have no problems with this message, but I just feel it could have been transferred in a way that is not so painful to look at. I enjoy a good art film, but if the film becomes too self-conscious (as in this case), the result is often frustrating. Covering a suitably slow-paced person who takes 5 minutes, they try to make a point, but just end up in the audience. <br /> <br /> Female characters are very weak and you just want to tell them to pull it together. This is a movie you feel you should enjoy or appreciate and appreciate your qualities, but I was just too disappointed to ever recommend it to anyone else. This may be a deeper message than other Roger Michell films (for example: 'Notting Hill'), but at least it was a movie you could watch.
