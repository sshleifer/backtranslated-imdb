If you've ever seen a movie by Brian Avenet-Bradley and compare it with the feedback from IMDb, you know that most of the comments and voices are fake. TRUST ME: You are bored! People in the production team write their own feedback (sometimes even admit it). But that's not enough: they also click "no" continuously if there is a negative comment on the movie. That's why negative critics are always placed behind mortgages. <br /> <br /> The film itself is bad, bad, bad: bad performance, bad lighting, bad script, bad end. Believe me now! If not, you will believe me later! <br /> <br /> Brian Avenet-Bradley can be quite a good businessman. Otherwise, it cannot be explained that he finds people who are still financing their films. (Okay, they're cheap, but still.) But as a creative person, he's a complete failure.
