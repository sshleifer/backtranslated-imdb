I looked at this example and I just couldn't find it funny. This may be the first episode. Recently, I understand that ABC is playing a lot of stupid shows today and is going to the station. All characters in this exhibition are pretty bad actors, but even if they were good, the jokes and scripts are pretty terrible and still bring the show down. I would say I believe that this exhibition will be canceled, but seeing how ABC plays the quality of a terrifying show, they may just be because they are average compared to them.
