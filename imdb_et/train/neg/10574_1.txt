Except for the family, this new season is worse than Season One. I can't imagine what they think. As a fan of fear, you can tolerate a lot of gore and frantic chaos, but this series deepens with every trip. I can't imagine how unpleasant it is that the actors and the team have to go to work every day. THE STORY! Is it too much to ask? ATTENTION! How can we give ANNONE the fate of these stories? If we don't occupy, who cares, will they get carved or whatever? Almost every episode ends with a meaningless leasing of blood that goes through a greater shock without any revelation or inferiority, or the reason why we have undergone one hour of bleeding. Even Dante's efforts this season were somewhat disruptive for sexist violence and erred in meaningless conclusion. Ironically, output values ​​and performances tend to be faster, while content is ultimate. I have great hopes for Exec's Garrise VALARIE, which we look at.
