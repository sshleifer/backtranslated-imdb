I think there are some that remember Nicole Eggert from her little girls' days in TV shows like T.J. Hooker, Charles's accusation and who's the boss? You pervert, you! Maybe you remember him from Baywatch when he grew up and got breast implants. It does not matter that you will definitely forget about this anticipated comedy about eating people for foreigners. How did he recognize the alien? Why was an alien hot with peppers and cinnamon? Why didn't an alien eat him? You get the picture. <br /> <br /> Before an alien eats his boyfriend and takes his identity, you'll see him in the body of Alex Meneses. This Mexican / Ukrainian beauty is the only reason to look at this trash. Stop the shower and go to your boyfriend and continue your business.
