It's not really gymnastics; from time to time, replace exercise assemblies and it may be as simple as archery or microbiology or booger-flicking. Instead of any other Rocky / Flashdance derivative that flooded the 80's market, it is the triggering of the conquest of reluctance, making all your personal realities irrelevant - of course, for the sake of love. Ronald Reagan from top to bottom, briefly; so it's in the cinema, it's in detail. Some actors are strange enough to bring things up - especially the interest of love brought to you by someone other than Mr Keanu Reeves, warming Ted; heroine Olivia D'Abo's angry alky-father and big-haired hairdresser is more interesting than a sick mother or her totally inert female-noble / teammates, one of whom seems to be made of porcelain. It's my instinct to be outraged by the comic-relief black boys, but on the other hand they are at least in the movie. But D'Abo does not believe in her inconvenient girl with shtick, and in the absence of other narrative focus, interesting gymnastics is in power; it is just all the bodies that surround, and not just the end result of the big tournaments, but everything is obvious twice.
