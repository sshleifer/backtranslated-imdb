Wow! I am shocked to find out that this is a small world and that we are all connected. What is 88-minute waste. John Dunne put this one sentence much better. "No man is an island." Operation was not bad. The children gave it all they had, but sometimes the thread was so thin that I couldn't follow it, and the only true hero in the movie comes to jail after being tortured by the instrument. I do not know. I just can't get it. Oh well.
