Did I step in or is it a bad smell for Daybreak 1 + 2? God was behind everything? What has God done with Sci-Fi? God is the only answer if you cannot think of a reasonable explanation. In fact, this is just a serial finale problem - they probably couldn't think of sensible explanations for the many big issues raised throughout the series, such as how Kara Thrace returned from a completely new viper, how his old viper and deepened body came to land 2, why Baltar has a head of imagination 6, why 6 is an imaginary Baltar, etc., so that they can explain it to "angels" or simply not explain it at all. <br /> <br /> In the last two episodes, there were enough big holes to fly through Basestar. For example, why does Galactica and his team go on a suicide mission to save one girl (Hera), especially after Adama says she won't save the salvation? Because they found the location of the Cylon base? This is not a good reason to sacrifice a team's life. And how did Anders feel this location? And what was the life of the main characters before the war? It's like they forgot to do it earlier that they threw something at the last minute. <br /> <br /> People who wrote the last two episodes couldn't be the same writers who have created a sensational series so far. It seems that writing a script has taken over the Evangelical Christians to spread the word 'Word'. Forget that trying to hit loose ends in the plot, an important message that the writers wanted to overcome: don't put your faith in technology because it will lead to your destruction; God is your ultimate salvation (good luck if you have a disease that needs medical treatment). <br /> <br /> Imagine in Star Wars series final movie that they say there is no "power" ..., Jedi actually gets his power from Jesus. Then they fly their spaceships to the nearest star and live in the forest with Ewoks. Would this be a good end? No, it wouldn't.
