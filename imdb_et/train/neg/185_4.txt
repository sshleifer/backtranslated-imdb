Five or so good Westerners, who Mann has done, are equal in Hollywood as an ensemble. Even John Ford didn't do that much. Their curious thing is how they are uneven. The Ford My Darling Clementine is worth about two and a half of them. Or at least two. <br /> <br /> Their real hero beyond Manni and Stewart is Chase. Chase is responsible for the excellent Red River. Chase wrote a long way, bending the river and probably others. But none of them are as ready as my dear clementine, but then there are very few movies, west or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Every five of Mann's films have big gaps or it's six, you see. Bend, Far, Man of the West, Man, Fury, Winchester 73 and yep, six, Naked Spur. Each of them has a great scene after a wonderful scene, quite dazzling. At the same time, it is also the Red River, which is still one of the largest Western countries. So perfection is not all. <br /> <br /> But in the Far East there are big big holes. It's mawkish and really only lives when Stewart and Mc Entire are horns. The rest is a real pedestrian, a normal exception from the Mann camera. The Mann camera is a one-man course in cinematography. It's almost as good as someone who ever moved behind the film strip. It's almost never the wrong place, never. Far Country has one amazing moment. And as usual, comes from Stewart. No one in the history of the cinema received a physical punishment with the authority of that person. He is absolutely amazing: look at him Bend, Far, Winchester and Laramie's man: Bend is beaten and hangs so reliably with a thread and he looks like someone who moved around Dachau, Far's. is struck by such violence, it seems so convincing that you win, and of course, when it is dragged through the fire of man, you will find yourself in search of the brands. What an actor. Not to mention the moment in Winchester when he was beaten up early in the hotel room, just as anyone ever did. But it was Mann's territory: see Gary Cooper, who fights Jack Lord with West of Man. So painful as any fight ever registered. Although Cooper is not as convincing as Stewart, he is somehow exhausted at the end of his equal struggle. In a nutshell, somebody, but no one, but no one has ever shown a person in the extremity or Mann. <br /> <br /> What a great manager. <br /> <br /> Look at every western part he has ever done. They are his real monuments, even if they are all mottled. But what then. When he roars with his big scenes, they are as good as anyone, including Ford. And his six westerns as a band are the best that everyone has made, the period. Thank you, Anthony.
