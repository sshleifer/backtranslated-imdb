I've seen some bad movies (Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but this movie is so terrible, so THESE that I got around halfway and couldn't watch the rest. Damage. Dear talents like Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall, and the story of John Grisham that went wrong? Branagh is a great lawyer with one night in the evening with Davitz. His father (Duvall) is a psychopath who hung his cat, etc., so he sent a nuthouse to Branagh and he flees immediately. Somehow (I couldn't figure it out) Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen, and Tom Berenger are a mixed story that moves slower than stationary. I wanted to do this and, being a huge Grisham fan, read this movie and I (foolishly) waited for something interesting. This is a honest WORST movie I've seen so far and I wish I could get my money back. * at the end *****.
