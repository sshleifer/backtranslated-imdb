My 7-year-old daughter loved the way Disney was supposed to die. This is a problem with the "breasts". It is a strictly accompanying children's film that is full of carefully calculated cuteness, a couple of politically correct morals and enough potty humor to avoid the terrible G rating. As a parent or even a 10-year-old, you've seen it and done better before. Think of the "101 Dalmatians alone" and you get a general idea. I think a good children's story is a good story, a period. "Air Buddies", which are about the same as recycled paper, do not meet this standard. This is not the worst video your child can watch, but the better are the megatons.
