This film is a waste of time, the plot is terrible, dialogue is terrible. <br /> <br /> Actress is OK, but participants don't have any plot or script. Also photography and some special effects are OK, but again, there is nothing interesting to watch in this movie. The story is not logically advanced, the story is completely pointless. It's not even scary. There must be at least a small element of credibility to make the film scary. This movie is not at all plausible. <br /> <br /> There are only three characters in the movie. Each character is low and has no personality. <br /> <br /> Most special effects and works are both badly done and the most mediocre. <br /> <br /> I hope you read it and don't waste that movie if you are curious to see a totally terrible movie.
