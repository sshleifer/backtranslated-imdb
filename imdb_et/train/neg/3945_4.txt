My name is modest is a low budget film that talks about the origin of Modesty Blaise. It's not that the movie is terrible, it's not just what I expected or hoped for. Although I have been aware of Modesty Blaise's character for years, I am not too familiar with cartoons or graphic novels, so I'm going to this movie as an outsider. This may be part of the cause of disappointment. I was expecting more action and comedy. The film is dialogue-based. I think I was looking for something a little more for the value of the camp. My name is modest is a deadly serious film. There are very few, if any, "mild" moments. At least Alexandra Staden's actions are acceptable, but nothing outstanding. As others have commented, it seems that he is not completely credible in the title role. What are the modest actions in my name is one of the weakest points in movies. I never bought this notion so that this woman could behave as a trained killer. <br /> <br /> I really hope that Quentin Tarantino will go ahead and rumor a big budget movie based on the character of Modesty Blaise. I am convinced that this concept has many possibilities and I look forward to it.
