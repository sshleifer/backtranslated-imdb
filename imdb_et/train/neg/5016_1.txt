Nick Stahl, a young cast and VHS attractive coat named me to buy and watch this flick, waiting for me to see a good service movie. What the hell! The clich√©s' full scenario, dialogues and performances are terrible, terrible, very bad, terrible, terrible? summarizing, wasting time. Fear, black humor, just an absolutely boring story, with points of shameful plots. The film starts with six characters, indeed three pairs together, like a group of friends, but really disgusting people who seem to be enemies, playing a ridiculous pointless game "Taboo" and each of them writes yes or no. some taboo issues. It is that characters have not been developed before, the viewer does not know who they are, their motives and relationships. Then one year later the ellipse and the same group gather together at the New Year's Eve, insulting each other very badly. But the plot and the twists are both ridiculous, predictable, mediocre and unbelievable, which does not deserve an additional line in my review. Just one tip: don't waste your time or money on this garbage, you will definitely regret it. My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Taboo? Jogando Com o Assassino" ("Taboo plays with the killer")
