The problem with the book "The Memories of Geisha" is that it had Japanese surfaces, but under the surfaces it was the mindset of the American man. Reading a book is like looking at great music, sets and costumes for the great ballets that these suits are dressed in, so far from the Japanese mindsets were the characters. <br /> <br /> There is no movie from Japan or a real geisha. This is the story of some of America's erroneous ideas of Japanese and gay men who have been filtered through their ignorance and misconceptions. What is this movie if it's not from Japan or geisha? Is it pure fantasy as so many people have said? Yeah, but why do it make American fantasy? <br /> <br /> There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture with no Puritan hangings, no signs of sins from sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is this movie processed in sex? Right. As it was dirty. The closest thing to the film's sexual scene is the wrinkle of Sayur's nose and the five seconds of the man who tries to install him has dropped a few cockroaches. <br /> <br /> Does anyone really have sex in this movie? No. One character has said it is buggy, but all we see is displacing his lover because he doesn't seem to want anything dirty. Such typical American puritanism is not in place in the Japanese geisha film. <br /> <br /> Did Sayur have an old bunch who after his cherry was auctioned? No. It is located there like a piece of cold meat on a cutting block. Of course he should not enjoy it. And that's what I mean about this movie. Why couldn't they enjoy anything for him? Why must all the sex be sinful and wrong? <br /> <br /> Behind Mameha was the secret patron of the chairman Sayur and he was behind his innocence auction. He could have auctioned and he himself won. Nobu didn't even offer. So why did the chairman promise that the old old man would win him and smell the old people so he could get his fingers all over his naked body? Does a woman really forgive someone for this? <br /> <br /> Let's try to understand this. Behind Mameha, the chairman owed Sayuri a debt for geisha training. For debt recovery, chairman Sayuri sold to Crab. Through Mameha, President Sayur sold sexual favors to this old geezer so the chairman could get his money out. The chairman was not his patron. She was her pimp! Romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is proud, but it's like a very attractive, appealing transvestite whose voice, appearance and touch are exciting. But under this very feminine surface there is a malicious secret. Under the improper Japanese surface, the film's mysterious secret is that the heart, soul, spirit and core of this film are entirely American and male. It is not the best thing to try to be wrong, distortion and terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some contrasts between Japan and MOAG: <br /> <br /> Japanese style ?? Refined, elegant simplicity. MOAG Style? Beijing Opera. Japanese geisha? The hair swept up. MOAG geisha ?? Loose hair, which must be all pastry made of white, thick, thick paste. <br /> <br /> Japanese Shaved Ice - The Japanese are quite strict on seasonal observations. Shaved ice is strictly in the summer. MOAG Shaved Ice - Chairman buys Chiyo, a young Sayuri who plays the wonderful Suzuka Ohgo, it's cherry blossom. The thought made my whole body cool by shaking. <br /> <br /> Japanese Geisha ?? Trained and experienced entertainers. MOAG geisha - sluts. The Japanese wind is ringing - used in the summer because the sound of it is heard, the Japanese people feel somehow cooler. MOAG Windshield - Doorbell! When a person stood in front of another house and was dealing with the wind of noise, they are considered crazy, not an entrance. <br /> <br /> Japan? Emphasis on human relationships, group-oriented. MOAG ?? "I want life that is my" American individualism. <br /> <br /> Japanese Traditional Dance? Refined elegance. Almost geometric and mechanical precision. MOAG DANCE? Martha Graham strikes out of the LSD, but was wearing a rather unattractive white Japanese funeral cover. Performs a geisha ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? Ha ha ha! Is the striptease club where they did most of their geisha surveys? <br /> <br /> Japanese House Fire? Turning off or even firing a fire is worse than murder, because it represents such a great threat to the community. Fires can cut through the villages, towns and cities that destroy hundreds or thousands of homes and kill so many people. MOAG House Fire - A great addition to the fight, but there are baselines and as it is no longer needed, admire the fire out of control. Technically, the film finished here because at least Sayuri would have been forced and joined by his sister who had never heard of it. Which is where Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall should be printed. <br /> <br /> Enough. The film smells.
