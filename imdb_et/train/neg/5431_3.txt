It's your typical Priyadarshan movie - a number of red signs that are out of a silly mission. The culmination of his signature has all the film that has come together and fights for the hidden money in some madness moshpitis. Has it won a lottery ticket in Malamaal Weekly, black money in Hera Pher, "homecoming" Phir Hera Pher and others. Etc., the director becomes ridiculously predictable. Don't do me wrong; like a clich√© and unpleasant films, I finally like comedy. However, most of his previous films have had good humor (Hungama and Hera Pheri are remarkable). Now the fun of his films is getting worse as he uses the same formula over and over again. <br /> <br /> Songs are good. Tanushree Datta looks awesome. Rajpal Yadav is irritating and Tusshar is not much better. When Khemu is OK and Sharman Joshi is the best.
