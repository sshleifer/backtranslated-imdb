Without reading a novel, I can't say how faithful this film is. The story is a typical mystery material: the killer is aimed at young couples; The female investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal disease. Yes, it sounds like a soap opera and that's how it plays. The first two thirds are boring, except for murders, and the last 1/3 makes a partial return as it speeds up its complex conclusion. <br /> <br /> Action is strictly sub-standard, although it is difficult to blame only the actors: the scenario is cruel. In the last 1/3 you stop noticing because the movie actually becomes interesting, but it's only the last 1/3. Director Russell Mulcahy is very much his element, but he has only as much as he can do with the budget of the TV and the network censors. He is confined to fast-cutting and distorted lenses, though he managed to capture a couple of "under the floor" during the murders of the club's lounge. Unfortunately, because it is made for a television, there is no more extensive detail that it uses with a wider picture but not. Note to manufacturers: Give this person a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when you hire him. <br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is bad for cinema standards and mediocre television standards (see CSI). If you are in the mood for such a movie, I have some great suggestions: pick up Dario Argento's "Deep Red" (my highest recommendation; a great movie), "Opera" or even a "Tenebre" copy. They are stronger in every category.
