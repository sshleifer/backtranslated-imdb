I got this DVD well over 2 years ago and I decided to check it out yesterday. I don't know why he took me as long as I like to show the inspector widget and even the new gadget and gadget. Although it may have a bright colored pallet and all the technical complexities of a modern animated film, some of the old things have disappeared, putting this gadget down into the toilet. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the classic inspector widget theme song and music is completely missing. The composer tries to compromise when he makes a score that sounds similar, but it is still not good enough. The gadget mobile is now a talking car, not a car that can become a van. Plus it looks much smarter and the rounder instead is the usual cool. Penny no longer has his computer book and he and Brain hardly have a look at all. <br /> <br /> No piece of land. There's something about the transformation formula and Doctor Claw, who used to never have shown evil, but that's all I have. What a short / giant Italian guy I never know. It had nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> And if the title is something he should go to, his last case is in no way put together. And he's staying Christmas, so why is it called the "last case" is also a mystery. <br /> <br /> I wasn't impressed at all. This is a great animation show that has a strange lack of DVD, but don't let it buy any inspector gadget DVDs. I sold it just a few seconds after I finally looked at it. No child likes it and doesn't appreciate it and no old show fan can withstand it.
