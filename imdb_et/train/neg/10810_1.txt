There is only one thing I have to say about this film - a scene where Shaq is in a musical number with Francis Capra's character, that he wants to be a gene; never see this movie. The story is terrible, acting is terrible (c'mon, that's Shaq!) And I see Capra in Free Willy (equally terrible) twice before seeing the movie.
