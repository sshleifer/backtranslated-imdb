Nonsense, ignorant, misunderstood, career killing (where are talented Angela Jones?), Deeply Failed Garbage. No wonder Reb Braddock has done nothing else - anyone who has the opportunity to make his own film based on his own script using Quentin Tarantino himself and creates something like this, someone who feels it was a story worthy of to speak to the world, it does not deserve another break. In these circumstances, the performances are good - the actors do what they have done and they do it well. It's just that they shouldn't have done it first. <br /> <br /> 0 of 4.
