I can't believe those who praise this movie don't think about another movie. I was ready to make it terrible, but the script (or lack of it) makes the movie meaningless. On the plus side, the overall level of actresses and technical team crafts is quite competent, but if you have an ear in the ear, you can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should adhere to all the other films he has brought. Dorothy S fans should stay on Galaxina. Peter B fans should stay on top of the last picture and target. The fans of a cheap woman laugh at the expense of those who seem to have asked them to remain in Peter's amazingly terrifying book, the Unicorn.
