If I could give this film a real rating, it would probably be in negative numbers. While I respect the fact that someone has to take these terrible "horror films" seriously, people, buying a ticket for this movie is a waste of money that you could spend a lot more valuable time on. <br /> <br /> Despite being a horror movie, nothing is scary, unless the idea is to see how much horror you can get into one movie. Had the rating been higher, it would probably have made a better film for a long time. <br /> <br /> Who made this "Prom Night" version, you twisted. Participants would probably have done a decent job if it were not questionable scripting. It was a terrible waste of cinema. I'd go before and look again at "One Missed Call", at least with one that had a plot.
