The worst movie I've seen at Ginger in the afternoon. I think it's horror / comedy. I predicted quite a bit of every scene in this movie. Special effects were not so special. I believe I could come up with the good effects I have around the house. I wish I could say something good about this movie, but I'm afraid I won't. Even Coolio should be ashamed of such turkey. After a little thought I have one thing to say about this movie - it ended.
