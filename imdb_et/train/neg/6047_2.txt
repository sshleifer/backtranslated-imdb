What made the work of the French community so good was the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). In this catastrophe led by Frankenheimer (who brought us such gems as Raindeer Games and Dr Moreau Island), the film focuses on Doyle and his unique obsession with Charnier (Rey). The fictional idea that NYPD would allow Doyle to travel to Marseille to find Charnier with the help of French local authorities is ridiculous. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Charnier didn't leave the city with 65 pounds of clean smell !!! The street value is 32 million, but yes, we send Doyle to find this man, it was his face. Please !!! The story was weak. The act was terrible (a single exception from Hackman, who played his part completely). The direction was all over. Even between the sections, the scenes were terrible. Make your preference and check the first installment twice and skip it.
