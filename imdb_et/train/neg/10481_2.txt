The film is badly cast, except for some familiar old Hollywood names. Other appearances with unknown names (i.e., Jennifer Gabrielle) are unlikely. I've seen other movies in this movie, unfortunately it's one of his worst. Maybe this is a reflection of the scenario? <br /> <br /> In a positive note, Kim Bassinger and Pat Morita recorded the results of the movie's oblivion. But I enjoyed more in Karate Kid. There are many good movies to see and, in short, it's not one of them. Save your money and celluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
