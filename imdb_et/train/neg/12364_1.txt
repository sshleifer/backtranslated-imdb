God, I'm so sick of coming out of America, called "Cartoons"! <br /> <br /> As the anime became popular, US animators produce a drawing with a 5-year lazy-ass drawing style (Kappa Mikey) or a Japanese animation. (Usually the classic characters are interfering) It is no wonder that the anime kicks American cartoons! <br /> <br /> They are no longer trying! <br /> <br /> I heard about it last night; I live in the UK and when I first got this show, it appeared in 2005, well, I didn't know that the UK is so up to date with the current exhibitions.
