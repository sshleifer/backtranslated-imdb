William Shatner is acceptable in low doses. Unfortunately, instead of leaving your character under a slight irritation and moderately amusing in it, it is suitable for expanding and exerting its role. Just like the original Star Trek series. I think I never understand American humor, which often goes from "top" to get the message through. I'm voting with my feet. I no longer see an example that is ashamed because the rest was good. It is a pity that the surplus role of Shatner also affects James Spader's action. But most show how society is going, I think. I'm not driving on the same routes. Frank
