A woman (Miriam Hopkins as Virginia) drives to Man (Joel McCrea as Kenneth) father (Charles Winninger as B.J.). A woman wants a person to invest in a deceased mother's money for a business; but the father has lost money in the notorious scheme. Nobody knows a little, but real evil schemes are the best friends of Man to steal his fortune ... <br /> <br /> Production looks interesting, but the story doesn't. Players did not play well drunk. Noteworthy is Broderick Crawford's first appearance - the gopher "Hunk"; Mr. Crawford gets to the floor of Mr McCrea, except for the job. <br /> <br /> Female Chases Man (4/28/37) John G. Blystone ~ Miriam Hopkins, Joel McCrea, Charles Winninger, Broderick Crawford
