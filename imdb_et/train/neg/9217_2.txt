Yes, the only thing this movie is memorable is that he played with young Tom Hanks, who would be a Hollywood star just a few years later. However, there is no movie here that shows much of its talent at all, and the only other thing that could be considered a bit of entertainment for this flick is the scene where he thinks he sees monsters and runs the guy through. Yes, this film is about playing games that makes people in the group use their imagination and try to find interesting scenarios. Basically, after school type special about evil game Dungeons and Dragons cleverly returned here at Mazes and Monsters. Apparently, the filmmakers thought the nerds should not have any fun if they were going to go and do minor drinking, drugs that have a lot of unprotected sex and harass other weaker children, like all popular children. No, these bad people played a game that really needed a brain there, no sky! Not that if they have the brain, they can actually think for themselves and certain groups should not wash them temporarily. Yes, I think this movie is completely stupid and a waste of time. In this case, it may be a film against drug addiction, but there are many fewer people who died in Dungeons and Dragons far from their existence than to say what the drivers are like.
