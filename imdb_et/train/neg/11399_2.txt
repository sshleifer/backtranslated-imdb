I can't believe I wasted 80 minutes of my life watching this terrible movie that I hoped would eventually get better, but the boy was wrong. The plot was exhausting, the operation was extremely bad and the special effects were terrible. Not even 2 beautiful girls could revive my boredom and bloody confusion. But I can't lie, some of the features of this movie were quite memorable, such as when an Asian boy says "I lost virginity to the babysitter so f **** stereotypes" <br /> <br /> please don't waste your time with this crash unless u are ready or want to laugh good ... maybe you can watch this movie with some guys
