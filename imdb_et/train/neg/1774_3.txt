Ok, I saw this movie for the first time at 9:00 am Cinemax a couple of weeks ago and thought it would be a prize, boy I had 180d of it. This movie is great. I mean, the mother of the monsters shows their true form only at the end of the movie. I'm going to "That's it? Why doesn't he show it in a little bit earlier in the movie." The plot is the mother and son in the blood of young women. Wouldn't it be better if they just went on, you know, smiles are killing like a couple of young women, then it's a sheriff or policeman to find out and get into the old bread, how to kill monsters, save a young woman / women and you have 1 or 2 people? I think it would be much better. It also sucks because the son is the main character and is killed first. Why not get rid of my mother first? In addition, how does he have the strength at the end of the film when he starts killing people? He said he was too weak. What the hell was Stephen wrong this time? I can never, ever affect a film by any actor, they all try. If it wasn't a good actor, I would have given this movie 1/10. 3/10.
