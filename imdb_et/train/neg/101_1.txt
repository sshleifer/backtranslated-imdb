Amateur, no budget movie might be surprisingly good ... it's not one of them. Ah, another Brad Sykes cruelty. Action is outrageous, except Emmy Smith, who shows no promise. The camera's "direction" needs serious reprocessing. And no longer "keep the camera and start" tricks; it just doesn't work. Special effects are unimaginable, there is a problem if the effect can be detected in real time. If you intend to cut your ear, don't let us see the actress's actual ear in the blood. The landscape is boring and boring (the same as Mr Sykes's other ventures), and music is a junction between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar metals (see landscape comment). <br /> <br /> Did I mention the absence of any real plot or character development? Probably not a scriptwriter. <br /> <br /> Who will finance this man ... please stop. I've seen some of his other "home films" (which I don't combine) and they're just as bad. Usually "Director" grows and learns from his earlier efforts ... not this man. It's one thing to be an amateur movie, but everyone can be hacking. <br /> <br /> It is definitely not a popcorn movie ... of course chewing in popcorn kernels would be less painful than that. /> <br /> Prize: The worst military thrust of the movie.
