I think it's possible that I've seen the worse movies, but that's a real smell! The plot is unobtrusive, but it is not the worst. Leadership is not where you go what you expect from Andy Ching. he is able to do a good job but was unable to pull the film together. <br /> <br /> Angie's harmonious playing with a female leader as a reporter who steps behind the presidential murder has really helped her. there was no chemistry good, his behavior was flat, and the wood and the 5-inch studs he wore throughout the film were absurd. this harmonious outing puts him firmly at the bottom of the "b" list. <br /> <br /> And what was Cuba's good thinking? he has to perform several outstanding shows on his credit, but it was far from what we had been waiting for him. <br /> <br /> Poor james forests and burt reynolds. poor poor poor poor.
