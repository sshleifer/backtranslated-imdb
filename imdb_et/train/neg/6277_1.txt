this movie really strives hard. If you intend to make a horror movie, at least give reason to believe in the viewer's engagement. <br /> <br /> You are waiting and waiting for a movie that is waiting for a great explanation, but it is not. Instead, it tries to be too smart and not to reveal anything. <br /> <br /> What was the idea of ​​the movie? where is it actually going? and more importantly what hell was going on. . . <br /> <br /> Why were they there and how does it relate to something? just one weak sci-fi horror. I love counterfeit comments from IMDb, saying how big a movie is with the related press releases (whether it or people have a low horizon). it's not worth 2 hours at all. <br /> <br /> I am not saying that the film is better than fragile, but at least what gave you reasoning and why things happened and that has a final result. it is not and it is just a wafer with lots of paddings to make everything scary. this film is about as small as a foreign speech. God, who was also flat. <br /> <br /> A great tip if you intend to do horror, make it credible with justification and explain to the viewer what's going on, so they have their own story. because if there is no justification or credibility, there is no firm confirmation and it cannot be scary. no disrespect to cast or team members because they did a good job. it's just poor writing.
