This is the worst thing a TMNT franchise has ever been born. I was a child when it came out and I thought it was still, even though I liked the original comic. <br /> <br /> This is one scene I remember when a mafia-ape boy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are. It's cruel. Many fans hate a series of female turtles, but it didn't bother me. So much that I didn't even remember him before I read about the show recently. All in all, it is unfortunate to forget. The only okay was the theme song. Innocent pleasure, they call it ... Nananana ninja ...
