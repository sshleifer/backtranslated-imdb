one of the worst films I've ever seen. Pathetic action scene and really bad acting also doesn't help. The only good point is the parts of Gary busey, but it doesn't raise the movie very much. it lives up to the B-movie leaderboard and passes the test with flying colors. A waste of my money, though I found it fun when I started to upset some clock. I don't recommend this movie if you look at it for free or as a gift. (a gift that you can ask for from the receipt and send it back for full support). <br /> <br /> Really BAd. <br /> <br /> 1/10.
