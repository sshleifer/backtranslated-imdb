Frankly, I knew what to expect before I watch this movie, and I have to say that this is the worst thing I've ever seen. It has its moments and comedy at a level that is very fun, but I'm afraid it's not scary, and stupidity will be taken to a new level. There are many unnecessary holes and the plot is all over the place. I have no idea why foreigners were evil, and why they even came to this remote part of Wales, (I mean, who went anyway?), But I didn't care about that moment because the costumes were fun and bad CGI. As for B-films, it deserves the title "being so bad, good" and worshiping the filmmakers because they knew what they were doing. These movies can go on long .....
