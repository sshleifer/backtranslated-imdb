I look behind me to watch this movie all the time because it was really painful. Impossible painter will be a fully capable blow? This film was full of absurdities, which, when I mentioned them, I would give the film away. Norm Peterson, or George Wendt, really must have agreed on this movie. Operation was unfortunate and the story was even worse. As a rational and rational individual, I did not understand where the writer came from or where he went to the film. Every main character had a failure, had unhappy and ridiculous events, then the movie ended. One absurd act after another dialogue does not make the film, but does the wreck of the train.
