Your mind is not satisfied that it is not a thriller of budget prejudices; but pray who wants? A young couple spends the real end of the world in a hidden laboratory of an alien who disguises the people of a church. <br /> <br /> A small _cocalyptic themed outing, THE END OF THE WORLD is inventive and there is a lack of both brio and style for purely 50's similar films. And it's not just that, but EOTW plays like a hybrid, not just a doomsday, but also a monastery slip. The film villain is a well-known character actress. <br /> <br /> This totally shameless blow seems to be the exploitation of the monastery, a remarkable genre of the 70s, which nowadays seems so obsolete. Anyway, the monastery's secret lab is some nasty piece of futuristic deco! Christopher Lee is the end of the world; but the end of the world is not his pride!
