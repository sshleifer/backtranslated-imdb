I usually only comment on the movies I like, "noting" to everyone's taste, but here I want to make an exception. The premise of this movie, which seems to be confused, is that these two self-centered adults have the right to go to Las Vegas , drunk, marry, and cause computational suffering for their respective species, children, even if they allow a culturally sanctioned inebriation, they have no courage or responsibility to wake up and cancel what they have moved the next morning. Hell with all the others The fact that things "work in the end" is not really a point, in fact it is quite irrelevant The thing is that this movie changes the light and thereby strengthens that for others, especially if they is young, and especially when they are addicted, it is disrespectful. There are many more harmful behaviors that these "parents" could have done, what would be in the heartbeat he made his army of social workers with his head.
