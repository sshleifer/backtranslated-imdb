What a load of garbage .. I can't even describe how terrible this movie was. The assessment he has here is really hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... Especially if you liked the first ginger clicks. The first was a well-written, well-managed, well-executed .. fantastic aesthetic and atmospheric brilliant film. The second was "alrite" - decent as an independent film, but obviously not to the first level. The third is the series offense, the period. I appreciate movies: 10, 6, 1. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, and yes, it's actually in the past, sisters are still Ginger and B Fitzgerald. a bit of American mythical mythology. Nurses do not have a real story or progress or even a clear relationship ... They are just trying to survive and be "forever". It's as deep as it gets. <br /> <br /> Split that girls agreed to read this script in this heap. <br /> <br /> Oh and the other thing, staging action was terrible - people who appeared regularly like girls turned around and there is a complicated candlelight place where a mysterious native American woman just sits there and speaks . The kits were terrible, didn't get away from the fact that it was obviously a set that didn't really help. In addition, the camp consistently had snow, but not inside the trace (..). <br /> <br /> Arrghh ,,, so bad! I really hoped it would be at least as good as the other.
