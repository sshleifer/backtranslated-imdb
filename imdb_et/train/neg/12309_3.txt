It was a disappointing film. Given the material --- army life is always good to laugh --- and stars, this movie should have been falling. At best, it was worth a couple of women. Steve Martin has been a lot more fun than this and it seems that Dan Ackroyd should remain in dramatic roles where he can follow Robin Williams' leadership and never win an Oscar.
