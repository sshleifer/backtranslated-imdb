This adaptation exerts a positive flesh on the classics that are loved for this fineness. Timothy Dalton has no concept of the different nuances of Rochester's character. I feel like he has never read a book, just tried to put his too tight knees together and was given a summary that read "Grumpy, broody, murky past." She plays Rochester not as a character or a real one, but an overflow, who never smiles with a smile before she does when she admires a panic. No chemistry. The only feeling that this adaptation was fascinating and unbelieving in me, and compassion for Charlotte Bronte, who certainly turns to his grave. Go and see the book. ROCHESTER IS PERSONAL. AND PLEASE NOTE: "PASSIONATE" LOVE SCENE IS NOT BIRTHDAY.
