I don't see enough TV to understand the attractiveness of SHOW ME THE MONEY, but I think he has some desires for unwanted audiences. Obviously, the quiz offers a huge amount of money for competitors to answer some simple questions. However, its quiz elements are only a small part of the procedure that I find difficult. For example, before answering a question, a competitor chooses which question will be asked from random "A", "B" or "C" options. Does it serve any purpose other than slowing down the game? It would be much faster to just start with "A." Competitors may pass on questions but must answer one of three questions in each category. <br /> <br /> After answering the question, the competitor is asked to "lock" the answer - another delaying tactic. The next challenge for a competitor is to identify a woman in about twelve go-go dancers who need to introduce a card that shows how much the issue is worth. The correct answer adds a dollar figure to the current set of the competitor; wrong answer separates the same amount. This time-consuming step is actually somewhat entertaining, as it allows the audience to explore the little clad and evenly proud dancers. In the meantime, the participant is reminded that the "killer card" failed option will stop the game immediately. This will naturally change the competitor's sweat and cause further delays, as the nervous competitor will consider the unexpected loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. My suspicion is that the possibility of a sudden disaster is the main audience of the exhibition. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, many empty catchers are slowing down the entire process between host William Shatner and the competitor, with occasional routine dancers. All of these delays burn so much time that viewers can forget what the initial question is when the right answer will appear. <br /> <br /> A typical JEOPARDY 30-minute episode often passes through 60 questions. The first 30 minutes of the SMTM I watched were just six questions (many of which affected other TV shows). Nobody at their best will not see this example because it is fun to play by answering questions at home. This leaves three possible reasons for the exhibition. <br /> <br /> A. To see how a competitor reacts to win as much as one million dollars, it all loses in just one move. <br /> <br /> B. Look at the beautiful young women who perform sexually recommended dance rides. <br /> <br /> To enjoy William Shatner's glowing torture. <br /> <br /> My choice is "B", but women are not long enough in the camera to justify suffering within one hour.
