... but I'm sorry. Since the IMDb ratings are relatively high (and they have to be relatively high on Netflix), I think I put it in order because it is advertised gently by the UK as a comedy that has produced a lot of movies that were enormous. "Maintaining Grace", by contrast, belongs to the category of ridiculous comedies usually populated by Hollywood films produced and run by talentless. Brenda Blethyn is a capable actor and I liked it in other movies. The concept - a gardener who grows marijuana to overcome death when he finds himself after the death of his wife - does not hurt me. Despite the fact that molded fabrics make a sense of humor, the film falls on its face (falling on its ass can be funny) as far as I and my wife were. Be careful, oh gentle reader, not all successful British comedies succeed. It's a guy.
