When a friend gave me "12 Amazing Scifi / Horror Movies!" I was reasonably cautious. But because the item was a gift, I really didn't pay close attention to my common sense. After all ... movies for free! What if they are small. After much consideration, Alien Intruder was the first of these films. Ironically, it was the first choice because it seemed to be the best in the bunch. All I can say is that if it is the best of them, I despise the rest. <br /> <br /> It had good things on the surface. Four (read em!) Actresses I knew. Billy Dee Williams, Tracy Scoggins, Maxwell Caulfield, and Jeff Conaway. I said to myself ... "Billy and Tracy have been in some good sci (according to Star Wars and Babylon 5) that they do not write to turkey, Max is a veteran of soap art who could never penetrate the film .... but not too dirty actor Jeff .... well ... he's done good and bad movies and a TV. I soon discovered that Jeff had decided to add his "ugly" to his movie repertoire. <br /> <br /> The first clue was in opening scenes. mugs your way through the "I Crazy" scene before I finally kill myself. Funny camouflage, really. Unfortunately, this is a movie without much exaggeration. Then it goes downhill. <br /> <br /> Next we have a mission commander (Williams ) who are sent out to see what happened to Jeff and his team who chose their new crew as a criminal element, but this assortment is not so dirty a decade - more like a persuasive foursome. Plus, one of those fine mechanisms, a computer hacker, appears in his cell that works Isn't that a bit like a slammer in a murderer? Pretty flat prison when you ask me. <br /> <br /> When they finally impact, they are really terrible. The model of spacecraft seems to have been knocked in the afternoon by some 8-year-old eternities left over from their Airfix kits. <br /> <br /> But horror doesn't end. While on the route to the area where Jeff's ship disappeared, the criminal team is punished for their good behavior when they are given a virtual reality on weekends in which they gave their male fantasies. Everything good and good and the use of scenes from these fantasies is the introduction to "Alien Menace" that will appear there. But did they have to drag it for sooooo? Alien Intruder? Alien Boring, more similar. <br /> <br /> Finally, they make the G-sector and the presence of an alien makes them fight against each other for his feelings until only good old Max is left. The end, a genuinely optimistic garbage film, convinced the sequel - as if! The appearance of this movie is also a sign I called "Sweatdroid". She should be an android, but apparently this fact disappeared from the make-up team who gave her sweaty features every time. But don't worry, he's just there to make a number of body numbers at the end. <br /> <br /> Williams and Scoggins, in order to be true, make very little in the movie. They just stayed awake, not to mention. And as I mentioned earlier, Jeff gets to the shower early, so his manicure won't let much of the film light up. Max is trying his best, just like a few other majority members, but the film is honest, just honest. <br /> <br /> The only semi-imaginary thing this movie offers is the ship naming convention. They are all named after musicians - Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the movie is boring and uninspired. <br /> <br /> Made in 1992, I thought it was one of the 80 direct-video works at the initial viewing. They still seem to have made crap movies in the 90s. <br /> <br /> It's best to avoid it. Even if the cuffs of the film are a movie, this movie is smelly, but at least you can send it quickly.
