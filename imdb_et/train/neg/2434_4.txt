Realistic film, definitely, except the fact that the characters don't seem scared. When Billy Zane tries to kill someone, he feels bad ... but he doesn't look. That's why I don't like the performance of this movie. Tom Berenger plays the soldiers again. No excitement, no realistic sequences. Not always shooting, this is one big thing. Well filmed. I hate a helicopter sequence, causing only one terrorist to kill a single terrorist ... I'll give him ** and half *****
