My wife and I look at movies every evening without disturbing and mostly thinking about art films. I have a lot of patience for films that are slowly blossoming. My husband has twice as much attention. All this has been said - this movie is just empty and BAD! It went somewhere. Never flourished. It started with a pretty strong promising plot ... then he bakes cookies ... goes to Spain .... he closes, he looks .... credit roll. Uneven, full of holes, wrong start and dead ends. We FFs through several extended sequences that just look into space. The artificial depth was indirect when he played and shouted the mud. Zzzz ...... It's like a beautifully shot chick-flick that pretends to be deep or artistic. You don't know or know Morvern at all. About halfway through you just don't care anymore. We just wanted to see at least one plot line. Don't waste your time with it. I am shocked that it is so high.
