When it is not possible to post a 1-mark mark, I watched this scent and hardly looked at what I was looking at. Every part of the movie was terrible. Music, Dancing, Direction, Story, Everything, Just Everything. I found myself out loud at different points in the movie. I especially loved a little where our hero moves through the hospital's soft focus in slow motion, and hitting the clipboard from the nurses because ............. well. Just because. Product Placement? Crucifixs (Crosses?) Everywhere. If you are a Christian persuasion and very easily satisfied, you may like this movie. If you like this movie, you really need to come out.
