The extremely thin plot of "Satanic Rituals" or any such mumbo-jumbo gives you a hokey excuse to integrate a lot of sexual scenes. Direct vanilla sex, masturbation, lesbianism, S&M, emotionality, incest, and some other impulses of sexual spread will take time here. The problem is that the story is so boring that the restraining sexuality becomes quite annoying for some time. Who knew that meeting an intimate goat / girl can be so fucking boring? Well now I do. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Venezia Hidalgo shows everyone; Helga Line offers R & D (both often displayed); Female viewers get a random penis. <br /> <br /> My Class: D + <br /> <br /> DVD 1 Pickups: "Pick Up", "Eight Samurai Legend", "Don't Answer the Phone," Prime Evil and " Sister Street Fighter "(the same DVD owns another feature film" Evil Eye ")
