It should first be sure that I have read MANGA and so my ARGUMENT is based on differences. <br /> <br /> This anime is very disappointed because it removed manga and OVA comedy and high quality action. What he left behind was just a crust of what he might have. Many characters lacked manga depth. Alucard is not a sympathetic character that secretly desires death. Walter's story is not a betrayal. And the Nazi enemies who drive the world war are completely absent. Instead, the anime gives Gary Stu to Incognito, who is defeated against what seems to be all odds. <br /> <br /> My primary complaint is not that the anime is different from the manga, but it does such a bad job.
