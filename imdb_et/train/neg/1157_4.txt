Finally, with my close friends, I looked at the tenants who rented the film only on the cover of Snoop Dogg (their passionate fetish). Obviously, I didn't expect much. I thought the movie contains typical Snoop Dogg behavior and images, often seen in clich√© rap videos. But my generalization was mostly wrong. Unfortunately, it didn't make the movie better. <br /> <br /> Most of them would describe the film in a dark drama, while I would describe it as a blindly drawn dull drama. The film speaks of two struggling writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) who are trying to create their own separate masterpieces. Their polar opposing lifestyles are unlikely but very complicated and neurotic friendships. This friendship moves across the film, such as a wild roller skater, most of which is Snoop's character - which resembles someone with a severe personality disorder. And while the film is a drama, Snoop and corporate behavior - which is sick and serious - is more comical than anything else. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to those who get distracted because it has a lot of dialogue and much more dialogue after that. There are some mediocre conflicts, but even they are mostly under dialogue. The end, however, jumped sharply with surprise. It was a little twisted, somewhat unexpected, and a great way to stop the film needed to finish. Looking at the final credit, I couldn't take the picture that the director thought, "Oh God, how the hell I'm going to quit." By the way, the director put in carefully planted tips and nuances that led to the climax - all of which are more visible than Waldo's crowded street, with nothing but black sweaters.
