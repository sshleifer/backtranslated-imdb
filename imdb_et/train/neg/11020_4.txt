First of all ... with names like Fred I am Ray, Brinke Stevens and Jan-Michael Vincent and distributors like "Rhino" and "Troma" in the video field. B movie mania! If you really expect to see the thriller "based on Edgar Allan Poel," forget it and head straight to the excellent series of Roger Corman 60s Poe movies. It is a clean, undamaged butterfly (only for pedestrian experiment "Premature Burying" at a similar plot) with lots of R-rated, video-ready sex and nudity. However, it is definitely fun and fun as it is ... <br /> <br /> Brink (who has the first 30 minutes of naked scenes) plays rich, traumatized, insomniac housewife Victoria Monroe, whose fear is premature. the belief that his father (Hoke Howell) was hit by the same fate. His worthless wife, Terry (Jay Richardson), has been attacking some serious gambling debts (owed by a gangster played by Robert Quarry), and with the help of his kinky, blonde, European-acclaimed sex pot secretary, Lisa (Delia Sheppard) plots to lose Brink for their money. The name-value actor Karen Black, as a hypnotist, falls briefly into a blonde wig (he is too talented to play such an important role), the 50's sci-fi / horror star Robert Clarke plays a doctor and family doctor, and Michael Berryman shows a decent nightmare to leave about living Vick. Jan-Michael Vincent sits mostly outside his car in his car, making goo-goo eyes when Brink enters and leaves home. <br /> <br /> The legacy-a-husband-estate-estate plot has been done a million times before, end up in an unintentional laughing government (ending with Zuni's Fetish Doll segment with a direct breakdown of TERROR TRILOGY) and who created it terribly for release blinded face and decapitated head FX, their sharpening skills a bit. Brinke does a decent job that makes her character somewhat sympathetic, but the biggest surprise is how good the former Penthouse Pet Delia Sheppard is. He stole any scene he had, and gave an easy idea here.
