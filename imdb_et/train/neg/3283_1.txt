OK, we all love the daisy duke, but what's that pain. Let's start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, not one thing in this girl and Daisy wasn't ditzy! Uncle Jesse was probably similar to the original. Burt is not offended, but I didn't notice that Boss HOg is so long. It was part of the Boss Hog humor. Did they even try someone like Danny Devito?!? Okay, now do I get Jessica Simpson to take a look at her husband? He's on the road with Luke Duke !!!!!! Clearly these manufacturers did not look at the appearance of old cast members. The screen t was never duke! It changed the film from the beginning. I'll give it a huge thumb.
