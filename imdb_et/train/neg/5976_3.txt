Rumor is true: girls like COYOTE UGLY more than boys. And the reasons are obvious right after the plot. Jersey girl goes to New York to get a song writer. And after the initial disappointment that there is no luck, some girls are listening to the girls for about $ 300, which they did last night. He gets to the bar where they work and surprise! The place is completely full of "two-year-old babies" who hit the babes in the dance. <br /> <br /> The story is not bad and some characters are pleasing, especially Cammie (the "fashion coordinator" part was lovely) and the revelator, but let's face it, the drama was terrible and completely ridiculous from the start. Violet and her father saw too ridiculous in the movie. And, look, Violet is too broken by this keyboard with a breaker dancer! <br /> <br /> For the first time, I was wondering how could production be so terrible? For a short time in this film, Hollywood can stand on its two feet and show a new low without big public fears, saying, "You were warned!" Instead, COYOTE UGLY seems to have a determined intention to try out the world's biggest backs. Advertise on babes at the bar, but shows a paper thin "resume your dream" story disappointed with every male you targeted! <br /> <br /> And finally, music. No breakthrough music was found in this movie, especially when it was needed (hospital scene). Every scene seemed like a short music video you just wanted to stop until the bar opened. But the climax was the most ridiculous: the 80s-like song that Cyndi Lauper looks forward to playing on stage and Violet jam. Heck, I personally thought Bon Jov would start long hair and jam! <br /> <br /> Other than a really smart camera, dancing (especially in a damp scene) with coyote girls and a couple of cute clich√©s, COYOTE UGLY is something that is just embarrassing. Regardless of whether you watched or did, it looked like a time kill. Or you waste depending on how you look at it.
