I'm probably one of the few who actually read Stephen King's book based on this film. After reading this great work, I couldn't wait to see the version of this movie. After watching the movie, I was completely disappointed. The only thing this movie has in common with the book is the names and names of the characters. The book puts Schwarzenegger's character in the game. The main goal is to survive. But he's not in the arena. He's out of town and has to flee from the game show (I think you're calling them) for the villagers who don't have any similarity to the movie characters. This assumption built a lot of tension and stoppage and ended up largely at the top. The film was an absolute rubbish. There was no cinematic quality. I fully respect actress Arnold Schwarzenegger, but she's confused.
