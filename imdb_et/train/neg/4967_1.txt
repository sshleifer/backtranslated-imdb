SciFi has recently made high-quality films (such as Minotaur or Dog Soldiers) with very bad luck. Grendel should be based on the great epic Beowulf, but it differs so much (and offers so little) that advertisements on television could also call it "some shame on Christopher Lambert's film". I didn't expect it to be as accurate as the inflated Hollywood production, but I assumed that "artistic integrity" didn't interfere with the actual story (even if a little bit changed to make a two-hour storyboard smoothly) in the separated times). <br /> <br /> Did the director and the producer have an idea of ​​what they did (did they investigate any research?). Obviously, it would not have been said that Beowulf and his team (except for the boyfriend) were wearing big horn helmets. One big problem I still had was the appearance of Grendel when Beowulf should wrestle him, should he not have been sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons? Grendel's death segment had no way? in my opinion, the epic was actually better than the junk generated by the script; For example: Grendel should have a hand pulled out of Beowulf. Don't cut the forearm after it has been burned with an explosive arrow that looks like it weighs 300 kg! And Grendel's mother? Did they just connect him at the end of the dragon at the end of the epic, where he finally dies when he comes to his wounds? And honestly, what the hell was that mullet? <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie because it's not connected to the epic ... because there's really no other one (except for the names of characters). The only way to recommend this movie is if you liked the movie Druids (directed by Jacques Dorfmann)? though i don't want to watch.
