It has been a marginal but very pleasant film since the early 1970s. I've seen the original at least 6 times. The 1997 version is a 20-minute crammed movie for 2 hours or whatever the running time is. The Cheesy storyline, by the way, is completely different from the original. The great involvement of the government was far removed. There is no flow from one scene. In the original you can go for a beer or in the bathroom and continue. <br /> <br /> Only a few hours of movie time spent on changing the car to the oil bath. It takes a lot of time longer than in real life. Car guys notice this stuff. The fool or the fools who chose the 1968 recycle bin and the abuse of the 1970 Challenger must also be bored. The fact that they are not "car people" is painfully obvious and their passing is not exhausted. <br /> <br /> The participants didn't feel any emotion, everything was cut and dried. One step above the monotone. Barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, the radio DJ made a statement that Challenger hit bulldozers at 180 or 185 (??). It's a complete garbage. Do you say aerodynamics or lack of it? Hahahaha !! This movie is a joke. Don't waste your time looking at it.
