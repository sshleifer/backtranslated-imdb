Three years ago, Rachel (Therese Fretwell) held a lake with her friends when her brother fell out of bed and drowned. Rachel's friends think it's time for him to stop beating and blame something he didn't control. So grab a brew and chew something back and return to the same lake that has been Rachel's constant nightmare. As expected, bleeding has already started when two friends have sprayed before heading to the party. This flick is a feeling of high school play where everyone forgot their lines and "wings" ... very badly! Writer Marcos Gabriel gave himself a greater role to Rachel's boyfriend Leo. Outside Fretwell and Gabriel, there are some pretty flat actions and some characters you'd like to attack before they get away. Also pay attention to some of the players who had the nerve to appear: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is one MEMORIAL DAY you are missing.
