The only reason I couldn't do this is that Sibrel shows that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a movie. It's a technically skilled film. <br /> <br /> By saying this, it is a movie based on fairly liar lies and distortions. Most documentaries are spent on propaganda techniques based on a space program, not on actual reality. And Sibrel's "indisputable proof" that the landings are forged is easily overturned when you know something about orbital mechanics. Don't let Bart Sibrel benefit from his curiosity.
