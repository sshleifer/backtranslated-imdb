This is Peter Falki's film. Period. <br /> <br /> I was 10 years old when this movie came out; I was filmed at that time. Of course, my parents didn't see this movie when it came out, but I was in love with the typeface and aura of my ads, which it was an important movie. Okay, 34 years later I've seen the movie finally, having ever seen any Cassavets-directed movie. He's generally a cage. Timing, editing zero hour. Gena's presentation reminds me too much of Dustin Hoffman's "Rain Man" stint: technically par, but with one note. When Tom Cruise stole "Rain Man", Falk takes the cake. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed that Gena's performance, really all over - seemed better "Awakenings" (blecch!). It's not all his fault: he's a basketball from the first scene to the last. We'll never know why? But Falk's character seems real, and Falk fills it seriously with a faulty man. <br /> <br /> Shave for at least an hour (editor needed!) And it would have been an arresting portrait of a woman not under the influence, but easy, Cro-Magnon, a man who starts off against a woman who is not working and still can't handle their three children and her husband for a long time. <br /> <br /> I 'll remember Cassavets' "The Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby". He would have been a better director when he managed to tear his tendency - as he shows enough about the film. <br /> <br /> Bob
