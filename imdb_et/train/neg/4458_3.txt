Most French movies I've seen - and enjoyed - were more talked about than action, but that's okay. I found them to be interesting, well-photographed and interesting participants. (But I did wonder at one point whether Gerald Depardieu was ever made on a French film! It seemed so.) <br /> <br /> This movie is just as interesting with visual and good opening. But then it started to talk, talk and talk more ... that is good for drama, but not for the mystery of murder. After a while I was almost asleep looking at it. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie was a game where almost all scenes were played in one room. So if you love to play then you should like it ... but I want a bit more of a bang murder story.
