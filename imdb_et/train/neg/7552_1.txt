Wicker Man has made it impossible! It replaced Cat Woman as the sharpest last movie in my steel trap cinema mind. YES it's really so bad. So bad that when I wrote this review, I thought to myself, "If I had the opportunity to see this movie again or I have red needles in my eyes," I could actually go to the red hot needle. > <br /> LaBute created a rare film where Joel Schumacher can sit and say "Yes, it's the wrong direction right there" with comfort and innocence. <br /> <br /> I think the first clue I should have been on the label line: "Some victims have to be done". Of course, this may seem like a nervous malignant intrigue, but sacrifice is all on the screen. Trust me that those responsible for this film should blame hate crimes ... or at least for fraud that tries to exclude it as something that reminds of entertainment. Seriously! The film is an island where men are only breeding animals, and I am still rather attached to Gilligans Island, but the pictures of Condoleezza Rice, which are then occupied there. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of this movie was the guy who hung up the loudspeaker I've ever heard in a movie theater. It is neither a joke nor a fancy. I've never been in a "thriller" and heard so much laughter all over the film. I can't be sure if the laughs were in some ways tense to ease the cinematic tension or if they just thought the crud was actually flying. I found honestly that I could direct a blackout or maybe fight a movie, something that would make it more interesting, which is pretty sad, because Deez, the powder and I drew two beers before each movie just a little mentally anesthetic (soon to be all Nic Cage movie laws, write to your congressman today, do not delay). At one point, I thought this film was really a scam and Anna Ferris would show up? Oh, how I wish. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage throws so much zinc on one shot, which I mean today cholesterol test. To think that I thought Sean Penn was a d * ck for Nicole to become famous, he is still d * ck less than one? Yeah, Sean Penn d * ck was down because of this movie. Make it all for us to Nic to play our strengths and to remain a pathetic loser and drunk. You can't play superman that you can't play to play strong hunky roles go straight to jail without going to $ 200. His best moments on this film are when he finally arrives and actually pulls out a hairy woman to steal his fur (like a peer, not a joke or a functional moment during this review) to continue amok like Conan O'Brian's masturbating bear, but Party Fun Bear Knocks Her Junk Round. Fortunately, he will soon meet after the end of the day when it turns out that he has to be a victim of a crowd in the new hybrid exhibition of Burning Man and Lilith Fair. Yes !!!! I just broke the end for you and if you knew better, you would build worship from me and sing my legend songs. I sat through this nonsense festival so you don't have to. <br /> <br /> About half of this little misconception I was thinking, Jack Bauer would have offered this case in 20 minutes in real time. .OK 35 minutes when the mountain lion attacks Kim. Even Steve Martin, as Inspector Clouseau, could have recognized it less than an hour and you are not Inspector Clouseau. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you are imprisoned and you have the chance to see this movie or take a shot, take a month. <br /> <br /> Somewhere, Uwe Boll laughs at us all.
