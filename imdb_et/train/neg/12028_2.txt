I agree with all the above-mentioned people who said something that would convince you that you won't even waste shorter moments watching this amazingly amateur movie. Very poorly performing, remote production values, a completely pedestrian direction, and a script that is both incorrect and nasty, should never have been written, not to mention produced. Even Hollywood's "specialists" will probably only work for a salary account, though no one should have paid for this bad work. Instead, careers should be CLOSED over this unlikely turn. <br /> <br /> OTH, something is exciting when you look at something so jaw-little. And Chad Lowe is terribly and consistently bad.
