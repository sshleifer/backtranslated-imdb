Please forget me to forget. Please. Please. This is the worst film I've ever had. I consider the film an insult to both the brain and the back, both of which have suffered me from watching and watching this movie. I have not yet seen the damage caused by my eyes and the execution of the penalties. What a garbage load! And don't get me going ... Somebody please help me forget! "Weird Science" - Come Back! Everything is forgiven ... <br /> <br /> I'm "proud" to give this film the first in IMDb ... And I voted for hundreds of movies ... Many of them c ** p, but that's so bad I don't even believe it. Did anyone really find the idea and thought it was worth getting into the movie? Someone actually read the script and decided to produce the movie? Anyone read the script and listened to it? Someone saw the movie and decided to * not * put it on the shelf to collect dust forever? * These * are the questions I would like to answer. Not a philosophical question about this tree in the forest and well, you know ...
