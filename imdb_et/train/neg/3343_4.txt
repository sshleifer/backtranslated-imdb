An interesting story about a soldier in a war, who cannot save the life of an enemy's young girl and worships this event, although she saved many other children in captivity. The film flashes head and this soldier is now a high school teacher, mostly led by corridors, bathrooms and even classrooms. In other words, high school is a prison and most children pay very little attention to their teachers or teachers. Dolph Lundgren (Sam Decker) plays a soldier / school teacher and decides that he will give up teaching and go out.
