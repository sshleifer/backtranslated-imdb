First of all, I apologize for my English. <br /> <br /> All persons from the former Yugoslavia who are not some extreme Serb radicals agree with me. This movie shows Serb and only Serb. There was no crime in Serbia. Fortunately, everyone can see that this movie has been made by the Serbs, so there is no neutrality. Not all "professionals" interviewed are professionals at all. Some boys read only a book written by a few Serbian radicals, the other one is a denier of genocide, etc.etc. <br /> <br /> Even Slovenians were accused of this movie. just because Slovenians were happy. There were not many Serbs in Slovenia and YNA did not reach Slovenia via Croatia (after the Croatian-Serbian war started). All Slovenians are outraged by all the accusations of this film. <br /> <br /> Every sensible Croatia agrees with one thing: Independence was too early. Perhaps all major conflicts could be avoided. The mention of World War II and some related things was really a pathetic attempt to justify everything. Imagine the Japanese throwing a nuclear bomb in Seattle and Washington and saying it was justified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You will not find any evidence of the overgrown YNA soldier and murdered Serbian civilians near Vukovar. But you can find a tape with the reporter that makes his allegations about Serbian civilians near Vukovar wrong. All over the internet. And the director forgot to mention the entire Vukovar bombing by YNA (now on the Serbian-Montenegrin side and 100% full of Serbs and Montenegro). Let's not start with Chetniki. At first it was just a resistance movement. But the director somehow forgot to mention the cooperation with the Nazis, including Uhash, ethnic cleansing and the Yugoslav partisans. There are thousands of other things, but it can be easily checked. There are many misleading things in this movie. Only a few all the accusations are true. Every movie in Croatia is outraged. I believe I do not have to mention the denial of the genocide of Srebrenica, a genocide with too much evidence. Imagine denial of the Holocaust. This movie is the same. And according to this film, Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo were bombing themselves. Every Bosnian Muslim is outraged by this movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, the director forgot that the Serbs mentioned the land of a small Macedonian (FYROM). <br /> <br /> Croatia, Slovenians, Bosnians and Macedonians have never entered Serbia. If you are not a Serb and you actually started to believe in some things about this film, you know that the Serbs have some kind of propaganda that the Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Macedonians are actually Serbs with their history. So ... <br /> <br /> Even 50% of Serbs say this movie is '' small '' extreme and Serbian. <br /> <br /> And Serbian radicals are very pleased with this film (there are about 40% of Serbs who vote for radicals). <br /> <br /> I think everyone understands my points here. There is very little truth in this so-called documentary film and my advice to everyone is: Inform yourself before watching the movie. After that, you will only laugh at pathetic accusations. <br /> <br /> See real, neutral documentary documents about Yugoslavia's death.
