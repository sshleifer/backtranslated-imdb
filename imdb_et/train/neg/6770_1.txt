I went to watch this movie with my 17-year-old game. daughter. I demanded that we go to the mat, not because I was stubborn, but just feeling I had. In the spirit of NASCAR, it is the sponsor's dream. With so many blatant advertisements, it almost qualifies as an information-trade if it wasn't called act. Continuing with the tradition, the Herbie franchise continues with its cheese line, the car is just a "vehicle" (no red) for this movie. Earlier, the Herbie parts (though also the cheese competition) were produced, making them easier. Mrs Lohan, Disney's ruling queen of drama, is a little acting. I was surprised that Mr Keaton and Mr Dillon are involved in such a project. The only snack bar was the bigger ripoff!
