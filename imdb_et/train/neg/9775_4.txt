Fine performances and the direction of art are not good films. This film is so grim and depressing that I do not feel any joy at the "happy" end of the trade union strike. Experiments with humor associated with the lake's pregnancy are completely catastrophic and all the films that contain Baldwin's brother are already against it. According to a positive note, Lang is still one of America's greatest undervalued actors, he alone makes it worth a VCR. I'll give it 4.
