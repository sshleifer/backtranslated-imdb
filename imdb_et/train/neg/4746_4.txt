There are a number of things wrong with this movie - the character of Brenda Song is one of them. I don't think the girl is a sad actor - I don't honestly do. I believe he will be given bad lines. She should just be, "it's a useless, rich girl," and while it's a funny TV show she's playing, she can't even laugh here. <br /> <br /> Should I have known what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The film was not so terrible ... initially. Wendy's reaction to Shen was completely natural. I think you would feel if a man who claims to be a reincarnated monk called you to tell you to wear a medallion and demanded that you fight against "great evil" and save the world? Which brings me to the second point. I know this film is completely fiction, but it is still the basis of Chinese culture. It seems that all the "warriors" in the Wendy family were women. Correct me if I am wrong, but I doubt the monks would have been in this way. Of course, maybe they would have worked it out, but they didn't offer any explanation. In doing so, they contributed to Hollywood's and the media's efforts to multiply hair by empowering women. <br /> <br /> Never saying we will continue. <br /> <br /> More unbearable when the movie continues. Yes, she's a teenager, and it's almost homecoming-I mean, who wants to fight at home during the evil? The problem is that when "evil" begins to manifest itself, Wendy does not seem to be like it should be. He's extremely careless - even someone like him. He doesn't take care of his training. I use this conversation, for example, Shen: "If you do not win this battle, take over the evil and all the good will go away." Wendy: "Don't talk about pressure. Well ... let's talk about something else." Yeah, let's Wendy. Let's go dancing if you should train correctly. Of course, Shen promises her, but her character is an excuse. It is better that he will work with him if he does not, and he will not train at all and will kill both. <br /> <br /> talking about it. Shen also told Wendy that his fate was to die for him in the battle as he was for his grandmother (I assume this part). <br /> <br /> This makes Wendy's activities unforgettable. br /> <br /> As the script writer would have, Wendy is home fight and this "big battle" is exactly the same day. Do you know what Wendy is doing? Do you even think? Yes, he is in the battle because when he tries to leave his country, the monks (who trapped their coach and teachers in Shen because he knew a strange fight against the old man) knew that Shen had gone alone, so he went to save him. <br /> <br /> At first we see some semi-finals that are really fun. Finally, the great evil comes out of the body of Wendy's rival home income and creates the body of its ancient warriors from broken pieces. <br /> <br /> Don't ask. Anyway, Wendy gets all "panic." Then Shen goes and protects him from this guy - forgive me for forgetting my long Chinese name - and I can kill myself. <br /> <br /> Wendy catches Shen if he makes his long descent uncomfortable. air. <br /> <br /> He shouts out the title of this article. <br /> <br /> Now it was so bad that Wendy got too strong, too fast. No, I won't let it apologize because it was his "destiny" and he had "power" inside him. Ever since he studied healing? No, the worst ... because when did he restore people? So Shen has been raised from the dead. Then Wendy and she are fighting a boy. <br /> <br /> She loses her way easily. The worst part is when they jump together and hit him at the same time, and he's forever left out. Then the monks praise Wendy for his sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Two Things # 1: Does the script writer and director know the battle needs a little more "finesse"? # 2: What's the victim? The fact that he did not go home? Because the girl did not break the sweat or even bleeding. I mean, come on, this movie was TV PG, I wanted to see someone get in. <br /> <br /> Ah-hem ... moving forward. <br /> <br /> I know it sounds like maybe I'd have to give one movie based on my comments. Part of the criticism, however, you must know that the thing is breaking down. You may not be looking for fraud, but if it does, pay attention to it. This movie has a lot of bad things, but something funny happens if you never expect something that is too big first. <br /> <br /> So, I think it was all right. Not that I didn't say it wasn't all right, anyone would have stopped watching it.
