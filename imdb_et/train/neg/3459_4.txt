"Cut" is a movie about movies. It's a lot of "Scream", an ironic, self-referencing horror flick that at least falls for me, because for all this irony it's just a bad horror movie, the same as the movies it refers to. br /> <br /> But it wasn't without his charms. Well, one charm anyway. Molly Ringwald was a fantastic, if spoiled, female American actress who hates every minute of working with an Australian amateur film crew. He was so convincing that he was tempted to believe that this wasn't the case, although everyone who participated in "Cut" said he was cute. :-) <br /> <br /> Seriously, every scene of fasting, fasting or grabbing was great. But everyone else glanced between OK and terribly wood. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "Cut" has some laughs, some buckets (some of it surprisingly horrible), and finally ... just another bad horror movie.
