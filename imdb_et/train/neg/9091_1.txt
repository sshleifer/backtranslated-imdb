Seriously I've read some comments about this movie, and I have to ask if you watch the same movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I give the organizers a lot of credit for being able to restore Los Angeles in 1930, but what? No character is pleasant, the story seems to be pointless, Karen Black is not a very good actor. Donald Sutherland is just sudden. (and his character "Homer Simpson" makes me want an animated version. D'oh!) Then you had a horrible child actor, miner Billy Barty, etc. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies cinema lovers and the rest of us watching each other and going "What the hell!"
