Absolutely, Burton's worst film seems to be getting deeper for every movie he's running. A fascinating script, filled with clich√©s, is just one of many reluctant aspects of this movie. This is a movie where every time something happens, you will definitely hear someone shout, "He's lost a gun!" or whatever it is that everyone knows. Carter is really terrible and so is Wahlberg, who can't play it straight and be convincing. Very beautiful effects and photography, but bad music at John Williams Hall in Burton's Crown Elfman. Heston appears in the nonsensichal scene to express his most famous phrases from the first film. Very bad results. <br /> <br /> When somebody else saw "Sleepy Hollow" there, they've probably noticed, as I am, a reduction in the quality of Burton's films. I have heard that this particular project has been produced by others and that Burton has been a leader, in which case his decision should be asked. But I think he has promised any vision he had ever slipped during his career; there is evidence in the movies. In "Sleepy Hollow", she couldn't decide what movie she did, be it a comedy or a real horror movie, and the British character actors (Chris Lee, etc.) also made you think it was a kind of monster rally movie (these aren't never scare like horror fans know). The movie could not be transmitted in horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic and the style was not designed to smooth out each other. The "Apeside Planet" is much the same and the result goes beyond Total Recall or Tango and Cash as sci-fi. He has also fallen into the rut of so many other "big" directors who tried to satisfy the entire audience. The word to Burton when you're out there - choose something and do it directly or use some style to put it all together (like "Martian attacks" or "Beetlejuice") or you can retire because people like me who is yours movie fans, stop.
