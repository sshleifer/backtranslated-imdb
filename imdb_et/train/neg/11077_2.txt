The only reason I chose this flick was the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine. All I can say is that it was the biggest waste of big players that was ever put on the film. As far as I could say, Borgnine was the only actor. Other performances were so terrible, I am surprised that the studio would actually pay for "performers". Combine this talent level in the department with a story that is so sprawling and inaccurate that I thought my eyes would start bleeding for credit and you had a perfect kinematic disaster. Of course, the film appealed to the children's audience and its credit, it was better than most of the original programming for Disney Channel and similar boy-oriented networks. But to be honest, it doesn't speak much.
