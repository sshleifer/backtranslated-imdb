If I had realized that John Wayne was in that movie, I wouldn't have watched it. It's humiliating for Japan, unfortunate for Hollywood and embarrassing for some thinking. But most of John Wayne's movies are like that. Fifty years ago, Hollywood believed that everyone in the world loved Americans when the truth was (and still is) somewhat different. The film deals with the isolation of the nineteenth century in Japan. Maybe it's Hollywood, which should be isolated. It's as short as possible, this movie is a terrible jingoistic slip. (Madama butterfly is bad music.)
