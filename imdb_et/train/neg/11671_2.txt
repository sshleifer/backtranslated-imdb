I need to say - it's a stink! (I gave him a rating of 2) <br /> <br /> Observe it only if you have insomnia. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of terrain chewing and scattering, but not much more of this movie. There is no tension, deep, shocking secrets that are not a real threat to the heroine's well-being. Some disagreements, a slight increase in votes - that's pretty much. The secrets are not something that would not happen to anyone - the last "secret" that appears in the film is completely predictable by then. <br /> <br /> This plot revolves around a woman called Faith (Meg Tilly), an artist who has been hired to paint a series of wall paintings in a huge building between a very rich wealth, an older widow's wife, and a growing mother / daughter type craves with her. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the older woman's daughter, Cassandra, is dead. You can fit the rest of the pieces quite well. <br /> <br /> Even a scene with a mysterious person threatening our heroine will not promote this point where you are really afraid of your safety, even if you are two or two. Why does he still hang for years after Cassandra's death is a good question. <br /> <br /> The question is also that there is only one servant in this big mansion, a faithful butler who seems to have done everything ... cooking, cleaning, serving meals, answering the door, and so on. Everything except probably the door lock, because that would be the only explanation of how one of the characters just goes into the room where Faith is. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to get your management's hands gripping and tilting at the edge of your seat, because there is no "fix" tension in this film - just blissful, pathetic revelations that are occasionally thrown out. <br /> <br />
