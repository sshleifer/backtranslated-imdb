This film should be a "light" story of Santa Claus and his "magical and mystical" miracles. Instead, it's going to be awful. There are two things in this movie that look like terrible in my eyes, 1) how Santa looks. Have you ever seen a more horrible Santa Claus? and 2) "Satan's Evil Rep." Pitch's just odd dances are just in sight. Watch this movie only if it is a MSTed version or if you like a great laugh. I can't believe it's a children's film.
