Burt Kennedy was a very good director before, but you never knew it with this unpleasant mess. This movie is not only inexpensive, it is cheap - most of the scenes in the battle are lifted from the far better "Last Commandments" in 1955, and this film, which has been photographed 32 years earlier, seems more than it is today. Few scenes actually made for this movie are incorrect, confusing, and incompetent, looking as devastating as the rest of the picture. It has the look and feel of a bad student film (and the budget doesn't seem much more). It moves like molasses, mostly acting mostly in ham or over-top-comatose - although Raul Julia leaves better than most of the rest cast - and it's full of annoying historical inaccuracies. Moreover, it is too long. If you make a boring movie, do it in one hour and get it over - do not stretch it for three hours as it is. If you want to see a good movie from Alamo, check out John Wayne's 1960 version or even the 1955 movie, which this movie stole from his action scenes. It is hard to believe that the film was made by six producers. Skip it.
