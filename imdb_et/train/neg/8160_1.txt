and not to have fun watching. it's just bad. it is shocking that people have posted positive things about it. story sucks, actress is bad, it is not scary, special effects are not special - oh no! the board has hands out of it! Oh Gee - The Mirror Became Water! The hair, clothes and makeup of the 50's were not accurate and they got a middle-aged man who still has a hairline to play his high school version. it is like a late nightmare on pedestrian things. I enjoy sitting down to watch the terrible film of cheese as much as anyone else, but there are better bad ones.
