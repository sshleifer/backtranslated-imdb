When this movie appeared, it produced a film review of one of the most important capsules: Sphinx Stinks. He does it, but incredibly. Casting is silly, from the beginning: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as Egyptians? There is not enough makeup in Cairo, at least not when making this film. But it's quite fun to see them try. Performances go from mummy (apology, obvious observation) to top, very few stops. The character of Lesley-Anne Down seems to not find Egypt on the map, less understandable of her archaeological treasures. This is, at least in part, due to some very bad letters, one of the passages that every movie viewer visits. It is my opinion that curses that are connected with the curse or that lead to their foundation on a subject that is somewhat esoteric, like Egypt, are ripe for a foolish, overwritten dialogue. It does not disappoint and the approach proves that it is double. The plot has one source of dramatic tension management: can it become vague and less plausible? The answer is usually YES. Location images are beautiful and the design is generally very good, the only consistent reminder that it was not a low-budget production. This and the fact that there are so many well-known faces that serve such an unintended laughher. Cheap, no; cheesy, yeah.
