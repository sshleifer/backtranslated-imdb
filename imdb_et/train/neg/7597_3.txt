I love the 30s and 40s in the movie. I love Salma Hayek. I was more than willing to love this picture. but . . <br /> <br /> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOCOOO! ! ! !! ! <br /> <br /> No, sir, nothing good. The only entertaining aspect for me was the character of Colin Farrell, an insecure writer, and this scenario, despite the fruity theme of racism, is approaching the audience in ABC Afterschool Special fashion. The only person who didn't seem like he was "acting" was Sutherland, and his minutes were little. <br /> <br /> Approaching a tired plot.
