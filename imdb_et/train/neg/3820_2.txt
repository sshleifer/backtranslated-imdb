Watching Speak Easily is painful for Buster Keaton fans. Seeing such a phenomenal writer, actor, comedian, director, and stuntman subordinate to this humiliating point of view is like seeing Picasso as a dropper, or perhaps seeing the best Camembert, which is fake with whey-based agents and treated with Cheez-Whiz. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Keaton is the wrong Professor Post, whose overstretched vocabulary is the only thing that keeps him saying, "Tell me about rabbits, George." (The post would have said something like, "Please tell me the status of small mammals in the order of the family Leporidae, Lagomorpha, sir, whom I believe is primarily directed to the epithet" George ".") When Keaton was created his characters, they may be helpless they were not stupid. They were quick studies and became masters of these worlds. Not with Post, who never has to stumble and bother, and who no longer controls his destiny than Titanic. And although Keaton's original characters had charming jokes and innocence, the Post became such a deep sexual slowdown that once he had been physically awakened, he swollen the ice cream and turned to the doctor. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of small, redeeming moments, like Keaton's attempts to get rid of vampishist Thema Todd or his suggestion for a suitable dress for Greek dance, but it's not just worth the whole length of the movie to see. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of bad movies, crush and watch friends with your friends, "Mystery Science Theater 3000". But stay silent. Let them be 100% of what Buster Keaton remembers.
