Bobby is a funny child who smiles too much and wants sex. So he buys a vending machine to help this endeavor. Action is flat, comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than a loosely clipped chain of clichés and cheap excitement. The makers of the film apparently wanted to capture some of the madness of other films from time to time, but fell short for a short time. They even use Bobby's slip on the banana skin because it probably adds comedy value. <br /> <br /> I try to find the redeeming feature of the movie. If you like DeVito, this is another classic DeVito role, but it is only supportive of the value of the actor and the cliché.
