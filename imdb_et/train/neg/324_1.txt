The worst mistake in my life. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie for $ 5 because I thought, "Hey, this is Sandler, which I get some cheap laughs." I was wrong, totally wrong. In the middle of the movie, all three of my friends have slept and I still suffer. The worst plot, the worst script, the worst movie I've ever seen. I wanted my head against the wall in one hour, then stopped and you know why? Because it seemed damn good. When I grab my head, I missed this fucking movie in the microwave and watched it burn .... and it seemed better than anything else I've ever done. It took the American Psycho, the Army of Darkness, and kill Bill to get to this mess. I HATE SANDLER'S ATTENTION, HOW TO ATTENT THIS AND ALL DAY OF MY DAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
