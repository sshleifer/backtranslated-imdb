This movie is a bad memory from my childhood. This is one of the films they show to children at school on a rainy day if you can't go there and you look at something else. At least it was like in primary school. I just remember this movie. Allow me to have not seen it after 15 years and they will not use it any more on a rainy day, but I want to warn everyone: You'd better use it to put your children to sleep than entertain them. Trust me, choose something else. Although this is a controversial topic, the plot is so cumbersome and slow that I can't remember it, except that I didn't want it so strongly that here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn you all against it.
