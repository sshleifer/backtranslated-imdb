I really don't know how people made this movie and thought it was worth all the work they did. Even more amazing are those who watched this movie without having beaten anything valuable, like cleaning on the couch or reading Leviticus after 88 minutes. First of all, they would definitely have found 2 real Irish people and some good-looking women who would be able to shoot their film better when it was washed, haggard porn stars. Gore works - but strangely, it's not as worrying as you might think to see organs stay out of porn stars (hot (previously) tense bodies left and right). Probably have something to do with wanting to die after their terrible inhuman behavior. <br /> <br /> So if you don't care about the following questions: <br /> <br /> - acting (seriously, everyone sucks. I've never seen it before. BIRTHS). movie doesn't make sense if you are not as trashed as writers probably were). <br /> <br /> - Theme (there is nothing to learn from this movie. Nothing should be intimidated at night, pondering or understanding or explaining to others). <br /> <br /> - Soundtrack (Crap, crap, crap. Music like a regular and boring script). <br /> <br /> - Landscapes (It could have been the savage grace of this movie, but there's nothing pleasant here. Even the stones are fake). <br /> <br /> Yes, yes. If you don't care about it and you're just a horny teen with bad music and "female" taste, this movie is for you. Positive comments: Interesting cinematography is sometimes wasted on other elements. Very realistic gore; again, wasted. But the intestinal scene is classic. I agree that mutant-disembowelment solves the problem of fake call.
