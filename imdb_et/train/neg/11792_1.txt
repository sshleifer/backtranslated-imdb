It must be the cheapest film of the 21st century. This is a completely low quality, but in the end it is down ... everything. All the cheap tricks - like flashing and dark - are meant to hide their dirty computer effects. <br /> <br /> All actors are lower than average, especially the main character Anne Fletcher (Simmone Mackinnon). There's a scene where Anne is asked, "Why are you so careless?" The correct answer is because he can't act. Whatever happens (the world is destroyed, his friend dies, he is fired), he has the same silly smile on his face. <br /> <br /> This is not just a movie of B quality. This is also the description of the back cover (at least in Finland). The text mentions things such as Lorica Gray, the Capital Vessel and the main character Garrison Harper and Anna (not Anne) Fletcher. The description sounds like a different film that includes both Fletcher and sea monsters
