The film starts with a rather intriguing scene, three people drinking and making small tales at the bar. All of them make a bit of unheard of stories. When the movie opens, it turns out that the most terrible story is true. Moreover, this movie is not very interesting, except for the scene in the bar and the scene where the main secret is. This revelation is barely halfway through the film and, frankly, there is not much to see. For the rest of the time, the chairman is the god who is left by a Russian village full of bad and horrible old women. Of course, these are interesting and a little shocking pictures, but their admiration takes too long, sacrificing the development of a possible plot or character. I found this film to be another example of terrible or lazy filmmaking, where instead of trying the story of interest, filmmakers focused on stunningly interesting images and through some almost interrelated story (example - the story of a meat trader) to leave the spectator to find out all the odds and ends. The surface has an artistic appearance, but in this case there is nothing but a lack of talent.
