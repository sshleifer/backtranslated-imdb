Before I begin, let me say that my experience of this film could have affected the duplication I gathered from other comments that were original, something else is worse. So it is quite possible that the subtitles or probably the new DVD version would change. I have not read the corresponding book; I know only one other Japanese manga and maybe lack the cultural context. <br /> <br /> Possible small spoilers in front. Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, etc.) but I didn't enjoy the movie at all. Although it began to become slightly intriguing, it became annoying when it was half finished. There are all kinds of problems; let's start with what is probably the most serious: dialogue. Characters cannot formulate complete sentences; if they do not scratch each other's names for the second time, they are usually monosyllabic ("Kanedaaa!", "Tetsuoooo!", "Huh?", "Grrr", etc.). This leaves most characters completely underdeveloped and two-dimensional. It does not at least help that many of them will only get a few minutes of screen time without saying anything to develop them alongside visual stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Upgraded with some random pseudo-philosophical technobabbles that sound vague and non-Star Trek standards. There is nothing deep and meaningful here - it all seems random, thrown at random from different bit and stock sci-fi ideas, without any cohesiveness. <br /> <br /> The little plot to understand is not just a pretext for starting the remaining final queue, which consists of steep and destructive scenes. Of course, there is something wrong, a bit of chaos and destruction, of course; but in this case you will find yourself asking, "what is it all and how long it is over". The formation of characters over the last 30 minutes is little more than Tetsuo, which became obviously unclear for Pizza Hutt. <br /> <br /> The end is similar to 2001. Leave the viewer feeling that he has just been looking for a kaleidoscope within two hours. I am sure some will argue that this is an art; but it was just an imaginative use of color and images. (Some of the music was also quite interesting). Unfortunately, it is all style and non-existent. <br /> <br /> Disney Tired? Do you want to watch adult-animated movies smartly animated? I am sad to say that you will probably find such a thing in "South Park".
