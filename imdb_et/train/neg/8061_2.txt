Let me start by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I respect her work very much. I wish she had more movies that showed her talent. So Soul Survivors said a very bad movie. Very bad. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I'm almost all guilty of a bad script. Affleck is a very talented actor, Wes Bentley was great at American Beauty, Melissa Sagemiller was good and Eliza Dushku is now a Hollywood girl. I don't think any actor really got the script, and I understand why. If you say that this movie belongs to the Horror genre, it is superfluous. It had twists that you would expect, but they just didn't take anywhere ... except for more confusion. I just found the end to be very climatic because it just didn't make any sense or any real answer to any question I had about the story. <br /> <br /> I would like to have a good overview of this movie, but I can't. Frankly, the only thing I think you find fearful about this movie is that you paid for it.
