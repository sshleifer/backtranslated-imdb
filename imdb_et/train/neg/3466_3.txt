The slip in the early 1980s is a curse that has someone who is trying to die. Years later, the group tried to complete the film - the films rebuilt a deadly curse. A great idea for a movie, but unfortunately "Cut" is just one wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> In Australia, unfortunately, there is no fear of the best results in the world. "Razorback" (1984) was out and out, as was "Holwing III" (1987), which was still half the American film. As far as our comedy-horror is concerned, "Body Melt" (1993) is best forgotten. The "cut" problem is that the makers who try to create a smart horror wire la "Scream" (1996) but who do not have an overview of the genre or what makes it work. And while it sounds strange when I say this about Slasher's movie, but what "Cut" really isn't, "Heart" is. Of course, it follows the "rules" established by "Scream", but it does not want to play this formula, instead it is a copy of an earlier cardboard. <br /> <br /> It is probably one of the most boring and unpleasant crooks in the history of fear films. His endless repulsion uncomfortable, flat with one liner would make porn dialogue a Shakespeare. The cast never seems to have their full involvement and looks like they are just waiting to shoot, so they can collect their wage control. And the feeling of the movie is as he deliberately tries to be horrible; more like "neighbors" or "heartbeat" episode. By the way, these attempts in the MTV style, hyperbolic "research" just look flat, dated and inappropriate. I hope we are still doing it, maybe we should take a page from the book "Mad Max" (1979). Instead of trying to copy the US, we should try our own genre.
