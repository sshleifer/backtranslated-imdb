Comedy Central has been successful with original programs using professional comics. The Chapelle Exhibition, Mencia Mind, The Daily Show, and the very popular Colbert Report, all adult professional comics, and everything or the Chapelle Show were solid shows. Given that Sarah Silverman is one of the best female comics in business, I was expecting good things. <br /> <br /> I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> Funny order, but given that the star is a Silverman caliber, this show would have been much better. It was just a pilot and hopefully the next week's show is better. If not, get help from a better writer.
