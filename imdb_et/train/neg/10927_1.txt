The reviews of this film were mild at the best and the expectations were high: a big budget, tons of popular faces, a pretty funny idea, and the main actor whom everyone loves. The end result is a disaster. Alice Tremblay's allegedly humorous journey in the fantasy world is not able to provide entertainment at all (I did not hear any smiles throughout the presentation), passing this page-thin story and one-dimensional signs without one spark, not a sign of the magic she wanted. The 90-minute film is sterile in a clumsy direction, and some good actors are doing their best to become professionals in a feature that certainly doesn't seem like a big idea on the idea, let alone paper. 'L'Odyss√©e d'Alice Tremblay' is a comic comic book that combines (very) thin good ideas. Avoid or bored you haunted.
