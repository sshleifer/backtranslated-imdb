No one can enjoy this movie for their merits, but if you have a sense of humor and enjoy Schlock movies for the quality of your MST3, then this is for you. This is a very high position with "Road House" if it is an unpleasant character, set and story. Poor writing drew me up: "I want you to dust those guys off" instead of "... dust those men." The F-14s come from the carrier, but when they enter, they are in the F-16! Without anger or skepticism, Segal goes back to work for the public, who only in a few minutes followed the hidden "sweeping of mind" at Seagal. Segal ends with balls and rests with a knife to kill the guards. So, of course, the guards all drop their weapons and fight the knife! The hand grenade is dud, but it explodes anyway. A small hidden fighter can fly to California without refueling in Afghanistan. Then Segal goes back to California - a long way, i. European - though there is an airline that gives it 20-minute air aid in the Arabian Sea. Carrier CIC consists of three black computers, 2 flat-screen TVs and wall-mounted gauges and cards. What a hoot!
