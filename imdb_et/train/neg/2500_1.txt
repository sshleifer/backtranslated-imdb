Van Dien is embarrassed in the memory of this ridiculously poor film, as every individual has. Frankly, I am quite embarrassed to admit that I looked at it from start to finish. Production values ​​are somewhere between the original Crossroads and Prisoner Cell Block H. Most of the five-year-olds could offer a more realistic dialogue and a more reliable plot. As for the actresses, if you can imagine the most trash you have ever seen - one where the action is padded with some infinite "story" to explain how some of the old peroxide blonde boilers have spit - roasted with a pair of mustache with mustache - You have a definition of a standard that works on "Man Voyage". Worse still, you can't even go on sex scenes because they're not. Amazingly terrible movie.
