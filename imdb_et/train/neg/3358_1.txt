Haunted. Of course, remake. The original was a horrible psychological thriller that has improved over time. Compared to this remake of 1999, it's classic. There is no character development here, only cartoons (bitch, authoritative brain, "I get out of here", oh so sensitive book form). But when you see how special actions were "star", I think the characters you know are a secondary problem. Unfortunately, the effect is ridiculous. Awakening of cherubs, stretchy doors, irritating dead children who can't speak clearly ... and an idiotic fun ending that gives you a new age of butterflies and rainbow age enema. Sick my mouthpieces orally, thank you. Bruce Dern, I've liked you from "The Cowboys". Stop.
