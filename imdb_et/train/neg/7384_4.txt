STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) is assigned to France for a record-breaking mission with three new with a young strike team recruits after a direct order disregard. But at night, before they strike, it is found that the killer kills the seemingly inhuman force to kill. When the French police run around with their investigations, he is going to look for those who are responsible, only to detect the corrupt faction of the military who is dealing with a deadly new drug that changes human DNA and gives them a terrifying new strength. > <br /> Bad cover. Bad title. Bad post-production infringement. And a bad trailer. Pretty bad movie. But I have to say I don't think Attack Force is his worst. I know that it makes me unpopular for most of the other reviewers (or not Steveday), but I think that a lot of criticism has been caused by all the bad news that went into the movie, not its actual quality. br /> <br /> I have to say that there was not so much duplication or tropical editing as I believed. Duplication was (which made him sound like Martin Sheen with the groin problem!) Was quite terrible and quite frequent, but didn't use as much of a movie segment as I thought. The movement of the plot was quite smooth, bearing in mind all the confusion with the original finished movie Harvester, which went on. Another reviewer also noted that the film has a nice Gothic look, a new touch for Seagal. <br /> <br /> The absolute low point of the killer was the complete and complete lack of exciting activities with just a few filmed combat scenes for any fun. <br /> <br /> But I have to be honest, but I look at it rather than rage, today you die or kill. **
