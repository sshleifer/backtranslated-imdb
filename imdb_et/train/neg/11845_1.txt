... is the only way to describe this film on topics that should be certain: scandal, sex, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst extends his role as silent film director Marion Davies, as he thinks he is "Legally Blondes". The man who plays William Randolph Hearst crosses the place where you want to hit the screen and hit him. Eddie Izzard is pretty good, except he's playing Charlie Chaplin and it's about 125 pounds too hard? It is hard to believe that this crippled, uneven wreck was staged by Peter Bogdanovich, but then he hasn't made a watchable movie again, what? 30 years? Sometimes it doesn't just come back.
