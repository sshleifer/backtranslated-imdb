I don't know what you're talking about the first time I watched this movie with two of my friends we couldn't cry. It's one of the funniest clothes I've ever seen. This comment on porn is so right though hahahaha. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is even worse, but it put tears in the eyes due to fake characters, poor dialogue and action. Not to mention the expensive cameras they filmed? One of these films seems to be my leader ed. class. The props look like they had come out of the high school drama show. Music sounds like the original Nintendo system game. The only thing that even scared for this movie was that he had a killer clown, who, who is not limped by fat, is lurking in clowns? hahaha, if somebody should ever look at it, they have to look at the verbal mistakes of the participants like adding words and some facial expressions. hahahaha i died. <br /> <br /> SUSAN
