"National Lamp Goes to Movies" is the worst film ever made, even surpassing the uncomfortable "Space Plan 9". At least this film was just unfair; By contrast, the lamp's film is both incorrect and average. From time to time, the films used to honor their audience's intelligence. But it has a frightening face, a rotting carcase - and then it tries to rub its nose. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer of this site wrote that the only good parts of the movie are naked scenes; and I agree that Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry are flashing a little meat and have a very nice meat. But the directors do not realize that even R&D needs a good story around it. There is no such thing here. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers are the worst savers last. The third of these three segments is the toughest trio. Robin Benson is an avid young police officer who has been at work in his first job. He's tied to a tired, cynical old player played by Richard Widmark. Only for a moment will we be given the hope that this film will come to an end. We definitely think the young dirty attitude rubs the bar and makes it better. <br /> <br /> Unexpected hope! Instead, the nail will win a day - and the young sparks will be used forever. "The National Lampoo goes to the movies" and leads to the toilet, asking us to run through it. Namely, it is comedy. But where is humor?
