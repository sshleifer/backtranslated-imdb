I saw this movie in the middle of the night when I was slipping through the channels and there was nothing else to watch. This is one of those movies where you stay to see what it is - just for a moment! - But understand in 20 minutes or so that you just can't turn it off, no matter how bad it is. One of those films that is somewhere so bad that it's good and so bad, it's good, just BAD, it's worth seeing just to be confused when you realize it's both! A big night's break if it's just a fabulous drag on tennis. Don't even ask yourself why no one can say that Chad Lowe is so obviously a man because logic doesn't apply.
