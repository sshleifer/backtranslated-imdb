I saw this movie in Tolkien's class in the second year of college. I was sadly close to the screen and my professor chose to serve as a whip - everyone else laughed, but they were not in constant vision. <br /> <br /> Let's get out of here: Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings has something to pay for Bakshi's film. For example, in Jackson's The Ring Fellowship, the scene where Black Riders attack the empty strangers' bed is almost a complete copy of the scene on Bakshi's film. You can name this plagiarism or respect, depending on your agenda. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the similarities won't end. I'm not going to do any research to find out what these are, because that would mean I have the respect of this movie. I'm sure others have sketched similarities - look around. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete train rack in every sense of the metaphor and many, many people died in the accident. I have decided to list what I remember more or less chronologically - If I am something that offends me, that is because I am completely overwhelmed by the wealth of wealth (and higher points) of mediocrity). <br /> <br /> * Because rotoscopy is difficult, Gandalf is no longer gentle, smart, but a frightening punishment prophet (whose hat changes color unexpectedly once or twice during a movie)) <br /> <br /> * Saruman White is sometimes called "Aruman" during the film without explanation. She wears purple and red for mysterious reasons. <br /> <br /> * Sam is puzzled. His friendship with Frodo represents strange parenting and dissatisfaction. Yes, hobbies are small like kids, but they're not kids. <br /> <br /> * Merry and Pippin have never been introduced - they just appear in a sentence sentence while changing the scene. The film is full of such cumbersome editing. <br /> <br /> * Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry are singing along the way. One of the hobbies procures the broom at least twice as much as it is behind - which was not visible before - and starts with a typical fantasy field pattern as they all get into "la-la-la". FULL. <br /> <br /> * Aragorn is probably Native American, dressed in a highly stereotyped fantasy tunic (without pants), with a huge square pilgrim pocket. She is undoubtedly the worst sword player in the film - often she can beat her before hitting her ass. <br /> <br /> * Black riders seem to be more of a lunatic than a threatening evil. They slip wherever they go slowly. It's worrying to be sure, but not scary. <br /> <br /> * Black cyclist scene, trying to cross the Bruinen Ford (where they look at Frodo who is on the other side of the horse) continues forever, during which riders drive their horses in a vaguely threatening way and ... do nothing other. The scene was apparently meant to illustrate Frodo's hallucinatory decline when he gives up his wound. It turns out it's more than anything else. <br /> <br /> * Gimli's dwarf is as long as Legolas Elf. He's DWARF. That's not just an excuse. He also looks like Gnome's bastarded David. It is a raw but accurate description. <br /> <br /> * Boromir seems to have split Elmer Fudd's golden viking armor out of this Bugs Bunny opera episode. She looks ridiculous. <br /> <br /> * Despite the similarity of Tolkan's illustration, Balrog is worshiping and the least threatening frog in the film. It seems that someone carries pink sleeping bags and it is hardly higher than Gandalf. "Purists" may prefer this Balrog, but I take Jackson's version every day. <br /> <br /> * Battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing. Almost none of the characters have any power in their weaponry. I'm not asking for actionable scenes as they are in the Jackson movie, but they should be fighting. <br /> <br /> * Treebeard makes a very short look and I was sorry she looked up to show everything. Watch the movie, you see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Okay, now the movie's good parts. <br /> <br /> * Some voice acting is pretty good. Aragorn SOUNDS is not bad, he just looks like Jolly Green Giant. <br /> <br /> Galadriel is somewhat interesting in this imagination; like Tom Bombad, he seems immune to the Ring's temptations, and his voice actor is not terrible. <br /> <br /> * Boromir's death is not as close to heart as Jackson is depicting the same scene, but it is still dramatic (and true to the death of his book, though I don't think Jackson made a mistake when he did) . <br /> <br /> * As my professor pointed out (whispered threats), orcs (mostly Helmi deep when I am right) resemble the corpses of soldier soldiers, a political statement that works pretty well when you understand what is trying. <br /> <br /> * Although this is not a really positive point about the film, Baksh cannot be blamed for most of the mistakes in this movie, or as I was told - the project was within budget and its late production lost creative control to some of the higher ones ( who i'm sure they didn't read these books). <br /> <br /> Allow me to be clear: I respect Baksh even trying something like a soul of this size. I just find it hard to believe he was happy with the end products. In general, I cannot in any way suggest to tolerate the blasphemy of Tolkien's classic trilogy, even laughing, if you have not already read books and have your own personal visions of characters, places and events. I'm sure somebody will choose a copy of this confused; if you do, keep an open mind and try what's good for it.
