This is the story of the television version, the film begins as an "Xena ..." episode with little meaningful dialogue or character description. After a while, it gets a little bit more meaningful, but all the characters are still a comic. <br /> <br /> Salma is an exotic beauty. Richard Harris is a bad and sexually repressed Frollo who wants to break a nut in Salmas. Other characters, including Quasimodo, are quite forgotten. <br /> <br /> This is also the liberal liberal version of the story, Frollo is a blocker of enlightenment ideals, such as "The Name of the Rose", and Quasimodo is the winner of freedom. The hidden character of the quasi is ignored, although it casts fluid that is directed to humans. He is really only an external factor in that he looks differently and enjoys playing watches more than the average person. Perhaps this film is for children, but I doubt it, considering Frollo's shepherds themselves to be bloody, that he would want his monkey to shoot. Mainly uninteresting and forgotten but not terrible and sometimes fun magazine.
