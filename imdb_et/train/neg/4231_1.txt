I felt obliged to watch this movie all the time because I had found it in a good box and bought it for myself, but I came many times to turn it off and just to pay for it. If you're a fan of gore and sadism, this movie is OK. If there is one thing the filmmakers know, the creative use of counterfeit blood and body parts is a disease. If you don't like it, leave it away. <br /> <br /> This movie is filmed with a home video camera with classic school props and terrible actors. It is dubbed from German, but even allowing this sound is terrible. This movie has a budget budget, except for the special effects mentioned above. If they had spent a little more money on actors and on a real script instead of blood and gut, the film could have been more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> There are about three men on an island inhabited by a tin-masked sadist army. They are caught and the rest of the movie is about to escape. I call this story the most freely because it is really a scene of torture and struggle that has been put together by a blind dialogue with darkness. <br /> <br /> There is nothing about this movie unless it is like a frantic gore. Think of warning yourself.
