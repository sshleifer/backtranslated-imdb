The ORCA is not exactly bad, but it's not Richard Harris's best lesson either. As a fisherman like Ahder, Harris begins with a winner who is hostile to the killer whale after the whale's "wife" and the unborn child are killed. Charlotte Rampling plays a whale scientist working with Harris. He punishes him much for the importance of leaving nature alone. He does not listen and somehow reaches the Arctic, which fights with vengeance with mad whale. There are no special effects to talk about, except what looks like a round mirror for a whale eye - there are endless Harris shots that are reflected in the eyes, so the audience understands that the whale knows who it is. Bo Derek, as one of Harris's crew is particularly uncomfortable running Orca and most of the supporting pain, including Robert Carridine, Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn, is not very good either.
