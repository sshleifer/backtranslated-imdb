I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor, so I was very interested in how he works as a writer / director. I would not be more disappointed with this step. The film was so separate and the cinema was so far off that I wanted to pull the plug out of the wall. The participants were very good, but it was a waste of talent. Not all participants are writers or directors and Mr. Hopkins is clearly in this category. Of all the 50-year-old movies I've ever seen, it's the worst movie. Please do all of us, Mr Hopkins, and avoid doing what you are great, and leave those who are talented in these areas writing and guiding. If I could give less than one rating to this movie, definitely.
