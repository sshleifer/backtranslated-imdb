I feel that the film does not represent Smith historically. The purpose of this film was to say to Smith's life that it would be "convenient" for LDS Church leaders, historical accuracy seems to be of little concern. The purpose of the film was to be a "faith-promoting" experience, not a balanced view of Smith as a man. I've taken it to study the life of Smith and I've read both LDS works and any LDS work. The film, like most LDS projects, was filmed and worked well. But this was not a realistic idea of ​​the beginning of Mormonism or Smith's relatively short life. <br /> <br /> A remarkable period of time was given to reinstate the accident that Smith had been in for seven years. Although this event was undoubtedly important in shaping his spiritual outlook, it seems that the main reason for incorporating it into the film is to help understand Joseph Smith's sympathetic view. The second point is the depiction of Smith's teenage years when the film does not speak of the Smith family's participation in magical practices during the 1820s. The other problem is that the film shows Joseph Smith entering a wrestling race, it doesn't show how he sometimes lost his temperature and became violent. <br /> <br /> I can go on and on. This film was in no way historical and should be considered a fictional film of man. I wouldn't want to see this movie for any purpose other than entertainment.
