never look at this movie ... this is the biggest bunch of sh * that I've ever met throughout my life. and it says something. acting, story and filming were absolutely terrible, it's WORLD FILM IN WORLD !!! serious that it doesn't even give you a hit, because it cost you 99th sainsburys and it was only made in 2005? hahaha this movie is like a cheap college movie that can even be seen in the corner of the screen .... though if u want to watch it, you have to look at the "scary shark scene" ... maybe the best thing i've seen in my life ... ha ha. i mean seriously, this is the biggest waste 2 1/2 hours EVER !!
