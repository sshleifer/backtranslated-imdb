3lbs is obviously just a self-evident program for Stanley Tucci to be a manufacturer / fancier deep doctor. Unlike House, he has no personality and, unlike Gray anatomy, brain surgery cases are not even interesting. This program should be set in the leading Neurlogics case center - but here's nothing interesting or exciting! Even the so-called pathetic "hatred" between him and the rival does not show anything in the play and does not do hallucinations. In the pilot, there was a brief glimpse of the social life of the leaders as a father - stabbing! boring and pointless. This performance is trousers, now there is a medical drama that does nothing special.
