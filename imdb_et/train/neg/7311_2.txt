Okay, I had heard a little about this movie, so when I came to the TV movie channels, I wanted to watch it, being scary. I think I can make a collective "ah?" anyone who watched it. <br /> <br /> I decided to move on with my life, but in my party with my closest friends we saw that it was coming and some of us who saw that we had already decided to laugh our way, so we both declare that "this is the eternal thing I've ever seen. It wasn't scary; Give it to Roth (who thinks it's a young cage); characters change throughout the movie area "Cube". <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, regardless of your typical "cage rat" scenario, whoever turns on, who, etc., was a pretty mean horror. > <br /> Some points: 1.) What was with this child? I'm not even talking about being strange and biting people. I'm talking about all the "slow motion karate kicking", what was it? 2.) Okay, I know Rider's character liked Jordan Ladd, but when I was a young woman, I was terrified that she just went on and molested her in a dream. It is illegal. <br /> <br /> 3.) Roth was in the movie so Roth could be in the movie. Talk about meaningless writing yourself! 4.) What was the Deputy? 5.) So he pulled off the dog immediately? And there was little that there was no blood left? Just his jeans? Anyway we READ our donkeys off, and I love to laugh during horror movies (back live by dead 2, Evil Dead), but I don't know if we should have laughed here ...
