This totally boring, pointless, pointless, spiritual and stupid movie is not the ultimate proof that the world can forget about Danny Boyle and his "Trainspotting" films: "The Beach" has already taken care of it. What is strange about this small budget is just securing your place among those who started very well, but with drugs, rhinitis, ego, self-deception, bad leadership, or whatever it was that led to the promising quick death of the director > <br /> The premise is absurd: two losers (Ecclestone and some bimbo Jenna G - rapper, most likely) will meet randomly and start spontaneously singing more like a duo of potential shelter - what they change. His friend - an even greater illiterate loser - becomes their leader when they break down the window of the store and steal the camcorder he's filming in "action", and then shows the tape to some music that really is interested in garbage. Now I know that in recent years, the UK has been an amazing junk, but it is ridiculous; Music makes Oasis seem like The Beatles. During studio recording, the duo - Strumpet - changes the words in every key and Ecclestone tells the music that the boys take it or leave it, and quite absurdly they take it. Music is not only a complete and complete trash, but its "performers" are antisocial; these NEWCOMERS should call the frames. It's just too stupid. It's just terrible. <br /> <br /> The dialogue has failed and goes somewhere and this bird-bitch story doesn't make sense and makes no sense. It often seems to be under the influence of improvised drugs. Danny Boyle is a complete idiot. This little trash is so bad that it is embarrassing to look. Ecclestone I.Q. you also have to ask if you agree to be meaningless. Anyone who funded this Â£ 1,000 joke should leave the film industry before they sell their underwear on the street.
