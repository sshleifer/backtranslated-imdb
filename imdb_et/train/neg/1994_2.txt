This film, which originally appeared during the Christmas of 1940, was lost. A very bad copy has been restored and made for a CD, now for sale. Don't buy it! The film is incredibly horrible. Casting is bad, the script is terrible and management is terrible. <br /> <br /> Picture Roland Young is singing and dancing. And that was highlighting. <br /> <br /> This movie may have deliberately lost.
