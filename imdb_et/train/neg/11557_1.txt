* SOILER * It's fake! The whole thing is fake! There are no ghosts or zombies, Alan is the Lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something that wants the castle and his name for himself. So he makes this overly complicated and unnecessary pointless plan for the suicide of SCOOBY-DOO Alan. Most of the movie is his redheads and attacks them. He hasn't even killed them. She falls asleep and the girl disappears and thinks she was buried. When he looked at Evelyn. To the ghost, he can say he's wearing gloves! My God, a waste of time. Do not bother looking at it, renting it and if you bought it and haven't watched it, sell it. Fast! Take advantage and stay away from the HIGH NIGHT EVELYN CAME. I give this stapler CRAP-O-LANTERN.
