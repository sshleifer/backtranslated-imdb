Another Rape of History <br /> <br /> This movie is a disaster; it simply uses a historical story and makes a sweet love story with poor-performing and low-budget production. <br /> <br /> The movie should be 1/3 of the time, they just dragged the time to make a mini-series. The battle scenes are so stupid and illogical, soldering is stupid, costumes are a disaster. The Romans were open to fighting in good places, one of their armies completely destroying the Germans when they tried to fight in the forest, in this film, the Romanians decided to fight on the city side. > <br /> And how Cleopatra came from Macedonia, which means a light skinned person.
