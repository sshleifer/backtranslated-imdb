Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn would get into their graves if they knew that coming to the dinner area was actually in theaters. Together with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton, these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with director Stanley Kramer's 1967 masterpiece. This modern hanging is a joke. So a white man from too stereotyped Italian family in Rhode Island brings his African-American girlfriend home (adds GASP here) to his big father's funeral. The reactions of his family members were of course ... predictable. This movie was so painful from the beginning of the telegraph to the end when my girlfriend actually started to fake to let me know she wanted to leave. Take your preference and rent the original. Take on Wake.
