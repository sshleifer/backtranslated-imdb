This movie was the first time I saw it for the first time when it was called "Lost in Translation". But somehow Bill Murray became an eccentric black man played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson became a tough Latino woman played by Paz Vega and Tokyo, Japan, which became Carson in California. Instead of meaningful conversations and silence that we enjoyed in translation, we get meaningless blabbering with 10 elements that limit the annoyance. Instead of entertaining and introspective characters, we get letters that give us meaningless advice on topics they have no idea. How can a hundred-dollar T-shirt, which has never been within the target department, count on the workgroup's wife to prepare for a job interview as an administrator? Don't think it stops him. If he doesn't give his dress advice, he will tell him what he should eat. The most disturbing part of the movie for me was how they allegedly hurried to make meetings, but the characters keep the time to run the second command, whether it's car washing, stopping at Arby, or just circumventing their 10 products or less lists of things they love and hate. I wanted to shout at them, saying, "Didn't you say you got to be somewhere? What the hell is doing? A moment ago you were almost late, now you eat roasted beef and pondering your life!" As long as I saw this movie, I have never really understood how something could be "called for", but I think this film does it accurately and unwillingly. The dialogue makes the characters nervous and unreasonable, except that I was sorry for both participants signing this project.
