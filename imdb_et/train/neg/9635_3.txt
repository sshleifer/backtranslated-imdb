WOW! Pretty terrible stuff. Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor highway is showing land in Sardinia and connects with artistic director Joseph Losey for his remarkably bad Tennessee Williams fiasco. Taylor plays a rich, dying widow who keeps her minions over the island, where she dictates her memories very much to the patient's secretary. When Burton shows that he is a poet and an old friend, Taylor understands that his time is over. Extreme Extreme --- It's hard to determine if Taylor and Burton are acting bad OR if it was Williams' intention to make their characters so unpleasant. If that is the case, the actor is great! Burton mumbles his lines, including the word BOOM several times, while Taylor strikes him. He's really terrible. So Noel Coward like Taylor's tough confidant, "Capri's Witch". <br /> <br /> It is expected that BOOM will have a short time and how fast life moves --- two standard Williams themes, but Losey has misunderstood that Taylor and Burton were not for the public their mostly inanic monologues, any substance that the film would have completely diluted. <br /> <br /> BOOM has fabulous photography --- the camera should have focused on screwing Sardinia's beauty! Supporting luminaires are Joanna Shimkus, a great Romolo Valli as the inventive doctor of Taylor, and Michael Dunn as a nasty dwarf security guard ... he and his dogs are numbering in Burton!
