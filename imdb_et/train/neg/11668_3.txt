There's pretty landscape shots. Writers who put their faith in the mouth of their mouth. With less participants, this exhibition would be stupid. "Art must raise humanity or BS." Not so, because the art mentioned by all is also a mix of humanity and a blind person. The sign even says that those who do not drink hide the shadow. Wrong, he lived in the darkness and repressed his blind to drinking and being one-dimensional, not expanding his horizons besides the landscape. In his work there was no respiratory organ and no expression of pain. The whole artist was confined to dimming ten landscapes. Discussions between characters were classmates, trotting things that gave the writer's wish to one character. I tried this after reading all the first wow comments here. I had to dig to see those I agreed with. I think the big comments were related to the people connected to the film. I was only finished once. The child was too passive. The scenery was nice and the music was ridiculous. Just my opinion, but I am not shown.
