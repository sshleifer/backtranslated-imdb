This is a film that tries to trace the history of Thailand, located in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this movie because I thought it was a line of many Thai films that I watched and enjoyed, with Thai actors talking about the madness of Thai and martial arts. It's nothing. This movie is fully captured in English, full of Anglo actors and has production values ​​so terrible that it is ridiculously bad ... but not funny! Who can blame for this garbage? Functioning, dialogue and most of the kits were pretty bad. Some fighting scenes looked like a choreographer by a local high school drama club. The special effects were mostly bad, but some were just an inexpensive animation that was placed on the screen that gave the cheese a lot. It has one big epic style exit scene, where a few thousand eccentrics arrive in the costume field, but when we see two armies collide in battle - HA! What a joke! The film has a couple of beauty. I'm sorry they didn't have a little more skin. At least it would have been something for the boys to value. Do not worry.
