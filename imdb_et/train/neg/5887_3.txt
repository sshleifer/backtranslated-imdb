Jane Russell turned out to be a pleasant music comedian like "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"? but unfortunately this film destroys these skills. There's a budget and nice Paris photography, but the movie just doesn't work. Russell seems to be playing Marilyn Monroe. This leaves someone Jane Russell playing enough. Some other players are out of their elements. <br /> <br /> There are several embarrassing scenes; first and foremost, be warned: there is a musical number where silver African cannibals "put" in pots of brunettes, after singing Alan Young in a gorilla suit. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting, sometimes embarrassing, waste of resources. <br /> <br /> Married to Brunettes (10/29/55) Richard Sale ~ Jane Russell, Jeanne Crain, Alan Young, Scott Brady
