Well, to answer one person's question, "Why can't anyone remember this movie?" this is because, really, not so many people saw it in 1978 and it hasn't been shown much on television. (If this is a video that would be a news for me!) Even in the sometimes useless comedy era of the 70s, the film's visitors had the opportunity to avoid this movie. If they don't like Billy Crytal, Paul Lynd or Joan Rivers, then "a lot"! <br /> <br /> Paul Lynde was a funny "Bewitched" or "Hollywood Squares" here. Joan Rivers laughs during his career, making brutal jokes about the lack of weight of singer Karen Carpenter! Har-har Joan! It also seems that in the age of each "somewhat" famous name. (The most surprising is Doris Roberts later "Everybody Loves Raymond".) Anyway, the story of a somewhat good idea, a woman who becomes pregnant instead of a woman, goes here. With the help of the male friend Crystal you can get help with the whore to finally lose your virginity, but because she was "up" instead of her, she gets pregnant! (Comment on women who take away men positions). <br /> <br /> Kristal's belly grows, she passes through all the feminine emotions and feelings associated with them. Unfortunately, he is now misunderstood socially. He attacks the mob who wants to rub him (I think). <br /> <br /> He is forced to divorce his child ... helped. Or if you want, marble (God knows only where he can be! Ewwww!) She turns out to be a girl (there is no shock here!)! <br /> <br /> Everything else about this movie is worthless and forgotten, humor is high school or less. <br /> <br /> 2 stars with a good idea and some good touch and relevant moments / Billy Crystal. Ignore the rest of the Rabitt Test, this flunks great time! <br /> <br /> I can't believe Roddy McDowell has signed up! (END)
