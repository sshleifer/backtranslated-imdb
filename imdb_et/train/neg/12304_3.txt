I watched this movie last week, and I had the biggest laughter. The film's plot is pretty stupid and badly designed. The only plus is Corey Savier's impressive abs. Alexandra Paul (I think this is her name) is a terrible woman as a preacher who has had depression. Ted McKenzie is tough and his character is on it. And if the fact that you think he's having sex with his son is not enough, they will cast unnecessary German songs in every possible way. The end and peak of this movie is absolutely exhausting and ridiculous. I mean, who the hell wants to carry your child, who was trying to guess you were your son and you had an incredible relationship with him!
