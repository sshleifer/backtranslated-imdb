The third prisoner of space in the deaths of the room is able to hijack a space shuttle and escape to American forests, where he, together with some new friends found, is trying to escape from the "stranger" female Cyborg killing machine. Fred's Ray's best movie, "Hollywood Chainsaw Hooks," it can't help but feel a bit behind. Just as low a budget as the previous movie, but not nearly as fun as me. None of the actors differed from me, the film is shameful for a non-discriminatory viewer on a Saturday afternoon, but it's pretty good. <br /> <br /> My degree: D + <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Thriller
