It was a new alltime among Western countries. Writing is terrible, the characters are impossible to emphasize and they are disgusting or blissful, violence is terrible and technically very convincing. And Tobey Maguire shows us the backside of her talent, the talk of sleep through her part with their non-expression eyes, and her heavy voice that only puts the motif here. "Fucking with the devil" is one of my five worst film experiences that the West has never crossed the negative.
