Stewart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, VANITY FAIR) runs his local Jindabyne, Australian fishing friends vacation, vacation and relaxation weekend. But when Stewart discovers an aboriginal woman's body that floats down the river, things seem to be the worst. The biggest accident of the weekend is men's tenderness. They won't get out of the mountain and stop fishing with some big catches of the weekend. Then they control and report on the body. <br /> <br /> The city and men's lives are quickly becoming confused. The local media blame them and the accusations of indigenous peoples from indigenous peoples. Stewart's wife, Claire (Laura Linney, EMILY ROSE EXORCISM), has a deeper sense of what her husband and her friends did, but she has to fight it through her mental illness. <br /> <br /> All this chaos is the life that was the young woman who is now a media spectrum put on a morgue plate. His murder and subsequent displacement in the water symbolize the subdivision of men and women, black and white, social and drowning, beneath the city of Jindabyne. part of what is happening are two young children: Stewart and Claire's son, led by about one and a half breeds of Aussie, who were killed a few years ago. A young girl lives with her grandparents and tries to let her mother know how she can best and the discovery of a new body? strangely ?? the method by which it can be achieved (again, the current underlying Jindabyne is assumed). <br /> <br /> Everything and everything in this Jindabyne parish knows what lies beneath it, but none of them wants to dive into the twilight waters and look around (the symbolism here is to see the nearby lake used for resting and swimming, contains the old town of Jindabyne below it). No, that is, until Claire forces them. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting as a little too complicated. There are too many stories that need to be researched and it just doesn't; too many loose threads. The action was okay, but filming was terrible. Wobbly cameras, grainy or dark shots and just general consolation harmed the overall production. <br /> <br /> I like the symbolic movie, NORTHFORK is one of my all-time favorites. But Jindabyne was supposed to have her head above the cloudy water to see her problems that just didn't happen.
