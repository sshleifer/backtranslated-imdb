Black boy fights ..... and supposedly wins .... yeah ... 1/10. Apparently there is fiction. <br /> <br /> So we're going to present a pretty nice title, a real nice label line and even a nice plot. That's where it's going to end. that is the case. <br /> <br /> Michael Jai White, a black boy, so you can't be confused with the name .. depicting a black man .. Umm, it's all called .. <br /> <br /> It's so hard to find good help, must have hired black friends to help create a small budget, a little failure of this movie, the camera shades behind the first scene .... Yes, the obvious moment of idiots to the average man like you and me .. but yes ... <br /> <br /> 10 lines. submitted for review. if you pay for watching this movie, you're screwed.
