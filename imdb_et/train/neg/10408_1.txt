If Fassbinder has made a bad movie, I don't want to see it! Anyone who complains that his films are too talkative and claustrophobic should be forced to watch it, learn to appreciate the more free style he has chosen for great films, such as "Petra von Kant's bitter tears". This film captures so many artistic, quasi-symbolic images that looks like a "movie" parody. The scene and scene of slaughterhouses, where Elvira's prostitute friend is channeling, which seems to be ten minutes, is just two of the most striking examples of making this film's viewer a real test. But what makes me angry is some scenes with only Elvira and his ex-wife and / or his daughter. These are the only moments that show true human emotion and prove that at the heart of this terrible film was an excellent film that fought to free itself. What waste.
