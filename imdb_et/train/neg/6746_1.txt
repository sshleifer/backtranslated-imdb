* SPOILERS INCLUDED * <br /> <br /> With a title like "Bleed", you know that this puppy wasn't high when that puppy was. The film is your main low budget slasher film. Oh, sure it's trying to be creative with the assumption of a murder club, but we know it was a joke anyway. Okay, for those who care very much about these things, the basic thing is that the new girl in the city is starting to get to know her co-worker. He invites him to the circle of his friends and the feast tells him how they have a "murder club" and they kill people, blah blah blah. Well, we know it's all a joke, but not before our heroine kills the parking lot. The "members" of the murder club are now killed one by one. Oh, and the bad guys win and the movie ends with the shooter. By that time you will never care. <br /> <br /> Looking back, the first 10 minutes of this movie don't make sense. The motivation for the killings at the beginning of the film has never been explained. I would say that this was the way the director put out the movie, but the DVD has deleted scenes! I'm not sure why anyone would want to see more than the "Bleed" feature length, but probably the people behind the DVD thought the viewers wanted more. The box says that there are Easter eggs, but why hell would I waste my time to look for additional films about this movie about me. <br /> <br /> I had been waiting for a bad movie and "Bleed" that was shipped on this front. However, this was not a fun bad movie. Everyone looks good in the movie and there is a lot of nudity, but the actor is just terrible. My least favorite character is the man who will be the killer ... I think he should be funny and fun, but he just comes off the tool. I think the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills a terrifying fearsome death in the car park. The heroine strikes women at the cement house of the parking house and the woman looks like she barely strikes the thing and spits the mouth of the blood and dies. <br /> <br /> For those who think that making movies is complicated, the creative process that professionals do is look at "Bleed". It will change your mind and you will understand that the movie can do. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money.
