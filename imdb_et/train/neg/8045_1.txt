I'm so confused. What was this world? What was the killer's motivation? He seemed quite angry, but I haven't realized why. Nothing in this movie makes sense. Its depth was zero. Or less than zero depth. What I think is a mountain. Or a bunch. For. Operation was terrible. When I was looking for some of the participants in this movie, they had very few things I heard and it came as a whole surprise. I can't decide if I feel that I am embarrassed that I have been in a movie or feel that they should never be back in action. Getting started. . . NOW! (Seinfeld's reference.) Really, don't waste your time with it. There are so few substances that there is nothing that would even be a joke. It was undoubtedly one of the worst slippers - NO, one of the worst rails of ANE KIND that I've ever had a misfortune to watch, and I've seen quite a few.
