I had to leave the theater. After an hour, everyone saw that people cheat women, danced like dogs on a rout, and used an F-word like a diabetic using Equal. <br /> <br /> Thank you. <br /> <br This was especially frustrating because the film could have done a lot. None of these characters could have been quite interesting if they were given more than to rob, talk about it and swear to each other. <br /> <br /> A few times when it seemed to be a kind of character, everything that happened was the other sex. The development of the plot in the first hour can be summed up as 1) several murders, 2) Vinnie sees the murder scene 3) Vinnie looks over the Atlantic / East / Hudson River 4) Vinnie deceives a woman; and 5) Joey (the most likeable character) gets her parents out of the house. What's more, I didn't expect to see. <br /> <br /> The combination of photography and characters was great, but they had nothing to do. Sex and vulgar floods are hardly worth waiting for another hour for SOMETHING to happen. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Spike. Take some lessons from Notting Hill or Shawshank Redemption. Each of them is a better study of community and human relationships.
