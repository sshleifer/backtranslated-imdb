This movie is completely rubbish. Some imbecilic intellectual comforting oneself, doing their best to demand the superiority of the aristocrat over the working class. Nothing is more than self-satisfied catharsis. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> If such a movie is set in the US, it will definitely make a big joke. And just because it comes out on the other hand, he makes a masterpiece, great entertainment for some of the western parts of brainwash and / or brain-washing (some George W. maybe :). The typical consequences of the Cold War, some sort of joke anyway. <br /> <br /> I would say that if this - as expressed in this movie - is all that the Soviet intellectuals had thought in all these years, then maybe they deserve all the suffering they claimed. IF NOT! Because, like many others, I have read and followed the real great Soviet intellectuals. For example, there is something important with the dog "White Bim Black Ear" - both Gavriil Troyepolski's book and Stanislav Rostotsky's film - is a real masterpiece. Real life, a real tragedy, a real sad, real pride and dignity, the real best of the Soviet era.
