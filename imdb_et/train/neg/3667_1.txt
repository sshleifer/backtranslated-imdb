Open the scene "explains" why Hurt is immune to the "contaminated man" later. Too bad not to explain anything else: how he got what he "tries" / what it was / why it works so fast. Then we go to "modern Budapest". OK, was the opener in the past or the future? Of course, this turns out to be a thing of the past, but within a few minutes it seems that the second part of the film is at the beginning. Sorry, I should have paid more attention? Or maybe it's just bad. Then there is a lot of confusion in the different jobs he has in related fields, and finally, how he should have died during the initial experiment he did. Aha! So n and a private industry came together to poison one of their top men to see the effects? He must have been one of the top men, he is a chemical company, for God's sake, with friends. Then the substance itself is a technically poison, but it mutates in the 'carriers' of the immune system, so we have what we want; poison, disease, allergic reaction, all very different things in real life. Magically, it is not only a carrier that is contagious to another deadly victim. How convenient. Then there is a protocol: they jump into the situation without having any idea what is in store or how to prepare it. Didn't the producers have enough money to show proper washing after the team just left the deadly unknown substance scene? I was thinking that Hurt would die from a bad cleaning technique and the open scene would eventually be closer.
