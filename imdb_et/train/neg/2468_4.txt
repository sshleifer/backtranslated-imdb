It wasn't that big. Not terrible or angry, nothing, just forgotten. <br /> <br /> It was some sort of hesitant, diluted air, as he never knew if he wanted to laugh or go for a sweet or satire. So we stayed with three weak blends. The actors seemed lost. <br /> <br /> The ideas were also really tired and recycled, almost zombied themselves. How many times do you have to tell us that in the 50s you have been infected with a banal match? And that was confirmed by aggressive consumption? And this emotional repression in men is a baaaaad thing? Old hat. <br /> <br /> Its greatest crime in my eyes was just how it separated from reality. I know it was comedy and everything, but - especially in the full length movie where you have to listen to the audience for a long time - you still need some emotional anchor through some relatable guide to make it interesting. In order for a "hero" child to look at an old woman, two schoolchildren, and finally her father dying painfully in zombies or in any hand, and to happily greet it with a smile and shrug, I just accept it in any positive sense. Mom was the same. If you make your two main characters so inhuman at this level, you risk losing me and it happened. <br /> <br /> The biggest positive thing I offer is that I love the appearance of apple pie suburbs and it hit it well enough, it was a beautiful movie, especially some of these wide-angle streets and inside Robinson's house. The newspaper was also lovely, already made, but still in a funny way. <br /> <br /> And I thought Billy Connolly was OK and it comes from someone who isn't a big fan of Billy Connolly: Movie Star. I just had the fear that he would seize it and try to steal every scene, but he played with him a rather low key and apparently the most sensible character appeared in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's not very big.
