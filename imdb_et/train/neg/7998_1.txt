Not only did she want to listen to her, but she didn't have fun. I swear that some fobby Asian boys who say mummy jokes would have been more funny than Leary's mess. (Well, maybe funny for a few minutes, but at least I'm at least laughing!) Leary said she stopped taking drugs during one of her "jokes" ... she was probably still high; he was just some of the prank-like impressions that were mostly drug-related. One of his jokes was something like, "I wouldn't use a crack, especially the same name as my ass" - Oh man, how did he come out?! I swear that the only man holding f ** k up is Denis Leary. Thank God I didn't have to see him. This man sucks. <br /> <br /> If you have been attracted to it and "jokes" where you can come, you will waste your time on this spam.
