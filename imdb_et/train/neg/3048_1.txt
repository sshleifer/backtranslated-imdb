This is probably the most powerful Santa Claus who is ever dedicated to any medium, be it a book, a picture or a movie. Santa Claus looks at how the children looked, and the twisted story of Merlin to help him defeat one of the people of Satan, Pitch, doesn't make things better. Less is ridiculous, with bad consequences, even for the 1959 standards. If the child had to watch this movie, he would have nightmares and he wouldn't want Santa to arrive. They would be intimidated for life. Imagine being a "Christmas Story" when they start yelling after Santa Claus. So it would look like a child would see this movie.
