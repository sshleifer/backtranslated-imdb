When I work in a video store, I see a lot of movies and sometimes I try to watch some of the not so big movies. Proud happened to one of them. The first idea of ​​a black ship story during World War II was of no use. However, less than 10 minutes after watching the film, it turns out that the primary point of the film was to talk about the racial tension of World War II. The basic story is about the ship, the crew and their military equipment. This primary point grabs you all over the movie. I commend the men who served the USS Mason for their triumph over the reluctance and hardships they suffered. The film should have been done focusing on the achievements that these men made for the Navy and for their country, and not for the film that focuses on racism during World War II.
