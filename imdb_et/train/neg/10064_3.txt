The Pokemon Movie was a terrible movie. unlike the first, it's not a good movie at all. the graphics were decent, but the story was flat and there was no real drama. in the first part, the communication between the characters was decent. Brock separation and adding tracey was bad. Tracey doesn't really have much to say or do, and unlike the brock, there is no comic relief. the only good points are when you see the mist to get over the ashes, and his early brooding, called his girlfriend, was fun. generally this movie is not worth renting and a short film did nothing for me or my wife. and we consider ourselves a pokemon fan. well, maybe the next better better
