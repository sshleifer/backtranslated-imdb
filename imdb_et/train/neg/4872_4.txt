The collection of jokes about the production line that pretends to be "Babe" has never been done; the writers clearly hoped that seeing the animals was enough to keep the film. This is not. Eddie Murphy sells again as a doctor who discovers his forgotten childhood gift to understand the constant and effortless preaching of guinea pigs, tigers, rats, dogs and pigeons. The voice is impressive (Albert Brooks, Julie Kavner, Reni Santoni, John Leguizamo, Garry Shandling, Ellen DeGeneres, Paul Reubens, Brian Doyle-Murray), but the script is so unimaginable, charming and frustrating that the whole thing rolls into the trash quite quickly.
