The problem with this film is that it is captured on the worst possible camera and the film is blurry and grainy. Perhaps it is just the fact that the person who held the camera was unable to hold on because they had a seizure or something. There are too many poo and vomiting in this movie. Everyone twenty minutes is being vomited and it makes me think something bulimic or something did. It was disgusting. Then it is annoying high-level shouting that continues and continues and does not end before the credit rolls. I also didn't like it when all his friends had shot (or not, I don't know) and he goes into the van and puts the band's aids in. It was just really stupid to even do it in the movie. How much gas can a person siphon to become a commercial? It must be the whole batch because the rest of the movie doesn't come out of gas. It was a terrible movie and I would never recommend seeing it all in my life.
