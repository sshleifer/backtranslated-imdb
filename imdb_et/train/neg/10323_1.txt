I was delighted to see sitcom, which I hope would represent Indian Candian, but I found this show not funny at all. Manufacturers and cast are obviously happy to get both bad and good feedback because, to the extent they are concerned, it's about talking! I was ready for some stereotyping and there is no problem, because stereotypes exist for a reason, they are usually true. But there was nothing funny about these stereotypical signs. "Fresh boat" father who does not understand his daughter. A radical feminist Muslim daughter (who by the way is a terrible actor) and a young Indian man who tries to control his mosque as politically as possible (he is a pretty good actor, I see him as better). /> <br /> it is very natural and the dialog does not flow well. there were so many ways to do something like that, but unfortunately I think it failed, and don't care about looking at another episode. <br /> <br /> However, I enjoyed the great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again, she's always treating her and everything she does is too bad her daughter's show is not doing the same!
