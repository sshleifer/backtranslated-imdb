By now you should know from this movie that Jessica Simpson's "bomb", which went quite a bit straight into the video (limited, anemic theater rush). Basically, Mrs Simpson is driving Katie from a small town to Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend to surprise her to find her in bed with another woman. She's stranded, but she has one friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I want to see more often in the movie), who lets her stay. Katie works through two accompanying colleagues (Penelope Ann Miller and always fun Andy Dick) who just use Katie to become the president of the company (Larry Miller). It is a strictly b-film that is not meant to be deep. Jessica Simpson is by no means an excellent actor, but she is pretty much beautiful and never irritating. The film is traceable in that it is not abomination, but thrown away. Penny Marshall is funny in the pan (a little joke about Milwaukee made me smile) and there is a funny scene with Norwegian priests (not reading too much). So, not terrible, but easy to skip. Your secure contribution is to watch it on television if it ever does. Again, there is no good but no deep disaster.
