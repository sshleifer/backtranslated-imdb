Steven Seagal was severely damaged by this film. Or as I should say Steven So-dull! As before, Seagal is either too good or too stupid to duplicate its lines, leaving someone to embody their voice for frames where the sound needs a loop. A few movies before that he had done it, but I don't think so much! Frankly, the movie looks pretty good, the script could use some work, but some of this movie looked like a real movie! Of course, all this said, this movie is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> It would have been much better without Seagalita, who has become her own comic. Do not worry. There's too much of this one! I honestly believe that this is the last time for me and Seagal film. What took me so long to understand?!
