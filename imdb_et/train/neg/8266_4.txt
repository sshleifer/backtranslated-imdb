What is this bliep * with this movie? Didn't they get a better script? All in all, a "nice" movie, but ... it's been done more than once ... Until the end I thought it was okay, but ... back to the past ... * barf * So waited ... fairy tale mother would appear ... but wow, it didn't happen ... that's good. such a film with a new child with another child who wanted to be older / bigger; just so it is, <br /> <br /> Just look until it appears on the TV. Don't do me wrong, but that's not all
