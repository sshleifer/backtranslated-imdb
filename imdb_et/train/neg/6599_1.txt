Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a well-known actor. Practically all the movies he's done are better. Now George was absolutely doing something like that ... but he once said something that describes the movie for T.. I don't remember his exact words, but he said basically that great writing can save you from bad action, but excellent performance can't save Bad Writing. This little observation has never been more serious than "all new adventures of Laurel and Hardy: for love or mommy". <br /> <br /> Casting two drivers was absolutely perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy) not only see parts, but also do an exceptionally good job of imitating the actual transaction (wisdom and all). This film should remain a permanent testimony of their talents. This means that this film will face your face (you thought it) WRITING. <br /> <br /> After the opening dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain (which was very characteristic) and the gag associated with a short taxi, this movie is an absolute chore to sit through. <br /> <br /> PROBLEM # 1: Too much time and effort went to the plot. <br /> <br /> I don't want to know why the mummy wants to rob a British lady. What I want to see is Stan and Ollie (or at least their stand-ins). Too much screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or non-very funny secondary characters that turned around the plot. <br /> <br /> But even if this movie was all jokes, it was still ... <br /> <br /> PROBLEM # 2: Most jokes are what I would call "water" . <br /> <br /> What do I mean by "soaked"? <br /> <br /> Length, injury moves due to comedy effect (Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges ..., or Laurel & Hardy?). <br /> <br /> "Created" in slapstick (as I define it), the character gets slightly hurt or uncomfortable, and the filmmakers play it for a comedy effect. <br /> <br /> An example might be: <br /> <br /> Looney Tuning gets Daffy Duck by Elmer Fudd. His bill falls off and he puts it back. This is a classic shot. <br /> <br /> In this "pearl" Ollie accidentally hits some people. They turn around, tell him to be careful, and continue your joy. It's not dirty. It's not even funny. It's just ... boring ... and this movie is full of such jokes. It's like the film's bread and butter. Writers and directors take these very moments and act as they should be funny. The example I just gave is the most extreme case, but I can relax it so much. <br /> <br /> A short story: The movie doesn't work because the script doesn't use Pinchot and Sartain's ability to reveal Stan and Ollie. Instead, the script uses plot plot and flat jokes. Watching this movie is basically looking at two great emperors who were not given any real material. <br /> <br /> Not a good movie, but incredible sleeping bags. <br /> <br /> I say this one shortcoming and stick to the real deal (just as long as you don't run "Atoll K" and "Be Big").
