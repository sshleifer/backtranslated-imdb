Dr Tarr's Torture Cave includes a journalist traveling to a crazy shelter to write about the new methods they use with their patients. But the journalist will soon discover that things are not what they seem to be, and patients are guided by shelter and doctors are in cages. First, some parts of the movie are just clean and just want to sleep, and interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons (for example, a man who thinks he is a chicken). I have to admit that the story is actually pretty good, but the film itself is bombarded. The music of the movie is really strange and something you would hear in some madness comedy, and yes, there is a scene where dancers participate, which pretty much made me turn off the screen. Watch this movie at your own risk! <br /> <br /> Rated: R violence and nudity.
