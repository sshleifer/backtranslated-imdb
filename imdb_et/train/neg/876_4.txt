Until the last 20 minutes, I thought it was probably Jackie Chan's worst film (except for his 1978 work I don't know). The final battleground changed it all: it is long and good and intense - indeed, one of Chani's career highlights. But in order to get there, you have to sit through a lot of "comedies" that could enjoy five years of joy (oh, look, someone threw a tomato on a tomato face) and endless "football" scenes. Not to mention duplication (which includes the line "How can I turn it off? It's not a tap" - see how it refers). "Dragon Lord" pays for letting alone for the final fight, but the rest of the movie is only for Jackie's collectors and even for those who have already seen at least 15 of his other films. (**)
