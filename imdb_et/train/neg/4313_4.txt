Like last year, I couldn't sit the whole thing. Okay, so Chris Rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely interesting. Or rather, of all the eternal cages packed in the theater, he was not at least 10 most boring. At the same time, many rapporteurs were glorified in the top 10 of this. I didn't know the whole thing was done with autocue (although I knew it was written), but it was really terrible to see those supposedly good actors who can't enter the expression, fail to praise and stumble over simple words (Natalie Portman ? The length of Fancy Dresses and boring calls was long and tedious, Beyonce Knowles did some good stories and had very few decent reception calls and clips. Adam Sandler wins the worst report. <br /> <br /> To help me with this review write, I would like to thank everyone in my mother, father, my lawyers and all my pedicure who believe in me, and I would like to point out that I have a great metabolism and of course I have not starved myself for one month. .
