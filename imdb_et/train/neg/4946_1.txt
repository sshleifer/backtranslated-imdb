True, I looked at this topic with very low expectations. Dieter Bohlen is a fairly unfamiliar composer flock, whose lack of talents is only beyond the size of his ego. <br /> <br /> It was the first cartoon I watched 100% humor for free. It's rude, offensive, red, and obviously anti-women. As such, it is a good work for Bohlen, but the average viewer pushes it down. No wonder it wasn't shown in the cinema: it would have bombed BIG's time! <br /> <br /> Not even 6.5 MegaEuro failed to save this famous secret. Save time ... and money!
