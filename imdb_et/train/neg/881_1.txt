Thanks to some notorious home video distributor who brought the so-called German Independent Series, Four For Venice is not only terrible, but really terrible. It is so terrible that I have dumped it when I sell the goods. <br /> <br /> Nick and Charlotte are married couples who agreed to sex only on Tuesday due to their passionate schedule. profession. Eva and Luis are a few pairs who live in the mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and Luis as an artist. Nick indirectly causes Eva to lose his job as a waitress. Luis and Charlotte had a thing behind Eva and Nick. Luis cheated on Eva, lying to him that he was going to London to do something related to his work of art, but the fact is that he is traveling to Charlotte for a vacation in Venice. Eva kidnapped Nick and pulled her two children into a confrontation with Venice. The trip to Venice reaches both Nick and Eva. <br /> <br /> Submitting a journey between Nee and Eva from Germany to Venice marks a comedy failure. It does not only seem pointless, but also harsh. In the film, Nick tries to find help in many ways, but it ends with no results. It's either strangers around him who act as morals or are just stupid. <br /> <br /> Comedy also had a tendency to add unnecessary scenes to prolong the story. Although some of the problems that can be solved by common sense, no one uses common sense to solve the problem in the film. They prefer one big round to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> It is not so bad that even the beautiful Venetian landscapes do not attract the image of the film.
