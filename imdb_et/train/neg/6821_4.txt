It was a good story, but not very well said. I liked the themes and the main story that was not as clear as it could have been. Maybe there was too much going on and the inability to control it everywhere. The actor was shy, some were stronger than others and even stronger actors acted less. It took a couple of months to complete the movie because it didn't leave my attention and the flow was just bad. I just stopped watching it and I'm glad I did when the movie finally moves and is over. Again, a good story, but the delivery was par. Would recommend this story and maybe a little eye candy, and I mean a bit.
