Until now, the worst film I had ever seen was Ben & Arthur. Instead of this movie, you should check the reviews of this movie. Survey statistics for this movie are positive if some of the people involved in it are disappointed and unscrupulously proven, on which evidence is easily discoverable online. At least the people who made Ben & Arthur were respectable enough to let him stand on his shaking feet, rather than being carelessly promoted, as would such suckers buy for me. <br /> <br /> All this movie is terrible, script, story, casting, acting, direction, photography, editing, music ... what else is the movie going on? Whatever it is, it's as bad as it gets. If it were not so unpleasant, it would be ridiculous. I was watching that it should get better because I had not yet discovered that none of its positive assessments were reliable. <br /> <br /> It doesn't take a big movie, nor does a low budget mean that the movie must be bad. My favorite example of a fish festival budget is Gus Van Sant's amazing Mala Noche, but there are many others. Binding Secrets The director's cut or original is bad not because the people who did it were not money, but because they had giant egos and talent was nothing but self-promotion.
