I saw the movie "Troy" this afternoon. Here's what I learned: <br /> <br /> Contrary to popular belief and history in general, Greek men were not gay. EVER. It appeared clearly at the beginning of the film and was strengthened every five minutes. This way the American Dude is safe from this movie. <br /> <br /> Helen Troy always had impeccable hair and makeup. He saw in all his short stage pictures a miracle that was probably filmed the same day, one after the other, saying to the director: "Okay, now look beautiful ... good ... OK, now look scared ... good ... now look depressed. .. good ... now interested ... good ... now beautiful again ... good ... "<br /> <br /> The men of Greece and Troy had British accents. People with an American accent were unable to act. <br /> <br /> Trojans looked like Greeks, but tend to stay on the right side of the screen. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt doesn't blink <br /> <br /> Helen of Troy's biggest line was: "They're coming to me." <br /> <br /> Trojan music played remarkably like modern Bulgarian music. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitti's thighs move up completely. They were cousins. Don't forget what is said in history. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole can only say the whole story with an expression. <br /> <br /> The Trojan gods probably had all the Greek names, but their statues saw Egyptian or Peter O'Toole dragging. <br /> <br /> Greek men didn't touch each other unless they were fighting like American men. <br /> <br /> All of the thousands of movie additions were exactly the same ... Color by Egypt, Max Factor. <br /> <br /> Troy had only three women. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of blond greeks, which is good news for Brad Pitt, who would otherwise have been really stuck. Despite their coastal desert, the Greeks had the unpleasant ability to find unlimited quantities of wood for fires, funeral trophies, trojan horses and the like. br /> <br /> British actors see foolish Greek hair. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt changes expression only when the sun shines directly in his eyes. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers fought constantly, but their equipment was always worn by Greek soldiers under their skirts.
