Previously, I didn't know that Devry University (or ITT Tech?) Was added to the repertoire of its amazing technical programs in the early 1990s. Well this film must be a class valedictorian product. My friend and I rented our Netflix for the original 1980 Boogeyman and this movie was on the back of the DVD. Don't waste your time with this movie. Terrible terrible terrible. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker adds 2 main characters, a woman and her therapist. The woman has dreamed of Boogeyman and her victim's first film. Over 50% of this movie is in the original movie store. The rest of the film is the main character with bad dreams, while his therapist tends to tell the narrator. These scenes are photographed through the thickness of the marks glowing. They would make Angela Lansbury 25 years old. So, terribly. Don't look at this movie.
