I recently watched this movie on DVD and I have to say I wasn't impressed. I know this is a taboo for knocking out independent films, but it seemed to be no fun. <br /> <br /> The assumption was interesting, but there was little compliance. I found myself thinking "okay, they just get in, the story is getting faster". Before I knew it, the movie was over and the story had never gone up. I can't say I found everything working impressive. It was pretty bad. Not a Star Wars prequel trilogy bad but bad yet. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what the working time was, I expect two hours (because it's a safe rating). Anyway, when the movie was ready, I felt that I would have earned some appreciation for the willpower I made next to the movie pause and half-walk. <br /> <br /> Again, I was thoroughly imitated, and finally missed my mind. I'm not one of those men who need quick action and explosions in the movie, so don't start with me because that's why you don't like it.
