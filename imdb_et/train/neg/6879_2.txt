Rosie wasted a lot of TV time talking about Tainos as if they were very influential in today's dynamics of Puerto Rica. They weren't. The truth is that the Africans and the Spaniards were and he knows it. What kills me is that he is standing on a screen that looks like some average mild skin black chick (obvious black father, cousins ​​and aunt) claiming to really recognize their true nature, making them into today's Puerto Rican, but hardly mentioned how the Africans influenced their Spanish language, food and music. She's so typical and I lost her a lot of respect and doesn't support anything she does. Also, because he wants to dance around his African-Ness, he doesn't have to take on more dirt-related roles (i.e. Lackawanna Blues). The next time we find the proud Black Latina (thank you Zoe Saldana, Gina Torres, Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa). <br /> <br /> Puerto Rico, who said here they are African and not "black". ... thanks. We have no "blacks" for something "common" to you, so love hasn't disappeared. But since you are probably in the countries and you have benefited from the movement of civil rights, we would like you to refuse any dignified treatment you received from blood, sweat and tears from the "black" back. <br /> <br /> When I'm right, Puerto Rican has a terrible picture in the media, but we're not spending time trying to read you in disrespect, because we know the media loves to take advantage of all the low points and behavior. minorities in order to preserve unthinkable generalizations. However, you have obviously brought a leap to someone who is white or superior ... you are not. You also feel compelled to believe that black culture is BET ... again you are wrong and you have to take a vacation. Try to visit Atlanta, Ga., Houston, Texas, Charlotte, N.C. Trust me none of these blacks do not want to demand their "culture".
