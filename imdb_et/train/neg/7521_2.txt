I'll probably give it more credit if it deserves it because it's Halloween, I was just "Knott's scary farm" and I was in the mood to watch a truly cheesy Halloween movie. <br /> <br /> And it only cost me one dollar. <br /> <br /> Usually, I ffwd through such a movie to get into "good things", but I was responsible for this, and I'm still not sure why. The opening frames showed that it was not a "real" movie, not even a B movie. This is more of a DeCoteau "horror movie" category, such as "Brotherhood", which is filmed for about 50 cents on a film (in fact, I was half afraid that none of his fleshly college boys stood by rubbing themselves in his underpants or anything). There are no shots (too expensive to make multiple camera settings) and flat lighting, but ... it's hard to pinpoint. There's something refreshing when you look for a director who doesn't have the money for a semi-decent movie. The fact that she even does a semi-professional job is commendable and this film is in proportion - the actor is not bad, photography is pretty good (if it's too scary to be scary), there are some surprises, and the whole thing is sort of. .. different in any way. <br /> <br /> All college kids are (for an unknown reason) embedded in a warehouse where they decorate their annual haunted house. The terrible old man gives them a satanic book and they randomly call the hosts of hell. This results in the people of the ghost house costumes they have created and cause many chaos and human suffering. We are treated to strangely complicated and thoughtful lesbian relationships - it's interesting that this couple seems to be the most rounded film. Yes, there's a sex scene, but it's not bad - or at least no more than you find any legitimate movie about lesbians that shows them sexuality. It is quite unusual for a horror film to take time and effort without using cheap exploitation. The other thing that was in my interest was how he clearly tried to "strange children and get killed" by the 80s slashes. It's hard to take, because there are so many movies that are already there, genre made to death. I'm not sure if it's good or bad that these filmmakers were just trying to make another record in this genre, without irony, as if it was still alive, but I appreciated that experiment. <br /> <br /> Why did I sit through it; Sometimes you just want to watch a nonsense, non-budget, "A-for-effort" horror movie. There was really too much set up, not enough gore, endless plot holes, congestion and clich√©s, and the unfortunate general feeling of the movie that there was not enough money for the film the producers saw ... but at least the haunted house scenes were pretty cool. I would pay to go to this haunted house when it existed and did not think about paying for the dollar to see it on the DVD, even if I never look at it again. <br /> <br /> Oh and ** Possible spoiler **, but there was a big, short business with a casket vampire: "I was claustrophobic before. But I've changed." Ha ha, good.
