Before I start, I _love_ Eddie Izzard. I think he is one of the funniest positions today. Maybe that means I'm going to go too high on expectations, but I just didn't find Eddie joking on this trip. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is Eddie, who is trying to be too hard to be Eddie. Everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic and we all love him for that. But Circli seems to be getting more irrelevant than funny and losing me completely. Many of the topics he has dealt with have been covered in the past - I even think I will recognize some recycled jokes there. <br /> <br /> If you buy a DVD, you will find the Eddie tour in retrospect. (interesting places but not very funny) and French version of one of his exhibitions. Die-hards sees Eddie's vision in a different language, but subtitled comedy isn't very funny. <br /> <br /> If you are an Eddie fan, you have already received it or are about to buy what I say. If you just pass, buy Glorious or Dressed to Kill - you won't be disappointed. You will probably be with Circle.
