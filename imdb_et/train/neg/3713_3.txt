DOWN TO EARTH / (2001) * (out of four) <br /> <br /> Blake in French: <br /> <br /> "Ground" is such a misleading and desperate comedy that makes sitting on the couch at home Watching Chris Rock's standup comedy on television, looks like the sky. Speaking of heaven, the film is based on the 1978 film "Heaven Can Wait." It was a good film, and it's good to show how a group of aspiring scriptwriters can get decent material and change its garbage. Directors Chris and Paul Weitz miss almost every target. From concept to narrative, "Earth" cannot fail; this is one of the incredibly bad productions. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock is a tough stand comedian, both in his role in this movie and in real life. He plays Lance Barton, whose director (Frankie Faison) even feels sorry for him when he has been in the local theater during an amateur night. Soon after the script has given up its talent shortage, it will kill the character's speed-up truck. The death played by Eugene Levy has made a mistake by taking Lance before his number was. God's assistant (Chazz Palminter) is very angry and decides to let Lance remain on Earth for the rest of his time by taking the body of the only 60-year-old white millionaire. <br /> <br /> The old man's name is Mr Wellington, whose life has its own problems. His wife (Jennifer Coolidge) interacts with his assistant (Greg Germann) who kidnaps him for his money. But that's all right, because Lance, inside Mr Wellington, is in love with a young black woman called Sontee (Regina King.) Meanwhile, there are pieces of Wellington killing, Lance trying to get a better body, and Sontee's confused feelings about Mr. Wellington's finances. In a hospital situation, <br /> <br /> "good ground" has some good ideas, but they are a meaningless and convincing love story full of contrast and recycled material. The biggest problem with this is how we see Lance as Mr Wellington. Chris Rock is an actor with popularity and advertising, so he doesn't leave most of the movies; all characters see the new Lance as Mr. Wellington, but we see him as Chris Rock. It's a comfortable love story; we believe that a young woman falls for Lance, but in fact she is old, gray hair. It's not so convincing. <br /> <br /> A funny comic situation should look at an old man who makes funny things that a young black man really does. But what inspires laughter is when characters get into conflict without their knowledge. Just look at "something about Mary." In funny scenes, the characters have uncomfortable experiences and not their will. Here, Lance knows that she is in the old man's body and what things old men usually don't do. If Lance didn't know what body he was, it might be potential. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this concept: we didn't know Mr Wellington first, so how can we compare Lance's body if we don't know what he was originally. To turn off everything, Chris Rock must be the focus of attention here and make this character too much like Rock. He says simple routine jokes that are annoying and painful; his dialogue is so obvious, woody and understandable. I hated the movie with a sense of humor. There are so many funny jokes and terrible comic situations. It's like watching Chris Rock as Chris Rock, not a movie. <br /> <br /> We emphasize positive terms "down to earth". Mark Addy doesn't do it worse than he did in "The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas". Eugene Levy and Chazz Palmentar are well cast, but they are scalped in the mercy of the script. These are all the good qualities that I mention at this time, and if you give me one more week to remind me, it's unlikely that I will start again.
