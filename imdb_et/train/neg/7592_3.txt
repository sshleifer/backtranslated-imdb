The 1930s was the golden age of Los Angeles with its film industry and the rich and famous of many other opportunities. People came there, hoping to fulfill their dreams. Waiting for open hands and welcoming offers, only a few who were able to succeed and find their way to stardom, most of them condemned to hunger, frustrated and unwanted, looking for some respect in dirty bars and nasty rooms. <br /> <br /> A young Italian-American writer Arturo Bandin arrives in a similar quest to LA - spread his charms to become one of these beautiful rich women and write a great novel that would make him a career in writing a short story so far published hidden anthology. Wishing to create a romantic masterpiece, she seems to be unable to prepare anything without herself experiencing it, though from time to time she sends a sample of magazines to a local editor to help her survive. He is proud to present himself in Italian, but in a deep heart he really knows his Italian origin as a burden. The little money and the courage to conquer the world he once had, has long disappeared and looked at his dream of becoming a ghost, where he has one last nickel. <br /> <br /> The coffee he brought was cold and sour, and he was caught up in a curse that leads to an endless relationship between insults, voices, and the hidden love below. Camilla is an uneducated girl who tries to get US citizenship through marriage and also bears a heavy cross on non-perspective racial heritage. Although he is a much stronger and more experienced person, his situation as a beautiful Mexican woman is much harder to deal with than Arturo can understand. <br /> <br /> Is it obvious that Arturo finally finds inspiration for working with the novel? Is it possible that their love will eventually find their sun? Is it likely that their romance is unhappy? <br /> <br /> It is very surprising that the two main characters presented by Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell did not work. The relationship has no raw and authentic feeling. Hayek is more alive than Farrell's forgetting Camilla when her passionate character, Frida, was passionate and strong. It is also difficult to believe in a character that is intelligent, but uneducated and illiterate, uses quite complicated vocabulary and complex sentences. The tougher character of the Phil Marlowe variety would certainly be more suitable for Farrell, although he sees stunning in the costumes of the era, he seems very lost, trying to find a twenty-year-old dreamer who balances the hidden love and the desire to be true himself. <br /> <br /> Embarrassing looking at two screens while watching is not right. Their relationship could have been wild, but it is more likely that thunder and lightning are rushing, far from the actual passion, the feelings just described don't seem to be inside. It is very sad that such an interesting script and the potential of good actors have been wasted, soon becoming gray.
