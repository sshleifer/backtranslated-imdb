Mt little sister and I have self-proclaimed horror film buffers. We've seen almost everything, especially zombie cinemas. Now we've seen a lot of good zombie movies and a lot of bad things. This is the FAR WORST movie I've seen throughout my life. Not only did it work terrible, but the special effects, graphics and ever "zombie" makeup were the worst I've seen. If you can even call it a make-up (black eye shadow around your eyes) This is absolutely proof that you should never cover the book. The reason that the movie cover is the only sweet thing. Make your selves a favor and don't look at this movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so careless about this movie that I went to the inside of the film to make a sticky note before I came back to this movie: "This movie sucks, don't waste your time, come back now" hahahah I don't want anyone else's good movie night wasting on it On POS! I don't even know how he got the ratings he did, t should be negative
