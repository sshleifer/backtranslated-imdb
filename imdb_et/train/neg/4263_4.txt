A disappointing film. The activities of the participants are weak. Sets are good, it could have been better. The story is also weak. Battle sequences are terrible. Sounds and film quality are inconvenient. The history of the Kazakh people was very badly spoken. This film should have included more Kazakh actors in leadership roles. It should also have been in Kazakh. Kuno Bekker and Jay Hernandez are Spaniards. I can't get it. Ever since the Spaniards are playing Turkish-Mongolian people. This film is a shame of Kazakh cinema. Rustam Ibragimbekov deceived me. He is one of the world's best filmmakers. The Czech director is excusable because he is not of nomadic origin, he cannot feel the true spirit and history of nomads.
