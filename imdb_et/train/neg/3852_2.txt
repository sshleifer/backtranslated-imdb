It was one of the most boring films I've ever seen? I do not know why? Just your mill's story of the man who is going to get married and will be proud of it instead. The story has been told a thousand times. There is nothing new or innovative at all. <br /> <br /> I really don't know what was wrong with this movie. Most of the time when such actors / actors can make a movie that has been done a million times before, it's really fun. They usually have little smart things that are not really in any other. For some reason, it's not your attention. You can choose some funny parts or smart ideas, but for some reason they are not just funny or in some way wise? I wish I got a new one to explain it, but I don't? Just don't waste your time for that?
