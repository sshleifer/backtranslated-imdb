I'm a "bad" horror movie, but it was just a bunch of dogs! How can someone cool down or call it a movie is outside of me. If you like to rush editing to cover special effects, bad performance and bad script, then go for it! There is no relationship and the gore factor was ridiculous because it was so fake. I'll take the hostel or Wolf Creek over this pile every day. My partner gave up in about 20 minutes, he knows when he sees it. On the other hand, I sat stupidly throughout the film to wait and see if it was better. No such luck! I haven't taken my second movie, Torched, and I doubt I'm worried.
