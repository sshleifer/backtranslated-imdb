Predictable, a thousand times the story of the usual drama, a couple of rather dirty sex scenes, mixed with some paranoia, 70's style of random violin music that is sometimes comic, I couldn't fool myself. /> <br /> I usually like Defoe and I have to say that it is not so bad, "plot" is developing at a reasonable pace and keeps you away from time to time. Just because it is too predictable, I felt like watching a television drama instead of a new movie. Perhaps it is the style that the directors wanted, but it should be said that the review I read here before seeing the film could only have been written by someone who participated in its production. <br /> <br /> Don't expect too much, and if I could bring it back, I wouldn't have seen it in the cinema. Waiting for your bargain bargains, I'm sure this habit will take a long time.
