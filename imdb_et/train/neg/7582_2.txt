High heels are tricky things. They can raise women (or men to baptize) to new heights, present a sharp style statement, and bring a little bit of sensitive elegance. Alternatively, they may be dangerous foot pain, which inevitably leads to trips, falls and the ultimate tragedy. The Tacones Legion is rather a disappointment than a stylish high rise tower. <br /> <br /> Almodóvar's mother-daughter drama is certain, but in terms of plot, it is a linguistic and tedious thing that is full of confusing, complicated characters that are never fully related or meaningful. A few moments next to comedy, the Tacones Legion is not just interesting. The best bit comes first in the admirable slaughter case the child has organized. This brilliant black comedy looks at things, but then the film will wear. <br /> <br /> There are strong enough exhibitions, and there are some stylish, artistic directions to expect from Almodóvar, but otherwise the Tacones Legion is not an impressive piece in Spain. The story of murder, showbys, femininity, broken mother-daughter relationship and character, who is alternately a judge, transvestite, and police informant, could have been a melodramatic force. Instead, it's bad. High heels definitely stumble.
