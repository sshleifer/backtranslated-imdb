I have the "courage" to inform you that please stay away from "Dahmer", a biographical film based on the real story of a grotesque serum killer. Dahmer is more focused on his focused theme mentality. Jeffrey Dahmer, who murdered more than 15 young men and ate some parts of his body, was probably the most controversial serum killer of our generation. But real sick people are the filmmakers of this terrible spectacle who should have checked their heads before deciding on the green light of this terrible dahm project. It's not an easy movie, though Jeffrey could have easily digested it with some fiery "brainsadillas" appetizers, or even some real life "Mr. Potato Skins."
