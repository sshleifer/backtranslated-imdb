I didn't expect much of this movie, after a terrible "Life is a miracle". It turns out that this movie is ten times worse than "Life ...". I have the impression that the director / writer jokes with the audience: "Let me see how much void you (audience) support". Dialogues are empty, ... the scenario is minimalistic. After a few moments, photography is really nice. Few sarcastic lines are semi-funny, but it is difficult to really laugh during this "comedy". I'm laughing at the end of the movie. If you can bring yourself to the fiasco of this director, then ... you will find some legends (Miki Manojlovic, Aleksandar Bercek) and his mother's son Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> In short: too big for a big driver! Emir Kusturica is still young and should make the best movies. Instead, he decides to make a just-for-my-private theatrical film with this small budget that has a arrogant attitude to world trends and carelessness towards his old fans.
