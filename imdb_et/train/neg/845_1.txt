It is a pity that you can not vote in the zero characters in IMD because I would not hesitate! In fact, I would like to go so far as to say that this movie was in negative characters. <br /> <br /> I, like many others, bought this movie, I thought that because it is Michael Madsen, it might be good ... No chance! This movie was shocking! Imagine the length of the movie "Bold and the Beautiful", well, Primal Instinct didn't even get close to that good, and I thought nothing would be worse than the length of the movie "Bold and the Beautiful". Michael Madsen, how can you do this to us? The worst part is that I didn't move fast, I hoped they would finally show that it was some sick joke that they thought it would be funny to make such a terribly bad movie. <br /> <br /> Where do I start ...? Calling - zeros, scenario - zeros, zeros, cinematography - zeros, digital effects - zeros, production layout - zeros, makeup - zeros, casting - zeros, editing - zeros, trailer - half stars, graphic design - half star, dvd menu - half stars. <br /> <br /> But I think it's very important to see bad movies just so you know what a really bad movie is, so that's why I'm glad to see this movie so I have my own at the bottom of the list is a bad film.
