To make a good movie, you need some great actors or a great director. You need at least one of these two. We don't have any one in this needle. <br /> <br /> I don't even remember the director's name. He must not do much during his career. I really like Donald Sutherland, but he can't be the main participant of the movie. He's little. Sutherland is great in the film when she appears for no more than 15 minutes. I would say, for example, that Sutherland was great at Oliver Stone's JFK when he spoke to Kevin Costner without a 10-minute stop in the park without even holding his breath. Wonderful. But Sutherland, the main actor of the film, is not good. <br /> <br /> Kate Nelligan? He's probably good for TV shows. The DVD is terrible. Dreadful colors. Terrible light. I couldn't even understand the landscape of Storm Iceland when photography was terrible. <br /> <br /> This Ken Folletti story was good, but it was a pity that they made it an interesting movie.
