This is one of the movies you see in a video store that you just have to get because it just looks so awful. And indeed, we couldn't take most of it. There was a lot of fast forwarding there. <br /> <br /> But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduced a female protagonist (his name slips at that time). KRIPID. I've never watched a movie many times (I'm forty). And I've never laughed so hard in my life. You see, Englund has this thing that shows his back. I saw the movie a few months ago but I can't laugh when I write. Anyway, the scene is framing - Englund cuts off the girl, Englund, who rides the horse naked, and some mysterious women who fell on the snake's head. This is an absolute genius. You have to see it yourself.
