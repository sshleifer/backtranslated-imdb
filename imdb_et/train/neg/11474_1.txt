This short film remnant begins with a teenager who goes through the driving license process. It quickly turns away with the imaginable theme of each car. <br /> <br /> Things like dice rides, drag races, custom coloring and car exhibitions have been discussed. Often, it's trying to be humorous, but instead of being a movie, it's occasionally boring, pulled out and even sexist. None of the people in the movie actually heard. Instead, everything is done in narration and majority voting. I'm sorry, but I can't hold it. <br /> <br /> There's nothing educational or interesting about "Dad, can I borrow a car?". This is just one pointless stuff that takes time for your "Wonderful World Of Disney" TV show. 1/10
