This movie is truly brilliant. This is inevitably a scam if you do not see the good sense and general peace of mind in the past. But it doesn't stop there! This film hits as much of the bottom part of the barrel as it hits the ridiculous comedy point: see if Kor Beergutted Conan wannabe with the overflowing neck hair pulls his stuff out just as it does tomorrow. bumped into it, i'm really surprised that there was * tomorrow for him or at least his beer intestine). Don't miss this movie, it's a fantastic romp through idiotics and thin bloody thinking! And once you've finished watching it, dry the tears of tears (or the tears of disappointment about telling such an unsuccessful attempt) from your eyes, because some foolish f00l gave those people another $ 5 to follow!
