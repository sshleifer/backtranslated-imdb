this movie is just a pretext that the writer makes a movie of two unsuccessful scripts. <br /> <br /> Its characters are just a collection of clich√© tragic or comic attributes, the sum of which is a neurotic dialogue only wooded Allen could write. the woman loves it because her like looking in the mirror so they would enjoy the movie probably <br /> <br /> nevertheless did not enjoy this movie because there was no car chase and the film had no struggles. there were no lords or hares of drugs there. Not to mention the absence of snakes. This film had no snakes. Not my cup of tea and maybe not your ether so think about what I've said before you see this movie. <br /> <br /> If, of course, it is not like a female, consider people's problems with sex and the city and ally mcbeal, so it makes sense for you.
