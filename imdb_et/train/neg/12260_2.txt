Sometimes I talk about my head and think about the reasons why movies of killer and / or crocodiles are still ready today. They've made those flat "Jaws" copies since the 1970s, not as they get more enjoyable. The idea is still exactly the same. So we have an animal to kill people. First of all, it takes some secondary characters, then it starts attacking the main characters usually played by a few young people, except someone who used to be a little more famous, who usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before others kill the animal with an explosion. Then we usually get the last picture where we see that the animal is still alive or there are eggs, etc. Etc. "Krocodylus" basically uses the same excessive ideas and makes absolutely no change. If you don't think the "specialist" is the captain of this option, then your standards are pretty low. It's funny he's still playing by Duncan Regehr, he wants to be completely Zorro.Hell. I'll give you a bonus point for that.
