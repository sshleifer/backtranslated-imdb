Nintendo !!! TE #% $ @ ERS !!! How do you do it to me? I can't believe it ... this movie is actually worse than the first one. I went to see my brother in the theater because my mother forced me to mark ... oh God ... where do I even start? Land SUCKED. The voice worked on SUCKED. Animation SUCKED. Finally, really wonder. If you liked this movie, SUCK TOO. And for Futuramafan1987, who said it was once the biggest movie, you're TOOL, PLAIN, and SIMPLE. It's not a movie for anyone, but for ten-year-olds who have Game Boys who think that Pikachu is God. I still call today, thinking of this horrible sadness ... and then there was Pikachu's adventure ... not even getting me into the horrible crap. This is the whole truth of all my life's boring experience. Don't look at it at all costs. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Get out, find all the copies of this movie you can and burn it. Burn them all and then rent a good movie like aliens ... or Bowling For Columbine ... or even return to the future!
