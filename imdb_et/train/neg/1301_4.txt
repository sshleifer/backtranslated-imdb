I saw it recently on a 2009 Palm Springs movie. This is a full-length director debut by Dutch actress Monique van de Ven, and I think it should be her last. I hate movies that are so unlikely that you choose virtually every scene. This film immediately scratches your head. When a young photographer begins and his girlfriend, working for an international aid organization, rides calmly through the Taliban-controlled mountains in Afghanistan, where there is a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them. They get out of their vehicle to see how rocket carriers, rifles, rifles, handguns and grenades are equipped with all five people. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) is about to take a picture of it when one of the insurgents who grabs a hand grenade for those who kill his girlfriend has noticed. as they are at a distance from the hand, they cannot be more than 50 meters away, but he is somehow away. His girlfriend is blown up and takes a picture of the effects of the grenades from the moment he kills him and wins this year's photographer's prize. Every scene and situation in this movie is just as ridiculous as opening it. Next year Bob National Geographic will be assigned to the Dutch resort resort, where he will meet Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and add himself to his international sub-type of drug smugglers. Avoid this movie. I'd give it to 4.0 out of 10.
