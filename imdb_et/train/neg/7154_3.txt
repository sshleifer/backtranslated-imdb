This movie has all too many chefs that break the ghost. On the basis of the autobiography of Shielah Graham, it seems that the authorities, which cannot, are not enough alone. They could not decide whether it should be the story of Graham or the story of Fitzgerald, and also how much they should gently give someone the story. So the film that might have been a story of two exciting (Fitzgerald) and notorious (Mrs Graham) personalities is that it has become an integral part of the soap opera. In addition, there is no time period other than 1959. A clumsy scene follows a cumbersome scene and we have no idea where we're about to play or how much time it takes. But - and it saved the movie for me - Kerr has never seen love and Peck is always a very beautiful man. They make a really beautiful and mature pair, and I just want them to have better materials. There is one scene that works - Scott goes into a drunken state after Shielah, and these two refined stars are very disturbing to see each other and give a little bit of a glimpse of what is going on in their relationships. In addition, the film is a wasted opportunity and achieves the classic value of other Wald soaps produced in 1950 (PEYTON PLACE, ALL BEST).
