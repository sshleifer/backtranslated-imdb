This is the worst sequel to the world of films. He won't do it again. The killer still kills for fun. But this time he kills people who make a movie of the first movie. That means it's never a stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it. If you value one valuable hour during a movie, don't look at it. You want to ask the director and the person next to you that made him. Because it just doesn't combine the original factors of horror, action, and crime. <br /> <br /> Don't let your children watch it. For teenagers, toddlers, or young adults, this film affects people.
