Let's just say I had to stop my belief in Spiderman less than Hooligans. That means I have less trouble believing that Toby McGuire can hold on to the buildings when I throw Elijah Wood in Manchester with harshness. I'm not going to get into the specifics, because I don't want to write a spoiler, but the idea of ​​growing up, being a professional, British man near every weekend in deaths is ... funny. And this movie is not. The fight, the idea of ​​fighting, has been taken too seriously. The degree of pugility, the respect for the substance, becomes irritating as it does not create or solve the conflict. It seems that a plot with large holes to drive through a Guinness truck has been put together with a "fish out of water" theme, so viewers can look at Woods' tears in the eyes as he learns to become a man, ie. Beating other young men with opposing football tastes blunt and runs as soon as possible. The characters are cartoonish, especially for Harvard Americans. The development of the characters and the story are drawn to the viewer throughout the picture. Unfortunately, the film's absurdity does not reach its height almost to the end, which you have spent almost two hours in your life, which you will never get back to. Instead of this crown, choose "Football Factory" or "Fighting Club" and disappointment. It does not waste time on empty melodramas, tired of the old "Yankee King Aurthuri Court" or crying, parables of age bullsh * t. They are just pure, dark and smart fun; how violence should be.
