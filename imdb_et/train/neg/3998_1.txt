Can you say, "All the shock, not the plot?" There were so many unexplored directions in this film. There was no other room after death. * WHY * was it evil? What did it do? Why an hour? Then the unexplored things referred to; for example, we saw a camera in the fan that he mentioned. But when he got out, there was no camera. <br /> <br /> How did all the ghosts look like "digital" and things that were "static" on static noise? Hmmm ... if you put all these * things together, it will make room 1408 a high tech horror. Except that it was not followed. <br /> <br /> Oh ... by the way ... electronics doesn't work in 1408. Well, except for TV ... the mobile phone has no signal, but wireless internet works fine. How many incontinence can you add? Sorry, but this movie was nothing more than "shock after shock". It's all done before. Mirrors in the mirror. Things just outside the site. Change Paintings. Bleeding. "Oh, it was just a dream ... no, it wasn't." And if the room was "evil", why should our main character cope with his daughter's death if it keeps him trapped there forever? It just didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> In addition, there was no background information about the "First Book" he wrote. Just some vague information about "father was jerk" and so on. Talking about fathers, what was his father a bit? "You are with me". <br /> <br /> Overall, HORRIBLE is really a movie. It was a 100% adrenaline stroke, with no new or innovative effect, and certainly not a story, character formation, and so on. My overall impression is that the whole movie was "Cheap"; pretty much using a single set and pair of location frames and it was nothing more than a recycled, cheesy, "seen-before-before" effects film.
