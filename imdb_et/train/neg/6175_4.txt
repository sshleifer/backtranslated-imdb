Was it a thriller, as I thought, when I saw the cover of the video library? Was it a "food idea" because the author might have tried to do it? Not quite. So what was that? It was a very medium movie with great potential and well-managed but letting a confusing story without a strong side, who started the middle and end, where bad actors are waiting for the serial number who, though at some points, seemed arrogant. gave the best result for most lighting. It was nice cinematography, good colors, cool hi-tec stuff, beautiful styles, but losing you where it goes and where it is. And the feeling is that we just end it quickly. OK to see if there is anything else on TV.
