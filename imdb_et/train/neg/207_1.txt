This film is a 90-minute Ramones concert with short fool and absolute boredom. What kind of high school is it anyway? <br /> <br /> If you're not a big Ramones fan, DON'T and I repeat, DO NOT waste your time as I did. It is completely unreadable from start to finish. This movie should be called Ramone Fever. Everyone seems to like them in the movie. There is no plot in this flick. As for teen comedies, you scrape it from the bottom of the barrel.
