I'm doing this short and sweet .... its the movie suck !!!!!! <br /> <br /> I looked at Part 1 earlier today and thought it was one of the biggest films ever, giving it 9 out of 10 stars. So I thought part 2 and 3 would be good, I was wrong. This movie worshiped me to death and was so different from the first, it was a continuation of the plot and that's it. It was like a bad takeoff from the first part or something. <br /> <br /> I love Walken, but I knew him here. I was so happy that Glenn Danzig is in this movie, but does not blink to miss him. It was full of crappy actors and people I didn't like like Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. But it was the breath of fresh air to see Ethan Embry, one of the most funny people on earth. <br /> <br /> This movie will make you the first little less, so don't look at it because you think you owe it for yourself, being a fan of part 1. I wait a few days before watching Part 3 and I pray it would be better than this mess. <br /> <br /> The last scene with a flash movie was one of the most beautiful things shown on the film. Just forward or skip if you don't get the first part of the stomach. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars - it was terrible!
