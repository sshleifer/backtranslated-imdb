Time corridors. A movie that you can watch when you search for a complex suicide. Some use weapons, ropes or gas, but do you want to destroy your brain? Don't wait any longer! Time corridors are probably one of the biggest possible mistakes: thinking Christian Clavier is able to act and bring you fun. I will not forget the 45 francs that this poor thing will cost me: sometimes my rating system must be restored to zero. This movie deserves 2/10, but it's just because I like Jean Reno. He's too bad, he's also Ronin. I don't think I like him ...
