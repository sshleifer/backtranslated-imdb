I like to look at Burt Lancaster's films in general - especially when he is required to go nuts when he sees the presence of a screen like Elmer Gantry. But his greatest strength, his magnetism, was sometimes his greatest weakness, because he rarely, if ever, played anything down. And this lack of fineness prevents Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character was supposed to be a sort of showman, but how Katherine Hepburn could be part of her spell is totally inexplicable. He should be smart, but it doesn't seem like Lancaster's blarney is thrown on the screen! In addition, the story is probably one of the most static films I've ever seen, and it's too obvious that it's a game-based movie. It just looks like it was mostly filmed at the sound stage, not in the big open west, as it should have been. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a very overpriced movie.
