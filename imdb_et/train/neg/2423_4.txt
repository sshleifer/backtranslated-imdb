I got this movie from a private collector and was very curious about it. It was IMDbis 7.8 (only 9 votes) and some external comments were nice. But I have to say that this is a very ordinary and uninteresting giallo. Yes, great filmmaking, the film is well-managed, but it never shamed me. It starts well, but even though it's not boring at all, it is so common and things that are so normal that I didn't like it. <br /> <br /> You can laugh. And you can see some small tits. But if you like the kind of gialla I like (bizarre, surreal, pointless, gory, atmosphere, brutal murders ...) then you don't appreciate that movie. <br /> <br /> I give this 4 good control and editing and the last turns that make the movie fun. But it can be much better.
