Last night I watched our DVD tower to see something. We were between NetFlix posts and it was quiet on Saturday night. I pulled one out that I've never heard of it and borrowed it from a friend. The coat seemed like it was "The Big Chill" hanging, but the whole star cast felt it might be worth it. The boy I was wrong !!! Not only was it "The Big Chill", it was almost finished by nature. Bill Paxton's character was a copy of William Hurt ("where you've been all the time") - a spoiler warning - and, look, he's behind to take care of the old place (salon / camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; jerk womanizer Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc. I found myself wondering why I even look at these people. To me, inadequate character development seemed to me to find these interests. How did Unca Lou find these characters even after 20 years? In addition, it wasn't even funny, except when Perkins fell, "morning" in the first morning out of bed, it was a sign and I miss it. After it was over, I asked my wife: "Were there any pleasant signs in this movie? ... Are you sleeping there?" He replied, "No, I still think ... No, I don't think."
