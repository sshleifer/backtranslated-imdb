I rented it just because I loved the first movie. But calling it John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just a trick to let you rent it. In fact, he is a manager and obviously was not involved in making this film (Jeepers Creepers Someone?). <br /> <br /> Tragic story, terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the least convincing Vampire Hunter all the time. It's not even comic bad. <br /> <br /> What we end up with is a boring, enthralling film with a terrible script and endlessly bad and cluttered. It's just a small budget. <br /> <br /> Avoid the bubonic plague.
