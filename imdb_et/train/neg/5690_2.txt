First of all ... I never thought of Uwe Boll Hater, because I think I never saw one of his films, but after that cheap apology for the movie "Seed" (which is the name of the serum killer)) I'm close to a hate club. This movie makes no sense at all ... the plot is a joke and while Boll is clearly trying to get the attention of shocking people, 90% of this movie is just boring. You can summarize this movie as follows: <br /> <br /> 1. Hooded killer watches clips of tortured animals on TVs. These are real film material that comes from field farms, and the film opens for a ridiculous reason that "a statement about humanity" is made and a Peta address is given. Since this film has no message at all and is the worst torture pornography, you already have reason to hate from the beginning. <br /> <br /> 2. Death with a blackout pretext, giving away what happens later in the movie that is printed on the screen so every retard gets it. <br /> <br /> 3. Cops watches videos of animals, children, and women who are starving to death, and disintegrate in the Seeds basement, with stupid nightmares and crying their whiskey, because Seed is such a bad bad mofo. While functioning is OK, the movie takes every time you try to add emotions ... <br /> <br /> 4. Cops bust Seed in your house, act stupid and get truncated in the dark. This sequence reminds me of a video game, you can't see anything except flashlights. Seed is a super-killer that is everywhere at once, and all policemen are stupid enough to kill ... except for the one who breaks him. <br /> <br /> 5. Seed gets on the chair and we see his electric shock as long as everything else in this "movie" ... he doesn't die and we are reminded that he must open when he lives with 3 electric shocks. Guess ... they just bury him in life to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> 6. Seed comes out of his grave, kills everyone in the second part of the pool and then catches the main policeman for revenge. <br /> <br /> 7. A woman with a head-to-head hammer, in a single point of view, is the fun and shocking value of this. <br /> <br /> 8. The seed hits the police family, attracts him to his house, threatens to kill his wife and daughter. After killing his wife's nail with a gun, the policeman lets himself head on, because that means what Seed wants (it's hard to get into this boyfriend because he doesn't even wear his mask in prison, but never loses the word ... no dialogue in the film anyway so don't like it). <br /> <br /> 9. Boll goes into a nihilistic shocker where Seed locks her daughter with her dead father to rottle like the people we saw on the video in sequence 3. <br /> <br /> This is ... no message, no plot, no reason, no face behind the mask, no background, except for the stupid story that Seed was burned as a child. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on just a few key features and their shock value. I hardly remember a movie that is empty of any emotion or message or entertainment. It's like watching August Underground ... it's good with me, some people enjoy this pointless snuff. But it is really hard to stand at the beginning of the pseudo-message and the fact that the film is well done in terms of camera work, effects and even action is too good for this cellulose waste. So how does Boll get money to make such "movies" when thousands of talented directors work with a worship budget? "Seed" is not only ridiculous, its lively proof that the free market is faulty ... happy Uwe that the German taxpayer pays a lot of waste to get deductions.
