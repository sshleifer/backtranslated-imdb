There's not much to say about this movie, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> Functional and dialogue is far from being decent, the story of hybrid werewolves is not very well explained and the whole thing is here and there are holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> CGI is something you wouldn't want to see. It's so amateurish that it makes me vomit. <br /> <br /> The only good DVD had extras. Mountain roller. Everything else, just a waste of time and money. I hope no one will buy it, it's not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> Just stay away from it.
