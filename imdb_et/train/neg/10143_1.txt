FURY FLIGHT OF FURY takes the coat that is very WORST Steven Seagal flick I've ever seen ... So far it's terrible without any interesting action, Seagal isn't really trying it - it's fat and its voice is still once duplicated. <br /> <br /> Co stars don't appreciate, being a rather unfortunate burden for third-party evaluators. <br /> <br /> Keusch is very bad and it is not surprising that he is also responsible for another Seagal stinker (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE). The manuscript compiled by Seagal is ridiculously incorrect. <br /> <br /> IMDb $ 12M was spent on this boring burden old - if these numbers are correct, I feel like a big tax game because there was nothing close to that amount. <br /> <br /> FURY FLIGHT OF FURY is actually shot to shoot Michael Dudikoff's flick BLACK THUNDER - which must be better than this. It's in no way eligible for redemption, give him MISS! 1/2 * *****
