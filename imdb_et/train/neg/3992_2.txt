Director Spike Lee is famous for making films showing racism. In many films, such as "Do the Right Thing", most white people are brutal racists. In this movie, the theme of interracial marriage is that racism is again the whole subject. <br /> <br /> What Lee is showing shows his belief in Christianity again. It's amazing that there are double standards in the film world. If Lee or someone else was biased against this type of group, would he be scared, but Christians? Hey, it's an open season for them. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, the admirer of this movie, shoots his son and then puts a biblical weapon on his bible. They zoom in closer when you miss it. Hey, people, here's another Bible reader and see what it is! Lee does such a thing for almost every movie he does. <br /> <br /> He shows the same hatred when dealing with racial relationships. Who could claim to portray racism as an evil thing? But Lee confirms this in the film as he is in his other films. His obvious bitterness against white people does not help. It only adds fuel to the fire. Hey, Spike: Start "doing the right thing" and leave your prejudices in the closet. Better yet, "get over." <br /> <br /> It is too bad because the subject could have created a thought-provoking movie if it was done with objectivity and intelligence.
