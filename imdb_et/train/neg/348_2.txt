This movie is a dirty and forgotten Sean Connery vehicle. Performances are generally Crappy, especially Capshaw, Fishburne, and usually solid Ed Harris. Connery seems to be wrong as a Harvard Academician. The film gets drastically worse. It is a third speed puzzle that changes as it speaks. The film destroys excellent support. George Plimpton also has a small role in adding some difficulties to Connery when discussing the death penalty. Violence and atmospheric pepper is the third speed mystery / thriller that is manipulating at the highest level. Scripting and direction are extremely bad. Connery charisma and screen presence is the only round of the film. Manipulative, violent and ridiculous. 2/10 Avoid this.
