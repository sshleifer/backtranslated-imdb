I saw the goals of the transition .. twice ... and always the same feeling ... you see that Olsen twins make the same movie .... they like to play different sports and then fall in love with the boy .. ... first of all such little boys and girls don't play for such big goals ... 2nd football doesn't play from time to time ... 3. when the game is over, the judge gives some overtime (minute or more) ... and the finish is so designed ... i I think this film is bad because of the lack of knowledge about football .... if it was done by European producers, it would be better ... and also the amateur players are not a steadfast choice ... they suffer from authentic shortcomings. They played the season full-time, but it doesn't make them big stars .... you have to show your talent. ... and that's what Olsen twins do not
