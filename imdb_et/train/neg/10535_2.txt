<br /> <br /> According to reviewers, the year 1955 and the players are 20-year-old college children who are going to school. Jolly joke! <br /> <br /> 1955? The synthesizer keyboard was not found yet, but it is on the billboard. Ford Pony Car was not yet invented, but it plays old music. The synthesizer seemed to be a model from the mid-1970s. The best Pony Car ever since the mid-1960s. <br /> <br /> 20-year-old college kids? Josh Brolin had seen 32 birthday when this TV film was made. <br /> <br /> The plot is so predictable that viewers have a lot of free time to think about all the errors that appear on their TVs.
