For me, it makes sense that this movie gets out of Hollywood because it's often in Hollywood, it's just popular. It also makes sense to think that people who like the movie can simply respond to countless stories that come to you, not the story. However, this film is overpriced and overwhelmed. Eddie Murphy just seems ridiculous. In no way does Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles give the Oscar nomination so much that they are before the film failed. I can't even believe that Condon is set to stand for an Oscar when he made the album. Glitz does not replace any story. Music doesn't make a movie.
