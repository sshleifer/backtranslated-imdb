First I thought they had naughty to say that the story and scenario were from Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of the best Hollywood scriptwriters until his talent disappeared and he retired. But it wasn't Preston Sturges, it was Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was mainly based on Robert Louis Stevenson's short "The Bottle Imp". A good person can get an evil object that gives him any desire, but which ultimately determines him in hell. That's fine. Someone said the scriptwriters do not have to be original. Participants are generally quite competent, given the mediocre writing that they had to translate to the screen. My biggest complaint is over. The hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma, but tries to solve the problem somewhat differently to save the innocent person. First of all, it seems to have worked, but it fits the code of a modern horror film, they feel they have to give one last horror at the end of the movie. This is a stupid convention. Older horror films were well received, allowing the hero to finally win. There is nothing wrong with the good triumph of evil, no matter what the current sowing of filmmakers is. You can give your audience good healthy intimidation and make yourself happy. Actually, I think it's better.
