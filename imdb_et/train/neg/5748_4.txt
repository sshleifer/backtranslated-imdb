I have to say that I hated this movie. I don't want to say that because Gerard Butler is in it. About half an hour of dull conversation, I apologize to anyone who is dealing with a plot, and quickly started to direct Gerry's scenes. I really don't know the end, I was bored. If Gerry wasn't, then I probably got one of the two: fallen asleep or off, but Gerry is the bright light of this movie because he's most of his earlier films. If you're a Gerry fan, don't worry, he's as divine and valuable as he always is, but if you really want to watch the plot movie, good luck because you need it, either a lot of coffee or soda to keep you awake! <br /> <br /> 4/10 ... and that's just because the election director had the idea to put Gerry in this movie, even though they had no idea how to write his name!
