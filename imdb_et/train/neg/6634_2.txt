The first look at the cover of this picture looks like a good rock n roll film. But don't let the cover fool, or the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie are in it. The story is just terrible and it works. Simple and simple: BAD <br /> <br /> This is not a film that represents a path, but a thin love story, so terrible that you see it. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Some good songs and that's why I give 2 out of 10. If it wasn't for music, it would be from 0 to 10. actress (at least she was in 1980) and a girl who plays a group is not even good looking! This film was a great disappointment for me because it gives many good promises.
