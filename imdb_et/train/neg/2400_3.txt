No, it wasn't one of the worst films of the 1980s, but definitely it's the bottom 100 somewhere. This film looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years and then appeared in 1981. How else would you explain the special effects before the American werewolf in London, the disco is still cool and Ronald Reagan is not the 40th President of the United States? If we are, do not forget the hairstyles of the 1970s and 60s. I've seen it more than "Happy Days" and "Laverne & Shirley" combined. <br /> <br /> A woman who raises this film to a "bad, good" category was late, big Elizabeth Hartman, but hardly. Biff plays Miss Montgomeryna, a high school high school teacher who becomes a sex boy, a stereotype that has been put to death, and what Hollywood still casts out today, but even as a "hot chick", it retains its mouse features. His request for assistance is evidence of this. He also looks much better than Miss Wimp. "Seven bucks in a beauty salon, hell." He wasn't funny. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that there are no good parts elsewhere, they are just a few and far off, and I just don't say that because I like Hartman. By the way, "Teen Wolf" was better than that. "Teen Wolf Too" was better than that and it wasn't even that good. <br /> <br />
