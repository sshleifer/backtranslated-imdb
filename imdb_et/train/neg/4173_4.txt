I have to say when I saw the trailer I was excited about. Futuristic soldiers who take the bad ass Vampires led by the genre veteran Michael Ironside .... In Space. I mean, I didn't expect high art, but it seemed like a classic B-movie. It was undoubtedly a television pilot, some time later on a feature film, after it was not taken. Alright I'll start with some good points with movies, the action was competent for a lower budget movie, and the CGI and places used were satisfactory. Now, Michael Ironside has been turned off here by the bad first, and his performance here ... well, it wasn't good. But as I said he wasn't much, I can't blame him. One thing that was really stupid was the PETA-type group for Vampires. This film also sins one of the main B-movie sins, slides into the lesbian scene and doesn't give it. Most of what swallows this film is nothing. Because it was meant to be a pilot, the script is almost non-existent and has no regular ending. Even the main villains come only to the end. If you ever need a Sleaze movie and a gore factor, this is Vampire Wars. Finally, the main crews of the spacecraft were all very capable actors and they could very well put this confusion and move on to bigger and better things. They had nothing to do here.
