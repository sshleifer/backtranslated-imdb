I'm sorry, but it's just terrible. I have told people about this movie and some bad deeds in it and they almost don't believe me. There is nothing wrong with the idea, today's Japanese troops are pulling back to Busido's warriors' days and almost everything is compatible with today's weapons. If the troops first understand something strange, do the people behind each transport have to say, "Hey, has my clock stopped"? Imagine lines that are repeated 15 times before they say anything else and you have a short film size.
