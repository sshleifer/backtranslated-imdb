This sure is one comedy that I probably will not forget for a while. It is a kind of popular p2p sharing networks like Kazaa, and so this production must be open to what it is. <br /> <br /> So what is it? Well, of course, it's not really comedy; Instead, it is meant to be a horror strike - "intended" as a very important keyword here. The script is completely inconsistent and unbalanced confusion, special effects are special only because they are particularly pathetic and, as for the actors, just say that if it had been a primary school game, my teachers naturally understand that this is a very low budget movie and in these cases, your expectations should be reduced, certainly as much as things like special effects. I am also aware that although I am a big fan of fear genre, these films are rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and excellence. <br /> <br /> But still. /> <br /> B-films often have some redemption features to make up for the lack of funding, such as humor. The only thing that laughs at Cradle to Fear is ridiculous performances. If you find this humor - and I can gradually drop it in the first 20 minutes - then this is the only thing the movie offers. Oh, this and two or three pairs. <br /> <br /> Woohoo, how exciting. <br /> <br /> It's not even about the story of trying to pass on something: victims use drugs and / or are involved in serious crimes. Lesson: Be naughty boys and girls, because one day you pay for what you have done. <br /> <br /> I rest in my case. So Overall, a little sex, a fair amount of drugs, but an absolutely zero rock'n role. <br /> <br /> I appreciate it in 1 out of 10, but I would go to 0 if I could. Or maybe I wouldn't: it deserves 1 to write the names of the actors correctly in the headlines. I mean, this is something you drunk?
