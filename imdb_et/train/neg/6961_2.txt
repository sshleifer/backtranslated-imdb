I fully agree with the other comments someone should make. What is Tiger Lily with this movie? <br /> <br /> It must be one of the worst French films I've seen for a long time (in fact with wolves with Brotherwood, 2 scary movies in too short a time). <br /> <br /> It's really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea is some fun. Especially Antoine DeCaunes and Jean Rochefort, who were among my messengers, were bitterly disappointed to see that these poor films are at risk. <br /> <br /> Lou Doyon is pretty bad, as usual, which proves that beautiful faces and famous parents can enter the movies, but they may not give you talents. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you want to laugh instead of watching Alain Chabat or having a fun time fun at LA FILLE DE D'ARTAGNAN.
