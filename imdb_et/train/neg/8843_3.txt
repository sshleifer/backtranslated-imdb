This movie is really very scary. Unfortunately, not because filmmakers would expect it. <br /> <br /> There are also headmates who are hidden, but he's not scary either. He's just your usual comic book, cross between Hannibal Lecter and Freddie Kruger, though not very fresh. Of course, can even the poorest and most understandable criminals be detained under tension, feet, 24 hours a day, stretched out of their hands? I think something is possible in the world that gave us the Abu Ghraib and the Guantanamo Bay. <br /> <br /> No, this movie is really a terrible central character, Danny. This uncomfortable young man, assisted and supported by some ridiculously loose security arrangements and a doctor who is completely careless of any kind of professional ethics or patient confidentiality, migrates to a hospital that can only be described as a very vulnerable and unprotected young person. a woman and nothing (her chronic sleeping excludes the possibility of giving something like informed consent), she has some special relationship with her. <br /> <br /> It seems that he has arrogated himself for a couple of days to abduct him, believing (totally mistaken as we discover) that he is better off taking care of him than anyone else, and within minutes, when he returns In his apartment, he is sexually molesting him though he is (again because of his sleepiness) that is unable to fully accept or resist. <br /> <br /> Our doubts as to why he knows this connection will soon be confirmed. Of course, he is not more or less able to form adult friendships, not to mention sexual relationships, so that he returns to this essentially infantile woman who has a spiritual age because of his permanent sleeping, which corresponds to only a few years of living experience. The scene in which she discovers ice cream is particularly frustrating, and the fact that she gives her when she says she needs to clean her up again causes horror. But again, I'm afraid not that the filmmakers hoped, but more frightening, but a much easier rebound spasm. We all clearly see what is at the end of our forks - this is the perfect dream of a paedophile for innocence, sexual compliance and totally addictive. Terrible, terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> What else have we got in this mishi bottle? Twisted dreams aren't as good as del Toro. Mandatory argument "You have to go to the police", where the token is always a reason not to do it, although it is the only sensible course of action. An automated order, which was commented here a lot, though completely and completely meaningless ("It doesn't work in any way!", As Sigourney Weaver captured in a memorable way in the Galaxy Quarter) and looking at me, just like the terrible doctor Phibes, who again saw Jeffrey Combs do their best, so it's a star, and a couple more, because you have to keep the lower sequences for movies that are even worse, and in general it is well photographed and well-conducted.
