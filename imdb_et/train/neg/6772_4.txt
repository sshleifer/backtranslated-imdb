So, when Herbie made her first look, I was very happy looking at Dean Jones's mug. I just wanted to entertain for a few hours and eat too much popcorn. Unfortunately, while watching a movie, I have expectations of riveting / delightful story when I'm not in any way a medicine. And this is another good film for the drug substance. There are no big laughs, complicated lines, complicated twists. Herbie Fully loaded is a great full load. <br /> <br /> This was the first time I saw La Lohan on the screen as he switched places with Jamie Lee Curtis (I thought he was in this great part) and I can't say I was terribly impressed this time . In addition to her ever-changing and disturbingly unnatural hair color, she just didn't want a boy next to a woman who had spent a lifetime climb. His "need for speed" was not consistently shown in the film - maybe it was elsewhere - he seemed older than his part and it seemed he was always looking for something (party designer new money for spending money?). set. I didn't see any chemistry with Justin Long; that romance seemed to be mandatory at best. The only time Lindsay had been involved was with Matt Dillon, whom I thought it was right, like Evil Bad Guy Trip Murphy. <br /> <br /> Herbie was great to see, and I loved the film's introduction to the old movies. If Disney had come out with some Car 53 jewelery, I could have spent some loyalty. His new feature (?) Was somewhat inconsistent (did he direct his leader's thoughts? He now skate?), But whatever. We all knew how it would end, but I wish he would have come to someone who was a little less terrible than Maggie. And in my head, Maggie still hurts this lesson and our viewers were kicked home. <br /> <br /> What would make a movie valuable? Is the old Herbie a real story with a real plot - at least Herbie is as good as Lassie - but that is clearly too much. Why is Disney always going back to the same level as "Herbie Goes Bananas" and "Computer That Wore Tennis Shoes" when it comes to innovation? <br /> <br /> I am sure this was a great movie for kids and for those who had no expectations. The rest of us .... this is when you have a "flu" and just can't take the back tension.
