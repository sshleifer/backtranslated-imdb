This movie is terrible. Carlitos Way (1993) is a great film. Goodgfellas is not just one of the best criminal movies. This movie should be considered closer or perhaps a speed zone to STING Part2. Remember these precious stones! The only reason this film was made was to follow the culture of the original. This film lacked all of De Palma, Pacino and Penn. There was no pleasant character and it is the fault of all that. I hope that RISE TO POWER will win every RAZZIE that he may be able to, and perhaps even invent some new categories to enable it to be recorded. After watching this S @ * FEST movie, I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to get a bad taste from my mouth. After I watched it, I wanted Pachanga to come and beat me out of my misery.
