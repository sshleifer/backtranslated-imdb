This movie was terrible. at first I just read the plot summary and it seemed OK so I looked at it. Operation was TERRIBLE. it was like an actor was almost camera shy. everything seemed fake. I feel bad for Edward Furlong, Terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago .. I watched it at least 20 times .... <br /> <br /> The plot was nonsense. the writers were apparently asleep when they came over the lines. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, this is a good bad movie. What you look at to see how much it can get worse so you can tell other people later how you couldn't believe when the movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should look at it so we can better understand other, real movies.
