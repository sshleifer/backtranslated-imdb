I've been trying to follow this movie simply because of the bad phrases about "attracting and killing teenagers in your house". I think I first saw the parts of this movie when I was about 10 years old when he was working on a cable. It made a real impression! This is the kind of film children know they shouldn't look at and change the channel when their parents come. When I saw who was cast, I couldn't believe some of these good actors were in such a terrible movie. Then, if you want to see that the men who cheat their women are killed, this is an interesting film. Also, when I remember, there are some pretty interesting pseudo-lesbian moments. Probably the slowest end, but still ... memorable.
