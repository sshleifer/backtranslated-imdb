Budget, decent participants ... who knew these things were important. Don't waste your time with this spam. Effects are nonsense. Action is a mess. The only thing that could have made it even more tolerable was a little cheap R&D, and it would be shaken in the first 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only remotely redeemable quality of this movie is a very uncomfortable mistake. It was like they found only those 7 people on the planet who have never been cursed before. Hats out! <br /> <br /> If you want to see some guy in a bad suit, go back and watch the old prom photos. The only way Bigfoot flick could be good is that he has a big budget and some actors who didn't come from Frogballs Community Theater.
