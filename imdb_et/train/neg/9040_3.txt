I agree that although this Melville story may just be unclear, it is not even plausible to try. The story of relocating to the 20th century is simply surprised by the original story and the nature; maybe you could have transferred it to England, but it must be a periodic piece. Even our story teller - the owner - tells it back, goes further, somewhere around 1800. At the end of the 19th century, a strange disobedient worker was thrown away without meaning. And the 20th Century? Come on! Give me an excuse for a break !!! Even in about 1800, such behavior did not work very well in the end. And the end of the movie? I don't know what it was because I didn't look at the whole travesty - I had to stop. It was like setting up "Streetcar Named Desire" in Elizabethan England.
