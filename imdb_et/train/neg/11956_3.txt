This movie stinks. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that has been drawn to the value of the shock. The plot was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was super flat and the actor was empty. It could have been a good movie. I think it was based on grotesque images. I can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos, but it seemed that Miike shot it for the sake of taking pictures. Only one badly made movie. Watching this movie is not just something of entertainment if you are not fascinated if you are exhausted by explicit incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, self-milking, parental and brother abuse and stools. I think I just sold the movie to many others, but I thought about it when I said it smelled. He has also succeeded in other films, but I think it would be better to look at someone's pooping.
