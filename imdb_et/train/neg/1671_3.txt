I saw it on the Cannes Film Festival market. <br /> <br /> This is a real cheap prod - nothing wrong with it, but you have to make up for it with some sex or gore or both. Think about Larry Cohen. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is an interesting actor - well done for the producers to shut him up. <br /> <br /> The open scene on the spaceship that comes down is fun - you could take all the team's hands to shake it! <br /> <br /> Ha ha - but I wish people who did it well - at least it's not terrible.
