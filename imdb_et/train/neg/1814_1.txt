All of these reviewers are on site. I've seen a lot of bad movies over the years, believe me and it wins a lot! <br /> <br /> This is not just a waste of "good bad" exploiter time, but a real, fun, frightening movie. <br /> <br /> A MADE OF A COATED BLACK BLACK SLEEVE! <br /> <br /> WANT TO RECOMMEND Thom Christopher's "Spell Weaving"! <br /> <br /> GAPE USER A ** E-CLENCHING DISBELIEF! it is one of the "European co-productions". No wonder we have so many wars. I swear that some people who participate in the "lost kingdom wizards" do not really know that they will appear in the movie! <br /> <br /> FACTS! I was watching this movie originally on HTV Wales late at night, suffering from concussion and sleep disturbances. I had to copy several weeks later to make sure it was really terrible. It is. Even worse than Lee Majors The Norseman, the more ridiculous than all John Derek's films, this is indeed Trash's Kane.
