Anyone who actually was able to sit through this movie and walk in the feel like it was a good movie doesn't appreciate high quality movies. This film was an obstacle to insult, and the direction was high school film quality and cinematography. Blair's witch project had better cinematography and I hate this movement with passion! Style had the potential to be a very intense very good movie, but it fell within the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie. Someone mentioned that this film was about the child's imagination, everything is good and good. But they could have done better with this script than what they did. I mean the fire in the Indian store. Did the boy look at the little idol and suddenly imagine India and the whole story of Indian spirit called Wendigo? What they mention to the shop worker and he accidentally says there is nobody here but me who works here so you think it's a terrible scary scenario, but then he just plainly looks for the idol and we forget that boy who's this man sees . It was so flat that it went beyond pathetic. In the end, you stayed not only at what happened at Otis Hospital, but also at OMG !!! Why hell, when I was wasting this time, I saw it !! This is a step I do not want to see, there are definitely better quality movies that do not offend your intelligence! I thank God for not seeing this movie, I would have demanded my money back! For those who have shown this movie for easy entertainment, it is very sad that you lowered your standards to such a level of film to say it was a good movie.
