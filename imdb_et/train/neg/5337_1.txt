There are so many negative comments about "Stay away, Joe" here, I just can't keep silent and let this injustice happen. There's another half here that you haven't heard yet. <br /> <br /> Elvis Presley's movies are a joy for me for a simple reason: they're the perfect movies to get some relaxation because I don't have to think when I watch them. This means I don't have to worry about the lack of a complicated plot because there is never a right plot. I can just kick off my shoes, grab a beer, sit back, turn off the brain, and enjoy all the general nerves and memorable light n-roll music from the very sparse decades of all of them. <br /> <br /> My books "Stay Away, Joe" definitely falls into the "so bad of a good" category. Now that you are like me and appreciate the value of "trash", this is the ultimate camp experience of the 1960s. It is so bad that it is almost surreal to look at it and just when you think it is no longer able to paralyze you, it will surprise you most. Finally, you are so surprised at all the new levels of stupidity you just don't know whether to laugh or cry. In short, I love it because it's so funny that once there was a generation that actually made such movies. I still give it out of 10 out of 10 - when it reaches the bottom 100, it was a bad film class for a moment.
