It was an agonizingly bad film. It eats your heart when you look at it. I ask you: don't look at this movie! You hate you lose 1.5 hours of your life! It's not such a small movie that is so bad that you can watch and enjoy it ... this movie is boring because ... it's not as boring as this movie. You look at yourself after watching the movie. And you hate yourself that you didn't listen to me. <br /> <br /> I hate myself. I tortured myself and I watched it until the end of the movie. Now, sorry, I'll let myself. I've all seen. <br /> <br /> Please. Read it very carefully. Don't look at this movie. <br /> <br /> Please!
