For my humble opinion, there are only two things for this great version of BDWY music - Tyne Daly and the fact that now the filmed version is the original script. (OK Vanessa Williams is a good watch.) But for me it's all. Most of the cast seems to be walking through the show - Chynna Phillips has no idea who Kim really is, and wondering that people are walking around Harry McAfee when George Wendt, who looks like he would be in a bar in Boston, is playing. . Jason Alexander is satisfactory, but this wig must go and I saw a better dance at Bugsy Malone. As I mentioned, it is good that now there is a version of the production scenario, but I hope that the young people who have never seen the music will not understand them all.
