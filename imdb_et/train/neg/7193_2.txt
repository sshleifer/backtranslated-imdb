I had nothing to do with last weekend and I marked a movie with my friends ... any movie. And since the only movie we didn't see was Inspector Gadget, we decided to go with it. <br /> <br /> BIG TICKET. This is a film that can only appeal to children. Oh, and it's not like I don't like younger audiences. But this film had nothing to draw attention to. If you don't have anything to do at home, go to bed. Better than wasting the money you earn. Watch a movie if you are a child or if you are a parent with a child :)
