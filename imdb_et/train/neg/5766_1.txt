It is believed to be the flagship of an open-source community, something that stands up and screams in the world of media, to take note that we are not trapped in our marketing choices with the ability to create good work with open source tools. After downloading the main version (the dead hard fan here on the dial-up modem) I finally got here when I hit my first hit. Media Player, Mplayer Classic & winamp did not open it in my xp box and then Totem, xine & kaffeine could not open it on my suse server. Mplayer was able to start it flawlessly. It's hard to spread this word if ordinary users can't even open it ... <br /> <br /> Movie. Beautiful soundtrack, great lighting, masterful camera and flawless texture. Everything seemed real. And then the two main characters were moving ... and talking ... And the movie died for me. Everything except the synchronization of the lips and the actual animation of the two main characters (except Proog in the dance picture) seemed liquid and completely alive. The two main characters were animated so badly that sometimes I was wondering if there are any games in the market that have fewer scenarios than it is. <br /> <br /> The frame of every movie is fantastic .. when the frame and thing are great, if neither participant moves. I'm so glad I haven't recommended it to anyone. I would break my reputation. <br /> <br /> And the ultimate fantasy had a more observable and cleverly designed plot. <br /> <br /> This movie would get 10 stars if it wasn't a tragedy on the screen.
