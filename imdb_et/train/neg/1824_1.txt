I will not lose this movie for Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black. It is boring in one word. Perhaps the fact that it is too predictable, more than the used Ben Stiller loser role or the non-all-funny scenes make this movie just forgotten. Even Christopher Walken's appearance ends in a pathetic way. I was very disappointed. I love Ben Stiller's action. I loved it in most of my movies, the last thing I saw before was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and wasn't that bad. About Jack Black ... Well, after High Fidelity, I've never done anything good for him. What about Rock Rock? Ooops, scary.
