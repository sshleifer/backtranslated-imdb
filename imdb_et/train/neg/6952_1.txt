The most terrible challenge of the big series. It shouldn't have been called Battlestar Galactica because it's just the same. Too many changes are just making changes. You have characters that are female female, black from Asia to silon, so they "attract women" when there were already strong female characters that could have been made stronger. Gone is the Egyptian feeling. Gone is searching for land. The absence of cylinders for rejection in the terminator takes away the film, especially when it is made to fembo. A lot of cheese was given to the original competition, but it was great. They tried to follow it, but didn't give the fans something to work on and basically spit on their face when they do it "their story". Changes are good when they do something better, not just do them.
