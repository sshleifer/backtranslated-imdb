Oh my God, it was so bad! The story was weak - at best - and the animation was flat and inanimate - even childish. This film takes itself too seriously ... if of course they weren't funny. I saw it last week at the London Sci-Fi Festival and the whole audience laughed at each scene. I think my favorite was "should you not study Oopsalof?" And I also think they were trying to see how many times they'd be in Nicalo's only line "we're together ... it's our destiny." I'm sorry, but after the first time the words lost all meaning. <br /> <br /> And what about the apple? <br /> <br /> I recommend learning it for Americans: you don't get an anime, so please don't try. You just torture yourself.
