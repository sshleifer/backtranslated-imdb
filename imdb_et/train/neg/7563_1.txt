Unfortunately, this movie does not give any credit to the original. Nicholas Cage, quite as much wood as the participants go, sucks the screen out of skills that are not over. Supporting cast is no better. <br /> <br /> As the landscape scene progresses, the graph remains the same as the original, but much worse. There is not enough detail to allow the audience to sell. It turns out that this is just an invoice for bad goods. Belief cannot be stopped or questioned. The only aspect of saving this movie is that it is very visual when the media requires it, and to whom it was praised for the location. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of laughter in the audience and several languages, literally: the end. <br /> <br /> Disappointed! Wait until the original comes on the TV, pour the whiskey and have fun.
