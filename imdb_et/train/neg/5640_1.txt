I'm a huge fan of Willem Dafoe and I was really looking for this movie (I had 5 Chinese DVDs in this area!). But this is really one of the worst I've seen for some time. <br /> <br /> Actress (except Dafoe) is terrible. Dafoe and Colagrande BOTH wrote and directed it (though not considered a director) and have no noticeable talents for writing or directing. (Try to work with Willem; out of Giada's business, please!) <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing going on. With the exception of a series of absolutely convincing, totally incredible motivations, these two people (who just met) in this house are acting. Colagrande sleepy, I do not care less about the expression practically NOT. And sex scenes are flat. I pulled them twice. Yuck! They are certainly no less a bit erotic, but the only time a movie doesn't let you sleep. Then it's occupied by you. <br /> <br /> Just terrible.
