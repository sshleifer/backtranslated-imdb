I rented this DVD for two reasons. Major actors and directors are cast, although Robert Altman may be hit or not. In this case, it was a big drawback. Altman's attempt to establish intercourse fell on his master. After Kenneth Branagh had seen in good films like "Dead Again", I didn't think he could help such a turkey, and I hope he didn't destroy his reputation. It seems that Robert Duvall has fallen to most of the one-time Oscar winners. A downward spiral that includes such eating and watching movies as this one. Duvall was once a great actor for amazing films, although his best power was not "Tender Mercies" but "The Great Santini". This movie was a real waste of time. I'll give him 2 out of ten.
