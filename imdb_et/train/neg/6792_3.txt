Here's a movie that has a good cast and a nice looking location, but it's just not. Director Richard Brooks must be a bit tired in this game phase; How much better was his PROFESSIONAL! Horses and the rest of the activity seemed to be in slow motion even without slowing down scenes. This movie was needed if anything. This horse definitely looked at me with terrible counterfeiting and obvious tire traces in those desert moments of tracking - just lazy. sloppy work. Damage. The actors did it well, but I've definitely seen that they all do better. Ben Johnson is always a joy. I saw this flick almost 30 years ago; was then disappointed and stayed as it was 30 years later.
