First I loved Ray Bradbury's novel. This is a horror that goes under your skin and will stay with you later. It was one of his best books, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and dandelion butter. I just hope this movie is fine. It had many opportunities, with great pain, such as Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote the script itself. In addition, it has PAM GRIER! <br /> <br /> How does it fail? <br /> <br /> There may be spoilers. <br /> <br /> First, it was disappointed. Much of the horror of the book disappeared because Bradbury must be forced to keep the violence to a minimum. All the book's visuals ... gone. Everything that made you hit ... gone. <br /> <br /> And then it is there. Like many of the movies that Disney's threw out in the 1980s, the children of this movie can't act. And this mistake was a lot for me, neither of them saw 13, but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship was not addressed. It was more like they were familiar. <br /> <br /> You think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could miss it in the roles of Mr. Halloway and Mr. Dark. But here's how they just don't care. All they want to do is somehow mortgage or pay off. It is far from being among the best results. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was good at witch, but the dust witch himself was not well drawn. He is much less evil and has no presence as he did in the book. <br /> <br /> And all that was out of the book. Balloon night, Jimi's house celebration, Mr. Dark's actual death, which happened to Mr Coogan in the merry circle, the fate of the light barn vendor, the real death of the witch and so much more. <br /> <br /> And the special effects were bad even in the 1980s. The condemnation of one thing with inverted horses was not really horrible and it was a weird green mist that had nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> I could continue with this film between the original novel, but it boils blood. Don't look at this movie, but read the book. This is Bradbury's classic.
