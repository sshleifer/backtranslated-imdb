I just didn't get this movie ... Was it musical? no .. but there were choreographic songs and dancing in it ... <br /> <br /> It was a serious drama .... didn't work it wasn't good enough. <br /> <br /> Is Whoopi Goldberg a high quality serious actor. <br /> <br /> I had trouble waking up with this unique movie. Attention is drawn to the respect of apartheid and students who died during the student uprising. But when the entertainment was very bad and the documentary film was worse, it was worse. <br /> <br /> See for yourself, but I hated it fairly
