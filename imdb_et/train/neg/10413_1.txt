There is no reason to watch this movie. If you have won and a lot of money and have spent your life in every pleasure and you have reached the point where you are casually relaxed and have the time to kill (as it will ever happen), get this movie from a video store (if you find it and make you laugh) , then ask for this movie, be prepared to make you understand the extreme wood that absolutely everyone is doing - people who didn't say anything.) Oliver Reed pulls his big career down, playing drunk - but wait for me to forget that is one reason why watch this movie - Claudia Udy, who shows her breasts!
