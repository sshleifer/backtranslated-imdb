As a regular film observer, I can't say I had that feeling. It's not too emotional for drama, not too thrilling for thriller, not too fast action. In addition, some movie moments are hardly reliable. OK, I understand that soldiers are getting out of their way somewhat, but it is hard to believe that a person would risk his life in the middle of a hostile city and after screaming a professor, without asking questions (properly). It seems terribly romantic when it comes to animation, but it should be a serious film of war. There are many such episodes, so the whole picture gives the impression that it's just a movie preview and it needs a lot of work. <br /> <br /> It seems that filmmakers wanted to create an image of an emotional courageous soldier, but all of those "curves" of his psychology just seem unnatural. <br /> <br /> This picture left a question on my head: WHY? Why did they give him an Oscar? Why SIX? And IMHO is the most exciting part of the movie :)
