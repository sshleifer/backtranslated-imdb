It is a formula B scientific literature and the director did not make a broom about it. This is a dragon that the scientific team is recovering. Everything is done that you have seen many times before. This is a weak script with no real characters. In fact, it is full of stereotypical signs and situations. The director is attacking it by simply making it into a formula screen without trying to fool us, and it makes this film an easy complaint, but that's not something you remember for a while. This is best seen during cooking, cleaning and working. Unthinking fun. It is in your entertainment place, but it is definitely not something you sit with your friends unless you're just drunk and don't care. The mass class is likely to be 3.2. I don't think it's as dirty as most people, but I'm surprised that some people in the posts thought it was remarkable. It's really life for me, because I don't see any effort to make it even a memorable film.
