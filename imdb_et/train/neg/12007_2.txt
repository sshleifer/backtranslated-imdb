It is amazing to see how Nikhil Advan succeeds in attracting people to the theater until the day of liberation. I mean ..... look here, promotion is great, good enough songs and trailers are good. This makes it the first day of a full house, but only when people go and watch the movie, they realize that their money is not returnable. On the first day the house was full, the movie was out next week. <br /> <br /> This movie, inspired by "love in fact", is what they say they couldn't handle the whole thing. They tried to put on big letters, but in the end they couldn't even bring out the average performance. The stories are hollow and cheesy, so the audience can't contact any single person. This is a great disappointment to all those who like the big stars or the question to Nikhil Advan after his great success "Kal Ho Na Ho".
