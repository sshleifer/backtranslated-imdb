Half Past Dead, starring Steven Seagal starring in a big B-hit. Half Past Dead 2 is just a direct-video sequel, an action movie that has nothing to lose but has no ability to win anything. It's less fun than the first one: in all aspects. But it's worth it. If you like movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; if you also want to see the former WWE stars on the screen or even if you love watching the lakes, even if they are direct or not. <br /> <br /> Kurupt did a good job, Bill Goldberg was below average, I think he's not working. Kurupt is a good comedian, I say. The rest did work, but nothing amazing, anything far away. <br /> <br /> Technical details, well, Sony's output can't be great. Cinema was a disaster, but the general direction was acceptable. Whatever, just look at it if you want. If you look, you won't lose anything. But if you don't ... well, don't lose.
