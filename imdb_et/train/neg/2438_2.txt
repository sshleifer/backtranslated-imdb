This infamous end to Koen Wauter's career reached my attention for a bad night. According to the commenting index, I was not the first and I am not the last person in Western Europe to find out that this musician (undoubtedly one of the best of our modern pop scene, even with the consent of the Netherlands) tried to be an actor. It should not be possible to assess whether or not it should have done the experiment. In the case of intensive care she is quite pleasant, but it seems uncomfortable with the flick in which she participates. No one can blame him. It deserves all the possibilities and standards in the Verheyen Hall of Fame. The story of a groundbreaking maniac, who should die in an accident, but is alive and angry, has been talked about tens of times, and even without the initial twists, the director can provide more than a mediocre story through innovative settings and cinematography. /> <br /> IC content itself with hospital wing and few middle class houses. The tempo is boring. Tensions lose their credibility to the musical score in the last race, because the appearance of each murderer is accompanied by a tedious threatening melody, followed by outbursts of orchestras, which are highly recommended and in any case as bloodless as a small budget can do. The sexual scene is free, but not less attractive. A couple of Amsterdam could have done that. When dealing with the parade, the entire sub-block between Wauter and the girl does not work. It might have been a more effective emotional connection on the screen if they were just victims who loosened halfway through the physical intercourse of their nerves. I do not even give other members a reputation with dignity, because they should all be cut into small, fatty pieces. In fact, most of them are. The ones I probably remember for the genre: pretty sister and two cops. <br /> <br /> So, in the cavalry, the cavalry will only be rescued in time. (Anti-hero) must be taken out of a cable-based, mostly smart way of thinking, because former red berets often do not get parts in these films; they can overcome the illusion of the immunity of the killer. Aside from the events, Wauters kills the doctor and rescues him. <br /> <br /> No one, I'm not ready. It's not like the story goes. Wauters is doing his heroic attempt, but is beaten by hell that is close to "Clockwork for Orange", so it's a girl who picks up the drill killer and hitting the brain of doctors. Although this method provides the killer with more than the usual 9 mm balls, the doctor will survive to allow the IC to achieve an 80 minute mark. <br /> <br /> I should have done my point now. Intensive Care is a bad movie that can only be enjoyed by Bad Taste lovers who can control Verhey's memorable statements and do some for themselves and try to sit in this way. For example, the value of a doctor clown mask (Halloween) (unwanted) parody and final confrontation in the park (chase at the end of Friday 13th). <br /> <br /> Allow me, however, to stop by giving some of the few elements that give little credit to IC. George Kennedy is not one of them. All he has to do is tolerate a terrible monologue made by a doctor / French actress and seen as frightening when they let him go down in the flames to mark his big name stand-in. He could have played his part of Naked Gun again to get beef but for a longer time. Finale can be one of them. I had never seen the magic that would have come to the fireworks inside to crush him against a flexible fence. It's good to laugh. <br /> <br /> Identify one really good point for intensive care ... Koen Wauters learned his lesson and devoted himself fully to his music. It makes me wonder how many publications of the Paris-Dakar race she must stop before her senses reach. <br /> <br />
