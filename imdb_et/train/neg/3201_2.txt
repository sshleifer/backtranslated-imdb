Joe Don Baker is a very small and small actor of actor here ... he was good at Goldeneye and made a good Bond wool in The Living Daylight and has appeared in several other films. One of the things he can't do is control the film he's in this extremely bad revenge movie in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed by killing a killer brother and sending a killer to Italy, but some boys are causing Malta to fly and the killer can get away. The rest of the movie sees Joe Don returning the killer here and there, Joe Don has been arrested several times, Joe Don tortures the Bartender and has been interrupted and so on. The film is pretty bad and you can't find yourself exactly by pulling Joe Don's character. You'll be surprised how many times Joe Don's hero gets a punch and how incompetent he is. The crowning part of the film comes when Joe Don pursues the murderer in the entire territory of Malta with the killer in the priest and then arrives at the boats and pursues them all over Malta. This movie also includes one of the worst closures to end the movie ever.
