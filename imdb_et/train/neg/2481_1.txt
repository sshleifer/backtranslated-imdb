I had never heard of Larry Fessenden before, but when deciding to write and manage it, he should consider his kennel to be a daily actor. Like many others here, I don't know how to categorize this movie, it wasn't scary or spooky, so it can't be called horror, the plot was so thin that it couldn't be a drama, no intercourse, so it can't to be a thriller, it's just a bad movie you should only see if you were a fan of the Blair witch project. People who liked this film used words like "ambiguity" and complex and subtle, but they read something that wasn't there. Like Blair's witch, people were scared because people thought they should be scared and bought some horrible things that it was terrible. This movie actually started with a "meeting" with the locals after the fear. It seemed like today's release, but then in the next 45 minutes (more than half of the movie) nothing happened, the family put their own holiday home, which was all very nice and dandy, but not a little fun. It was obvious that the locals would have been involved to some extent, but Essendon has no clear idea of ​​how to tense the film. Finally, if something happens, it is not even clear how the father was fired, how he dies (the sister said his liver was only grazed) and all the time this wendigo spirit obviously seems to be a very awkward shooter. 3rd class special effects. The movie is called Wendigo, but it was not explained in a clear way, the movie ends up being confused and leaves you very dissatisfied, I would have saved in 15 minutes, but I wanted to see if this film could redeem itself. It wasn't.
