American Pie has gone far from the first distance. At first I believe that the actors have no idea what they are doing and instead it is just a remake of the college party nuts. The story is about two college college boys (with a younger younger) who describe the dreams of visiting college just to experience late night, sex and of course cheese. The plot is stupid and comes from the original pie. In fact, they never had any apple cake in the movie. <br /> <br /> Luckily I work in a video store and can rent it for free. But keep in mind that this is a waste of time if you do not have absolute nudity and crazy drinking psychic films. I am myself and I believe that even Evan's almighty would be a better choice instead.
