I really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie, but wow, it became nervous or I should say, "just stupid." This is another example of obsolete humor. It might have been funny in 1940, but not now .... not even close. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is always interesting to watch. She especially liked her to switch from her boyfriend and Busby Berkeley's musical voice to a high voice, where she is mature and sounds. the cast players just played stupid characters, the worst being the Maxford coffee company manager (Raymond Walburn) who did nothing but cried all the time. He was brutally heard and was a big hit to the film.
