Oh, what I need, another 19th century England movie. What's pretty much like the usual England, but nobody is breaking the football stadium. In this picturesque lords, dames, and other randomly selected titles, Charlotte Gainsbourg walks like Jane Eyre, this novel that no one is ever prepared for. Mr. Rochester's crib, where he tries to teach a French girl to look at an empty ward all the time. One day, Mr.Rochester (William Hurt's auto-pilot) returns to fall in love with Jane and all that, but there's still a question about her fruit tree, which is locked in the attic. Carefully distribute the fire (they probably rented a set), the movie finally comes to an end. Everything seemed really authentic, this is something I think. But then again, skin.
