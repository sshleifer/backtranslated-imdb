I thought my favorite Martian was very boring and pulled out !! It wasn't funny at all. The audience just sat all the movie and didn't laugh at all !!! Not even the children laughed! This is a sad Disney movie! I thought they would have found someone better than playing Martian, not Christopher Lloyd! He was really stupid !! And he wasn't funny! I thought the talking suit was really stupid !!! In the original TV series, clothing does not speak or move! In my opinion, they should not waste this movie on their time !! I'll give her two thumbs down! Really a waste of time and I don't recommend a movie to anyone !!! Thanks !!
