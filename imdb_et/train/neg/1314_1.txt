This is the last worst face. There's nothing good about this movie. The plot has the usual fool, the dialogues don't make any sense, humorous scenes didn't hear anything about true humor. The actors just don't play, the worse they don't even try. The script itself is somewhat the same as Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. There is only one good thing in this flick, fighting. They are well choreographic, as expected from Hong Kong boys, and they are the only reason to watch the Prince of the Sun. Although I believe that the struggles have to fill an empty space, so the scriptwriter did not need to think over the story. But this weak and absurd plot can prevent you from looking at it to the end. Avoid this if you are not a dragon lady Cynthia Rothrock fan.
