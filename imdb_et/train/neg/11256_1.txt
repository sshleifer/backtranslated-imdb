What a waste of time! I've been trying to sit through "Sky Captain .." about 6 times and every time, in about 3 minutes, I'm going to do something else - something else! It's a dull movie, the actor is terrible, bored of writing, and probably the first-time director because it's stiff, and I wanted to love it, I love sci-fi, old rockers, and I appreciate trying to get Flash Gordon and To Metropolis, but to my God, to take it. I worked for Paramount Pictures and I was writing Sherry Lansing in 1993 when I used a blue screen for screen tests. He said they never had any interest or need to do so. Sherry was right in 1993, but he had to forget his advice when he shot this dog green. The blue screen affected the effect, but not the whole movie. Let us not forget that Jude and Jolie are not terrible actors (but easy to see) Paltrow's performance reminds me of the high school's efforts only under a qualified director. the funny thing is that the Sky Captain director will continue to work after that. It's trade, not art!
