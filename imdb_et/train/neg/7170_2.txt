Yikes made this movie a blow. The characters were weak, the plot weaker. I thought it couldn't be too bad because he had Christoper Walken, oops. He has to do it because he was bored and needed money. The characters had to be Irish, but nobody had an Irish accent. I am desperately trying to find something like this, I can't, unless Walken did a good job of wood. Find something for reading or discovering, never see this movie.
