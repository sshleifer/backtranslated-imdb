When HEY ARNOLD! first came in 1996, looked at it. It was one of my favorite events. Then the same episodes began to show again and again, so I was tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching it. I was surprised when I heard HEY ARNOLD! MOVIE because it doesn't seem to be nearly as popular as some other Nickelodeon cartoons like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. However, when I had nothing better to do, I went to watch the movie anyway. When I entered the theater I didn't expect much. I was just waiting for this to be a children's play comic, like the RECESS movie. I think I got what I expected. It was a stupid kid's movie and more. Here and there were some good parts, but mostly this film was smelly. Just for kids.
