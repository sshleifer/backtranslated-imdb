I tried to stop this movie three times, but it's terrible for God. Case: Mother and daughter go to bed and breakfast, mother stops for gas, crazy gas station crazy for her spider, whose B & B tries to rape her. He flees, leads to a B & B and instead of riding a ballistic and he wants to call the police, the story just continues with lukewarm behavior on both sides. Wow. <br /> <br /> Other logic shortcomings are numerous. Acting is also lukewarm and the neighbor's warning is given in a really bad, ill-acted moment. <br /> <br /> Moments of acute nerves / deaths that intertwine unevenly with time-consuming blends of aggregates. <br /> <br /> Less focused on gore, more appreciated mood and story.
