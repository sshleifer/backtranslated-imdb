Wowwwwww, about an hour ago, I ended up watching this terrible movie !!! I wanted to turn it off for the first 10 minutes, but I thought I'd give it a chance because it was just better. Or at least have some redemptive qualities, as I thought it would be at least what you think is a movie type or as really intelligent, or very well filmed or something ... Needless to say, it wasn't so and I wasted about an hour and a half of life. I'm not even going to get into why it's terrible because it's a waste of my time to explain that it may contain a spoiler ... IMDb, you should soothe the spoilers and pay more attention to people who don't rate movies and comments pay to write good comments or get involved in a movie or something else. I thought it would be humorous to see that the closet is bad after this terrible movie, and I was very shocked to see quite high ratings ... all the ratings with about 7-10 stars must be obviously some completely different film ... Im still big IMDb fan, but I mean this rating process seriously, because this film should not be higher than maaaybbbeee like 3.
