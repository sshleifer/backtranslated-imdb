Usually I have no problem with a free oath in a movie, but it really disturbed me. All they did was swear. For the whole movie. (And as someone else said, get cancer) It was boring, strangling and pretentious. I wouldn't be if I was you. Nor is it that I don't like movies that, like most people who like, say, "look at life". I love to eat a drink man, and all that happens is that the burden of the Taiwanese people is leading their lives. But I could relate to them. I've never met anyone who swore as much as the participants in the film, and I worked on a construction site before. So go figure. Having said that William H. Macy made me smile. One time. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Avoid if you don't enjoy tedium.
