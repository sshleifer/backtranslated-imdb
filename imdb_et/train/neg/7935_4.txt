Blind bought this movie and I'm quite upset that I paid as much as I did, but I would say it is at least a profitable rental for some cool death and ridiculous behavior. It's not a good movie, but I have to say I was pretty funny. I think it could be called so bad - that's good. As I said, the actor is terrible, I feel I could have done a better job that shows at least some emotion. The story is nothing new and it has been done better. I think I just have a soft spot for every carnival-esquire movie. I would say its renting or downloading, but definitely not buying it. It is not worth more than one o'clock.
