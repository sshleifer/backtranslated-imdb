I recently watched this movie with my sister who likes Sophia Loren's performances. I'm the person they call the cultural barbarian. I hate art in any shape or form. Rambo is my movie, action, kills, blood, horror. If you feel that way, this movie like a plague. No one dies, does not act, nudity or anything like that. Let me make a few sentences. It starts in five minutes with black and white Nazi propaganda. For every Italian housing construction parade, except for housewife, fascist and caregiver, takes part in Hitler's honor. The housewife, who has been cheated by her husband, meets an anti-fascist. She falls in love with her, wants to love her, but the fascist is gay. Nevertheless, they love each other. At the end of the day, the housewife reads a book from her homosexual lover and the agent himself deportes her. End. You want a shorter overview? CAUSATION ... Is it short enough? The man had to use his weapon at the beginning of this movie and shoot himself to save the audience from this cruelty. On the side, my sister noticed this movie. As I said, I'm a cultural barbarian ...
