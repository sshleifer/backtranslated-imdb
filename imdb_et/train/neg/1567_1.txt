I had to change my mind about the worst movie in the world that just saw it. That's it! <br /> <br /> Don't make this mistake, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> Here's a list of reasons: <br /> <br /> A hopeless storyline (despite being based on a serious story). Terrifying action (what was judge Reinhold's thinking) Incredibly bad stunts. Childhood Dialogue. Unnecessary consistency. Lack of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Take a picture? <br /> <br />
