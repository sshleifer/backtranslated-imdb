Where to start? # 1 Son of Amitabhi, played Akshaye Khanna, is 30. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has been in prison for 33+ years ... <br /> <br /> A) Telepathically transmitted sperm home? <br /> <br /> B) a nice Pakistani guard asked him to mail him? <br /> <br /> C) They allow marriage visits in secret Pakistani letters <br /> <br /> D) All of the above instructions <br /> <br /> E) Manufacturers were a little too much at the time the script was approved: < br /> <br /> <br /> # 2) Amrita Rao (Yummm!) wants Khanna - she is yum, yum, yummy ... and apparently she wants her - who wouldn't be, right? ... But when his father rolled out, and then killed (I hardly think it is a "spoiler", because you have to be brain-dead and blind to not come to the movie), he is at the peak of this catastrophe and his hat ( metaphorically) quite unknown, he leaves behind to save his father, never loses his loss and says (paraphrasing) "If God wants us to meet again" ... Basically this means that I get my d d done my job, sorry for my for Loss - CYA! Buh Bye! "- a call that goes beyond low lifetime Hollywood standards ... <br /> <br /> # 3) There are so many holes in this terrible waste of time that you can call a movie that can drive all jeeps, truck camels and all the extra stuff pass - really, complete and all-time waste - Oh! There is a great dancing sequence (yes, only one - as in the dance series - regardless of quality) big belly dancing - but NOT worth Veer-Zaara or Lakshya rental (does Hrithik Roshan take never act?) for better Indo-Pak conflict movies ... In fact, Veer-Zaara is pretty funny 7.5 / 8 I'd say!
