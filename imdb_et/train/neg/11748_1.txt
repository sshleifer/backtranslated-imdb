This movie must be one of the worst I've ever seen on DVD! The story could have been clicked if the film had more financial resources and writers who would have finished a pointless and sick scene that I very much warn parents ... But the story is like an open cannon. If the filmmaker had such a thing, it would have come. It reminded me a lot of fast movies, bad script writing and filming in the 60s. <br /> <br /> The only sensible character in the whole movie was barman and beaver. The rest of the film could have been easily done by high school students. I give this film a rating of 1 because it is really terrible and left the whole family feeling a scam. My advice - don't look at it !!!
