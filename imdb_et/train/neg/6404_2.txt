Spoilers ... if such a thing is possible ..... . . . . . As a fan of Rabid Robin Williams, I felt the need to buy this film first on the screen. Wow ... I couldn't imagine a more moody movie. In principle, the movie takes one bad joke after another, that your uncle Artie will tell you after dinner and dramatize them. Robin Williams plays a lawyer with a 30-second skit. <br /> <br /> I am all outrageous humor, but this humor was not pleasantly vulgar, or ribald ... it was just spiritual. There's no redeeming qualities for this movie, except Robin Williams fanatics, like me, who just have to own every movie.
