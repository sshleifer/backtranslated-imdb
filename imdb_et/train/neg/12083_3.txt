Yes, I think. It's hard to say. It's hard to have emotions from a movie that doesn't have emotions. This film is as sterile as the surgeon's scalpel. There are a couple of stone pillars on the ground, some stone seats, a couple of stone crosses and some rock players. They have no emotions! The only thing that records this movie is the fact that it is Hamlet and Hamlet is terribly written literature. Duplication was not so bad. The voices were true to the boring, gloomy, harsh, life-sucking atmosphere the film gave. I have seen this version of Hamlet on the fabulous Mystery Science Theater 3000 three times, and every three times I was on the edge of turning off the TV, even though it was MST 3K. <br /> <br /> Raising the dramatic task that deserves so much better.
