Tenants Two writers struggle to complete their books in all but insignificant apartment buildings. They help each other and then slowly build up tensions between them. <br /> <br /> It is based on Bernard Malamud's novel and, unfortunately, everyone says they are in this novel. Very little dialogue is natural with its purple and connotations. It would be like a college English head who has a claim full of claims. It is terrible and I found myself instantly immune to everything that the film had to say, which is shameful, because the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom. Snoop Dog is a fine form, unfortunately, none of these words and space can fail. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend this movie. Although not very bad, it is very talkative and pretentious that you would like to walk away. I lost interest in less than a third of the roads and I have to fight to get to the end. If you are interested, I'd try it with a cable, but I wouldn't see it as good.
