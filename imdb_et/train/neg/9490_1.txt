It's a complete and absolute garbage, a good example of what a BAD movie is like, no one can even like b-movie fans. Don't, I repeat, DO NOT waste your valuable time in this trash. Bad behavior, bad leadership, terrible (but I mean really scary) script and lack of idea what entertainment (in any form) is. I bought a DVD for $ 3, I swear I can almost pay for it. Burning is not enough for what this film made for me. I like b-movies, killing toys, weird lagoon monsters, but that's not far. You know the movies that are so bad that they're funny? Not even. Just old pathetic.
