I wanted a movie like this, it's SAW, blah blah blah ripoff, but I like those movies. Well done, it was all good, not brilliant, but good for the movie .... unfortunately these ingredients were gone! Action was terrible and was first seen when prisoners were introduced to their captain one by one (hoods taken off), comments and one liner are just terrible, yes I know bad writing .... but it's still bad writing with bad behavior . Two prisoners had been in a relationship with each other and didn't even admit that much more in the movie ..... <br /> <br /> Sorry, I don't even know why I barely watch it at all. <br /> <br /> I finish PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES & MORE PLOT HOLES! ISSUE!
