Oh my God. I bought this movie and ... I looked ... the whole thing. . . Okay, it's gonna be fine ... I know I'm in for a month or two months. Soon I hope to get rid of the flash. I started eating something after the movie, but I can't feel the courage to try and keep some food right now. Bad? Yes, bad. Very bad. BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. Wait, bad doesn't seem to send this message in the right direction. Hmm ... There is no word that would describe how terrible .... not terrible ... Hmm in a nasty terribly cast / behaved / filmed / directed / written. Now I don't know what to do, but throw it out. It could be burning, I wouldn't want it to end a thousand years at the bottom of an architectural well. The worst movie from "Hey happy"
