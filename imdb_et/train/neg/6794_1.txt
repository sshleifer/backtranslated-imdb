Friday the 13th step forward! There's an officially worse movie than your hateful series. I won this movie at a college competition and it was a waste of money, even if it was free. Jack Jones stands for a terrible singer who is trying to find some murderers. At least on Friday, the thirteenth has never forgotten me. I'd rather pull the nail than see it again.
