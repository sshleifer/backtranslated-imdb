This movie is a modest Spike Lee effort. He is capable of much more than this movie. Take the bus if it is probably racist, does nothing more than white and worsens the black status quo. The graph of this film is about a group of black men traveling by bus to a million people in Louis Farrakhan. The bus has every kind of person you can imagine: gay, muslim, gangbanger and uncle Tom (he's thrown off the bus). There was only one white person on the bus. He was accused of being racist when he drove by bus. Despite being jew and explaining, he is a racist and leaves the bus. I hate to say this, but such films need to realize their hypocrisy and the strengthening of steryotypes. It should not be seen as a triumph but a sad dissapointment. You may think I'm racist to write, but I mean well. Better luck next time Spike.
