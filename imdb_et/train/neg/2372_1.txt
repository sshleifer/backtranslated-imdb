For an amazing stupid, redundant and degrading closure on "Nightmare on Elm Street"! Part 6 is so incompetent that director Rachel Talalay deliberately wanted to make Wes Craven's original assumption into one big bad and tasty joke. It's not just the worst entry in the "Elm Street" harvest; it is also one of the most embarrassing films ever made, and it offends the fans of the genre! Story is stupid, character drawings are ridiculous, structure is all evil and ?? before anything else ?? special and visual effects are similar to Tom & Jerry's comic. The sequences in which Freddy Krueger's murders are endless and very uninteresting. Did we have to despise when Freddy Freddy turned to Breckin Meyer video game and pogo-sticker around the house walls? The story brings us to Springwood and it seems that Fredd has a middle-aged daughter. You think he would mention it in one of his earlier adventures, but not? In Springwood, there is only one teenage survivor, and Krueger uses her to contact her missing daughter. Another reason why this last part is so terrible is a totally illogical structure. The John Doe boy is introduced as a leading character, but then suddenly he dies and the plot continues with two adults! How would it be: Freddy Krueger, who spent five full-length films killing something other than teenagers, finally beat three adults wearing 3D glasses! Similar ruins destroy the whole being, isn't it? As for me, "Nightmare on Elm Street" has always been a terribly overpriced series, but so far, even the weakest items had at least some redeemable items. "Freddy Dead" is just unendurable and no one should waste their valuable time watching it.
