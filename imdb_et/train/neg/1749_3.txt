I have to say that it was the worst film of priyadarshan (unleashing a much better Kyon, which was also his director), it doesn't contain any specific story and just focuses on a body that shows actresses and some manners. I think priyadarshan is becoming too repetitive in his comedy flick, as govinda and David dhavan had previously done after giving the good entertainers they used to lose their audience. So it's good to focus more on the script and try some variations in your direction . Give us more herapher and malamal weeks of the week, not to give duds like garam masala!
