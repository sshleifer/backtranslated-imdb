Pam Grier's stars are Coffy. He is a sister who is looking for revenge, from drug dealers who got their sister involved in a bad heroine. Like every 70's, the Blaxploitation flick can also show that racist boys are just getting their desserts. <br /> <br /> In the 1970s, there were many of these films and they were really humiliating for the black and white audience. This is mainly due to the wrestling and humiliating, stereotypical characters of these films. Especially female characters. Other common threads between Coffy and other films of this type include brutal violence, corrupt police officers, car rides, a great deal of nudity and erratic proud women. Not to mention the ghettos of drug dealers, pimps, mobiles and other criminal contaminated cities. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was the undisputed queen of the 70s. He was great, being both harsh nails and fallen dead. Like his other films, Pam Coffy's has other characters. In fact, the Pam screen is so charismatic that such films are spectators without being the main character. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Grier, it's better to see other movies like Foxy Brown, or perhaps Foster on Friday. These films are much less empty than Coffy. Pam's character Coffy's too much to get bad guys. The pam characters from his other Blaxploitation films don't get so little to catch up, as Coffy did. <br /> <br /> I'd say I only look at Coffy if you don't see any of Pam Grier's second movie. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Only Pami's talent as an actor makes Coffy's viewing acceptable.
