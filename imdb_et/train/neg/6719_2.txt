This is a great idea for the film, but unfortunately this is not a great movie. What starts with a sweet and almost silly romantic comedy fluffer in love with the Fluffer spirals, which is uncontrolled by the strange combination of genres and real plots of land with BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA AND LOUISE, SHOWGIRLS, FRISK liberal loans. and even a curious 400 BLOWS dash that was thrown to the end. (At least the director did his research!) The result may not be boring, but in the end it is slippery, well-produced flick nothing. But all the actors make a game with the material and there are some good laughs in the world behind gay-porn. <br /> <br />
