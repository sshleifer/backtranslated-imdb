If you had only decided on the film, everything that gave the stage "A Chorus Line" to Pulitzer, and the Broadway audience who held the war horse for 15 years, were all heavy drugs, because one singular feeling this movie is definitely NOT. <br /> <br /> Whatever someone thought Richard Attenborough was suitable for this material, it completely mystifies me, but he does music that is almost entirely on the move, like sitting on the screen like a one-time noise. <br /> <br /> Not happy with the original score, as it was originally written, that someone decided that what the film really needed was a whole new song to give the film a zipper. So we attack the Oscar candidate (!) "Surprise, Surprise". Well surprise, surprise, the song smells and so does the film. <br /> <br /> Rating: D
