This film initiated a very promising story about a director who loses his vision and blind woman who is obliged to help her. But somewhere in the middle, it seemed that script writers didn't know where to go from there. <br /> <br /> One incredible event followed (Russia has to be very small because they all come together) all the time), the female manager's character is understandable (why is she still following her after leaving the ship? Why doesn't she try borrowed a cell phone for someone to call?) were completely ridiculous (was the story of a mother and a boy who had to be funny? And what was the story of a younger sister?). However, the film was able to predict all of this seemingly arbitrary arbitrary. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing is that there were many options. As I said, the idea of ​​the film was good, the visuals and scores were very beautiful, and the actors of the main players were also good. It could have been a really good movie ... but it wasn't.
