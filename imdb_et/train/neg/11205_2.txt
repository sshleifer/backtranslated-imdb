Yes, well, I was definitely sorry that I gave up my Saturday night watching this amazing little but very long movie. Obviously, it didn't make the main character to steal two hours of my life. Here is the appearance of the antihero "No regrets." We have this jerk, so confusing, so wandering, so selfish, purposeful, and unlikely that it was extremely difficult to get attracted to a very favorable businessman's son, Jaemen, if that was not the case: physical attraction. He states otherwise that it is love. But after seeing it, it's like loving Charles Manson because you lose the beard. (Alright, he's not so bad, but still real redeemable qualities). I never managed to bypass the endless stems of Sumin. It was once said that Jaemin loves Sumin. Maybe it's a cultural thing that flew over my head: crazy / merciful = crazy love in Seoul. It has to be because a little more than half of the movie is another one who is pursuing the second and the last part is pursuing a back and forth point, which I thought it turned into a comedy of a screwball. I was waiting for a tiger called "baby" to look like. Okay, so Sumin is running two jobs while attending school, as much as someone tries to do better. But after his first taste of the attraction of his ambush, he gives up his daily work for some kind of prostitution. What? OK, well, as mentioned above, obsession doesn't prevent work / career change, and if you throw a lot of other very angry characters, you get one cluttered movie where incredible events seem to happen without construction. Basic film, not 100% terrible, but you can do better with foreign gay-themed movies.
