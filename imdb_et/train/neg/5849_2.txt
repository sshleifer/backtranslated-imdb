As a fan of silent movies, I waited for the first time. I was quite disappointed. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, the film seems to be one long, long for Maxwell's car. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the pursuit scene was about half the length I have, I can enjoy the movie more. But it got very fast. And when I know that reality has been stretched many times in movies without reducing the viewer's enjoyment of Mexican bandits? I mean, they drive a car through the mountains, a car that most of the time moves about one mile an hour, but they can't catch up?
