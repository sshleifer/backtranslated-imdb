This stupid, unlikely story is redeemed only at the opening of the scene where the hard-boiled police detective gives some almost audible lines that confirm our greatest fears: He's dead. Perhaps the film would have been recorded if the director had forgotten the martyrdom of A. Martinez to the detriment of an anonymous actor who had briefly filled the screen. The fact that hacking from the street does not get to such a demanding water film is not less likely than a villain doing murder, dropping rocks into a quarry designed for an unsuspecting diver. His moment is short; his promise is immense. Maybe it is treated more with the screen than the vague screen when there is a sequel to the failed movie.
