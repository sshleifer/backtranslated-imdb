American Pie: Beta House is unique among genres. On the one hand, it is a comedy that lacks plots and few really clever jokes. On the other hand, it is a porn that is too soft to actually turn on all viewers. Beta House is essentially a collage of sexual scenes - some humiliate, others simply fascinate experiments with humor - with a few thin plot points that strive for unity. The characters are barely even two-dimensional, most of the development depends on Naked Mile's knowledge, and "important" plot scenes are so far away that you don't know why the writers even felt the need for the story. <br /> <br /> In all justice, I didn't go into this movie without expectations. I liked the first three American Pie films and I thought the Band Camp and Naked Mile were the rent. I thought Naked Mile was pretty good enough to get rid of the theaters, and when I saw some of the same characters coming back to the Beta house, I was happy to see this installment. I was aware that many forms would have multiple events and sexual humiliation. And I was pleased with it because in the past these scenes were supported by the story and were integrated into the plot. But at Beta House, it's almost the same as writers forget about how the other AP movies worked. They spent too much energy working in the nudity they forgot to write about. <br /> <br /> This movie is disappointing and not even worth one dollar rent. Jokes are flat, the story is non-existent, and the porn aspect is too annoying when it's all you really care about.
