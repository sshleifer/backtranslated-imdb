It is sad to see what the film is trying to do, and it is quite obvious that it was far from the mark. Film students should take this as a lesson and a warning. Would the graduate have an idea. He wants full control. So he writes, manages, produces, his cinema masterpiece all by himself. Usually, his concept is far from his budget. Typically, he writes a superfluous script that is full of any tag lines he can come up with. Usually he is more interested in the great sweeping of the story, not in the fact that they are acting with the actors of the individual scenes. Usually he gets a film that is weak, trying to create miracles with a low budget. He usually comes with a number of meetings (we cannot do justice when we call these scenes) that feel they are written by a 12-year-old. And he usually comes out with badly-acting scenes that can't capture the viewer. If you look at the judges from this point of view, you can immediately say that it is a normal price.
