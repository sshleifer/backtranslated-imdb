When I saw this movie, about 1979, it became the first film I ever left out. Nothing is worse than comedy, which just can't be funny, and it will be lost forever (though I can't speak the movie in the last 25 minutes). None of the schits had anything original. Although I enjoy the humor, these sketches were unnecessarily vulgar. What was even more annoying was that this movie was promoted as "Robin William's First Movie", using its new-found "Mork and Mindy" TV series. But his role turned out to be so small that he couldn't even be seen on the screen.
