I want to make "Holmes with the door" red, but I can't do it all together. The appropriately looting and over-edited WONDERLAND gives Kilmer a role that directs Morrison at the same time .... but how coy is this movie for the famous 14 inches! Australian criminals are filming it all the time and instead skipping graphical violence ..... as someone once belonged to double cinema standards in the US: "Kiss Breast and It's X, Tackle and Its PG 13" .. WONDERLAND is too 14 minutes too Long and at the end there is a relaxing spiral we all rejoice to escape from the cinema. How many films are called WONDERLAND? There must be six in the last decade. The captured violence and the milding color set the barren tone, but the glowing doll becomes tiring, as if we were in their nostrils all the time. Having some tips on DOORS and TAXI DRIVER, it will be forgotten the next day.
