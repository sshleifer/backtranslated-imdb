"I just watched this movie last night and I don't think I think I'd ever think of any of the actors because this movie is back in my mind." <br /> <br /> The above statement may be good or bad. I mean every time I see Tom Cruise or Demi Moore in the movie, I think "some good men" are good. Now, every time I see Ron Perlman or Kristy Swanson, I mean "Tinseltown" which is very bad. <br /> <br /> I chose this, thinking it might be smart or at least me and Arye Gross, and with the aforementioned Swanson and Perlman, I thought it wouldn't be at least bad. You could say that the film was made from a budget of Wheeling, Indiana (where exactly.), But maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie. ERROR. <br /> <br /> This movie is not funny or fun in any word. It's just there and runs 84 excruciating slow minutes. <br /> <br /> Characters are thin on paper. You almost care about NO characters, and because they are two of the most struggling Hollywood writers with a dream that are all two fighting writers with the dream of writing it, you need to know about them. Okay, two REAL writers know the versions on their screen, so they see the audience. They do not even think about the character, except that they try to capture it on the "Gilligan Island". <br /> <br /> The plot is unigene. Two men live in a shelter, where one of them saves a bed and also has about twenty people. The rest of the story is lively and stupid. Have you seen "National Lampoon's Favorite Deadly Sins"? Another story about Joe Mantegna is a television writer who doesn't find a good story to make a TV movie, so he creates it. Now replace the scriptwriter, morph Mantegna's television writer with tedious participants half of your age and take the comedy and have this movie. <br /> <br /> Participants are trying. Kristy Swanson is in the movie for even 10 minutes and gives the film the best result. He is still hot, but it would help if he actually filmed CAMEOS instead of a continuous movie. As for everyone else, I don't think it was the actor's fault because they have BAD material. <br /> <br /> Go look at the National Lampoon movie, but stay away from this movie.
