"A Gentleman's Game" uses the golf club in a national club environment to illustrate the youngster's discovery of honesty, prejudice and other lifestyle. How many times did I think I knew where the movie was under the title, but that it turned out to be wrong. Unfortunately, I'm not so sure that filmmakers would know where he was going. The decisive moment of this film is probably the scene where Gary Blue hits "The Karate Kid" and all the concepts she gets as a young golfer's mentor will debut. It is refreshing so that this film refuses to follow most of the simplified and over-processed film formulas. However, too much of it comes to be hurt. During the fall, people fall from all the civility claims or fail to respect the things in which they believe or have encountered much less respect than their place in society. Unfortunately, there is often no solution to these moments. And apart from the fact that the club is their background, there is no actual continuity or linkage. Unfortunately, writers and directors were unable to save a better film, especially given some talented participants and possible settings.
