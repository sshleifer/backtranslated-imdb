I've never been a big fan of Mormon movies. Being Mormon, I've always felt that humor was too exclusive for the LDS community and made us feel like obsessive wackos. I was hoping it would be a breath of fresh air, the Halestorm movie that I finally discuss with my non-Mormon friends. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I thought that because it had a B list talent like Clint Howard, Gary Coleman, Andrew Wilson and Fred Willard (one of my favorites), it should be at least a little funny. Besides, the church ball is mature, with lots of amusements and such. But I have to say that during the film it seemed that no one knew what they were doing. Every joke gradually dropped and every opportunity for a really funny gag was ignored. The dialogue was happier and the film had some of the worst character development I've ever seen. Every single character, but Wilson was less than one-dimensional. It is hard to believe that after nine re-writing, the film was still as meaningless as the train wreck I saw. I can't put the rage that I felt through the words. My friends and I were in the last game scene, so we went to premiere in Washington City, UT. Director Kurt Hale was there and I have to say that I avoided him after the show. He waited in front of the door, seemingly ready for feedback. I couldn't tell him that his film was not just about one and a half hours of my life, but left a nasty, painful scar that I never forgot. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the specific problems I had: a caretaker and a chubby piano player with a little love story, but these two characters stayed out and it was impossible to take care of, so my friends and I kept thinking, why we had to take care of these two flat, uninteresting characters. There were a lot of sub-blocks that rose up each time, everyone allowed the audience to laugh, but everyone came and went into the smoke, which ended before you even started caring. It was pretty much how the whole movie felt. <br /> <br /> This movie was a great census and I feel bad for anyone waiting for the first REAL funny Mormon movie. True, the jokes are not too exclusive to the Mormons. And again, it's hard to say what was a joke and what was the feeling of a hard ring in my ears. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. Keep in mind the fantasy that this movie is fun. Damage yourself to the disappointment I went through
