*** May contain spoiler. *** <br /> <br /> When you live in TOKYO TIME, there were some bold experiments in which real-life actors were given movie sections, provided they had to take a strong anti-prescription anxiety, anti-depression and antipsychotic medication (this is the classic psychiatric department that changes patients drooling zombies) all during filming, then this film would take much more interest. Or if film production was another attempt, where all the participants were sleepy before filming and filming, then TOKYO TIME can be explained more easily. <br /> <br /> As it is, this movie is filled with live, low-power participants. In the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking to his sister, it turned out that he had trouble opening his eyes. In almost every scene, he speaks every part of his body motionless while sitting on his line. From beginning to end, her facial expression is best described as "almost sleep". <br /> <br /> Don't talk to actors who talk about each other's lines, because these actors can't barely end any dialogue line. Everyone speaks with a depressing, unanimous voice. Don't laugh. Don't scream. No power. No one has enough energy to smile. Result: Complete and boring. <br /> <br /> And that doesn't help to make the direction simple and amateurish. It is better to look at GREENCARD, which has a similar plot and has charm and energy. Or, for an unusual Japanese romance, see LONG VACATION, which has a great deal of everything from TOKYO TIME.
