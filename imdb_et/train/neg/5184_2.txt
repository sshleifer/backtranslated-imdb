I assumed I enjoyed a romantic comedy with Hip Hop but was disappointed at many levels. First, this story is so badly recycled that it is almost intolerable. Secondly, the setting, acting and story are not very authentic or credible. Third, there are many more good black people who choose than these standard choices. How about a certain originality? Third, there were very few Hip Hop songs as a whole - if at all. Nothing seems really central. All in all, the film was a great disappointment, but the editing style was very interesting and almost worth the movie.
