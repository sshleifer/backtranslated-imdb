it turned out to be another failed attempt of a ridiculous sci-fi channel. I'm not sure who wrote the script and interpreted the poem, but I'm sure it was about a 17-year-old teenager who thought it would be awesome if the film had a crosshair. AAAAAAAH! when I saw this part, I lost all hope. Then ... they went into the heorot, which seems to be the ship Christopher Columbus drove! When they arrive at Heorot (which should be the Norwegian Meadow Hall), the idiots' sci-fi group decided to turn the heor into a great rock. when i saw this part .. i wanted to scream. I really wanted this movie to be good, but sci-fi hasn't brought a good movie yet, so I don't know why I got my hopes. Oh..and Grendel and her mother are also stupid. (this comment is off on the topic "Grendel") If someone reads it from a sci-fi channel ... there are some good tips. DO NOT MOVIE USE WHAT YOU ARE ALWAYS ABOVE TO CREATE PEOPLE THAT IS NOT A SCIENTIFIC Fiction! AND AT THE SAME TIME, TO STOP LOW GRADE ACTIVITIES TO RECOMMEND BALDWIN YOU, AS YOU! WHAT DOES NOT MOVIE HOW TO WORK!
