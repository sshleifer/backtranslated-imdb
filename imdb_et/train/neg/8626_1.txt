Looking at other comments, I am surprised that potential viewers have no warnings about what they are waiting for when they rent this garbage. First of all, I rented this with the understanding that it was Indiana Jones competently thawed. What I got was one of the most offensive films I remember trying to sit, even more shocking about the relatively high product values ​​of the film. <br /> <br /> I don't think this is a spoiler, but if that is the case, you need to be warned ... <br /> <br /> When he looks into his important second separated head, all the tools, rent it on the flick. If not, I would recommend you look for entertainment elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Come to think that the scene will sum up the movie so briefly that nothing like that.
