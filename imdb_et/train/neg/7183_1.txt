This is the classic story I've ever seen. They are modernizing it unnecessarily, and some points are just sick. <br /> <br /> Songs are rarely played. They seem to be thrown at random. Marley's flying scene is pointless and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's not just one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's definitely the worst music I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This is probably just classic, because "Christmas Carol" is such a classic story. Just because the original story was classic does not mean that some cheap adaptation is.
