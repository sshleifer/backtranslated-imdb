I can't get the rating of Amati Girls and I think I was really kind of giving out of 10 out of 10. Otherwise, it would have been a great story, where there were actually more or less decent actors, my eyes became a perfect farce. There are so many clich√©s in this flick, women's hair is just terrible and most scenes are more than unreal or seem fake. There is no real passion in this film, but a number of participants who move beyond any of the borders it hurts. It's not funny to be comedy, it's too fake-sad to really touch, so it's not good in my eyes. When I looked at it, I couldn't believe how something was done on my TV in my living room in Switzerland. But .. maybe it was still OK and it just disappeared in translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the most strange movies I've ever seen and it's definitely not good! Sorry.
