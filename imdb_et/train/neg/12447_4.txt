Sondra Locke stinks in this movie, but then she was terribly "actor". Unfortunately, he pulls everyone else (including the actual life of Clint Eastwood's outflow with him. But what did Clint Eastwood mean when he stared in it? Reading a script should have told him it was going to be an extremely weak story, basically no story or plot, add boring, bad action, even from normal good Eastwood, but there is no action except for a few arguments and I think this movie will rise to a bunch of natural sleep disorders. Wow! Could the film be more boring? I think dehydrating or growing grass can be more fun.
