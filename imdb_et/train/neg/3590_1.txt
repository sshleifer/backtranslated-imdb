How low is someone trying to reuse old glory? ST: HF will be happy to show you. <br /> <br /> If you are used to seeing what has been done for a good Star Trek show, don't look at it. <br /> <br /> Writing is a hodge podge, the actors' images of their characters are weak and above all the design work is even doggy. <br /> <br /> As you look at the strong captains, don't look here! Like a strong Federation attitude? Forget it here! Starfilt mocking hair SPIKES-bearing flags. <br /> <br /> While the seemingly mentally weak master confuses and within two minutes after the opening plan credits, Ensign Spikey tries to arrange an engineer. It just breaks down there. No, not even a uniform, for goodness. They are too small or too big, the collars down and the TNG Seasons One and two uniforms mixed with Season Three and DS9 uniforms. Strict discipline and tradition of any original that is absent in this production up to the stage! The only good thing about this show is the graphics that look a little better every season. OK, I'll take it back. Who uses the CG unconsciously? The designers of this exhibition. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about it, it offends your Star Trek idea, as it does in my mine. Not even the backlash of previous exhibitions will save this catastrophe. <br /> <br /> I looked at it openly when I looked at it, probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head was almost broken. This is bad.
