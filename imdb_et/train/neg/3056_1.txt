Before I saw it, I had seen pretty bad Christmas movies. But when I saw it, "Jingle All the Way" seemed better than "Godfather". "Santa Claus" is a cheerful movie about Santa to help some children, but it almost seems demonic. Santa's fun ho-ho-ho replaces the evil, the devil laugh that I'm sure many kids have turned off Christmas. The graph of this massacre is very strange, which fits all the performances and dialogues. Santa lives on the North Pole above the highlands, where he and his children all over the world are preparing for Christmas. But Santa has an enemy called Pitch or Satan. The pitch tries to destroy Santa's Christmas by making three boys naughty, and creating diversion, such as moving the chimney and warming the door cap. When Pitch causes a Christmas attack by a dog, this is a wizard by Santa's Christmas maker Pedro and Merlin to get Santa out of that bitter. <br /> <br /> All this movie that is bad is so strange. Satan dances a lot and he seems to be much happier than Santa. Santa speaks about giving gifts to all boys and girls, but it looks like he is delivering only 5 children to Mexico. Reindeer are toys, and when the reindeer laugh, I'm surprised that it doesn't bring tears to the child's eyes ... it's scary. Everything is terrible. The first 10 minutes are just Santa playing the organ when the kids sing it. Probably one of the strangest scenes of Santa shooting in a lace with a mini-cannon, and laughs over when Pitch dances around the pain. I think parents have a better testimony to their children about where children come from when they show them. The only positive thing is that you laugh hysterically when you value bad cinema. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 85 minutes.
