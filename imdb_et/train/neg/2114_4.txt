Just looking at the set, staging and editing is easy to say that the project lacked the right budget. Maybe Bela Lugos is meant to take such things away. Young brides fall dead on the altar, saying "I do". Their corpses are stolen by well-known horticulturist Dr. Lorenz (Lugosi) and a couple of his foolish minions, because his aging wife (Elizabeth Russell) needs injecting fluid from the young virgin glands to stay forever young ... forever beautiful. The desirable local cub reporter (Luana Walters) realizes that every lost bride carried the same rare orchid on the altar; orchid, where Dr. Lorenz would be most aware. A typical horror film rushes a bit of a spooky visit to the Lorenz manor; especially behind the dwarf and the sliding horse. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.
