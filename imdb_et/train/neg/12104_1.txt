Bill Maheri Religulous is not an attack on organized religion. This is an attack on Christianity and Islam. In addition to ridiculing rabbis who invented sophisticated machines to get around the breathing rules, he does not really attack Judaism and feels furious when the rabbi challenges the existence of the state of Israel. When Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to his logical conclusion, he understands that the creation of Israel in the Palestinian territories is based on the so-called sacred books of organized religion. This is evidence of his complete and complete objectivity or lack of focus in creating this film. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is really hard to believe that a man is an atheist or even all that intelligent. Anyone can go to a religious person and laugh and call them foolish for their beliefs, but what should you offer them to the contrary? He never really tells them why he thinks they are stupid. What makes him a "rational" person in the room? In a way, it reflects how it really is and the process is looking as stupid as these people. <br /> <br /> If you want to look at the real evil of a movie / documentary religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to human civilization, see Richard Dawkins '' The Roots of All Evil? '. It is a well-documented documentary that clearly describes what it expects to achieve and how. Bill Maher's religious is not funny, does not offer interesting questions, and gives no overview of such controversial topics. His rantings and attacks by the old man seem to be bad for his Catholic upbringing. I'm very sorry for him.
