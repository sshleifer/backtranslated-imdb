** Includes spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Truly exquisite Sean Young (who looks like Elizabeth Taylor with her hair on some scenes in her scenes) is striking at this opening. Sitting at the back of the police car, waiting for the busts to be sent, his face and body are tense and disturbed. Unfortunately, when the bust is over, Youngi's tense behavior never changes. It's one of the deadly suppressed actresses. <br /> <br /> The only young and best-looking young man playing Arnetia Walker is just to compare. Walker is always open, emotional and easy ... that there is no visible obstacle to what he can feel and his expression. He's an open book. Young people, on the other hand, act in a cunning, self-conscious way when you could expect your neighbor to act when they were suddenly thrown into the movie starring. Basically, he has no idea. <br /> <br /> With this big gap in the middle of the movie, we have been thinking about the insecurity of this story. For example, after Miss Young has been kidnapped by an offender who has caught her in a closed closet, she stops the door when she is alone. It is allowed that she is dressed only with bra and underpants, but in a similar situation, is the psycho captain obliged to return at any moment, do you drive to the door ... or take the time to go through your dressing room, take out clothes and dress? I think this and other scenes are trying to suggest a mixed emotion to Miss Young's character, but Young cannot pass on this type of complexity. <br /> <br /> There are some moments affecting the movie. , for example, short police interviews with the victims of past criminals, but in general it is a goal. It is too bad Miss Young was replaced by filming a couple of comic book films that could have used some humor (BATMAN and DICK TRACY). Looking at Miss Young's efforts to act, at least in this "thriller", is a sad spectacle.
