Channel surfing and catching this LOGO. It was one of those "I have to watch it because it is so terribly bad" moments, like a roadhouse without joy. Writing is cruel; totally naughty and actress is in the mouth bad. <br /> <br /> There is a small budget and then there is an abyss where this epic should be thrown and never seen. I mean, the main characters are going to the skiing uphill in a rented house, and the house is very common, which is not a big deal, but they decide to show all the cleanings that poured on it as it was in the Sistine Chapel. I'm sorry, but looking at 6 men who looked every 10'x10 in a boring room with a futon, and exhausting is flat. I think they did not learn to break the bad bears of training (see the hotel room control scene) ... wow toilet! yaayyyyy !!!! I don't buy it all over, so something goes routinely. If it smells ... and it looks ... well, you know the rest. <br /> <br /> Avoid like a plague. <br /> <br /> Edit: Probably the other closest thinkers believe that since I didn't like this movie, I'm an "obvious hate", which I can only assume I'm phobic, which of course is not true. I decided to do this crazy, mad thing and evaluate the movie based on the actual content of the movie, not through its mere presence (ie refreshing to see ...) <br /> <br /> Of course, it can be refreshing to see, but it doesn't equal to a great movie, but give them some better material to work and tighten. In fact, I commend the efforts. To be honest, I'd rather listen to my kitchen catalog than watch it again.
