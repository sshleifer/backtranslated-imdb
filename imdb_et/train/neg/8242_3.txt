After just looking at the seven eyes, I have to be honest ... I just didn't like it. I've read so many good reviews about this movie, but I just didn't get where these reviews came from, <br /> <br /> I have a lot of time to make newcomers to movies and I'm sure the directors are doing well, but the main problem was their budget, the whole movie used two cameras (which was ok) but they really looked like cheap cameras. The second problem was the sound, you sent all these girls to shout and yelled all at the same time, everyone is talking about each other - it's just impossible to hear what they're talking about. <br /> <br /> It was a good idea, in short, they hit a parked car, then drive out, shortly later they get the car they hit, the mad woman who wants to kill them and who has many options Do it! ... and on the other hand, girls have many ways to escape, but don't! <br /> <br /> Very frustrating ... I just finished it!
