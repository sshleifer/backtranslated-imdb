I was obliged to watch the film for my work, so I didn't pay for it (on the contrary, I paid for it), but I still found the movie more than average to suck. The jokes were sheep, two leading actresses ... well to use the "First Wives Club" division of Hollywood, they are no longer in their "hot chick" age, but more in their "regional lawyer" age. What most angered me about the film was the main plot plot that was pretty much plagiarized by Beavis & Butthead Do America (where the boys have all been walking for some guys, offering them money to "do their wife", do not understand they are expected to kill him). All in all, it's a boring piece.
