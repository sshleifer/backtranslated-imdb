Really terrible movie. However, this is to be expected. It is clear that with a low budget: something else that is innovative, an actor (if you can call what he's "doing"), who always has nudity in the shower room, a reptilian man who is almost after a predator, some kind of a cabin. forests, etc. However, there are some redemption points. Although the story is not new, there are usually some parts that are not so regurgitated. First, the black man does not die when he attacks (for the first time) and he is not even one of the first few to die. But it's small. More importantly, Kat's experiments have a very interesting twist and Wes & Steve that I didn't see. When Steve told Kat, he knew what he was doing, believing what he said and what Kat was saying. But when the creature appeared, who he really was, I was pleasantly surprised by the novelty of revelation. This may be because I have no experience with the genre, or that it is really smart. <br /> <br /> In both cases, the movie is pretty bad and don't look at something better ... If you don't recognize a cheap sci-fi flick.
