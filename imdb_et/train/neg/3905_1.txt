Forget Plan 9, this is the ultimate fiasco, a costume drama that has been misguided, written, acted, etc. This film is based on Isabel Allende's not-so-far-right novel. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish films) and other actors, including Winona, my favorite actor and Jeremy Irons, are trying hard to overcome this terrible script. Lots of bugs (for example, when did it snow Xise in Chile?) And very cruel, along with this evil tone called "magical realism", this is the worst film of all time. It sucks !!!
