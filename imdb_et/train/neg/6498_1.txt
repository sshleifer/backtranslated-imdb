I've seen bad movies before, but it takes the "Longest Life Movie" Award! Anthony Hopkins must be mentally ill so that his name is added to it - everywhere! I never see any other movie with him, directing it etc etc! I can't believe other actors and actors I liked (in this picture) that were so low to be part of this disaster! There must be great drugs! That no one is part of such a movie, it's not me! Save your money for it! GREAT FLOP from start to finish! Shame on you Hopkins! Also Shame Christian Slater! I can't believe you put your reputation on this line!
