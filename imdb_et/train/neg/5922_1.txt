My mother keeps the cassette of this movie as a general threat to every movie loving person who is irritating her. All this stinks. <br /> <br /> It's a real classic. <br /> <br /> Who gave this 10/10? Have you inadvertently watched a good movie and voted inadvertently for it? <br /> <br /> Every filmmaker should be forced to watch at least a small portion of this movie. It should be an indelible stain for anyone who keeps the movie holy and is respected kinematically terribly.
