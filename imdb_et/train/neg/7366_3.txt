What did I look at F * @ #? Steven STOP !! Please! This movie is badly bad and stupid. Strangely leaving action and adventure, Mr Seagal (apparently) favors - they were vampires "like" creatures with super human power. OKAY? Oh, and their eyes flash foully? Wow! Even in this movie, to abandon Seagals, the last-and-no-one-can-kick-my-$ $ ego is somehow stronger than they are. But all the average people are going to crush him. Come on, I understand the mouth of the next bullying or drug dealer, but they are the ultimate people. Oh and get it, Seagal briefly goes through identity problems, because he and his cohorts in the film probably think he is Wolverine! Oh My GO ... And worst than it all! Yes, it is worse than that. He even has a voice in the middle of changing his voice when we look at his face. Obviously, they do not sound good to him and I believe that it may be one of the other participants in the film. It was pure madness. Although I wanted to turn it off, I always look at the end of the movie. It's always low even for your direct movies, Steven. Awful! Awful! Awful! Two thumbs down! Redemeption Features? I think so, I am fair about that. At least some special effects were OK and I like the wardrobe of actors and actors. All women were quite attractive to the IMO. Still, and I told STILL, it doesn't make up for the blatant X-Men, Underworld, (enter your favorite zombie, vampire here)! Director, writer, producer, ALL should be in the film industry and be exiled. I think I feel that most people know about blood circulation (and almost all other Uwe Boll pictures). That's my whole $ 1.00. See if you dare.
