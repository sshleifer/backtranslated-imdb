I'm starting to melt, so I'm getting this review as short and sweet as possible. <br /> <br /> It is an astronaut and he rises on a spacecraft with two other men, you know? If something happens to reveal him, and then when they come back, don't forget what happened to the other men, but our astronaut has started to melt! No, not just burn, but BLACK! Like an ice cream cone in July! Well OK maybe it's not that fast, but you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he gets all the reds and fools, and the fact that he melts makes him really crazy. I think he also checked the "melting-down" handbook because he suddenly knows that to avoid being completely melted, he must eat human flesh so that he starts hanging on people. <br /> <br /> Other characters, but in the movie where the man melts and melts and melts (and melts), do you really need others? What matters is that WHO will speak next, and WHAT will remain? How long does it just take to melt something? Why was this film first made? Where did they get the money? When do you sleep while watching it? <br /> <br /> I am very melted, but I still have plenty of time to say that this movie is terribly boring, even though the idea is really cool and kind of gross. Makeup is clean, but everything else is ... SPLAT
