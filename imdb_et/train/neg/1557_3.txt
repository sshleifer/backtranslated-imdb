The film is basically boring and frightening clich√©s that do not provide a true intercultural overview. The Middle East journey is described as particularly irritating: obviously mud is a village in the brick village, dirt trails in the middle of deserts, black gowns and belly dances. I don't know how camels and date palm were missing from the whole picture. The personality of the two main characters is very carefully sketched and many situations are hardly reliable. <br /> <br /> The original idea could have been interesting, but at the end of the day, if you are looking for a cultural understanding, you should skip this movie.
