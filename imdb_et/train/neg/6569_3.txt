Max had a V-8, Trace (the last and only heroes) on the back of his car has a jet engine that allows him to inadvertently make humorous faces when he holds the half-destroyed wasteland. Be surprised that Mad Max 2 (aka Road Warrior) has been cut and stapled together as a new movie, although it's filmed in bad ways with bad actors and an evil stunt. <br /> <br /> Why is WoF set to post-apocalyptic wasteland? Simple, Road Warrior was! In fact, all the questions can be answered: it was in Road Warrior! Except for the mutant actors of the original 60's timed The Time Machine films, they do some non-transport activities for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> In the usual 80s, all cars driven by bad guys who have been ripped or lightly struck are exploding with a huge explosion. Inevitably, car rides to a comfortable cliff and cars will inevitably fall off. Along with this 80's cinematic natural rides, the overall rampant misogyny in this cheap movie. In general, I was expecting a Trace rocket motor to accelerate and shoot, so that there would be another shot where he would hit his face, as if he were tough, more than constipation. Bad choreography with bad behavior makes this movie a real sink. The value of involuntary humor is even thin. <br /> <br /> Rats: Bruno Mattei is a better night for terrorists. And that in itself says a lot! According to this census, Texas Gladiators are a masterpiece of cinematic art compared to Wheels of Fire. The Bad Road Warrior bursts, which is not close enough to the cheese factor to make the film film-making. <br /> <br />
