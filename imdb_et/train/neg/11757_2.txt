Hey Arnold! is a slow pace and a bit boring film. The plot is not very creative. Paul Sorvino's character (Shenk) buys all the bad, low-cost buildings to build a giant shopping center, shopping centers and office buildings. This plot dates back to many 1960s children's movies. It's boring. Paul Sorvino is also not very exciting, so his bad guy is not very scary. Gramps remembers something from a historical document, and the rest of the film is about 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal have to find a document with Helga's secret aid, whose father hopes to get Shenk's Mall rich. Children must move around the city on buses and so exciting bus connection is not only silly, but emphasizes that this film is written for very young children. Hey Arnold, the TV comic is usually a lot of fun and has enough humor to turn to adults. A TV comic is usually faster and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold movie, is about five times more calmed and a good way to put someone, including sleep modes. Hey Arnold was tough to stay awake all the time before the predictable and completely boring end. If you want to send your children to a completely offensive movie, that's the case. I feel that instead of making a 90-minute movie, the producers started a 30-minute television card and tried to expand it within 90 minutes. This Mall Story would certainly have been covered on television. Hopefully, Arnold will make a better writer if there is a sequel.
