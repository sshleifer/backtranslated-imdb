There seems to be little land on the Rhine River. One of them likes it very much, praises his sincerity, his liberal perspective and his subtle action, otherwise he knows its obvious propaganda, mediocre dialogue, cartoon marks and general tendency. I am in the very last category and found a movie and play, - in connection with European refugee activities in Washington during the war - a core of destruction that was worthy of acting as an actor, and even only during breaks. This author, Lillian Hellman, was irrelevant to the angels. His plays were written for people who shared their views, and he rarely looked at the ideas that the author and the audience had not before, except to note how terrible the "other side" was. Even if I find myself in a hundred percent agreement with what he has to say - like the Rhine - I still can't say how he says it. His characters are unrealistic, and while his ear for dialogue shows a way people talk, he lacks real shine or originality. He had nothing to say. I totally agree with the late demolition of Mary McCarthy Hellman's reputation a few years ago. For those who think the theater is dead or extreme and long for good old days, I invite you to look on the Rhine as bad as the angels, which only shows that the theater had one foot sixty years ago in the grave.
