Carrie Fisher has said more than once that she made this film during her life when she had a severe cocaine problem, and she doesn't remember that much. This would explain why he did this movie, but it doesn't explain why someone else cast or teamed; I can't believe ALL was a coke problem. It must be one of the absolute worst films ever made and that means something. The charge cannot be placed on the footsteps of "director" Tim Kincaid or "writer" Buddy Giovinazzo, because it is obvious that no one wrote or directed this picture. Obviously, it just came together spontaneously, because there is little evidence of unity, consistency, design, plot, thought, intelligence or anything else. It is really amazing that some real professionals took part in this glop. Colleague Robert Joy has done a good job in other films and composer Jimmie Haskell and Arthur Marks are both industry veterans, Marks has also been a director and not bad. Why they were involved in this steaming rump is incomprehensible. The alleged "director" Tim Kincaid has made quite a few rent and horror films, and having seen most of them, I can tell you that none of them are good. However, this is the worst thing he has ever done, and this is his great achievement. Everything, absolutely everything about this movie is the 12th price - the best. Cinematic art is terrible, acting ridiculously, "special effects" make "Plan 9 out of space" "Spider-Man", the story is subtle, derived and stupid. Don't waste your time despite the cover of the video box, let alone rent it. Complete, perfect, annoying, complete dud.
