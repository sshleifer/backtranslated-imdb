Devin Hamilton is probably better known as the new name in legendary Full Moon entertainment. Unfortunately, his arrival at an independent studio occurred at a time when budget and production values ​​were the lowest in the years. But during his short career, Hamilton is a creative leader who can make inventive and original. Now, this does not mean that his films are good, but at least they differ from the usual genre of fear. <br /> <br /> Hamilton delivers a sloher sub genre in his debut "Bleed". Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a young woman who finally gets her dream job. Not only that, but it seems that he has also found a boyfriend (Danny Wolske) in Shaun, and finally it seems that Maddy is smiling after many sad events. Until the party with Shaun's friends, they tell him they created a "club" where members have to kill someone to enter. actually murder someone. After this event, someone else will kill the rest of the club. Maddy needs to understand what's going on because someone could be a killer, including her. <br /> <br /> Maddy is a very interesting character played by beautifully beautiful Debbie Rochon. It is very interesting for the genre to twist that the leading actor is part of the suspects. The concept is so original and Rochon's performance is so good that it is really a shame that Hamilton didn't develop the whole story a little better. The film seems to be quite slow from time to time and the general feeling is a good idea that is wasted on bad film. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strange in the sense that all women are very good when the male pain hurts bad. Danny Wolske is terribly woody and his performance in the yuppie is quite stereotypical. Julie Strain, Brinke Stevens & Lloyd Kaufman appear in small fucks and are great in small roles. There is also a lot of nudity (both male and female) and most are very good looking, so it's really a plus. <br /> <br /> A low budget hurt in the movie effect department, as there are very few gory scenes and they are not really graphic (probably because they look bad); nevertheless, watching the budget, the film looks at least good. <br /> <br /> Hamilton's Recent Efforts, Delta Delta Die! is a better designed and more general fun movie. Although it is not as bad as other well-known movies, it still has a lot of mistakes, and it can only be interesting for Debbie Rochon fans or fans of independent budget movies. 4/10
