I love the 80s slip and I remember when "Silent Night / Deadly Night" was pulled out of our theaters, I was very disappointed, so I was very excited to see some of them in Fear.net. You're better off watching what I've been waiting for for such movies. According to today's standards, the quality of special effects was ridiculous, character formation is too long, but everything was ridiculous funny! <br /> <br /> Scenes where he loses it because Santa, his father, feels like a mother and later, when a mob is actually shown for lighting burners - not flashlights, as in the 80s, but real flashlights! - Really knocked my funny bone. But the scenes in which he controlled the children of his neighbors gave me a frenzy of a different nature. I also liked trying to find out who the characters were. It took me some time to find out that the main character was a pleasant teddy bear for the brothers.
