From reading all the comments posted here on IMDb, it seems that this movie has been much corrupted, but I didn't think it was bad. I've actually seen much worse. "The house where the evil lives" is a ghost story about his wife Ted and Laura Fletcher and their daughter, Amyst, who are moving in an old house in Japan. They know little, the Japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and lover and killed himself with a samurai sword 100 years ago. In a house with strange things, it happens that the ghosts of the earlier inhabitants are going to have living beings and intend to re-establish the bloody murder that took place 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie and decided to give it a chance, this cover seemed like a decent ghost story. It was routine and it was horrible, but I've seen my day worse. The ghost sequences were a little over-done, we see that translucent blue tones come randomly around the family and take over their bodies. Frankly, the ghosts of this film type reminded me of the Haunted Mansion ghosts in Disneyland. Maybe I was wrong, but after watching it, it seemed to me that the Japanese horror film "Ju-On: The Grudge" and the American remake of this movie hung a little. An old Japanese home with a brutal murder, ghostly action, passion for home, etc. But I may be wrong. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is a pretty dirty ghost story. Don't go out of your way to see it, but if you like this thing and it happens to come on TV, you can do it. 4/10.
