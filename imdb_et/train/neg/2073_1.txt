Oh my God. oh my god, i can't get this movie over. It was pious. terrible, terrible! Don't even waste your money to buy 99 cents in the trash. No, hold it at any cost what I warn you !!! <br /> <br /> This was the worst film I've ever seen. In my life. In my life !! <br /> <br /> First of all, G-girl? Are you kidding. Get real that sounds like a new Barbie doll. Are you kidding. It was so fake fake fake. The townspeople did not even seem to care that the flying blonde just zoomed around the city, saving fire .. Ohh big! <br /> <br /> Jesus, was it just me or did this film seem offensive? I think you have to be a super hero couple of double Ds, blonde flowing hair, glasses and leather skin in tight suit?! <br /> <br /> When he was trying to be romantic ... if .. God, I don't know. It was terrible when love meant that he would take one for an art exhibition and when having sex in bed AND in the air ... when they loved it! <br /> <br /> It was pathetic, everything went too fast. First of all, this boy was alone when he was acquainted with a G-girl. When they broke up when he thought Hannah was a girl .. and .. it just goes. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this movie made me wonder ... How the hell did they get in the theaters? !! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
