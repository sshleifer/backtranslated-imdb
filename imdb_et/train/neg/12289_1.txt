I'm sick of movies that in a single-line synopsis entertainment sound finally equals what you find in the bottom center of the compost pile. <br /> <br /> Who knows: "Witchcraft" Maybe interesting in the studios, even if the "big name is cast" (like Blair and Hasselhoff - the eye blows, nudge-nudge) and the effervescent likes Hildegard Knef (I don't can, woman ...). <br /> <br /> But the film breaks down faster than the papier-mache sculpture in the rain. It seems that these unfortunate people are trapped in a manor house on the southern seaside island, and one of them (a woman, I think) is directed by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while others are grotesque, embarrassing. Okay, there's a cross-section of "The Exorcist", "The Omen", "Ten Little Indians", and some other lesser-witted films of satanic worshipers. Amok line. None of them are very fun and to a large extent you will start to get to the scene until it is over. No, not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff can help much. They are just about to pay a fee and don't seem very willing to give them "everything". <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hasselhoff wants to want him back with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda ... well who knows; Celebrity PETA benefits or pro-am golf tour or whatever it is he has nowadays. <br /> <br /> And Torture Scenes! Ecchhhh. You can see that people get their mouth shut, hanging fireplaces inside, hanging on trees with a violent storm, boats that break out of their neck, and so on. Sheesh, and I thought the "fucking character" was the most sadistic film I saw .... <br /> <br /> Don't bother. It's not worth your time. I can't believe I told you as much as I did. When you look at it, see if you can count on clich√©s. And yes, Blair gets in hand as if you don't see the main street coming down, followed by the march band. <br /> <br /> No stars. "Witchcraft" - these sorcerers give you itching.
