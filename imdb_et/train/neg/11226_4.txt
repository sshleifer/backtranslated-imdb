I'm stabbing on DARK ANGEL. The film seems to be a "loving" tribute to the greatest little one to ever live - but there is so little real "content" that the film itself is practically useless. I can't really see the motivation or the point of this movie - because there are very few biographical data in the narrative - so those who don't know much about Bettie no longer know DARK. ANGEL either ... <br /> <br /> The film basically crowns Bettie's career modeling career in recent years. Almost the entire film consists of "reactivating" some of Bettie's "most famous" photographic breeds and loops. These reintroductions literally take 75% of the time of movies and provide virtually no information about Bettie as a human. The film briefly touches on its short-term legal action and its subsequent decision to leave "business" and become religious - but all this is pretty much a glimpse of showing long and drawn-down scenes ... <br /> <br /> DARK ANGEL is not terrible movie - it's not just a substance. Another problem is that the actress who plays Bettie really resembles the frames - it's closed. The other thing that irritates me is that although Bettie made several topless modeling forms - the only nudity in the movie was the short segment that was made in the zoo at the time of the final credit. The film itself is obviously at a very low budget, but it does what it can set and delimit within costumes - so I can't get there. The actors are real wood and all involved. In fact - the most memorable thing about the whole movie for me was during the final credit that the actress playing Irving Klaw's real name was Dukey Flyswatter. No joke - check the cast list. Can't say I recommend it too high if you are not a true Bettiefile graduate and you have something related to her. And if you're so bad, you still have to look for treatment ... 4/10
