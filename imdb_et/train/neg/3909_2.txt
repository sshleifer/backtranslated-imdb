When I found that there was a movie with both my favorite actors Meryl Streep and Wynona Ryder, I went through the roof, but I had a heavy decline after watching the flat movie and I still have the impression. Jeremy Irons (an actor whom I even wonder after this disappointment) was just terrible. He treated his family like a mess, especially his sister, played by Glenn Close. I didn't get any characters near or sympathy and I didn't get a bride, but the sexual scenes were really unnecessary or could have been tinted. The characters from Wynona and Antonio could have developed much more and their romance could have been a lot of passion. And what was Meryl's character and his "mystical powers"? Why didn't they go any further? This film had a lot of deadlock and the bottom line was that it was a really sad film and there was a lot of wasted talent.
