Mario Lewis of the Institute for Competitive Entrepreneurship has written a final 120-page point-to-line extract of this mendacious film, which should be titled CONVENIENT LIE. You can find the address of the website where your report, entitled "SCEPTING TO COMPLIANCE RIGHTS", can be found at: www.cei.org. A shorter 10-page version is available at: www.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf Once you have read these scraps, you understand that the alleged "global warming" is neither real nor more dangerous than the Y2K intimidation of 1999, which Gore he also accepted, as he did the pseudo-science "DAY DAY TOMORROW", based on a book written by the alleged UFO kidnapped by Whitley Strieber. Like James "The Amazing" Randi makes for Psychology and Philip Klass for UFOs, and Gerald Posner makes JFK for conspiracy-idiotic theories, Mario Lewis makes Al Gore's film and the whole "global warming" scam.
