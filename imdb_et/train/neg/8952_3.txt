After hearing George Orwell's prophetic masterpiece of my whole life, I am now 37 years old but never read a book, I'm completely confused about what I just saw. <br /> <br /> I am very familiar with the concepts in the novel, as I am most sure, but only through rumors and quotes. Without this limited knowledge, this film would have been a complete mystery, and even with this, I am not yet in 1984. More about the story about education than before. <br /> <br /> On the plus side. .. <br /> <br /> Cinematic art is amazing, Hurt & Burton offers fine performances and the overall feeling of the film is wonderfully grim and devastating. The scene of the prostitutes was fantastically dark cinema. <br /> <br /> Now down and there is a lot ... <br /> <br /> There is war, (at least for propaganda), but why and with whom? Nothing is explained. There are a few names (Eurasia, etc.), but they don't mean anything without explanation. <br /> <br /> Who is Winston? what is he doing? where does he come from? where does he work? why does he change the news? why is he not on the front line? Why didn't he eat food? What does this drink drink through the film? Why is he so weak and ill? Why didn't he rinse like the rest? What is her mother and sister? What happened to his father? A small backlash would have been nice, not a scratch, which is important as I did not read the book. Without it, it is just confusing and difficult to follow an artistic film that keeps you constantly out of what's really going on. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was disconnected and poorly edited and continuous conversation Big Brother screens favor dialogue in places that make it even more difficult. I agree that this may be an artistic choice, but it is very disturbing. <br /> <br /> I also know it's been mentioned before, but why all nudity? It just seemed completely free and seemed to be thrown there to make up for any plot coverage. <br /> <br /> Personally, I can't keep up with how Hollywood feels it has to explain the story line for these days. We are not all temporarily cleaned simpletons, but it is a step too far to the other. I can only imagine that it is entirely based on reading the book, because if this film is really "literally" what I have seen by many people, it would be very difficult for me to understand why in 1984. like the classic it is. <br /> <br /> There is no denying that it was a light year before that time and has pretty much predicted the changes that our society has made so far (maybe it has been some biblical powers that are?), but many sci-fi the novels have done the same, leaving the band's holes in between. <br /> <br /> I think I have to do what I had to do from the beginning and buy a copy of the book if I wanted to think about it. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'm very disappointed with something I've been waiting for for years.
