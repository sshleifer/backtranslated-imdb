WOW! Why should somebody make a stage for a already hanging movie? Half Past Dead was a bad film, but at least there was an idea of ​​what he wanted to be. HPD2 has no idea what it wants to be. It just appears on the screen for reasons I can't explain. Spoiler: The whole movie is like this: Twitch (played by Kurtsi Tha Dogg Pound) goes to another prison where there may be a box filled with gold brick. In a prison, a rivalry between competing prisoners breaks down, one of which gets off when a guy named Cortez and Cortez plan to escape. During the marriage, the daughter of Cortez Twitch's groom and Burke (played by Bill Goldberg) is abducted and kept in the execution room. Burke reluctantly interacts with Twitch and eventually gets to idiotic detainees when they find Cortez is close. <br /> <br /> Opinion: This is the most necessary sequel from Universal Soldier: The Return. The script is terrible, the actor is terrible, the dialogue is a joke and everything in this movie is caricature. Look, I know it was a low-budget movie, but it's not an excuse that these guys won't do what they do. No one in this "movie" believes what they are playing. In this film, no one can be taken seriously as an actor. Kurup should be ashamed of himself. His "Twitch" character is pretty much a spineless minstrel doll that spends most of his time with Burke or other inmates. Bill Goldberg spends most of the time on the film as if he had to take the PHD (a pretty big dump). Fighting scenes are badly choreographic and pathetic, and HPD2 is pretty boring even when it comes! • Let someone tell you that this movie is somewhat decent, it smells and is the main reason people disdain Follywood.
