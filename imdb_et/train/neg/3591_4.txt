First of all, let me say that I am a big believer in Fanprost. I see it so that good display will continue long after it is canceled. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars revelations are examples of decent efforts. So I have a clean place for fan projects, which means I forget things that I would normally do poorly on slate. <br /> <br /> So in ST-HF. Well, first off the good things. Enthusiasm is a big part of what any exhibition is believed to be, and most of the crew seem to have a good time with their tasks. Next, the effects are not bad for brewing at home, but not something that really wins you. Stories are not too bad. Nothing particularly innovative, but strong enough stuff and at least there are running yards. <br /> <br /> But it has many mistakes. <br /> <br /> First of all, although they are obviously hanging on HAVE Star Trek footage, backgrounds, music, and effects, I see no reason why they went off almost all of the other sci-fi music spots made. Everything from aliens to Starship Troopers brings it to one or another point in the orchestra head. Similarly, a large part of the video is from other films that are conscientiously over CGI to make it different. Gray warships, such as the hidden ones, are quite obviously Star Wars stars. The station is also quite probably the Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga Starship Troopers. Similarly, the sound effects of various Star Wars films appear in combat battles between fighters, as well as animation as film footage. From one scene, either in the first or the second season, I think you will even see two TIE winners during the battle in the past, barely able to stop your beliefs. hardly a painful look. Everyone is getting better with the seasons, but it is expected that the screen will get much worse, especially in early seasons. They have also made some interesting options for action. Let's just say that the food replicators in this show seem to be a "cake" and leave it there. <br /> <br /> Make-up effects are generally quite effective. But they should really ruthlessly kill the person who decided to use cheap Fereng and Cardassia masks for non-background or "passage" purposes. They are simply unreal. Every time I saw one of them (besides not laughing too much), I was expecting this unhappy soul to carry the gun out and say "It's sticky!" In one scene, "Cardassian" actually speaks of one of them. Not only lips do not move, but the mask does not even have a hole where the mouth should be. Nobody needs it for that. Couldn't they accept it by hand, for goodness! There are also some well-made but inadvertently funny make-up jobs like Herman Munster look like. <br /> <br /> Writing, though coherent, is nothing new. Instead, the script works like a DS9 continuation, with vessels moving from DS12 to different missions. The new enemy "The Gray" is not very intimidating and the line that covers them is the reprocessing of Borgi threads. that is, Starfleet meets Gray, Gray is enormously powerful, Starfleet barely escapes with his life, they are beginning to find ways to fight enemy etc with technology. All before Borg. <br /> <br /> The second bone of the dispute is dialogue. Star Trek writers have long been able to write the script "insert technobabble here". Usually this means the last plan to fight the enemy using "quantum phase discriminators" or "isolation fees", etc. In other words, the crap that tells you that they are in the case and the resolution is at hand. <Br>> <br /> Words are really dirty. I have no problem with this, but if ST: HF is confused about it, then where these concepts include real comments. <br /> <br /> Tactical tips like "We have to group" sounds good, but not when it is already spoken by group characters. Similarly, when asked what the situation is, a tactical officer will be heard to answer "We read three battleships". He really had to count them? C'mon! I was waiting for the questioner to ask him "Are you sure?" or "Do you double check". But my all time favorite comment is: <br /> <br /> Captain: "Can we create two-way communication?" <br /> <br /> Comms Officer: "No, we can only send and receive." <br /> <br /> Well, duh! ..... <br /> <br /> In the above, the play improves when it goes. The 1st and 2nd seasons are pretty bad, 3 shows improvement, but 4 and 5 are where it gets better. Season 6 so far seems quite reasonable. <br /> <br /> I have problems with the choice of media for exhibitions. Quicktime sucks, frankly, and the faster they move in divx / avi format, the better. Some of us want to actually see our downloaded shows and view them on a decent screen, not a small QT window on a computer monitor. Quicktime does not only make it difficult, but the 320x180 resolution it shows is not at all good. In fact, these exhibitions are pretty much written as they were a copy of the 10th generation VHS tape. At least they could make a hi-res downloadable version. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the show has a promise and I've even started to like some characters. But it's 40 episodes, so I'm not sure it says much about character development at all. <br /> <br /> But what you can say is free .... <br /> <br /> PS: 19 out of 28 people rated this show 9 or 10. Hmmmm ... are we look at the same show? Or are you 19 years old all three years old?
