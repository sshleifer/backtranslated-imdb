The endless madness of smart visual irons may not necessarily create an interesting movie. The "Blonde Wig" side of the movie never went out because its makers were too much self-conscious. <br /> <br /> Wong Faye Party (featuring very playful when Karen Carpenter is looking for, Faye Wong) has much more complaints. All the ingredients are there, but the girl-meeting-boyfriend element takes the back of the artistic wisdom. Character development is uneven. Emotion is missing. <br /> <br /> For music lovers, Chongking Express effectively uses Wong Faye's "Mung Jung Yun" (Cranberry's Cranberry smash hit "Dreams"). Faye Wong also recorded a version of the mandarin language called "Zhen Im". Both are on the CD, although the official movie music CD has only "Mung Jung Yun".
