The fact that this film made it into the rental route to Norway is odd. This movie is just terrible. This picture quality is just one bit better than the mobile phone and the plot is so bad. The main character is just annoying and the rest just suck. Anyone involved in this film should be ashamed. The fact that the people who made this movie made their name extraordinary. And distributors; They even saw it!? This is probably the worst film I've ever seen. To mark it, comedy is an insult to humanity. I urge you not to support, buy or rent this movie.
