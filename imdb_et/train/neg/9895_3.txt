If this book was true, we can only assume that the author was aware of history. Mark Anthony never died as a result of injuries in the battle. He died of suicide by suicide and even then he asked his slave to do it for him. The Ori decided to kill instead. The real story was shameful about Mark Anthony's slave size and decided to copy him. But even in the event of death, Mark Anthony was drunk and failed his attempted suicide. He cried to Cleopatra and was taken to him for bleeding. He pulled his bedding on the ropes and Mark Anthony died later. If you want history to not watch this movie. If you want a romantic ring, you will probably enjoy it!
