This movie must be the worst I've ever seen. The title of the movie deceives the public to think it might be hoping. The story of the film is at best ridiculous, so the actors will be so poor if you just have to. The title "Zombie Nation" means zombies in a total of six. It cannot be categorized as a horror film resulting from the introduction of the 80's music when the zombies attack. Zombies speak and act in a movie like human beings, the only difference being what makes La Roux out of the video. If you have the opportunity to buy this movie, do it, then burn a copy.
