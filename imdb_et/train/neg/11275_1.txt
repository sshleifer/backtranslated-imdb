This is a really exhausting "LOCK STOCK" clone with stars and a terrible script. I have no idea why so many British best players signed up for this junk, they have to be bribed. Failure to respond to the story continues forever and forever, and if I hadn't paid for it, I would have turned it off after 10 minutes. The worst film scene ever seen, this glory goes to a truly pathetic movie "(I use the term loosely)" GUMMO "(I feel like complaining that the so-called" leader "lost hours and half of my life), but this trash can Definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen, such things remind Hollywood that they don't have a monopoly of really terrible movies.
