Recently, I watched this movie at the 30th Gothenburg Film Festival, and frankly it was the worst movies I ever failed to watch. Don't make me wrong, have funny and fun bad movies (like "Manose's Hands Fate") and then the terrible bad movies. (It belongs to the last category). Cinematic art was incredible and not good. It seems that the operator deliberately kept all the attention (except for the free nipple stroke), the illumination was something "between a boy running with a light bulb" and "not being". The actors were as bad as the soap players, but not as bad as the porn partners, and gave the impression that each line came as a surprise to them. The only redemption function was the disguised appearance of the killer, the classic look of La Jason Vorhees "Friday 13'Th". The plot was extremely poor and even worse. I would only recommend this movie to someone who needs examples of how horror film shouldn't look like or maybe insomnia.
