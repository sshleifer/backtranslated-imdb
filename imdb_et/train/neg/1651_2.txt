A poorly written script that does not contain pleasant characters. What is comedy, I forgot to laugh. This is about 2 deliberate friends who cheat on women too much in bed (no sex scenes) and another friend (who is semi-strange) who sometimes have scams, but it is considered to be mainly a man who crafts. 3 friends meet and fall for the same woman (Amanda Peet). Somehow this is done without any romance. Three men finish their friends when they dated it separately. She scammed them with her friendship because they scammed women. - Bad movie
