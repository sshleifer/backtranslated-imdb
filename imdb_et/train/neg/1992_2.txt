Don't let the name of this movie deceive you, in fact, Jake Speed's character is probably the most common hero. When Jake Speed ​​doesn't save her girls from evil crazy things she's not, she's really relaxing. Maybe it adds to his charm, but in my opinion, the silver player is not cunning when he gets the chance. Moreover, unlike other courageous heroes who usually have an impressive list of talents, this person has nothing to call, of course, for talents. Anyway, this movie is basically worthless, writing is a sub-parameter, and the action, if any, is very flat. (Jeep machine guns were not bad, but that's it). If you are in the mood to watch a movie that is treating insomnia, this piece is perfect for you - it has a hero who not only lets you sleep, but also your audience.
