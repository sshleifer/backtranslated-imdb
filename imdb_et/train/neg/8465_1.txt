I can't believe how terrible this movie was. I feel extremely even referring to it as a "movie". The action was flat, editing was terrible and the plot left many important questions unanswered. The premise was OK when unoriginal: a small group of aliens live in the US and are slowly trying to take over humanity. But it goes down there quickly. How could they convince a "person" to persuade an alien to be his spouse to make them an alien hybrid they need? They show a lousy alien, but never show what he does. They have a plastic surgeon who can produce the perfect look at an industrial level. They throw a huge huge alien into the monster with teeth. The end was almost too painful to watch. I think I'm mostly disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner has something to do with it. How can he say to a big alien monster with teeth: "Remove him from the b * tchi ​​son who has a straight face?" It's a long fall from your Babylon for 5 days. Avoid it at all costs.
