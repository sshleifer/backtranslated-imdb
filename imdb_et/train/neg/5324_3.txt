Vovochka is your daily hooligan vs power movie. Vovochka, the main character, is a brand with early bad effects on neighboring children. With the words of the wisdom of some adult man, he finds his way, he finds that he is changing his terrible ways, but it is worth it. Personally, I found an actor who played Vovochka too annoying to express his sympathy, but changing the tone of the film would make it most felt that the emotional struggle Vovochka is when he wants to be good, but bad things are still happening. This struggle makes the film a bit different from other movies in the same genre, a little taste I thought. All in all, I wasn't interested in this movie, although it was most likely targeted at a younger audience.
