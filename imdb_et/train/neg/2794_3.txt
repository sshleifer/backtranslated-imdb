Well, because I'm a musician, I thought I'd look at this movie from TMC, something good. One of the worst mistakes in my life and it's only half. I seriously thought it was one of those soft-core films with a buggy plot and nervous action, crappy filming and crappy effects. But fast, I don't even enjoy it. Even "musicians" were not very good. I was hoping some might laugh, but I wasn't sure if they were trying to liner or not. But now I have to sit here and watch the rest until Pulp Fiction begins. Or maybe something better. And now I can sit here until I have 10 lines
