Why should a person return to a person who strikes them in their teeth, not once, not twice, again and again. <br /> <br /> This film teaches us that we need to accept abuse to find love (not only to forgive, but to fully agree). Gosh! No wonder my first relationship lasted only ten years. Of course I was not my inner masochist. <br /> <br /> Like Bucatinsky's debut, this film has many wonderful aspects; However, more character development would have been useful to justify the reunification of Eli and Tom. We are never familiar with Eli's Masochism, in fact, we believe he is not a masochist, although Tom's psycho-emotional sadism is very obvious.
