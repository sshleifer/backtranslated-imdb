This movie is just bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Now that I got it, I feel better. This movie is bad from start to finish. The story is flat. The 3-D segment is really bad. Freddy is the worst in his comic. God thanked them for killing him. And who wants to see the fire of Roseanne and Tom Arnold? <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is the little backstory we've given Freddy. We see that he once had a family, and we see his abusive, Alice Cooper. <br /> <br /> Moreover, everything is bad. Here are some high quality participants (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto) and they do their best, but the end result is just so bad. An hour and a half, when I watched this movie, it was an hour and a half hours I could never get back.
