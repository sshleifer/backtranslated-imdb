Despite a few moments of rainfall, a meeting in a drunken and organ mill with gypsies and monkeys, and staying in a sanatorium, this Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle's quiet comedy is short, supported by Buster Keaton and Al. John is amusingly interesting, although Buster has a rather funny Arbuckle queue, which is the ultimate "meet cute" scene, especially since it is one of the few times we see the face of the Big Stone smiling and laughing in the movies! It also seems that due to the overuse of the movie stock, editing of many scenes has changed. However, if you're an Arbuckle or Keaton graduate, Good Night, Nurse! definitely worth a look.
