Wonderfully, it's actually quite observable. This is bad. It's really bad. But while the original was so bad, it's bad for my life bad, it's so bad, it's easy to have fun. This is a rather weak praise. The production values ​​are widespread, the exemplary and the Romero-wannabe satire is not able to think about what ecology it is mocking. The internal logic takes the head in the back seat, which drives itself from the fridges, the incubation times of the virus change as the "plot" requirement, the balls that work against zombies or not, the zombies with or without speech. Gore is obviously a drawing, but the framework is so embarrassing that it is annoying. The dialogue sounds like it has been translated by the same computers that mangle the manuals, and the scope of zombie infestation is linked to none of the inventiveness of Romero films. All this is the result of amazing synthesis. Absolute garbage.
