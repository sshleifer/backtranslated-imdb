This agonizing comedy drama was surprisingly ridiculous in its 1979 release. I remember opening the LA Times movie section and watching a 2-page ad "Chapter 2" full of glowing headlines like "Better Than" Goodbye Girl! and "Neil Simon does it again!" What does Neil Simon do? She takes on an autobiographical situation (getting married too soon after her beloved husband dies) and makes it rusty, unpleasant, and worst - unsuccessful. James Caan plays Neil - ... that's George - a writer who can't live back after losing his wife; Enter into the Marsha Mason (real life Mrs. Simon ... soon ex-Ms. Simon) who is trying to love George despite her moods and general melancholy. Mason is very tempting here and maybe rescued the day if it was not Caan's indifference (not to mention the sub-section about the painfully thin, blonde Valerie Harper, which brings the procedure to the beat). I liked Mason's outburst at the end ("I'm wonderful! I'm NUTS about me!"), But I didn't see a happy ending for these two people ... and time proved me right. ** from ****
