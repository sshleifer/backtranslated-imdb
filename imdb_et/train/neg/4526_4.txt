Rather silly, trying to make a Hitchcock-type mystery thriller, unlikely to change the archeology of espionage and relying on Robin Cook's novel; by the way, I've recently acquired a second job adaptation - COMA (1978) - late in Richard Widmark's honor. For a record, director Schaffner had just made BOYS BRAZILI (1978) - like a fantastic but much more enticing protagonist and unfortunately SPHINX was the wrong step from which his so impressive career would not recover. <br /> <br /> Despite its scale and reasonably decent pain, it has nevertheless proved to be a critical and commercial flop - mainly because the narrative is not very exciting: in fact, it is rather terrible (horrible attempts with horror - the archaeologist hero who has bounce, rotten bodies, and even bats attack - despite that. Lesley Anne-Down is a lovely leading lady who stumbles upon a lost treasure - it is actually hidden by a local sect to prevent it from falling into the hands of aliens who have separated much of their country's heritage (under the pretext of culture) for too long. Sir John Gielgud grows thanks a bit early as an antique seller who puts the looting down and pays this "betrayal act" to his life. <br /> <br /> Typically, some characters are reversed by what they claim to be - so obvious allies (like Maurice Ronet) will eventually fall into the villains, but this is an obscure figure (Frank Langella whom I saw in London 2007 Early in the West End) Frost / Nixon, which has now become a movie, is going down the Down antagonist to his lover when he decides to keep the wealth of Egyptian high priest Menephta treasured.
