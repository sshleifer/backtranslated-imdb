Avent-garde is a creepy, extremely low budget film with greatness. It's hard to sit. I get the message that child abuse is wrong. Wow's a great revelation. I had no idea that it was wrong before viewing it. Yeah, that's sarcasm. DON'T look at this "movie" if you are offended by the gender nudity of both men and women. DO NOT look at it if you are the least bit terrible. DON'T look at it if you care about acting. The second time I thought you wouldn't look at this period. <br /> <br /> My Class: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Additions: Making a Movie, Premiere, Interview with Kristie Bowersock, Deleted Scenes, Movie Photos, Director's Commentary, 2 Teaser Trailer Version, The Azoic music video and classroom video experiment
