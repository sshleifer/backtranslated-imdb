Alejandro Amenabar's new version of Abre los Ojos, but this time with a lively, breathing mask. The dubious advantage of the English soundtrack is that we carry Tom Cruise's usual soul-feel to zero depth. Yes, the characters are identified with his person, but we are usually given some signs that keep our interests. His empty posting denies any erotic energy that might have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz. language means. The disguise of Cruise only painfully highlights his inadequacy as an actor.
