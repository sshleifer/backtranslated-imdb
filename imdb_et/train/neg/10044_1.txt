This is the biggest flop of 2008. I do not know what the director is thinking about creating such a major disaster. The songs have been added without situations, the story has been stretched to fill the 3-hour gap, and the most disgusting are the action stunts shown by the actors, like anyone with the superpowers that are between the balls, and nothing happens to them and one person. who fights with 100 people. Only the best results were given by Anil Kapoor, a man who is always at his best when playing a scraper with a comic act that tells Hinglish ... Akki has done a good job ... But the filmmaker just forgets about it.
