I went to this movie, hoping for the best. I like war music in general. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did a good job with their work; but the writers gave them a dull dialogue. There was no real growth in love between the two; just maybe it was there. I didn't think much about music; the best number was what we heard about Spike Jones with "Der Fuhrer's face". One complete number that Spike Jones had little of his great music comedy; pretty do things, even with a monkey. Bert Lahri's comedy sketches were interchangeable. <br /> <br /> There were parts to enjoy: Lucille Ball was quite an observer, and there was a good selection of little players who really deserved more time on the screen.
