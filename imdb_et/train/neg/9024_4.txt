"Shinobi" is one of those films that thinks that the mere execution of a character will automatically lead to a feeling or emotion. Unfortunately, for the audience to deal with people's death, you need to develop your characters, otherwise you will all have occasional acts of violence. The problem is particularly difficult if you have the TONe symbols each of which dies. <br /> <br /> OK, so if you can't bother to make characters memorable or sympathetic in any way, you will at least have reasons why they will die credible, right? No. Here's a war between two ninja clans, neither side really knows why they fight each other. They kill each other because the emperor says it. But even after it is obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead, they still refuse to give up their useless mission. It's not stubbornness ... it's just dark. <br /> <br /> Good, good! There is no character formation and the plot does not provide a reasonable basis for fighting. At least they are dying in cool action scenes, right? Once again, NO! In fact, many struggles aren't even fighting at all: super ninjas that the film spent so much time and effort to die suddenly to die (and in my opinion). I'm talking about things like "Lalala, I go along and I-* neck incline *". At the end of this character. Not even halfway through the movie, I threw my hands at frustration for this ridicule.
