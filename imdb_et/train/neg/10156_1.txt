It is written by S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character slipped his breasts. It was pretty tight. Before and after the movie is filming a lot. Action is like an E-list and is well shown in the movie. Not to mention the low budget that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie play with the same person. The whole movie looks like it's captured with the camera, not a half-decent movie. The only reason I liked the movie was that Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny. They said a lot of stupid things that made me laugh. Other than that, if you see this movie in Blockbuster, give everyone a preference to hide it behind Lawnmowerman. 2. Anyone who thinks this movie is good must be mentally evaluated.
