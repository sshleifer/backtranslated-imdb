** WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> If you get a very uncomfortable theme, this movie offers an amazingly combative melodrama. Surprisingly, this film has been multiplied and ripped many times over the years, although it is hard to understand ANY filmmaker inspired by this trash. Neither of these Hemingway women can work here (although Mariel has improved over the years), Anne Bancroft offers only a prosecutor's attorney in the classroom, and Chris Sarandon is in turn a pathetic and inadvertently fun as a ridiculous, fragrant bad man piece. <br /> <br /> Veteran Chief Lamont Johnson does not get a silk handbag script for this sister's ear that has been ruptured by badly bad dialogue and extreme situations. For example, the final queue where Margaux grabs his shotgun and pursues Sarandon after his last shocking act is exciting, but instead awakens joyful laughs. Add Michel Polnareff's infamous and gentle musical score and you have a real fault, even though you feel tired and hot after watching it. Don't say you're not warned.
