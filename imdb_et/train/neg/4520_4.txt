Irwin Allen was great. All of his TV shows had a big pilot or first episode. the rest were mainly hanging on their other exhibitions. Some of the Swiss family Robinson episodes were hanging on his older TV shows. One episode of the Swiss family is identical to the episode of the land of giants when a member of the party needs an additional operation. The exhibition was a big budget and too expensive to continue. Irwin lost in the 60s without touching TV shows. It works with Martin Milner. The stars of the child got there with an exhibition like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. one bright spot is when Irwin Allen adds a catastrophe like a typhoon and a volcanic eruption that copies him to a "disaster master"
