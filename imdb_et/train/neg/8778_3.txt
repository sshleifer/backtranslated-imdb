"White Noise" was potentially one of the films I thought of "Exor." Assuming that EVP is supposedly true, it was really easy to get into fear of being a real fact. Not many movies come that really frighten people's thoughts. As I said, this movie can be, but not. The film deteriorated to the scary film of the low-class PG-13. There is nothing compared to "Ring" or "Sixth Sense" in any way. No one really just needs to be responsible for the film industry and just makes a movie that not only helps us think, but makes us jump, shout, do anything the fear film should do. I'm sick of the PG-13 Horror genre because it becomes a genre. We need old days, blood and gore days, Freddy Kruger, Jason, Mike Myers day. Few movies can think about the state of mind that isn't so scary. So why try to pull it out? Some good jumps in this movie are nothing more than one of the stupid end of film history that has no resolution at all ... don't waste your money on this movie.
