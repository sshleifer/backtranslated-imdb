This film was extremely poorly prepared from all angles except the technological. I stood and looked at how everyone drove out of the theater, their faces like their lives, their eyes flung in front of their eyes - their eyes traveled to their neighbor, wondering if it was just them. I mean, how the movie could be really bad. No one admits it, this is the classic case of emperor wearing clothes. "Who am I to ask for a movie containing a man who stops a jet?" But the fact remains, every audience member thinks what I'm writing now. I really plagiarized my face. <br /> <br /> Lois has obviously only awakened power, he doesn't even get a cup of coffee with Superman With Glasses, which is not limited to jets. It cannot be a "look at" his eyes to the depth of his soul or something. In the old Superman he had no connection with him, he was obviously not a priority number 1, but he strengthened his character that he was "torn". I bet Henry Kissinger could have won this Lois even before Clark Kent. <br /> <br /> And now it's official, Kryptonite is doing Superman what McDonalds are eating. person. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN "ONE" He loses his country father, then finds his true father, the story fascinates every step of the way. He is a human, he touches people and loves people, he is involved with high school students, he is connected with people who feel different. He's tied. Superman Returns superman seems to be only related to superpowers, and it seems he just "works" when he rescues people. <br /> <br /> There is something about Clark that Lois likes, he really loves him inside, but he doesn't recognize it, and when he arrives in the picture as Superman, he throws rocks in love with rocks. Without Superman, he would have been in love with Clark (at least what the film shows, whether it was intention or not). Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and SUPERMAN, Clark is like a bunch of horses. Literally. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN TWO looked at it again. As a child, I thought I enjoyed the action, but now I know it was what was STORY, looking at it again and again. When I saw Superman returning as a child, I would have hated it. <br /> <br /> This movie has so much heart and soul and superpower, it's sick. Superman abandons his ability for love, because the world's plot is underway and meanwhile, LEANWHILE, Lex Luther got something fantastic in his sleeve. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN THREE There is a three-stage love story between Superman and Lana, and Clark, only humanity wins, and Clark's inner nature wins Superman power because when his SUPERMORAL nature is lost and he is SuperHUMAN (who does human things with his supremacy) ), he sees it not Superman's power that he's in love, it's not SUPERpowerman, but SUPERMORTALman he loves - and who's really SUPER. And when he says to Clark, "he prefers him to Superman," he is eluted, he has made a human connection again. He wants to be accepted by who he is, not just his ability to bend steel. This is the future of SUPERMAN'S REFUNDING. <br /> <br /> Clark super-sneezes to help the child get humanity again. In addition, it is a superb use of superpowers. He just doesn't use straight force. <br /> <br /> He crushes coal to his wife's diamond because he was supposed to sell his own, love is the only thing that makes him use his powers beyond saving. <br /> <br /> Superman Returns seems to have nothing at stake. Even Superman In Kolma, we see the damage caused by the inferior world supremacy .. we see suffering, see how it affects Pryor and others and the people in the middle. emotional to dump US Lex. We see the globes of crystals thrown into space. Superman was very creative in the first three Supermans to stop the plot against him, he could not simply "get into" his supremacy. In the first, he had to stop two rockets that went to different directions, and then crush his universal mandate and erased history to save the life of Lois ... (it was thirty years!). cross three men who were already more capable than, but with Lex's genius and the immoral tactics of the rogues, Superman was not overflowing enough, he had to work against each other and go over ... Superman III, Again He couldn't compute everything what he saw too much because he couldn't use the computer because he calculated it so he had to use benign acid, which only when he had reacted to aggression, he became dead and he found that acid earlier than he did could not just use his superiority to extinguish the fire because it was a chemical fire so he had to use his superb lines. he could not pull the water so he froze the lake and fell to the fire .. Now, Superman Returns, he just dropped into the outdoor space of the island, like UPS's night temp. He doesn't have to imagine anything, he just uses his "super power". And the brightness of Lex Luther was shown by junkies who just ran out of spam, at a predisposition level. <br /> <br /> He didn't say he threw this island outside the room after he was parked with the right mouse of the cyrptonite. In the bloodstream AND the island itself dropped kryptonite spores on his face, but he just prevented his eyes and nose as it was not Gray Poupon whom he looked at.
