This movie is too skeletal. This is a fairly low budget movie (I hope!), Which apologizes somewhat, but the lack of a decent aching and accurate charting is too much. Phillips is quite believable that his role is a branched son who is a scared family who is looking for himself (though his family is ... er ... well, a little too white ...) but the rest of the cast grabs the shoulders. Any moment with potential, destroys excess melodrama, and there's * five * too many sub-plots (which is an obvious sign of lack of graphics. They need a filler ...) I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who is not a Phillips fan , or having absolutely * nothing. 4/10.
