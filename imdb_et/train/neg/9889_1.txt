Under the woman, Mabel is mad, but I see why she's crazy. If I were to live such a life, he lived with my family to be crazy. Everyone in your family is out of their racer and not entirely with it. He is constantly surrounded by people screaming at him and telling him what is best for himself and for people who are not the sharpest knives in the drawer. <br /> <br /> Start with the person closest to him, his wife, Nick, is a little behind his rocker. He hugs him whenever he is at home, telling him how to live his life and stop behaving like an imbek. The rest of the time she works for long hours in her job and she's not there to support her when she needs support. One person in his life, which should always be with him, never exists there and, if he is, he just makes him worse. He relies on him to support and always goes to him when he feels he is acting wrong, and he does nothing to support him. When he comes home from the hospital, he tells him how to act instead of comforting him, just worships him and tells him what to do. <br /> <br /> Other larger people in their lives are his parents. His parents do nothing in his life. Mabel runs mainly through her life because they are afraid to stand up and stand by her. Finally, he even asks his father to stand for him and he does not understand and, if he does, he still does nothing. They do nothing to help Mabel restore or keep him crazy because they don't do anything for their time. The only person trying to do something with her is Nick's mother. Nick's mother is sure Mabel is committed. He doesn't want Nick to deal with it, so he's a doctor. Everything seems to be against Mabel and they feel his dedication is a good idea, because then they don't have to deal with it anymore. They all want to live their lives and do something for Mabel, except tempting him and making him feel he's doing something wrong when he's not. That's why he went crazy and why he had to commit, it was the fault of his family.
