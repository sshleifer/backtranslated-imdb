Save $ 8.97 you spend at Walmart to buy this DVD and watch Steven Spielberg's real movie. <br /> <br /> I am a filmmaker and, being an avid fan of HG Wells, I had to buy it in the hopes of sitting and watching three hours of good entertainment. Instead, it took four days to finish watching it because I couldn't watch more than 10 minutes at a time. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> It is known that Timothy Hines had $ 20 million for this production. When the hell did it go? Did he use most of the new house to buy? To finance your retirement? Or what? Let me start with what this movie really is. It stays with the book and has some good results. I can respect the actors who apparently tried to make it a good movie. But good results were quickly overshadowed by the terrible ... and I mean terrible special effects. Any newer film school student could have done a much better job with CGI. It seemed to me that most were seen as "stop action" card clips that were used instead of a complex CGI software that should be used by a $ 20 million project. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for amateur production. this movie. My partner and I sat around and rebuilt our ferry scene using software that cost less than $ 1500.00 and in one day there was a five-minute scene that seemed better and more realistic than it was created. I've seen movies with a budget of less than $ 2 million. Much better. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the special effects used in the original King Kong were more complex and better than the special effects of Hines in this movie. Actually, thanks to this movie, I'm much better off thanks to the Killer Tomato attack. Today's technology has no excuse for the film to look like a B-50s unless it was an intention that shouldn't have been done with this particular project. <br /> <br /> The problem with DVD transmission was that the movie was a funny, yet another demonstration of making an amateur film. <br /> <br /> In general, I have to say that I made a $ 45,000 project in 2003 with better cinema and special effects than this movie. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that anyone who appreciates a good movie or who is a WOTW fan would leave this movie on the shelf and look at the 50 foot woman attack instead. It would be easier for the eyes.
