Well I don't know where to start. Probably it was made for a TV movie, so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised by the general direction of the second hour, but something before or after it seemed to be color by numbers. <br /> <br /> And talk about nesting detectives who are dragging a bad chemistry. .. <br /> <br /> I'd go deeper, but this movie doesn't deserve it. Rating: D + (IMDB Rating 3/10)
