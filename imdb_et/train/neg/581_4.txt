Before I go on, I have to admit that I'm a big Bon Jov fan. In fact thats attracted me to DVD first. I would probably have bought it as a big horror blower and enjoyed so many first vampire titles. <br /> <br /> But it's not half good. Even Jon couldn't save that movie for me. My main problem is that it just isn't scary. In addition to Joni's character Derek Bliss, no other characters are impressed and you don't care whether they die or not, especially the annoying vampire / drug addict. Women's vampire just isn't scary or sexy. Rather, he looks like an anorectic 14-year-old girl, no wonder she's as tired as blood. Another big problem is that everything is just "too bright". There is no sense of atmosphere or fear. I know that the first vampires that have been set in New Mexico were not just in the dark, but still managed to be in the dark and in the fortune when it was needed. This film has no such tension. <br /> <br /> The story is basically the same as before. Vampire wants the Berzier cross to walk in daylight. At that time, however, the story is less cool. Don't know it's the captain of all the masters - the original vampire, as on the first movie. You really don't care about who or what it is. There is no army of masters. Instead, it hides in some old ruin that looks like Disneyland's attraction and then a horrible temple. <br /> <br /> So you really have it. Lack of fears, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting stories. Let me be shot in person.
