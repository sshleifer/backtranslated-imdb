They sell it as a horror movie, it should be a thriller, but I found it pretty funny (comedy ?, don't think about it), I laughed at the whole movie, which I think it was because of ridiculous behavior and plot. I don't blame the participants, I think they weren't very good, but O.K. I think Cillian is a very good "bad boy". I loved her actress Batman Beggins and Rachel McAdams. she is also a beauty and a good actor, but we try to be a little goal here, story mm mm ... direction mm mm ... she does not really have a good relationship, is really a boring film, but there is one good thing, this is a short film, only 1 hour and 30 minutes (OUR YOU, THERE ARE 10 MINES BY WATER!) <br /> <br /> I just don't know why this movie is rated so high and rotten tomatoes, even bigger, which is wrong, reasonable and with objective criticism?
