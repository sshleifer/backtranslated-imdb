Well, I recently got the opportunity to rent it and conquer Santa to win. Although children were more sadistic in SCCTM, I have to say that Santa was a much worse film. As a Spanish Spanish 5 we had to look at it. I tell you, usually when we watch a movie, we all talk and eat only food, but not this movie. Anyone who was just there was wondering what Mr. Pitch was following. Would Merlin help Santa!? or does his robot shop come and save the day? I would recommend renting it because it's the biggest garbage I've ever seen, and I love it. : D
