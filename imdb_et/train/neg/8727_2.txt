Let me start by saying that I can enjoy almost every abuse of the Italian horror movie or jungle in the 1970s. Seriously. It was absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> There are too many elements that Martino is trying to inject, and none of them work (except for the wild-wild thing) very well. Of course there are some unknown westerners who created a resort somewhere in the jungle. I don't even remember where this happens ... how sad it is ... Basically, people come to the resort to see this local tribe and its ceremonies, but eventually they disrupt the river alligator, who then returns to rampage, also killing vacationers and some tribes. Sounds good, right? Well, don't get your hopes. Finally, violent violence, special effects are so bad that it was like a kindergarten class, and their beloved story is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that look like they're up underwater in the pool and threw the toy in an alligator like throwing water and it should be an attacker. I'm not kidding. In the second superbly designed special effect, the Matchbox van is aimed at an incredible drowning plasticator, who is suddenly five times the size of a truck. (A few minutes ago, he was just big enough to eat, but now he's full of a full truck ...) It's really pathetic. The only other flick that I can think of, where the impact was so bad, was the story of Bruno Matte's "Rats" masterpiece, which, along with the conveyor belt plastic rods and anyone who couldn't scare. I would usually say Sergio Martino was a must-have, but it's a black pass. A waste of time and definitely not worth buying a $ 15 + sticker from No Shame. It's SHAME. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, kids.
