I'm not really sure how to start describing how bad this film is. I like bad movies because they are often the most entertaining. I love bad special effects, bad action, bad music and wrong direction. Except for music (which was better than I had expected), this film had all these qualities. <br /> <br /> The special effects were amazingly bad. The worst I've seen since my Nintendo 64. In some scenes, it is also necessary to look at the Thunderchild, whose mechanical leg breaks, the Big Ben scene, the train wreck ... Wow, there are so many bad effects! On the plus side, however, some scenes of foreigners are well done. <br /> <br /> The exhibition was about as bad as it could have been, relying directly on H.G. Wells book. For such a good source of material, it is almost the same as the actors trying to be so funny that it was funny. And then the mustache ... one of the most troublesome facial hair I've ever seen. Of course, only half of the movie contains actresses. The remainder are characters that move intentionally and in poorly rendered effects. <br /> <br /> Say Timothy Hines is an unfair leader who is unfair to wrong directors. Using different color filters between frames for a specific reason, using badly thawed backgrounds even on internal scenes, poor green screening, I am amazed at how this man ever got approved to control a movie. I can't imagine that this bad movie could be a bright book to change. Bravo, Mr. Hines. Bravo. <br /> <br /> My suggestion to anyone who plans to see this movie is to do what I did: have friends who enjoy bad movies, drink, play poker while watching, drink and maybe do it through . It makes a great bad movie, so have fun and laugh with this disaster.
