Tim Robbins is strangely benign here, cast in the 1950s as New Jersey garage mechanics who fall in love with the perky blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's niece! Although she has a lot of time on the screen, Robbins cancels the internal operations of her intense staff and disappears into the background (it's easy to forget she's even in the picture!). Lumpy's romantic comedy with a trick, this is Walter Matthau, who plays Einstein (who does what he can with a cartoon character). Otherwise, it is fresh and sunny, which Fred Schepisi directs quite a bit, showing the heart but not the mind or the brain. Meg Ryan is his usual peaceful self and the chemistry between him and Robbins is charming, like a gentle sister and his great brother. ** from ****
