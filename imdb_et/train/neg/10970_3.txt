It is absurd - besides having flicked a fellow Australian fellow, I can't help but I think everyone else who has reviewed it was somehow related to Elektra's production, given how generous their praise was. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm not really a fan of comic-movie conversions, so I didn't go into many expectations, but I found Elektra incredibly low. The thing that most irritated me was that there was so much in this movie that went inexplicably, which continued to think "what is the importance of the plot?" or "how did this character of a character arise?" I can only hope that these are things that may be explained somewhat in Daredevil, which I am not going to see. <br /> <br /> In addition, the behavior of the characters in this movie seems to work around random moments that fit with style, and not even to start with a totally useless romantic subtitle. I also (still) scratch my head on the fate of Cary-Hiroyuki's Tagawa character, which seems to be inexplicable. <br /> <br /> If I can wear what he should do for this movie, be fantastic places where it was shot, but otherwise I got little pleasure from Electra. I know we have to stop our belief in fantasy / action movies, but almost everything in this movie was so unlikely or confusing (even with action film standards) that it just made me disappoint. <br /> <br /> Well, hell, at least Jennifer Garner sees the devil.
