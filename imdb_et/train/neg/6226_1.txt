I cut through this movie. First, the idiotic plot has little to do with Parson's own story. Hollywood has been trying to create a sort of comedy car. Imagine "Englebert Sings Hendrix". <br /> <br /> Don't make this movie accurate. The name Parsons in the title and theft of his body is used as a springboard for a small budget tracing film, a blatant attempt to grab a few bucks of parson's legacy and his fan base. Gram's father had long died in 1973, other global characters are fictional, none of which is related to the life or death of grams. <br /> <br /> If you are a Gram fan, I suggest you not watch this movie. I wish it wasn't. It's sad to see something special that is treated as such a shameful feed. I swear that when I heard the Gram grave while playing the movie, I heard. If you don't know Gram's life and heritage, don't take anything typical of Gram in this movie. <br /> <br /> I can't say anything bad about this movie. When Gram was alive and saw this movie, he would kill himself. Then maybe he's afraid if he knew this film should be the result.
