Surprisingly, the film has some sort of redemption quality when it comes to its end. On the other hand, this movie is very bad and flat, with a small budget, an insulting bad written script, and everything that comes with it. <br /> <br /> It's stupid to make all the money around Christian circles where they never see enough money to make a decent movie. I am not religious, so I do not care less, but filmmaking is a good way to reach a new audience of churches and get more interest and curiosity for people, for example, reading the Bible. In this regard, these films always seem like a wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> The low budget does not harm the film and brings it down. It makes the film ridiculous to look at its effects and it just gives the overall movie a B-film feel. <br /> <br /> But what is damaging to this movie is writing it. The thing that just happens in this film is simply offensive to intelligence and then I don't even speak or talk about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the film progresses is so unlikely, and the people in this movie are making very unlikely things that their viewers are offended. <br /> <br /> I also hated how the movie was like a soap opera. . It seemed to me that it was just a difficult time for them to make it into a full-length movie, and they added some characters and dramatic developments just to fill things. I just couldn't care less from time to time. <br /> <br /> However, it must be said that the film becomes stronger and more persistent when its story focuses on its nature. However, it is still predictable, but it prevented this film from watching a complete wreck, and there is a lot more to look at such films, although I don't think this film will win. new souls. <br /> <br /> 4/10
