I'm scared! Wow, get ready for ninja unpleasant ways. Watch them when they beat, climb the ground (back or stomach) like a caterpillar, fly through the sky, climb buildings, hide and spring from trees, throw ninja stars, make blue greeting mats, disappear in smoke bombs, make a lot of noise with your blades and quickly steal or rides on his toes. What a vision! Really, I could go on with many traditional activities, but I'm here all day. Don't forget that we even get the legendary Chuck Connor open again and again, and see how he's gonna send some ninja with his shotgun. What a class! What's wrong! In any case, the very cheap "Sakura Killers" is sometimes a stupid but fun ninja action that only fans of this genre will get from this shonky b-class attack. <br /> <br /> The American Genetic Laboratory is a very important video that has stolen a couple of ninja. Colonel (Chuck Connors) sends two Americans to Japan to download it. <br /> <br /> Opening this feature puts it nicely up. Get ready to laugh! Later, it slows down, but soon after the two main protagonists learn from the ninja and undergo training, they can break in costumes and flee after a stolen beta tape that contains a very important formula. This is when violently fast action and aerobic family work really play. Nor is it too dirty (like moral scripts and daft performances). The final climatic showdown is very well done. <br /> <br /> Slow stretching has two Americans (Mike Kelly and George Nicholas) who look at the matter by sharing meaningless conversations and some minor issues in places. What made me laugh was how the ninjas were the two brave and smart. These were supposed to be professional killers? Director Dusty Nelson ("Effects (1989)") does a serious job with what he had and plays it for what it is. He brings together on-screen activities in Taiwan's prominent places. Score is purple.
