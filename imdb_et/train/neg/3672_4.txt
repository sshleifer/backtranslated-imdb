I watched the film, recognizing William Hurt, Natascha McElhone and Desiree Nosbusch. I'm glad I had no idea about Peter Weller's presence. At the end of the movie, I said, "Was that Peter Weller?" Knit to Mr Weller for his excellent performance. Weller played a great character and his performance was such that I didn't even know him. <br /> <br /> In general, the plot was bad, writing was bad and performances, in addition to Nosbusch and Weller performances. were subpar. The landscapes and places were interesting and Weller was amazing. <br /> <br /> 4 stars, possibly 10.
