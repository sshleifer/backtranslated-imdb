"Loonatics Unleashed" is the worst thing that can happen with the classic characters created by Chuck Jones. "Loony Tunes" has many spin-offs and different versions, some were good, others not very much. But "Loonatics" is the worst. The concept is a stupid and exhibition derivative "The Power Rangers" and "Teen Titans". There was no resemblance to the original characters and the stories are boring and poorly made. The new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic. This exhibition just doesn't work. This scary waste of animation is a complete failure and should not be anything but a bad joke. Lame! Zero stars
