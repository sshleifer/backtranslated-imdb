This movie doesn't have much to do with its predecessor "Robot Jox". This must also be the reason why its most common name is "Robot Wars" and not the alternative name "Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars". <br /> <br /> "Robot Jox" was basically a fun movie to watch because it was a nice prerequisite for giant robots fighting with each other in the near future. This concept has been abandoned for this film and instead it is a totally dumb story that it is not very original or cleverly written. The shame he was trying to be as different as it was, it could have been more fun watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Just like "Robot Jox" is this B movie, but the big difference is that it is not very good. Perhaps this is also the case with "Robot Jox" in the 1980s, when B-films still had a certain charm and class, even when the film came out in 1990. \ t about this movie. It's just flat, badly done, bad and not exciting. It also has an end that leaves you thinking, "Is that?" That is all? ‚Äù. <br /> <br /> What a movie's story is missing is a good, clear line-up. Perhaps a good main villain would have been a good idea and some other things, such as the actual point story, some activities or the likes of the main characters. for this movie. Not all of them just like their roles, and especially Don Michael Paul is a mate who behaves like a gift from God to wife and Mr. Perfect who can compete with someone. Could they even get participants from the first movie? <br /> <br /> For such a futuristic movie, the concept of which is big battle droids, this movie is definitely not in action. If they had taken more and more action in the film, watching the film would be at least entertaining. Instead, we have a movie that can't impress in any way in any way. <br /> <br /> Get a better look at the "Mighty Morphin 'Power Rangers" episode so you can act and prove more. <br /> 3/10
