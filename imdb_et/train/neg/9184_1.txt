F * ck Me! I've seen some incredibly terrible movies in my time, but it takes p * ss! <br /> <br /> Frankly, I can't say in words how bad this movie really is. In addition to the plot that is not really there, the comic crap acts, a fun terrible excuse for zombies; You know what, I could go all day. Every little movie in this movie is either stupid, pointless, nasty or embarrassing. I'm going to tell anyone who wants to watch this movie ... no! <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to say I have this tooth. It is hidden away at the bottom of a huge pilgrim god fucking. I couldn't even release this horse-apology for the movie. It's so bad.
