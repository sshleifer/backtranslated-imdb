I personally liked "The Prophecy" in 1995. Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and although the film was not flawless, it was a horrible and very original Horror / Fantasy movie that amused enormously entertainment. However, this lower 1998 sequel is worth, but mainly due to Walken. Walken, in my opinion, is one of the greatest actors and again, in the role of the fallen Archangel Gabriel, whom he plays for the second time here. Again, the war between the fallen and loyal angels falls on the earth. Gabriel returns to avoid the birth of a child, namely Angel Danyael (Russel Wong) and the human wife Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child can ever be a determining factor in the heavenly war ... As I said before, Christopher Walken is again a great Gabriel. But, alongside Gabriel, "The Prophecy II" is unfortunately a bunch of terribly annoying signs. Valerie's character was annoying enough and Danayel was even more annoying. The biggest pain of the mouth, however, was the girl from the Isidic, who did not interrupt, the character of Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy). However, Walken's performance is not the only redeeming quality of the movie. The whole film is pretty harsh and well photographed in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. In addition, Gabriel's resurrection scene is quite impressive at first and one of the coolest moments in any "Prophecy" movie. However, "Prophecy II" is the weakest of the three "Prophecy" films with Walken. Certainly Christopher Walken is one man-show, entertaining, but nothing else.
