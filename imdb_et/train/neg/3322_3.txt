Unfortunately for me, the first Busby Berkeley movie I ever watched was "42nd Street". Then I waited for all his stuff to be so good. I found that this wasn't necessarily the case here with my all-time favorite classical actor James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Oh, musical numbers are just as spectacular as always, but the story is like many others and quite tiring. They seem to be always involved with screaming, unhappy exhibitors. In this movie, Cagney, who runs so often, that after a while I need to have my headache and its character wearing a thin ... fast! <br /> <br /> Even the songs here are close by. The 42nd Street Class, the songs you could worship for years and years - for decades, I would say. The songs in this movie are not memorable. No, it's one of the few early Cagney movies - and Berkeley movies - I don't like it and I was very disappointed when I was watching.
