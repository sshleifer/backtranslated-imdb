"My name is modest" is based on an episode that takes about one page in the 10th modest Blaise novel called Morningstar Night. It describes a case where a young Modesty (in 17 books, mid-twenties) confirms his leadership in the war over the casino. Because it is set before the actual Blaise adventure, his trusted connoisseur is not in Willi Garvin's movie. This is one of the major problems because the relationship between Blaise and Garvin was certainly an exciting aspect of novels and long running comics. Another problem is that the film is simply incredibly boring because it is really just one small episode that was blown into the scenario. Casting is okay, but Alexandra Staden is not really a heroine and actually too old to play the role of a young Modesty. I have the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution to not lose the rights to the Blaise franchise.
