The plot was boring, the girls were sick and the supposed Italian male driver had probably never heard of an Italian accent. Someone said the boys were cute in this movie, but it seemed to be full of mediocre people. There was literally no redemption of this film. <br /> <br /> I think it's a graveyard for actors who never work again. The unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins who seem to be people who do not feel any apparent reason. I hope Olsen twins will find something that keeps them away from the entertainment company. They don't have that place.
