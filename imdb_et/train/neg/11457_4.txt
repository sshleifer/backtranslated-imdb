OKAY. I know that the wanna-be John films of the 80s were all one-sided flat, so the expectations of this film were quite small. It looks like I'm getting out of my head: <br /> <br /> I just sat through the 80's Rob Lowe's film, which had no nudity and only sex tips. <br /> <br /> The actor is dreadful characters boring and flat, depicting Oxford as an absolute insult and unruly scenes that have failed, uneven, and inaccurate. <br /> <br /> If you don't have Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays (or I think Rob Lowe) fetish, there's really no reason to see it.
