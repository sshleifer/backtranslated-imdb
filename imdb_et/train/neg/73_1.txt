It must be the worst garbage I've seen for a while. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is the Heart Tower? He seemed deformed. I wish I knew he and Naomi Watts were in real life because I spent 2 hours of my life, thinking what he saw in him. <br /> <br /> Orlando Bloom is the Heart Tower? When I look at the cheerful beard and deer lights, I can't say I agree. wait outside the device. <br /> <br /> Should I be sorry for the fraudsters and murderers? It's far from Butch Cassidy, who was really a fun movie. It was a trick, clich√©s and boring. We stayed just because we were convinced that it would improve. It wasn't. <br /> <br /> The last 10-15 minutes were unintentionally fun. Heath and his gang are founded in a border area hotel, women and children die due to their presence. It's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel, because we all thought of the black knight of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I was waiting for them to say, "I'll bite the leg!" We smiled with laughter, as did many other twisted audience members. When we left, everyone talked a lot about what the film was like. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I never get back.
