I'm just giving this pretentious garbage 1 just because I don't think the world is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie, hate actor, dialogue, setup, writing and directing. I hope everyone involved in this film burns and rebels with the darkest circle of hell. <br /> <br /> Damn this nasty waste of time. <br /> <br /> I pray every day when this film is just an imagination of my imagination. I pray that I would dream of a movie and that I should never see it in my local video store. <br /> <br /> BURN IN HELL
