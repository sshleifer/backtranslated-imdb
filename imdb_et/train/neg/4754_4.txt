I loved the original. It was great and always. Strangely enough, I was still waiting to see again. I'm usually a little over again because there are too many of them, but somehow I was interested. I really enjoyed it at first. Caine is as usual, and Jude Law can hold her next door. It was pretty smart how it was modernized and it worked. What stops it really good is the last seven minutes. It goes completely away from the original, but in fact it is no longer wise and simply irritating. The end of the original was fantastic! So many tensions were built and it was incredibly smart! It is? It does not grow tense, but it seemed disappointed that they decided to make Caine's character homosexual. It was when they tried to have a lot of trouble. And then ... BANG! The law is dead. Role of credit. This movie is worth watching only for shows, but these last seven minutes really drag. What a pity....
