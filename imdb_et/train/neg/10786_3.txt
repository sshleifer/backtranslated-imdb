How this movie was made in so many big letters is over me. This is a horrible clich√© film, the worst of which is none of these actors. It is a surprise to me that so many of these A-star letters would agree with this unexpected movie. Worse still, there are almost 100 million countries here. However, it shows that big stars can pull bucks even if the movie is terrible. I was sorry that everyone in this whore was involved. Billy Crystal tried her best, and the other stars seemed to be moving. Whatever you do, do not fall for great pain, because no one would have saved it.
