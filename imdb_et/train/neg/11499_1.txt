Gadar is a really stupid movie because it talks about a fake story. It's too unrealistic and is a typical sunny deol film designed for bash Pakistan.The movie aims to mislead the viewers so they can think that Pakistan and its government are bad but Trying to hide your mistakes does not work.And all the songs and music in the movie are all bad.Most often, the Sikhs love th movie cause they mislead.Video sucks and sucks power. I think only Amisha Patel was good in the movie. If I can give 10 out of 10, but I would be the lowest, then 1. Please save 3 hours of your life and don't look at this stupid boring movie.
