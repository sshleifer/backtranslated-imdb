The film is wanted for the public thanks to Ben Stiller's charisma and the recognition of J. Aniston. We seem to have a successful title recipe here, but there's no success in this movie. <br /> <br /> Polly undoubtedly plays very well with Aniston. This is the kind of character that fits her perfectly. <br /> <br /> Bem Stiller is the same annoying man as "Meet the parents", but there are few comics in this movie compared to the above-mentioned title. <br /> <br /> The script is very poor, nothing special at all. With these two well-paid participants, things could get a lot better - but what they can do if there is such a bad story and script. <br /> <br /> 4 out of ten.
