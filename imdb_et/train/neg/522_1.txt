After about 15 minutes, my wife wanted to leave. Not so much for the material, but for lack of it. They decided to fill empty spaces where funny things would have had to speak as much language and absolutely vulgar as they could. If it ended (very rarely), we would like to sit and watch (not laugh, remember) and wait for the next attack or offensive note. After about 35 minutes, we both got up and left. All we read was how big it was. The Hague seemed good and Roger Ebert actually called it "intelligent" and said it wasn't a raw sex comedy. Did she go to the right movie? With Be Cool, this is the only other film I've ever been out of ... and I'm sorry. I'm sick of trying to see comedies in America.
