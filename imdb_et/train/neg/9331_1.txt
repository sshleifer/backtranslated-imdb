Are we talking about the same movie? This film is totally ridiculous, the plot is nasty and totally logical. This is a typical straight DVD / TV movie that contains all the necessary ingredients for a frightening movie experience: excessive action has been actors, lateral steps from the plot that were left unexplained, Girl SHOW TIN T * ts (why, god) Why ??), people does not respond to things as they do in real life. I don't even worry about the details, it takes all night. Well, OK, only one: If two people were killed in front of you while walking on the street, one of the victims dies in your hands, his blood strikes his head with a wound over you, be your first concern; "Oh, he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face!" My thoughts go to Harve and his lost career.
