I read a running man from Kings books to Bachman and I felt that John and his family were the main character. This movie could have been so much. Problem? It was set during the madness of big movies. I was watching the movie and I was hurting all the time. I didn't know anything about this character and less about its cause. Yes, it was funny scenes (or ridiculous), though I think it didn't record the movie in my eyes. When you read the book, you can feel the climax and fire in the heart of John when he gets his final revenge. <br /> <br /> I give this film a small number. It may not be as low as I would have read the book.
