The trailers of this film were better than the movie. What a waste of talent and money. I wish I had been waiting for this movie to come on DVD because at least I wouldn't be $ 9. The film loses the character completely. What could have been a big movie for all the movies, it turned out to be the best B movie. The film moved very slowly and it was almost when I thought it was going somewhere, but it didn't. In this day and age, the film has unpredictable plots and closures, and this film does not offer either. The whole thing about everything is suspect is good, but it is not sure if it was as it was directed, lighting, line delivery, writing or what, but nothing came from it. Lots of hype for something. I was very disappointed in this movie and I tell everyone not to see it. The whole bright saxophone music made the film even worse. And at the end, there was NO other film involved. What a disappointment.
