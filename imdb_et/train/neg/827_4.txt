Burning saddles! It is a fight between two strangers' brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard), both of whom can ignite the fire spiritually; They kidnap childhood differences where dippy love interest Debra Winger caught in the middle. Directed by Glenn Gordon Caron ("Moonlighting" behind the TV) captures Vince Gilligan's scenario with a darkly textured comedy presentation that is so slippery, the film resembles an overwhelming enthusiastic film student entry of fifteen million dollars in support. It has a prickly energy of great commercial character, but a formless style that does not mean anything from the characters except their central eccentricities. These are not even characters, they are plot features. The film, which has been released into theaters, is a disaster, although it is just an example of a style that seems to be good. Winger is the only challenge that seems really puzzled. * 1/2 from ****
