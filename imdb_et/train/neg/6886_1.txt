John Heder was absolutely terrible in this film. I felt like I was watching a bad college boy who was first in a student film. Anna Farris was par for the course, not good, but not terrible (plus she is cute). Dianne Keaton should have felt better. Jeff Daniels was the only salvation arm in this film (although his part was a bad rating). All in all, I would avoid it at all costs. I'm glad I didn't see it cost! <br /> <br /> John Heder will forever stick to the predictable role of 'dorky child' unless he does some serious work for his own actors.
