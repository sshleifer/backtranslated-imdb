This movie is flat and not funny at all. The plot doesn't even make sense. Some scientists who work on the edge of science open the doorway to another dimension (maybe hell?) And her daughter is sucked through this or something, and one day, for no apparent reason, she comes back and now she has big breasts and wearing hidden clothing (I think that the demons of the second dimension did it for him?) The main character is the man who wants to marry his girlfriend, but he is so gay that he is more interested in his new girlfriend and they stumble with the spell of this witch (they want to be witches or something) ?) and the evil spell can be read again, which is how the evil demon arrives on the ground, which only a bikini girl and a love boy will probably stop. There are topless scenes for no reason, and the boy who says my boyfriend is a well-known wrestler, but his part is totally unnecessary, apparently they did something to put him on, because then maybe the wrestling fans are actually watching this nonsense movie. I'm sure topless girls won't get there either. The extra features of the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie, I thought it might help to explain what was going on, but in fact it made things confusing. Who are these people and what are they doing? Basically it's a movie-go-camp-to-out-then-fight-a-monster movie, but there's a lot of things (like another dimension and book seller) to make it confusing. I didn't like the movie, but it was just five dollars so big. I don't recommend looking at it, though it was just too stupid, I don't think of any good film elements.
