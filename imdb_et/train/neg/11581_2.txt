This is really a terrible movie. The plot (as it is) is completely uneven. (I think it's related to blackmail, but I'm not entirely sure.) <br /> <br /> Half of the dialogue is useless clich√©s. The other half speaks of the incomprehensible imitations of "southern" accents that are (unfortunately) not recognizable by the various parties. <br /> <br /> But one real tragedy in the film is that such a historic talent as Mary Tyler Moore was apparently in such terrible financial or personal circumstances that she appeared in it. <br /> <br />
