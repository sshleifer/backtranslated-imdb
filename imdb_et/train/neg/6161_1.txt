This is perhaps the worst fencing, sword fight, ever made movie. This is not only because the so-called sports guards are bad, but because the parcels of characters are so weak that they have to throw a half-sex composition and a later-expected group of dance fencing around the scene in the boundary club that is trying, I think I keep the audience interest. What is the waste of F. Murray Abraham's talents. You'd better serve an overwhelmed tearful film like Zorro, Scaramouche, something that has Basil Rathbone as a villain. Fencerina, I feel almost impossible to grab a movie as a sport, but when that happens, she needs to have fresher, better lines and a deeper plot.
