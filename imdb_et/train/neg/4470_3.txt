It is meant for comedy, but mainly for bad taste, and not for something that makes the film smile. The film talks about a couple trying to catch a child, and those who are in such a situation suffer from images. For example, the scenes of the fertility clinic are not the least funny and, frankly, embarrassing. The team leader who plays the construction worker and his hard hat is a bad excuse to reject the villagers. A female driver is trying to look 20 years younger than she is. Both drivers are exposed to unpleasant, unpleasant and completely unconvincing. The film features a variety of ridiculous and completely unnecessary events, such as a budget airline without humor. The only reason I get 1/10 instead of 3/10 is one sign for Shirley Maclaine, who in the class is something else in the picture, and one sign for some half-decent (though old) music.
