i love bad shark movies. I really do. I laugh at them hysterically. and the scifi channel had their marathon culminating in the release of their new original image, hammerhead: shark frenzy. Based on the preview, it seemed very fun. Essentially a really benchley creature. It was a shark attack 3 described above: Megalodon, which is a shark movie fun at its best. I was in the mood; I was ready to go. Bring this, hammerhead-mad-scientist-man! Oh, god, this movie was wrong. <br /> <br /> False, False, False. <br /> <br /> Ill. twisted. MESSED UP. <br /> <br /> This is the theoretical reproduction in the worst situation, my friends. when a stunned girl is brought out of paused animation and placed on a table that punishes her head, because the hyacinth of shark-man has an absolutely crazy "scientist" who deliberately implanted in her mother wants ... monkeys of Jesus. what I call disturbing. <br /> <br /> This is really how the plot works: hmmm, I thought a mad scientist. my son died of cancer, but I brought him back to life, combining his dna with a hammer, because the sharks do not leave cancer and the hammerheads multiply through the placenta. Oh look! Perfect amphibian creature! I've created the next evolution of humanity! I KNOW! Let's make him multiply! but if all these shark genes have not made my son's sense of blood, instead of rape the hot babes, I'll send my little jungle paradise, he eats him. but watch it! among the random people who have reached my research island because of some insignificant plot, the woman my son was before death! I bet he does HER! all this leads to an extremely touching and cordial meeting: a woman: are you going to impregnate me? crazy scientist: no. he is. (shows that the tanks have a thrilling shark-like person) as sweet. <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. never before.
