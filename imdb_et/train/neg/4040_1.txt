I think I'm a little snob when it comes to everything, and while the movie experience is more explosive than a high drama, I can also hold on to the movies. <br /> <br /> Not all art films are better than King Kong. I would give Kong two letters, doubling the creation of this movie. <br /> <br /> I think people were very excited about it because it was almost identical in style to what you see in the game. For a less remarkable art-buff, a film that looks like a game is "excellent art". <br /> <br /> This movie was, however, useless. <br /> <br /> There is always no story based on high drama. The only drama in this movie was either falling off the roof or not. So, a deep and meaningful dialogue? No. Great action? Hardly. <br /> <br /> Too fair: some landscapes were still interesting: communist apartments, city squares (St. Petersburg?) and Soviet trams still in use.
