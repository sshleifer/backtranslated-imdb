Shintar√¥ Katsu gained a ton of fame, Zatoichi. Zatoich's films had a strange and unbelievable concept - the blind boy is Japan's biggest sword player and spends every film to correct the mistake and demanding responsibility of criminals. She's a nice guy and the movies are exciting and addictive (I've actually seen every movie). That's why I saw this latest series of Hanzo Razor, as I expected it to be very similar .... and the boy was wrong! It turns out that Hanzo films are extremely sexual and also promote the rape of "worthy women". You see, Hanzo is a policeman of the Meiji period, and he regularly takes evil women in custody and listens to them with violent rape in his "steel penis". How he made his member so strong that you have to believe it, but it is certainly not puzzled. <br /> <br /> In general, I can't recommend anyone seeing those violent and misogynous movies. But despite other reviews, I see that they are still very popular ... and it's pretty scary. Despite some decent action and an amazing fighting scene, the movies are just like brain pollution - and I wouldn't imagine how the films would have contributed to violence against women.
