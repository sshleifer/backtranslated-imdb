Perhaps because I was so young, innocent and BRAINWASHED when I saw it, this movie was the reason for many sleepless nights. I haven't seen it because I was in the 7th grade at the Presbyter School, so I'm not sure what effect it would have on me. I say, however, that it gave me the impression ... and most of my friends. It served its purpose, at least until we were sufficiently old and sufficiently aware to analyze and create our own opinions. I was particularly frightened of what had to be tolerated by newly transformed Christians when they did not receive the beast's sign. I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, so I don't mention the details of the scene, but I can still shoot them with my head ... and it has been 19 years.
