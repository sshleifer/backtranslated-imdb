Comparison with American Graffit is inevitable to save your money and time by hiring this timeless classics. Speaking of timeliness, the Cheers episode took place where Norm and Cliff competed to find the most anachronistic in the film. They would have loved this movie from all the songs and some clothes were wrong. Such references were like "they paved the paradise on the parking lot". The filmmakers hoped to make some smiles on us, but basically made me worship. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially intelligent for young people. Almost as smart as the people in their thirties and forties when they wrote the movie. Very little of what the characters said was plausible. Combine bad writing and the bad functioning of this movie just totally fails. Although there were two exceptions, Kelli Williams brought things up as a future florist, and despite what another reviewer said, Rick Shroeder was pretty good. This brooding characteristic is displayed, which starts to appear in its possible appearance "N.Y.P.D. Blues".
