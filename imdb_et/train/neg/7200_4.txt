I wanted to like this movie - the location pictures were mostly filmed in Pittsburgh and the trailer had wonderful photography. But even the filmed comic was a very badly made movie. Consistency and stimulation were both terrible. The best bits of the movie are under the end credit, so it's (almost) worth sticking to the end (though strange it rises slightly in the last half hour or so). <br /> <br /> If Andy Dick presents the best results for a movie, you know you have to be a problem ...
