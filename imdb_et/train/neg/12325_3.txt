I remember this example. I still remember the fun fun song "America's Funniest People". Frankly, it should have been American flat or ununny or honestly disgusting People. Dave could not record this example and later Bob Saget and AFV substitutes failed. Jackalope's segments were fun, and yes, Dave was able to make good voices that were better than Bob's. But this exhibition went to hell because the lamer crappy videos of people presented. It has also become a somewhat diverse example of flat guest letters, including Olson Twins. Plus AFV was at the beginning of it before they picked up ugly when the winners were sinners. Did I mention that the videos were nasty and flat? However, the theme is song stones!
