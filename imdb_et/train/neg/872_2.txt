First, I was expecting "drilled heat" to be the same as "Ilsa, Wicked Warden." Boy, I was wrong! In some way, this film is not the exploitation of the 70's, "chix chains" or "women in prison". Of course, the plot consists of women in captivity who are wearing street clothes btw (rather comic) but NOT happening. <br /> <br /> There are no strong races, no one is trying to seduce a prison or a doctor to try and escape, and no prisoners are taken. There are 2 shower scenes that I suspect is just recycled film material, but no fight is / nobody is here - or somewhere on this issue! In addition to the absence of a plot, persuasive, uncertain and flat characters, a couple of prisoners who can escape can return to prison to "free" their compatriots? !! <br /> <br /> TEL-LEASE, the film should have come to an end when the refugees get to the sunset ... contrary to continuing this mess! <br /> <br /> I feel scammed.
