When you hit the head with a shovel, write the script with your feet, you can get close to the level of intelligence in the movie. In this movie, nothing has been made thousands of times in other gangsters and much better. Those who think "Scarface" was a kind of hero who was seen or seen in "Goodfellas", "Menace II Society" or "Dead Presidents" and thought MMM "It's my life!" like this movie. I thought I'd give the film a chance because the premise was perfect for prequel. I should have known when I saw Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs involved. Anyone with more than fourth grade education, look at the original with a real actor Pacino and be happy.
