Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin in the 3rd Home Home Alone Empire. Four industrial spies acquire a rocket control computer chip and smuggling through an airport remote control in the car. Because of the confusion of luggage, Mrs Hess (Marian Seldes) gets into the car. He gives it to his neighbor Alex (Linz) just before the spies appear. Spies rent a house to steal every neighborhood house until they find a car. Just a domestic cat with a canoe, Alex calls 911 every time he is in theft, but the spies always get out of the police while Alex is accused of making prank calls. Finally, the spies turn their attitude toward Alex, not knowing that he is a hidden device in his entire house trap. Home Alone 3 was not terrible, but probably shouldn't do it instead of Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesc or Daniel Stern. Home Alone 3 had some funny parts, but I don't like changing the characters in the movie series at my own risk.
