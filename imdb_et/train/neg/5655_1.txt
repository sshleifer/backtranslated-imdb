Egyptian films have many films that have high drama or romance or comedy or action even sport ... "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lam" was banned in Egypt because it is nudity of content (full of front woman's nudity) and this type of nudity is forbidden Egyptian movies .. When I saw this movie, I felt it ... Fool Story .. Nude Actress .. Bad Action .. Some Horror & Awful Colors .. Dear friend .. If you want to see a great Egyptian movie ... Just: stay in the form "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lam" .. We have great movies in Egypt ... We have great actors who won the global victory Like: Omar El Sheriff or Gameel Rateb .. We have great leaders like " Yousef Shahin "So believe me on Ball. You don't have to watch this movie.
