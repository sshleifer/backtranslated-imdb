or anyone who prayed for Al Cliver's eyes to wrestle naked, a 7-hour black black guy full of nelson, is your movie! Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner), a film star, is abducting a group claiming a $ 6 million ransom that will be delivered to their island. What they don't read is the tough Vietnam Veterinarian Peter Weston (Cliver), whose filmmaker hires to save her. And what they didn't really expect was a local tribe who loves to offer young women their monster cannibal god with blood supply to the eye. <br /> <br /> Pretty much the same filming as CANNIBALS, one of the better value for entertainment value, thanks to mostly fun dub-rails and an amazingly striking monster (Franco confirms that they were sharing ping pong balls in a disc interview ). Franco gets strong EuroCult support, including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochathi (whose death is one of the major scratches I've ever seen as a man who hasn't shown him completely - close to him). The film has a ton of nudity and a gore (Tempra color variety) is available. For me, the world was slowly showing the waves splashing between fistfight Cliver and Antonio de Cabo. Unfortunately, ol 'Jess puts this one amazing (and sometimes agonizing) after 1 hour and 40 minutes if it had to run for 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> Mostly, Severin's DVD looks pretty nice, but during some darker scenes, some strange haunted images take place. There is also a long part of the dialogue in Spanish, without it remaining (these are options, but only when you listen to the French journey). Franco gives a pleasant 16-minute interview on the film and has a lot more pleasant things to say about Buchfellner than his CANNIBALS star Sabrina Siani.
