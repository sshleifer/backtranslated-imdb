When you watched this movie, you know why I said, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus". Hehehe !!! Every time they said, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" ... I laughed at the thought, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I rent this movie?" I can't believe how the Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared in the background, while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Sensitive action! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done much better work! This work was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me that I'm not very fun for him ... but I prefer the actor, not the android named Timberlake. And his girlfriend was low, hollow and annoying like hell. I was happy when they both jumped on the street. <br /> <br /> The story was OK and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his bad guy very well. The movie was fun, but I think Timberlake destroyed it all. Without him, it would have been a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> By the way, the music was OK, but suddenly it changed every time the music appeared, making the movie into a MTV video clip with flashing, little movement and the like. . Something that thought of this police movie. Maybe they wanted to make an MTV video clip for Timberlake.
