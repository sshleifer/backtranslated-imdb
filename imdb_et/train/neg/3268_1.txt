It is a real challenge to make a film about the baby being eaten by wild dogs and that the mother is wrongly accused of being funny but against all probabilities. Meryl Streep gives her life, melodramatic, burnt, but with the comic genius that keeps you laughing even when her mother struggles with supreme horror. <br /> <br /> If the comedies of toddlers in your dogs are not your cup's way, it may be uncomfortable to look at it, and yes, this is a strange choice for a farce, but really little film has anything to do with it because it focuses on Streep's accent on his Aussie and face contradictions. <br /> <br /> Slamming media failure and sensationalism and ignoring truth or ethics gives the film the opportunity to make a bold point that these things are bad.
