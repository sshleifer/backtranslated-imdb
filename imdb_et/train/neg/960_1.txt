Heldeke. I was so disappointed that this movie was just a rupture of Japan's Ring. Well, I think the US also made its own version, but at least it was a direct remake. So sad. I am very pleased to be watching Filipino films and I know that some big things can come out of such a small country so I can't believe it. Claudine and Kris are such big names surprised to be involved in plagiarism. For all filmmakers from the Philippines: You don't have to make that low money. There are many film enthusiasts who watch the movies that the Filipinos put out and enjoy!
