You saw it last night at the Montreal Festival des film du Monde. What a disappointment. IMDb fans have clearly overestimated this movie. The action was only regular. Management did not bring anything new or interesting. There are no noticeable features on the plot: the film is all about the college degrees and game they play to make prank calls (7eventy 5ive). And on top, you can predict the end of the movie in the first five minutes. If you like the prank caller and the ax driver, which makes you jump one or two times during the whole movie, you may like it. If you don't, this movie is not worth it.
