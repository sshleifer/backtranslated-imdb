Good people, I stumbled upon this movie when I categorized the papers. My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature, and I can say that no one has ever done that genre that it deserves. Iceland's "Beowulf and Grendel" is the least offensive and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This Sci-Fi version comes with Christopher Lambert's version. Yuck. <br /> <br /> What did I dislike? CGI for one. Amazingly bad. More importantly, loyalty to fidelity, not to mention standing up. I've been used to all the versions I've seen. <br /> <br /> I am glad, regardless of Peter
