Yes, this movie has kids in a space camp and it starts well if you have kids meeting each other and learning the volume. Then they introduce a robot that does not exist in 1986, because they currently have no such artificial intelligence. The kid gets a friend with a robot and the robot pays for the child's friendliness by shooting him and other children in that camp, with a very limited oxygen content and radios that don't have the signal to reach space. This camp is not very fun either, as these children are trained and the instructors get everything for them if they don't work or do the right things. Give her a break, they're there for fun, they're not astronauts yet, but give them a space flight experience, not a military, like a camp. But you see Joaquin Phoenix in a rather early role. So in the end, a movie that is trying to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors, was alien to the battlefield of the child, besides everything else in the movie. at least the film is more pleasing to me. Probably to another one who would still like to see Kate Capshaw's face hanging on some strange super alien creature.
