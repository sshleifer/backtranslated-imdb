Some of my old friends suggested that I watch this movie, but I just got a chance recently. I had great hopes of seeing something interesting about Kamal Hans, which I saw was the corners of a high-speed mixed garbage camera. I didn't understand what the message was except for the humiliating Hinduism. I am more like many religion types, but I felt that Kamal Hasan is a person who has organized such thinking. He could have made a movie of fear than this mess. He tried to add the Hollywood genre of viruses and God forbid he did not convert this guy into a mutant and eventually goes to world domination. This is a more suitable film for the film school than for the ordinary public. Shame on him that he does not have the talents he has. Starting a story tried to borrow Chaos ideas about the effect of butterflies, then a little religious harmony for the Hindus at an insulting price (again, I solvanize Hinduism, but this film is not equal and my insult is the same religion in general that can be made in this intellectual intellectual film.)
