I have never read the book "Time wrinkled". To be absolutely honest, do I really want after seeing the movie? Well, I shouldn't look at this movie. Next, the TV movie is quite forgotten. Do you know why I say that? Because I forgot what's going on. I said it was forgotten. To be absolutely honest, no TV movie is ever better than "Merlin". <br /> <br /> How can I describe a TV movie? I've never written any reviews before. Well, I just say they usually have some celebrities. Temporary wrinkles contain only one. Alfre Woodard (Or Woodward, I'm not sure), Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> The movie has cheesy special effects, a lightly interesting plot, scenes that make you "WTF". The movie is incredibly bad and it makes you "WTF". What did I expect? This is a TV movie. They are usually not good. As it is. A timid wrinkle is a waste of time and a great time lag. Up, forget this probably the other thing that has passed. Well, maybe not the other is over. But within minutes. <br /> <br /> Temporary wrinkle: * / ****
