Wow ... what I can say ... IMDb says first that it is in the late 60s ... that means Carlito would be very close to the prison. He got out of 75 and said he was staying for 5 years. They used a lot of participants and a story that didn't even make sense. They bring back only one actor, Guzman, and he plays a completely different man. Why did it end with her and this Puerto Rica chick? Where's Gale? She said she loved her before. Where is Kleinfeld? He said he knew him forever ... You think he would have been there. And if that makes sense, where is Rocco and the black guy first? It was just stupid ... It's insulting Pacino and the first movie.
