This movie is really funny! I saw it at the age of 11 and even thought it was ridiculous! I recommend this movie only to children under 12 years old. I really don't care about it, but I think it answers the very good questions kids need to know, for example: 1) Does money buy happiness? 2) Should I go to (my parents) for things I think they disagree with? 3) Does money buy friendships? 4) Is there any money? 5) Shouldn't I tell my parents if someone is trying to hurt me? These are very unrealistic situations, but I think if parents discuss these issues with their children, maybe they should also watch this video to show / scare their children so that the lies can hurt you.
