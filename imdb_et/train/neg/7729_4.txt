An excellent television mini-series that has completely destroyed a 45-year-old woman who was desperate to go as a 16-year event! No exaggeration - this is the actual age of AC Macu's feature films when the film opens just before the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor. This TV mini series is really the most classic example of the title of this post and the one I refer to when the topic appears. <br /> <br /> This makes it completely unobtrusive, despite being one of the Best Filmed World War II "global" drama TV has ever produced. If you have a stomach - or a good ability to move - you may be able to enjoy Robert Mitchum's recent performance. <br /> <br /> I am stunned with some comments that refer to a love story (pun intended). Did they watch the movie? Or they are aging generations who no longer stop me with their "selective memories" and "selective vision". I'm Boomer myself, so don't think you're a cubic young punk. 45 AFTER STARTING 45. Get used to it. Deal with it. Age gently exhausts. <br /> <br /> The winds of war might have been ... so good. How much more would we talk about this mini-series today, about 25 years later, if ACTUAL's activities were placed in this important and critical role? Nowadays, with the constant haggard of the old-fashioned confusion, it cancels most of the wonderful aspects of the wind in the war.
