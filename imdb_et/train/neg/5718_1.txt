There was no characterization in this film and it really shows how much this talented cage, who drove it, must learn its craft. All of her characters in this movie were so unlikely and I got less care. The best point of this movie was the final credits and the hour-long shower after I felt that I was so damn that I was wasting money on this stinking load. Hey genius .... triplets and yakuza are from two different places, learning something about Asian culture. The dog's scene felt so loose and useless in this. This DVD is not useful because I love my new roll. <br /> <br /> So kids don't waste their money on buying this mess.
