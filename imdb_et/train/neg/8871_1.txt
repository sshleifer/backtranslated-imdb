I can see 200 films a year in theaters and at home, and I can say for sure that this movie is by far the worst thing I saw this year (if ever, but I have not really seen Delta's knights) yet). This movie is just a bad joke about a bad joke aimed at a 13-year-old and because I was happy to see it on a bus trip that I couldn't go out. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip one of the rental cars. Four dollars could be better spent on every movie by numbers produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
