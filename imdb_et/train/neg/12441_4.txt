Some things have to be explained. Mark Ferris's picture is not Mark Ferris, who celebrated this film. I know that because he was my father. Please remove this image. Mark Ferris was also a writer, at least one of them. I've tried to watch this movie again or see it. It has been for years and if someone can guide me towards copying, it would be nice. The film was not so bad and tried to compare it with today's Star Wars and other high tech sci fi worlds. When you look at it, just enjoy it with the freshness and humor it has. Lighten your movie snobs and enjoy less creative and innovative movies.
