Phil Alien is one of those peculiar movies where humor is based on everything than the actual punchline. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, it was very strange and pretty funny, but as the movie progressed, no fun or strange fun. <br /> <br /> This small budget movie (which is never a problem in itself) had some pretty interesting signs, but I just lost interest. <br /> <br /> I imagine that this movie will turn to the stoner currently participating. <br /> <br /> For something similar, but better try "Brother from another planet"
