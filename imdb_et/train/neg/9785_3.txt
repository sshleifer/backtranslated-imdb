This movie, which is special after school, is not so bad, and that is the problem. Nothing will happen. You feel like in a class. The guy teaches a number of young underdogs how to be good color ball players. We don't see these sub-letters badly as a good player trains them. They all suddenly become good players in meditation. There are also too many symbols and no character is developed. Too much time is spent on the main character and his sexy sister and not on some other child. It might have been a "bad news" (originally) because all the boys had a girl in the team, but they didn't know the movie at all. It does not feel any sense and leaves your bones a dull pain after watching it, it is not fun to poop, not a fun look, and it's just that ... there. Easy. Bored. Something you would look at before school before your evening. As boring as the day is long and it's been a long and long day watching this movie.
