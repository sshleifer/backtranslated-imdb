I rented Lensman's duplicate English version, hoping that because it comes from well-known novels, it would have some substance. Although there were references to the content in the film, it did not usually rise to the child's comic book. Maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book or lost a lot of the duplicated version. Or maybe the original sources were light. But for some reason there wasn't much. <br /> <br /> I noticed many details that were derived, sloppy, poorly dramatized, or otherwise inadequate. Some examples: The scenes that were opened were borrowed from the 2001 Stage Gun and the Star Wars Hyperpace. The robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized "R2-D2". <br /> <br /> It is going to try to rent its comic book Star Wars, but graciously (because humor doesn't work) comedy abandons and plays it seriously. In this sense, it is better than the Star Wars franchise, which started with a smart sense of humor, and eventually worsened Jar-Jari with annoying stupidity. <br /> <br /> Agricultural details probably showed someone who has never seen a farm. The harvester drove through the untapered center of the field, tried to silo the crop, instead of working from one side to the other and removing the silo from the already harvested lines or truck. Corn (corn) was thrown out of the cereal, but the agricultural land was pulled out like wheat. <br /> <br /> When it was time for Kim's father to treat his destiny, there was no dramatic weight on the scene. This could have been partly the fault of an actress in English, but the drawings did not have much weight either. Kim's reactions to this scene were similarly convincing. <br /> <br /> Similarly, when Henderson's name died, Chris showed very little reaction, though apparently they had to be close. (Henderson's death is not a spoiler, his name does not appear before his death scene.) He seems to forget him immediately. Someone has expressed more sympathy than he does. I think the voice actor in this case deserves most of the charges; Chris's drawings have at least a hint of feeling. <br /> <br /> On several occasions, a badger is unable to complete his orders. The villain leader often punishes these accidents with unfortunate deaths. I can't tell if it has been raised from Star Wars or if it comes from earlier - or Lensman's books. <br /> <br /> There is a scene where a spaceship bursts. If it falls to the ground, the ships will break. But so many pieces are falling off, so nothing should be left at the time of landing. <br /> <br /> Although Chris seems to be the most competent, harsh hero of space, there is a scene where he looks like an incompetent girl. Somebody who is tough enough to get so fast Henderson's death should at least be able to punish, "help, I have, and I can't get my gun!" Instead of just getting hit. <br /> <br /> The most personal character (almost at times) is D.J. Bill. He sounded like Wolfman Jack, D.J. American Graffiti. I do not know if he is so well expressed in the original language. <br /> <br /> Two movie explosions exploded. The explosions were impressive and seemed a lot of inspiration to Star Wars. However, for his credit, the cause of the explosion was completely different from the main weapon of the star of death. The dialogue had a good, interesting explanation of the cause. Many other explosions in the film seemed good, not just explosions on the planet. <br /> <br /> Some sound effects are very cheesy, as if borrowed from the late 1970s video game. Some pictures look like primitive video games, and some effects from Throne are also visible. On the other hand, sound effects are often quite decent, although they emphasize the sounding parts of the cheese. Art is also good, especially if it is often left out of the cheese-colored computer graphics. <br /> <br /> Finally there is a story. If the film tells a good story, it can get a lot of production shortages. But the plot here was quite light. A na√Øve boy is trying to help someone in a deadly spacecraft and acquires great power that he does not understand. He and his band, who are very virtuous companions, are fighting against a powerful, incredibly evil enemy. He makes friends, learns his special power, and grows into a young man. If he is persistent and strong enough, he can even fight the evil enemy. Details along the way can make such a story above a simple vision, but there is very little in this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's just a baby. But then, as older children seem to be the main target group, it may not be more.
