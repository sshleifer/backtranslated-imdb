Some nice landscapes, but the story itself - where the self-proclaimed Egyptian (Lesley-Anne Down) visits Egypt and in the most unusual ways of doing Egyptian things (such as shooting in the dark in tombs), handling old parchment, etc.) reveals the black market of war and somehow ( Within two days, not less!) The epicenter of the war jumping board becomes more sensible than any puzzles ever represented by Sphinx. Down is just terrible as a visiting British scientist (that he doesn't know anything about Egyptian culture in any way and even less is the guilt of writers about the antiquities, surely he is annoying because all the way out is his own fault) and the rest, including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella seem to be as confused as I was. In short, not what you would expect from Schaffner (Apeside Planet, Patton) and together. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at a ridiculously dated scene where Down rails against all male scientists, accusing them of being an academic, but under soft light, bathing in Hollywood. Besides, he spends the next hour's movie, which despises and harasses and runs any guy he can find. Wow, talk about your performative irony! <br /> <br /> * Note to potential Egyptologists: Take one or two Arabic languages ​​for graduate studies. It will help in the long run ...
