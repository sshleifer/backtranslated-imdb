I haven't seen it, and I'm not going to see this movie or any other Lindsay ...... see if & nbsp; until "poor little rich girl" stretches her life for 2 years, starting with her most recent arrest in July 2007. Actually, I don't know anyone who's gone to see all Lindsay's recent films. I rather imagine that 2007 will be a high water mark for his film making career, until he clears his act. All recently published ads have prevented his filmmaking career if he has any further efforts to make more films. <br /> <br /> Until then, film producers have been actively looking for Lindsay in their upcoming products. Now Lindsay is likely to go to auditions and compete for every role. His reputation is now "poison" and quite likely it would have a negative effect on ticket sales in any movie he has. <br /> <br /> Sooooo .... now Lindsay needs to "do not want" ..... can she handle it? <br /> <br /> I don't know if even Jay Leno wants to bring Lindsay back to his TV show? <br /> <br All of the above are just my OPINIONS. I have no inside information.
