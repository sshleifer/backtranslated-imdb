The film opens with beautiful ladies, a split white dress that runs through the stereotypical city of Eastern Europe. we know that he will be followed because he is looking for him. and soon we will see that he is hidden by a mysterious man in a black trench coat. then we understand that a man is actually a vampire and he is after him. but see that his reflection in the store window ??? not just his identical vampire! but unfortunately they both get it. <br /> <br /> After this brilliant and amazingly fun return to the 60's and 70's old ghost films (the prizes are twins listed as the evil twin, which of course is the name of the final mark of the hammer carnitine trilogy), the plot is dying a lot. <br /> <br /> What little plot is associated with drakula (who comfortably changes his appearance every time he is born, so the producer does not do it) t himself to be drakula), who come to grumble, which students understand that he is undead and thinking .... wow what a chance, maybe i just ignore all those movies that say vampire blood drinking will take you to a vampire and use vampire blood to find our jerk for treating a friend's illness. probably this is a bug and everyone gets a vampire. <br /> <br /> New concept but badly repels badly. The film creates great situations and refuses to do anything about them. <br /> <br /> For example, med students try to bring draci back to life by placing him in a full bath with lonely hanging in the country. mansion. The house itself is scary enough to be the focal point of the film, but are we there? no, because they decide to take a vampire to an abandoned pool. sigh. This movie has a real problem with "respects", as I mentioned before the opening stage is left out of the hammer, and this house scene would have been ideal for a hammer-like movie, but the movie swiftly moves and changes to a medical horror Another problem is that they introduce it Many signs that almost every one of them is almost impossible. There are students and a wheelchair-associated professor-type "friend" whose pupils are: arrogant, boring, money hungry and stupid. how are they astonishing at med school when the med school did not need to fill their muscle-binding carcass / big breast quota. and then there are vampire men who remain mysterious through the film. Hey, I can respect it, but it would be nice if they didn't set it like a movie about him. then you have random priests, policemen and types of science. so many people are introduced and then forgotten quickly until they need this person to save the day or jump into cheap intimidation so that it quickly becomes annoying. <br /> <br /> It's basically a lazy movie. some real fears, but some predictable jumps. Designed for them is so complicated that it is fun. blood filled bath. it is so obvious that drac goes out of dark blood. and yet we have to wait too long to escape the inevitable jump of fear. after that, he kills one dumber and bigger breast students. we all know he will be one undead. but what do others do? bury him in a low tomb near the house. sigh that you know who jumps to you when the police appear at the house .......... <br /> <br /> Well. <br /> <br /> Maybe somebody gives a hint that it's impossible to make a scary vampire movie and just go into the atmosphere, and then we'll get to the whole movie that's as good as the opening scene. <br /> <br />
