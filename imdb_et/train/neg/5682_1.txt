This movie is incredibly ridiculous. I love horror movies, but that's the worst I've ever seen. I am a big gore fan but most of this movie's deaths are not shown. It already shows us the corpses, and the only death scenes they actually show in this movie are terrible. Graphics are so obviously fake. The actors are also terrible. None of them have a real emotion. Not only did I waste my time watching this film, but I kept myself on the actual film material that the animals were beaten at the beginning. If I could rate it -10, I would like to. F * ck this movie. It's a mess. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it.
