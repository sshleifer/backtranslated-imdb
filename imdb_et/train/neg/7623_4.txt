This small exhibition is obviously an original series of tiny prequel / spin off. <br /> <br /> This show is complete compared to the live series. The exhibition of living activity had intelligent jokes and stories. While the animated series is basically a tinted bittersweet version of younger viewers digest, but I think maybe kids detest this mess. <br /> <br /> The story of every episode is basically just Sabrina's some stupid and pointless dillemma and he uses magic to fix it. This is basically the idea of ​​every episode. The most bizarre episode was when Sabrina uses magic to become Gem and Gem to become Sabrina. So Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes the catch to become his slave. This then leads to a strange but rather interesting scene where Gem says "just adore me now" and harvey down his arms and knees and start kissing his feet like God. (That's quite right, because he's under control of his mind). However, this stupid spin-off is not worth the time or effort.
