Film from the Harlem Renaissance and especially from one author. This contradicts today's story of a young, homosexual black artist. <br /> <br /> If this sounds vague, it's because the movie itself is. It is well managed, fairly well written and (mostly) well-functioning. Past scenes are also photographed in frantic black and white. This is also one of the few films that deal with gay men who do not leave sex away from scenes (not explicit and not frontal). I still hated it mostly. <br /> <br /> The film is inclined all over the place, full of improbable characters (including the main protagonist) and (it's a killer) moving through the action. I thought three times that I left the theater because I was so bored. But the director was there so I stayed. <br /> <br /> After his speaker shows that it was a work of love and took 6 years. I really want to get more of it (there are very few movies that honestly deal with black blacks), but I can't do that. If you are not very interested in the Harlem Renaissance, there is no reason to see it.
