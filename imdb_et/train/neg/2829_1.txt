Worst, and full of people who really need to know better (six oscars are cast between them). It is set in 'modern' Africa (it was done in 1979) and is linked to the slave trade. It has been terribly written and acted (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and William Holden are getting low in this career) and they have no thrill that is not needed for moral attention. It is also ridiculously drawn. You do not believe for a moment that a character is behaving in the way they do. Richard Fleischer directs, but you get the impression that it was on the phone. It's as bad as it gets.
