Margaret Landon's Anna and King Siam's frustrated musical version, filmed in 1946 with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, has been fired by Deborah Kerr as a widower and mother traveling from England to Miami in 1862 to take on the guidance of many of the king's children - And maybe teach the royal one or two things! Stagy's picture starts well but loses energy and focus quickly. Yul Brynner, who plays the victory of his performance as a king, is a leading presence, but it is used - as a summary story - as a buffalo. Kerr keeps his cool dignity and fares better, despite Marni Nixon's song. Maybe Brynner has already killed this part, so he didn't have anything except the bomb to translate the screen. The other side, where Anna and Mops directed the "Uncle Tom's Cabin" musical version, is quite ridiculous, and Rodger and Hammerstein's songs are mostly wild. Brynner won the Best Actress Oscar, but it is a weak Kerr who holds this silver over water. Long term, hard and "old-fashioned" concept in the worst sense. ** from ****
