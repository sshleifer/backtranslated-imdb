The "social commentary" on racism and prison conditions is said to be in the late 1970s, a "nightmare" filled with bad southern stereotypes that are hidden with accents. Not only would this be offensive to the sensitivity of most of the Americans in the South, but the thin work that is just a thin hidden "babe in prison", especially in its uncut original version. However, the action is generally above average and especially late Chuck Connors is doing a good job of hating the viewers - although he sees it somewhat uncomfortable in many scenes. Later, for Robert Reed, who also appears as a small journalist, there is also the pace of change and Tina Louise (formerly Ginger of Gilligan Island) who made a rather incredible sadistic prison guard.
