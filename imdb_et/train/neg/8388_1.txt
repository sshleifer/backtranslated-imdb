This is a heart warming hope. I hope you never have to endure this terribly. * Cough * Razzie Award * Cough * <br /> <br /> I didn't like this movie because it was awkward, predictable, and ugly. Looking at it, I felt like I was in a psychology experiment to determine how low the film standards will be before people complained. When I asked for the money back at the end of the movie, I was informed that because I looked at the whole thing, "I was not entitled to compensation". The Assistant Manager said several people had already complained and received refunds. <br /> <br /> Movie summary is quite simple. The dwarf thief steals the diamond and represents the rescue of the police for the child. However, under this smart sketch, there is a repertoire of original, fresh and fun sketches. Or not. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself the following: Do you want to see pans hit people? Do you like joking jokes? Do you want to see medieval people who are child victims threatened by a tank thermometer? Do you like tired race jokes? Do you think children say "goo goo goo goo gaa gaa"? If you answer yes to any of the above questions, this movie is definitely for you. Although in some places this is the worst film of the 'decade', it is probably a film or two that is worse ... somewhere. I can't be sure. I gave this movie 2 stars because we all know that reviewing with just one star refers to the reviewer's half-life and then doesn't take the review seriously. <br /> <br /> This subconscious comedy is for less intelligent audiences and I can't recommend it to anyone with good conscience. Save money on something funny. <br /> <br /> Respect
