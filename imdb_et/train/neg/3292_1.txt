There is a list of good points and bad points for this review. I'll start with bad points. <br /> <br /> Bad points: selection options (especially Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg), poorly selected story, story, idea of ​​setting a movie today, direction, editing, soundtrack and above all the idea of ​​making a feature film out of the TV series that wasn't such a good start is popular despite its popularity. <br /> <br /> Good points: Jessica Simpson in the red bikini ............ that's it! <br /> <br /> Can be done in the Scene where Jessica Simpson like Daisy Duke pulls her way to Michael Weston's Enos and asks, "Enos, where is Boss Hogg and Roscoe?" would have asked the same well: "Enos, is this a good movie?", red bikini would have said "yes" in his judgment, though in his right sense he would have said, "No, not really." when he looked at the bikini, he could have done it harshly, and even that wouldn't have saved this terrible filmmaking.
