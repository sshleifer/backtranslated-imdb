A female vampire kills young women and colors with her blood. He has an assistant who doesn't want to be a vampire, so he has to do what he orders or gets blood for a mammal. After some killing, the assistant regrets and falls in love with the homeless girl. <br /> <br /> What can I say about this movie? That pace is too slow for him to have some strange sound effects (never had an amazing sound) and an atmosphere (the new jazz came here) and the lights don't seem to be included. It looks like this is an "auteur" horror movie with all independence. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely stupid and as you think it is a female vampire who explains how to kill her even if she doesn't do it; Of course, crosses, light, garlic and sticks don't work. <br /> <br /> It's not even a funny tough movie. Maybe some friends and many beers can't have funny things (frankly, it's fun for 10-15 minutes at the end of the movie). Do not deceive the Troma sticker, this is one bad film they present.
