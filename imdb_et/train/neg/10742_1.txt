I tried to sit through this bomb not long ago. What a disaster. was scary. There were some totally pathetic scenes that fell into the lead. did not properly talk to Hitchcock's original "Lifeboat" modern recycling. I think Hictcock is starting to think around his grave just for that thought. movie.it has some semi-big names, but they don't tighten their characters. But, you know, to be fair, no one was really guilty. I mean, I'm pretty sure the script blew the first explosion. It is possible for LOL.it to improve as it goes by. But for me, I'm not ready to spend at least three days to find out. If you have at least a three-day weekend on the horizon, avoid this haiser / 1/10
