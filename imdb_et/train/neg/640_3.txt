Chilly, an alienating adaptation of Rebecca West's book, an army captain who came back during World War II when his memory is damaged (now there is an original idea!). He seems to remember the old flame, Glenda Jackson, but not the current wife Julie Christie, which should be enough to create emotional sparks. This extremely well-cast bile combines leading man Alan Bates with director Alan Bridges and co-organizers Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret and Ian Holm, but the burners are all low. There are a handful of good scenes (especially when Jackson is on the screen), but Bridges' pace is probably not slow and the dazzling color of the movie is inspiring. On a long shelf, this "soldier" is best forgotten. * 1/2 from ****
