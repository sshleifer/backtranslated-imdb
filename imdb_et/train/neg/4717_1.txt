And how this production amazed me. The main character is an unpleasant exhibition that is not the least funny. I can't tolerate that character at all. He's a stupid ass with nothing to show. <br /> <br /> This is the worst comic that has been on the surface for the last ten years, joking. The story lines are so badly written and executed. The jokes are just as bad as the lives of Disney Sweet Zack and Cody. I couldn't show more, it's terrible and should be canceled. Even the theme song is bad. The title is even worse. <br /> <br /> It's like an exhibition written by a couple of 15 years old, who characterize their character and think they are hot when they are really just arrogant and lack creativity and humor. <br /> <br /> Johnny Test, go far and fast!
