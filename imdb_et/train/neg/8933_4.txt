Last night, I was surprised that Fox spent so much money on him and got so little back in his investments. This is a disaster that must be considered credible. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the first morning of Raquel Welch's filming off his fireplace shook out to prepare the Academy Award. it certainly wins bold original text. Sorry. It's not like it happened. <br /> <br /> The set's attack was printed in detail by Rex Reed and helped the film achieve a reputation before it was released. When it finally released, there was no ordinary three-round fame. When I remember correctly, in Houston, I opened a car and neighborhood theater and never played any major places. <br /> <br /> To a large extent, I have accused director Michael Sarne of being warm (not all that is good) at JOANNA, a film about young musicians swinging in London. <br /> <br /> When I remember correctly, Fox finished his firing and cutting the film best. That's why the scenes play in no particular order and the characters appear and disappear. The impressive supporting cast (Kathleen Freeman, Jim Backus, John Carradine, Andy Devine, etc.) is wasted without doing anything. <br /> <br /> To extend this feature to feature lengths, Fox movies have numerous clips with stars such as Carmen Miranda (from the amazing material THE GANG ALL HERE) and Laurel and Hardy, who have never dreamed of playing on X's rated movie . <br /> <br /> The X rating is due to a random language that contains numerous sexual perversions; however, no characters seem to be fun. Perhaps someone who was involved in the film had broken the sensitivity of puritan and thought that if they could make these things uncertain, they were not bad to use. <br /> <br /> It was one of the pictures of young people that almost went bankrupt in the 1970s. One writer joked that the EASY RIDER (which was made to replace the pocket) was the most expensive film ever made, because so many movies followed, tried and failed to duplicate their success in the worst way. Sixtyish, once honored directors like Stanley Kramer and Otto Preminger did movies like RPM and SKIDOO trying to attract a young audience. White leaders and writers tried to create films to attract the black audience. These films are locked somewhere in the vault and two names and many others of this genre have never been, as I know best, through home video or cable. They are the deep dark secrets of the studio. <br /> <br /> The performance of Raquel Welch is very good. With the right direction and script, she played with this type of sassy women, Rosiland Russel and Barbara Stanwyck, who specialize. She looks good and has awesome costumes. Mae West is the busiest seventy actor I've ever seen. On the one hand, it is heartbreaking to look at his efforts to defeat his glory from past years, but I'm sure he needs money. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a big budget for this age of X-rated movies, check out the HIGH VILLA (including Fox) because it doesn't take you seriously. It's crazy kids playing with devices in a big studio. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is trying to say something. There was no one who wanted to listen.
