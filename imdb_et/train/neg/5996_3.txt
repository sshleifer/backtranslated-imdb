Thunderbirds (2004) <br /> <br /> Director: Jonathan Frakes <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbet <br /> <br /> 5 ? 2? 1! Thunderbirds is GO! <br /> <br /> So began Thunderbirds, my childhood favorite. When I heard they were going to make a Thunderbirds movie, I was ecstatic. I couldn't wait to see how Thunderbird saved 2 people while Thunderbird 4 dives deep, you get the idea. I just couldn't wait. Then came August 2004 when the movie was finally released. Critics tried it, but I still wanted to go. After all, as long as the heart was in the same place, it was important to me. So I sat in the theater, the only teenager in the 50's, everyone else was over thirty and less than ten. Most likely, the most uncomfortable theater experience I've ever had? <br /> <br /> The film (for prequel) focuses on Alana Tracy (Brady Corbet), the youngest of the Tracy family. He spends his days wishing he can save people like his rest of the family, but he is too young. One day he finally gets his chance when The Hood (Ben Kingsley) catches the rest of his family on Thunderbird 5 (space station). That means he has to have Hood's henchmen and they have to save their family in time before Hood can steal all the money from the Bank of England. <br /> <br /> Trust me, this plot sounds like a normal Thunderbirds episode reading it on paper. When it is put on the film, what confusion is in our hands. First of all, the film was meant for children like the original show. However, Gerry Anderson treated us as adults and gave us plots that were quite advanced for children's programming. On the other hand, it slips under the plot because it tries to embrace the Spy Kids franchise. The final product is a film that tries to turn to the Thunderbirds series and kids fans, but they're both completely missing. Lame jokes, cartoonish sounds, and fools of antics that no one really finds fun is all this movie, and I'm sure Jonathan Frakes wants him to never have run it. <br /> <br /> All, everyone gave a definite result, given the script that they are all given. Ben Kingsley was extraordinary as Hood playing very well. My only complaint about the character is The Hood's minions, who have been reduced from the old Looney Tunes cartoons, worshiping as amazingly enough as the children can easily use them. <br /> <br /> What's strange about this movie is that when I watched the movie, I had fun. But when the lights went, I realized that the movie was pretty bad, I was 8 dollars lighter and two hours of my time. Innocent pleasure? Maybe. However, Thunderbirds is an unforgettable mess. Instead of a big "go" I have to recommend that you stay away from this movie. If the rest of the film could have been the same for ten minutes, it would have been an incredible movie worthy of Thunderbirds. However, we get a movie that only hard Thunderbirds fans (if you want to watch your childhood split) or extremely boring should worry. <br /> <br /> My rating for Thunderbirds is 1 Â½ stars.
