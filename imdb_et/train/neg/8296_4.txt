Basically, the unfaithful dental spouse team and their 3 daughters are involved. The assumption is interesting, the actor is good and the music, though sometimes steep and the direction, is pretty cool. <br /> <br /> The problem is the plot. The man's dentist falls off his wife's back before the show (he has a small role) and then walks back to give him something but sees him with another man. The rest of the film deals with his episode, his visual hallucinations and macho alter-ego (his former patient Denis Leary) and his fear for his wife that he shouldn't "do anything." "I won't tell you the end, but let me tell you that the movie goes somewhere and the end is like a sputtering whim. The motifs of the characters are missing: why is he deceiving him? He's a dentist, decent look, good father. The film doesn't say. Do not wait for the answers, why he wants to keep the marriage nevertheless Who knows what purpose all the children vomit? Where is this movie going good? Campbell Scot and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as comic relief) are wasting this funny nonsense that don't know if he wants to be an American beauty or a family film.
