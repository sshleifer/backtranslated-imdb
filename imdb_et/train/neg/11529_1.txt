Yes, unfortunately I came to this DVD DVD and found it was incredibly terrible. <br /> <br /> First, the characters suck. I mean, come on, if any of the orange hats, who calls himself orange Sherbert, is the best creative idea that these men could characterize, they should definitely not be in the cinematic scene. Bad "costumes", bad "interviews", and basically, there is no "wrestler" on this whole disc that has no charisma. idiots gently and playfully bouncing on a trampoline. They also try to get together all the time, so the experience seems like a toddler than a "wrestling game". <br /> <br /> The Splatter Rampage wrestling is basically a weak Backyard Wrestling clone. Instead of blood, weapons, chaos and WRESTLING, we get a trampoline, strangers, TERRIBLE sound, and some guys called Orange Sherbert. It's terrible.
