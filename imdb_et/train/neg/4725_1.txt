A great opportunity and an Indy director to make an interesting movie from a rock musician on the edge of a start-up. It could have been a decent film if it had dealt with the traumatic past of John Livien and how he tortured his psyche. Instead, it is ridiculous to try to identify John Livien's life with John Lennon. John Livien's mother of suicida was John Lennon and he wanted him to be as powerful and fruitful as Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on John Lennon's musical brilliance and his great ability to learn for himself, to learn something about his life, it showed Lennon's legacy confused, a drug-dependent soul who should look at a man instead of God. I'm a big fan of John Lennon, and this movie reminded me of another "crazy" man confirmed by Lennon, Lennon's killer, Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man brutally murdered by someone else who had a Lennon identity crisis. Do we have to remember this? John Lennon gave the world so much with his music and honesty, and I was rejected to see another disturbed person who is the main character of Lennon's obscene film, and did not show his beautiful contributions to the world. Yoko Ono was happy to honor John Lennon's memory by making a memorial to Central Park to give his fans the opportunity to pay their respects and remember John. Instead, the director of this movie chose the site to kill the killer. I found it in both disturbing and disrespectful Lennon's memory. He was a peaceful man who died of brutal deathlessness, and such violence near that site seemed to be a recurring fear for every Lennon fan. It completely destroyed the movie for me. It could have been a decent film, but it left me a delicious taste of mouth. Let John Lennon and his family be happy and not recall his irresponsible movie about his malicious murder.
