This film, the correction, the thing, this devilish devil from the holes burning hell should have been killed before he even left the writer's head. I didn't get enough adjectives to describe this movie. But let's try anyway. Terrible, bad, nausea, tasteless, nonsense, vomiting inducing, intestinal cancer, bad, ugly, nasty, dirty, English isn't just enough words! The "plot" includes a serum killer who becomes a snowman. Don't ask how, not important. The killer snowman kills people. How can you ask if a snowman can kill anyone? In tasty ways that make your eyes remove only if you don't have to endure this styrofoam snowier. So you want to fill your ears with hot wax so you don't have to endure your snowballs anymore. Don't look at this movie! Destroy this sight! You don't see it for your soul!
