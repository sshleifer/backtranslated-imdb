This is one of those films that apparently tried to drive the wave of martial arts. Like Billy Jack. However, although Billy Jack had one remarkable martial arts scene, there is nothing in it, unless you think that a gentleman's attack and toughening are such. We introduce the character described as learning Jews in the Navy. I was in the navy, and although they're pretty sure in the box, I don't really remember Judo's emphasis. As a result, the antagonist James Macarthur refers to Judo when he excuses why he, the national champions wrestler, was so easily defeated. Lame.
