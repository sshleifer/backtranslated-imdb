How can you say the horror movie is terrible? if you can't laugh of course! The plot is well covered by other reviewers, so I just add a few things to the fun. <br /> <br /> Some reviews have placed the location in South America, others in Africa, I thought it was on a random island in the Pacific. Where exactly this happens, there seems to be a mystery. The Kannibal tribe corresponds to a couple of black women, black men, and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa who drums a drum ... a devil God is a big black man with a terrible case of pink eyes. > <br /> One of the "little" moments of a movie is "Pablito" finds a partner hanging on a tree that is considered an orange substance, which I assume is blood. (this is actually funny) and then his partner's head falls to the ground and "Pablito" strikes it a bit for what I expect to "breed" and his eyes really move ... <br /> <br But, of course, then "freak" disappeared when you realize that your eyes are moving because the movie is just bad ... <br /> <br /> I wasn't laughing like that, and I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends on Sunday afternoon and you have nothing to do. .. grab a beer box and start watching this movie. If you are looking for a real horror or gore movie, though ... don't worry.
