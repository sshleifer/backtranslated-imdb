This film, though not entirely bad, should have been filmed where the real events took place. On June 3, 1980, Grand Island, Nebraska devastated at least seven tornadoes. Grand Island is located in a nearly three-storey apartment building on the Platte River Valley in Hall County. The filmmakers filmed in Ontario's wooded mountains and brought the whole event to a null city of Blainsworth. The people of Grand Island were horribly overwhelmed by this terrible night to forget about the bad film.
