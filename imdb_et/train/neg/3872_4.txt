The movie can never be viewed. And to say this directly, he has nothing to show except perhaps the sub-sexy Alicia Silverstone's nervous non-sexy character that exposes quite sexy dresses. The story is very easy to follow or there is nothing to follow - you can see both ways. There is no relationship, little action, impressive dialogue, unsatisfactory sensuality, same boredom and very good deeds. Kevin Dillon is totally worthless. Silverstone ... well, I didn't focus too much on my actions, I admit. But as I said earlier, if someone does nothing but watch the movie, it doesn't seem so bad. 4/10
