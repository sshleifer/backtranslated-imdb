When I first saw the view, the first episodes seemed promising. Bill Compton introduced himself as a stereotyped "mysterious" vampire and Sookie presented himself as an independent woman. The show, however, went down and the interesting characters were as fun as the cardboard box. <br /> <br /> When the story progresses, the main characters lose their original personalities with their ability to act. According to Episode 5, Bill's wrinkles are so low that his face just consists of a forehead. Sookie, or rather an actor, is still dead as his vampire player. All of these tragic events surround her and she only reacts to how she loses her innocence. Personally, I think they made the main characters at each other too early in the show. The way they teased each other was something that I tried and could easily play. As soon as Sookie loses, she shrinks like a whole ditz, just thinking about the size of Bill's libido and her additive. Bill disappears his debonair attitude and well, he just goes stupid. His actions have never been explained unless he does it for Sookie. Why? Their love for each other is never in love. So far it seems to be the sex that is the core of these relationships. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, vampires are usually equal to sex, but come on. Every five seconds, I see some humping. It wasn't such a big surprise, because HBO always tries to go through the soft core of porn as a decent TV show. Bill opens up from dirt and got it with Sookie just for no reason what? I laughed so hard that I almost caught myself. <br /> <br /> The plot is just a stream of consciousness. Characters never go into detail. All events that happen will usually be left unexplained. The only thing that is constant is sex. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say is that I have smaller characters. Tara and her drunk mother are much more interesting than the main characters. The only reason I keep looking at the exhibition is the development of small characters. <br /> <br /> minus gender and main characters that show much more useful.
