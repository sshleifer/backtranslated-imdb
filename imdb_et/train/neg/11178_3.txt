First, I have to admit that it's not a good movie. And I would never have seen this movie if Pacino wasn't. <br /> <br /> The film has about 24 hours of publicist. And he is superfluous, dizzy, sick and sometimes regrettable. like a character at all.It is really boring, after 20 minutes you can sleep.And I do not understand why Pacino wanted to be part of this terrible film.Just money or what? <br /> <br /> Since I'm an avid fan of Pacino, I bought this 2002 film "People I Know". If you haven't bought it yet, don't even think, it's just a waste of time.
