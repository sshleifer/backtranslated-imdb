There are no spoilers here, but I've been a fan because Waking the Dead started, but the last series, of which only 3 have been so far, is terrible. The stories are not similar to the original idea of ​​the series. I found them in the last 3 series of jaws that fell ridiculously. As a BBC licensee, I called BBC complaints after the exhibition to pass on my disappointment. I am surprised that Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone caliber actors did not hold the story. These actors have been in these characters for 8 seasons, but they see they have lost the whole direction. It's a good job, it's the last series or the next series can start with a team that is investigating Santa's death! <br /> <br /> Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
