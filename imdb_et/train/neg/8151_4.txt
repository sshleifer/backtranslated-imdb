Leslie Sands' stylish "Deadlock" game becomes a bad choice for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, just after their "All About Eve" success. After the death of her husband, her husband will visit his best friend, who will go out as a spouse when others stop at the house. Irving Rapper, one of Bette's best directors of his peak years, is unfortunately unable to raise the ridiculous material that Davis is curious and restrained to the outrageous finals (where he luckily pulls out all the stops). Production and support are strictly at the second level; only for Bette Davis graduates. * 1/2 from ****
