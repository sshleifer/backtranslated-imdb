I love Jamie Foxx. <br /> <br /> And I enjoy 99% of all the movies you see. <br /> <br /> And I walked out of it. <br /> <br /> Now, I admit he could have had something to do with two medieval white women at the back of the theater who laughed at every little thing ("Oh, Jamie knocks! HEE HEE HEE!"). it was just so incredibly annoying. There can't be a permanent camera, and from the usual point of view the camera didn't come ... everything had to be face, loud and annoying. <br /> <br /> A bad guy was trying to be smooth and like Malkovich, but now it's just old and tired. He didn't bring anything new or interesting. Of all the characters, too many lines you came up with, too many of you have heard and too many "harsh men" lines ... and I don't mind this thing, really, as long as there is a bit of originality. In fact, almost all of the supporting cast just suck. <br /> <br /> I love Jamie Foxx and I think she's really funny and I thought she was funny in this movie ... but not funny enough I can handle everything else. <br /> <br /> This movie needed less shooting, less annoying camera shots, more emotions, more feelings and more Jamie Foxx. I gave him 2.
