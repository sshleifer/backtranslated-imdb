Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not offer the right chemistry here in this 1945 film. <br /> <br /> Here is a good story that the axis is trying to use coal for a future war. Unfortunately, this story is not emphasized. Instead, we're supposed to be lofty with Boyer. By the way, Bacall is both British and Vladimir Putin. <br /> <br /> Actual actor wears a veteran Oscar winner Katina Paxinou. As well as his memorable Pilar with the 1943 Oscar winner, "Turns to the Bell Bell Tolls," Paxinou plays the Spanish Revolutionary again, but this time he is a spy of double crossing the pro-Franco group. He's a pretty cruel character here, especially when he throws a 14-year-old child out of the window. He believed Boyer had given the child important material to hide.
