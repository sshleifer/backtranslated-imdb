This film was slow but annoying and often took place on the hay land. The character of Redgrave was unpleasant, because of the 60 women who were trying to compete with Thurman 20, something about Fox's character's love (why it's outside of me). The title of the movie should have been "Low people on the lake". The actors played as they were in the sample. An exciting start to the end. I can't believe it's on this website like comedy!
