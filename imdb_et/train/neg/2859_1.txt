It was done in 2007 and CG is bad for the film in 1998. In one part of the movie, there is a dinosaur stop motion that really looks good, but it makes CG stuff extremely amateur work even worse. <br /> <br /> Writing, acting, leadership and everything else in this movie is just terrible. It is so bad, if not worse, than the island of Raptor and 100 million BC. Pure mess! Again, as with other films, the only frightening part of this movie is that it has actually been made and is currently being promoted on a sci-fi channel. <br /> <br /> I can still understand how they somehow get people who have some operational skills to act in these movies and then sometimes get them as terrible as everyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> For those who aren't sure, another poster is probably sarcastic in his review ... or he's one of the people who worked on this movie.
