Waiting for some IMDB comments, I was expecting a feature film - maybe a dramatic or foolish or simple or comic, but essentially an action film. <br /> <br /> Whatever it was I was looking at, it didn't feel like a movie. The story is simple and straightforward (although the prologue tries to make it difficult). Take three interest groups: 1) Government 2) Rebels 3) A group of murderers. <br /> <br /> Now separate the first (they will never appear in the movie). Then just let one assassin, the princess, get revenge for revenge. Add conscience to the insurgency for insurgency. And you have the ingredients. <br /> <br /> But they couldn't change this story or movie. Some of the occasional actions and the odd visual images of small budget sci-fi are that you are feeling embarrassed. The film does not know the film, but a weird, inconsistent, boring dream. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10
