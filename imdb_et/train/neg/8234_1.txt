The writers and producers of this little departure have fallen into new depths. Whether the writer's block was so badly placed, OR that the idea had dried up so much that they were forced to include a nasty scene where a young woman empties the van in the back seat, and then throws out the car's faeces (at least the value of the film, at least that is what the film was.) one other woman's urination, as well as a number of episodes of graphic vomiting, once it would have been enough ... we got it! It really takes the toilet to humor to another level! If the script and the action had been better, I could just have forgotten that I was watching a movie that was captured from a completely low-budget video, this was a rather original story with a smart (only) direction that we only had to take a look inside the trailer, so it seems much more real. We could never see any other locations like a shop or a field where several women disappeared, and it could have added a lot of tension. <br /> <br /> The script was terrible. d like: "I don't feel too well ... I want to go home" when one of the girls has been a psychopath; What has become a victim of rape by a screwdriver and seems to be a little undernourished. <br /> <br /> Action was devilish (except maniac). Did all the main 5 actors in this lesson act in the correspondence of a long postage! The sound was so bad that I had to watch the whole movie with subtitles. <br /> <br /> The director seemed like a simple job. It seems that the only direction he had to give was "Scream Girls". !
