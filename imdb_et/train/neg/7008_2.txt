Annie Potts is the only performance in this really boring movie. Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really upset that someone stole Corvette and his classmates became hot (most likely the most filmed car to be featured in the film). an evil genius who has stolen his pride and joy. <br /> <br /> I would have looked after it when it wasn't fun watching Annie Potty's very early game, and it's too bad for Hamill that she didn't take a couple of lessons from her. Danny Bonaduce is also silly.
