Spoiler !! I love Branagh, I love Helena Bonham-Carter, I loved them with "Mary Shelley in Frankenstead" - but that's - <br /> <br /> I understand the actor's desire to stretch to avoid a romantic stereotype. Well, they did, but really - the script that was drone, the Bonham-Carter clothes were stylish, and the occasionally accelerated "madcap" sequence could have been a Beatles movie or an old Rowan and Martin Laugh in the Year. <br /> <br /> I never got a point - other commentators say Branaghi's sign was a dreamer. I never knew it. He was a loser and not very bright and certainly not cute. It was just painful to look at how to hide the bank's robbery. Definitely not fun. <br /> <br /> Bonham-Carter's realistic (one prerequisites) as realistic speech was harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of Lancashire's accent "Full Monty". <br /> <br /> The poetic end, with him on a high hill with him, buried under his plane's monster, was too organized. Was there a choir of angels or just a soundtrack? <br /> <br /> Go back to the classic or something with your back and arch. Give it to PBS. <br /> <br />
