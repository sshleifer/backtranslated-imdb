I have to agree with the previous comment and with Mr Maltin on this issue. This is the second speed, an excessively cruel western ride that is trying to center on the central theme of the wild west, which is being thrown away and thrown away consistently. He wants to be a "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid" tradition, but it does not have the vividness and charm of the film. Andrew McLaglen's direction is sliding and the last 30 minutes is a real bot, with some incomprehensible strategies by heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Someone gives me a hollow when you explain to me why they've come down the hillside.) Rape was a rape scene for all the treatment and the woman's reaction wasn't necessarily right later. Coburn is much more unpleasant, because the half-breed escaped from conviction, but all his refugees are underdeveloped (they are like bowling blocks that have to be kicked off one by one when the story goes on). Michael Parks gives one of his typical funny, devastating, bumpy performances, but in that case it was appropriate because his modern style sheriff symbolizes the satisfaction that technological advancement can bring.
