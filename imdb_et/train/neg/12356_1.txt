Watching this movie was a waste of time. I was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie, but I resisted. I don't know what Ridley Scott foresaw, but I learned that women in the army are getting stupid and men. They learn to spit, offend and fight in the fight, and that is also a waste of time (in my opinion). And still, what the hell was that last scene in Lybias? Are they still fighting against Gadaf or is it easy for everyone to believe that Islamic people are always dangerous?
