One might think (as I did) that the film with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese should be at least decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have brought the most funny works of all time comedy. <br /> <br /> Well, obviously I was very wrong - this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It looks like my way of thinking how one joke after another can be so deeply uneven. It looked at me to look at those talented actors who are one of the most positive scripts I have failed. On the basis of the big names alone, I have been hoping for a long time during the movie, but it was not able to constantly provide some entertainment. <br /> <br /> Usually, with movies and with life, I try to get away from biased comments and generalizations. But it's hard not to let go of this movie. I can guess, on the one hand, maybe even two or three fingers, big Hollywood productions that left me more bitter. It's just one of the worst comedies. <br /> <br /> I tried to enjoy it - I really did. But the cities outside the city will eventually fail. If you really want time-consuming entertainment, just take your money and watch it when you wash it under the toilet. Just don't look at this movie.
