It's the most boring worthless mess I've been wasting for one hour of my life. All I can say is thanks to God, it was only an hour. More than half of this "movie" is from the original "Crimean Madness". At least I can see the highlighting of rare classical highlights, because for some realistic reason, my video store has only "criminal insane II" (as it was, "Crazy Fat Ethel II"). But the rest of this movie is one of the absolute worst filming of home video and backyard filming. Why is my video store, not the original? Why do such things actually come to video stores? Why do people rent it and do not burn a copy right now when they see their enormous horror? Why - AAUUGGHH - Why, God, Why? <br /> <br /> If you don't see the irritating fruits that eat in the exceptionally slow scene of the whole candy bar, or when the fruit hangs even slower in the staircase, or the character that grabs laterally (not ask) on the back, or the brain cells murder monologues poisoning the path of giving your wife and then complaining that all the tales have made their way to the cold or mentally-slowed eating fly soup, or just want to see Crazy Fat Ethel dancing bloody knife in the garden: Don't look at this movie. Repeat: Don't look at this movie. Don't rent this movie. If at all possible, do not walk around the shelf of a video store that has a copy of this movie setup. You can still save, but it's too late for me. . .
