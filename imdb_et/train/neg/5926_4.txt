Another weak entry for the third season: "Is it truth, not beauty?" Nevertheless, it has at least one keychain element that is very different and, as Spock would say, exciting. The main character is an alien who has to be put in a black box because his appearance is so terrible that it drives people crazy. This is too bad if the episode fails to fulfill this incredible assumption. Apparently, I thought it was a mistake to ever "show" to an alien, because his actual vision is not in any way close to such a terrifying structure; all we get is the usual Star Trek psychedelic light screen that is used for all kinds of things in different episodes, usually when a ship passes a magnetic form or something similar. In any case, Mr Spock can at least tolerate the appearance of Kollos and then only if Spock carries a special visor. (For a long time, I thought that the alien's name was "Carlos", which I found humorous, but I ground.) At one point Spock is obliged to think of Kollos so that the alien can try the company safe for the pilot. This has been achieved, but when Spock / Kollos returns to the end of his state of mind, Spock will forget his visor. Uh oh. He's going crazy, but in the end, Kollos' assistant, a psyched power blind woman, returns. It could have been a very bizarre, great episode, but it has been badly managed and is facing another season of the badly done series.
