It's the toughest and worst romantic comedy I've ever seen. Every scene is worthy and two leading actors - Corey and Danny are very annoying. Corey is very stupid and naive and should never have listened to Danny's false promises. Danny (Dean Paras) looks at her late thirties and a girl she is trying to sleep - Corey looks like she's still in college. there is nothing smooth about this movie. 1/10 Avoid
