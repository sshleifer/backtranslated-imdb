STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Ray (Ray Winstone) is a criminal past he has had problems with Alcohol and now forms a drug habit that makes him paranoid and tends to domestic violence to his wife, Valerie (Kathy Burke), who is trying to keep the family together but reaches more than diapers. Meanwhile, his mother Janet (Laila Morse) is aware of Ray's son, Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) and his growing drug habit that sends him out of the rail. The film follows these desperate signs when they live with their lives. <br /> <br /> It has been said that the British seem to be unhappy and it includes movies that offer entertainment in this way. Films like Nil by Mouth underline this. It is a story of a broken family that is being crushed by crime, poverty, chewing and drugs. Such Jeremy Kyle strikes as a three-course meal. Basically, it is also a story of suicidal men, three generations apart, and everyone copying another, a tear to the family, and women trying to keep it together, though they aren't strong enough. If you take a little bit of what it is from an off-set, you will see that it doesn't allow joyful viewing from the beginning and it certainly won't disappoint it. <br /> <br /> This is what all the presentations have said, and the head stars, Winstone and Burke, are giving great shows. We see Winstone losing his wife, beating his nonsense after some more coke-induced paranoia, breaking with him during a telephone conversation and triggering an arsenal of typical f and c words when he doesn't let him see his child. Similarly, at a private moment, we see that Burke loses his mood to the staircase, at night before being hit. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films where there is no plot to follow as this is the hopeless life that seems to be a hopeless life that continues from one day to another. This has been recognized by many (including Baftas!), But it was really too grim and grim for me. I have no right to criticize it for knowing what I knew about this off-set, but unfortunately I found it. **
