No One Sleeps is not a bad idea and the topic is quite interesting. But while watching this movie, we said loudly, "These filmmakers are struggling to find good places, lighting is good, makeup and hair are good ... why is this sound so bad?" Throughout the film, sound was echoy, garbled and much of the dialogue was incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> This movie has some good deeds and I think Jim Thalman is really a good actor. This story, along with some of the same actors, would have been worthy of a high budget movie. <br /> <br /> I can't just repeat enough - if you have a limited budget, devote more to good sound. Sound is as much a part of a movie as a picture and it's right. Could have earned 6.
