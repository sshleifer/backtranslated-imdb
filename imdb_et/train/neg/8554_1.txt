The film was probably made in 1930 and appeared in 1931. I think it was very difficult to talk about the film in the silent era. Nevertheless, it seems that this Zane Gray plot is very weak. Gary Cooper was probably just learning. The result is something that would not be acceptable under today's standards. Maybe by 1931. It is not acceptable for 2004. Some actors worked well. Unfortunately, the Indians are getting a short end for their early Westerners. They lived in the country long before the white man came, but, according to a twisted history, they had no right to defend themselves.
