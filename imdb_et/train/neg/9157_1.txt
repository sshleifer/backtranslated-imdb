Your first clue that this is a cheesy movie is that it is filmed, not a movie. The story is twisted and production is amazingly sloppy. Note, for example, that if the title pair is in a seemingly landing plane in Vermont, where they have gone to celebrate their relationship at a civil society ceremony, the plane will be shown to the surrounding airport with palm trees. Their ceremony - in Vermont - takes place in a tropical garden, including palms that don't last five minutes in the New England climate. In another flight, the introductory shot of the FedEx cargo aircraft shows. Probably they could only afford to travel in the wheel. As for the plot, this film assumes that you believe Victor, who is a dedicated Christian Arthur brother, threw himself out of his church when the congregation learns that his BROTHER is gay. Not only that, but the pastor finally determines with a man hit by Victor that Ben and Arthur would kill the "souls of their sins". Apparently no one in this church ever heard of the Ten Commandments. If there were no Jamie Brett Gabel, who is surprisingly effective with Arthur, this film would not have any redeeming qualities at all.
