Director Barbet Schroder (Fortune Reversal) thought I saw it a bit in my media class and I recognized the leading actor so I tried it despite criticism. Basically a cool child Richard Haywood (Half Nelson Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Bully's Michael Pitt) competed to murder a casual girl to challenge and see if they could get out of it without the police. The investigation of the murder is the killer detective Cassie 'The Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with a new partner, Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who is quite puzzled by the evidence found on the scene. non-binding hairs. The plan does not seem to be quite well running, because Cassiel and Sam are quite quick to suspect Richard or Justin, this is just a question of whether they can throw them away. Agnes Bruckner also plays as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D. Call Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Assistant. D.A. Al Swanson. I now see the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's rope, the murder of which is a challenge, but this film does so in a very stupid way, and not even reasonably good Bullock saves it from boring and predictable. Enough!
