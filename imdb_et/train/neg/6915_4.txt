This is one of the films I remember that I can do years before something happens. I don't think it's terrible, but it's not quite good either. Alec Baldwin was pretty good, but the plot is the best. Cast is pretty good at what they have given, but again you are just as good as the script. Baldwin led it, though I could have sworn he didn't manage it all, I thought I was reading somewhere, or a lot of reps were not bad, but he certainly has potential there. Although his "30 Rock" work is not just a genius and should keep him a little longer. I hope that the exhibition worships tenderly, but perhaps not so long. 9 years went by. So if you want to see a movie that you don't get much, but don't use it well, it's for you. I don't remember the last time the movie was packed for so long when it finally came out and it was DVD. It was nice to see that Alec Baldwin & Anthony Hopkins is back together because of their great, but not many people have seen "The Edge". Now pick up this great movie for some real entertainment.
