Ugh! Where to Start ... First, Campbell Scott becomes a non-stop angst for a real time after a while (in a very short time) when he internalizes his detention, curiosity and anger. Only we don't care! The characters given by the writer and the director are completely irrelevant and there is the key. They have not given us anything to take care of when they are adulterous and whether they are still in love with each other. When Scott quietly tells his wife, "I can kill you before my three daughters at your dinner table, after her selfishly bad timing shock, I almost wanted her to have been - and then I did the same thing secretly, Denis Leary's appearance before the looney bin was removed." It is a waste of time and perhaps just resources.
