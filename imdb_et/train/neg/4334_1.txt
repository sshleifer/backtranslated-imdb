This film had the potential and I was ready to try it, but there are so many timing problems that are so obvious - it's hard to swallow an idiot like <br /> <br /> Rise to Power is turned on in the late sixties. Carlito's tea is set in the mid-seventies to the end. For this film to be realistic, it should be set in the fifties, if not until the end of the forties. <br /> <br /> Race to Power has no sign of Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), no Kleinfeld sign. There is no sign of Rolando that Carlito allegedly ran his "hey day". None of the original characters in this film was in this film. We should believe that Carlito met all these people in a few years. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power ends with Carlotte walking on the beach, talking about retirement in paradise she wanted to make in the original film. Pre-quel also creates Rocco and Earl characters - what should happen to them because they are probably not in Carlito's tea? It is also difficult to understand how Carlitol would have relationships with the Italians he is in in the original film, watching Rise to Power events. Where is Taglialucci in this movie? There are probably seven years between the two films and he is spending five of them in jail. It's like catching a square plug into a round hole. and discard the story of Carlito Brigante. The film had some good moments, but I think they would have been better off letting this film stand by than trying to turn it into a prequel for Carlito. , the only advice I can give is not to think of the film as a linear prerequisite. Think of it as spaghetti westerns, who have no Clint Eastwood man without a name, in other words, two movies with the same character but not necessarily related.
