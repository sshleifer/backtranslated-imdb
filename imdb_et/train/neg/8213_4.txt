I can't believe it, IMDb actually has every TV show for people! I haven't seen this example for over 20 years. I only remember two episodes and I hardly remember them. I remember that Tony may not go from the beginning, because one of the episodes I remember is where everyone is trying to join Tony, but he rejects them, but he usually shows a Power House at the end of the show, everyone is happy. <br /> <br /> The second one I remember is where Lolo for some reason pretends to be dead (with funerals and mourners). I do not remember why he plays the dead or how the exhibitions are over. <br /> <br /> It is one of those that shows that I am convinced that I must have dreamed of having never heard of it.
