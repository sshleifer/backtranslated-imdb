I was watching the movie for the first time. I wanted to look at it like I was with Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of his early films. The film is about a girl (played by young and beautiful Drew Barrymore) who moves from NYC to LA to overcome her recent loss. Shortly after he is a man in love with him, it is obvious that he has a bad twin - a doppelganger who haunts him. <br /> <br /> The film is pretty poor and sad. Both dialogues and shows that the film is not really worth it. All in all, it's just something for Drew Barrymore fans.
