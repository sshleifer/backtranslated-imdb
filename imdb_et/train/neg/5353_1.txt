I had the "privilege" to participate in a special "Light Lack" screening in Ohio's horror convention. <br /> <br /> First of all, you know that you have problems when the director introduces the movie, saying, "Now remember we didn't have much money ..." Not that the non-budget movies are bad, but if the filmmaker uses this excuse, the results are always bad. And there is no better example than this dreamless dream. In fact, the "Lack of Light" marks the first underground cinema in the world: this is the only time I saw talented talented animals of the genres who really carried me. Charismatic actors, such as David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Banister, enter and leave the film randomly and prove they are a little uninteresting than the unnamed names. Who are their characters? What are they talking about? Who cares? It's all so boring, you don't need anything anymore and no one cares. <br /> <br /> After thirty minutes of this endurance test I gave up and walked out of the theater. It is not surprising that most cast members did so. <br /> <br /> All curious genres would do it away. With a little luck, this film never sees "daylight".
