BEGIN SPOILER: An appropriately funny and memorable Mr. Chong in the roach-smoking scenario: Chong rubs a fine kitchen tube into his tube bowl, lights up, coughs and hurts forever, then with the perfect aplomb and not missed, reload the bowl properly, light up again, light up again and again. END SPOILER. Alas, I began to lose faith in less than half way. It seemed to me that the lack of duo was so unpleasant and less than relative. I've come to an evaluation of the relative complexity of today's stoners, Harold and Kumar. I just prefer a lighter business. But the film is probably perfect for baked frat bros or those who are so weak to stoner them out when they - the first is sober. A remarkable appearance of the guests by Paul Reubens, which provides a pee-wee form.
