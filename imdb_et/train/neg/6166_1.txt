I do not recommend this film because it is inaccurate and misleading, this story was supposed to be in the Berber territory of Algeria, it was hit in the South Tunisian desert, (a completely different culture, I know I'm both from Tunisia and Algeria), another shocking element was the character of his companion aunt, speaks a very beautiful French language in the film, academic French at university level, while the character he played was supposed to be disturbed and never left his mountainous personality, so living with such an educated ancient bedouin that the context is impossible, the most disgraceful scene and disrespectful, especially for the people of the region, the "femme repudiee" segment, which is a pure invention by the writer / director, is something that never happens in such a case. Algerian Society Ever!
