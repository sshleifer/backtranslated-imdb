Someone should say to Goldie Hawn that her career as a teen gamer ended thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films published for years, an unequivocal disaster, where both executives give their brand card exclusive exposure to offset the bad script and bad targeting. This thing should have stifled during childbirth. <br /> <br /> I hope John Cleese got a lot of this name for the disaster. He is the only speaker who came through this stinking confusion more or less intact, his only mistake was that he couldn't understand that the rest was illuminating the picture.
