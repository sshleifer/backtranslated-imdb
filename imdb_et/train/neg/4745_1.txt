I can't say more about this movie was terrible. The whole Chineseness is awakened in your being, because the ancestors were hard to sell. But telling the audience that every Chinese knows Chinese history without even being ridiculous. It's like saying that every American knows American history without studying or every Filipino language etc etc. It's just not plausible. <br /> <br /> The story is puzzling. It was said that Shin comes from a Chinese monastery - later identifying it from Beijing. But the early sequences of the film show a map that focuses on Mongolia. I know that the current Chinese regime, for its part, wants to seek such areas as Mongolia. But its a separate nation and even markings "Mongolia" on the map. Did Disney Studios fail in Grade 5 geography? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wendy and Shin is at best superficial and still seems to be somehow related to him. His training is also cheesy. And lets trap: everything about this movie is bad. Its bad to laugh and cry. In many cases, Taekwondo's action was over and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The evil eye was cheesy. However, the left-hand end would have been the only shooting practice. They should have set aside evil eyes. But instead, somehow evil is done. Yey! In general, the time of the dog is not worth the time. Brenda Song should go to the second studio. "F"
