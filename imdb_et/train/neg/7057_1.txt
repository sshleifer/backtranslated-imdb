It's one of the most irritating, pointless movies I've ever failed. Every time he started to look, it could get more blacksmith blows, followed by paranoid idiot that masks as social commentary. The main character, Maddox, is manipulative, probably a rebel who lives in a mansion that seems to be without parents or without responsibility. Supporting cast is much more pleasant and interesting, but unfortunately they have never been developed. Nor do we ever understand the character of John Stanton, which is said to affect Maddox's rebel actions. At one point, I thought "Aha! Maddox is just nuts and secretly all these relationships escaped from a mental patient, Stanton! But of course it's not so and the whole movie turns out to be pointless from both Maddox and the viewer. Where is Ferris Bueller when we need him ?
