The fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad script is over me. It really has to be one of the worst movies in addition to the "Haunted Highway" I've ever seen. BAD actors and really bad story. This film has no ordinary reactions, and although it is Halloween, normal people have greater reactions when they feel their father is being killed, not to mention gutted people who have a belt around their airways, unable to breathe (in a room of at least 50 people I could add) and some people who have dropped dead people from Satan's house, even an 8-year-old would see a difference between a doll and a person. Not to mention that no one can be so naive and stupid to believe in the reality of Satan and Jesus in the same day as this child does. When I was 8, I had more brains. But the really stupid thing is that everyone else is facing the look of this silent Satan, and no questions have been asked. The whole question of the film is, is it really Satan, or is it a crazy person who kills people when he knows it? Well, he has human hands, hands, built and whatever, so I think he should be in the movie, otherwise they did a terrible job that hid it. Then, when that person was a man and everything, he could kill an old lady, a man and his lover, 5 (!! ???) the police (all with weapons and training) and some other people. .... and probably everyone was standing there waiting for him or what? <br /> <br /> The whole concept and the way to tell the story is absolutely the worst thing I've ever seen, and I would never want anyone to stay 1 hour and 30 minutes of their life to see this complete mess .
