A woman and I saw a preview of this movie while watching another DVD and thought, "Jon Heder, Diane Keaton, Jeff Daniels and Eli Wallach, this must be better than I sow in the summer, so I ordered it from a local library." Lawrence Welk would make more laugh like "Mama's boy". I actually felt that the actors had to read the script in the privacy of their home and I couldn't imagine what he had to have. Maybe at least the next time they were offered such a movie, they "just say no!" One give two.
