It was filmed in reverse with the transformation of the famous Conan Doyle's famous novel The Lost World in 1992. And it shows. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a promising, ruthless organization that intends to take advantage of the lost world, and Challenger et al back to protect the prehistoric plateau, but then things go down. Everything is on the plateau and we leave the first movie with a weak, boring, overwhelmed rehash. <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs (hardly ever seen) are just ridiculous. Do we expect to take this soft toy that should be a serious ankylosaur? And the tyrant groan appears rooted. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and get the silent version of the lost 1925 world. Incredibly in this age of CGI and other advanced effects, the twentieth version is the best and will last as long as anyone finally decides to do a decent again.
