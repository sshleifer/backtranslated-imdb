First of all, I was convinced that it was a TV movie that wasn't worth prime. But after a few minutes of stupid astonishment, I realized that the overall tricks and the c-film had at least a comic value. This film would have been 1 if my wife and I were not so harshly laughing that we watched the actors keep a straight face. It was like the "The Big Hit" less funny spy version (I laughed so much that I actually bought Big Hit DVDs) with even worse action. We were disappointed that Nick chose to marry Elena, not Jim, after he was hugging and high-fives. A couple of rum and coke will definitely help you go easier.
