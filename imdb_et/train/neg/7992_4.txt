I remember this movie long ago on television. I remember that the prerequisite for the film is about a number of hotel guests who are attacked by human eating ants. What I didn't remember was HOW TO ATTENTION! <br /> <br /> I recently made this movie on television late at night. I'm sure it must be a mistake, because such films usually disappear from existence and can never be found again! Suzanne Somers (at the top of his career with three companies at Chrissy) is a vacationer in Lakewood Manor. The construction workers install the pool outside and unintentionally interfere with the anchor nest. Or should I say it is * MAN-EATING ANTS 'NEST * !! One of the workers is attacking the ants. At one minute he chooses his clothes one after another, the next minute he covers them. The next scene is dirt dirty. I could almost imagine his thinking in relieving him to pull out of the movie! against each other, blowing through the straw and covered with ants. <br /> <br /> It's basically a movie. There is really no "catastrophe" complaint or "big letter" for the film. It was supposed to be a "big" television event. It is now happy to get to your local television station at 4:00 am. </p> If you want to see Myrna Loy make bread and pay bills, check out this movie. <br /> <br /> 0/10
