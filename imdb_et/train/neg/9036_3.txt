I can't believe I waste that time to see this garbage! I did because Leonard Maltin gave him the "AA" rating and for TV movies it is usually a reliable quality entertainment indicator. <br /> <br /> Action was OK, but whoever wrote it should forever forbid access to any medium. The plot is ridiculous, the "bad boys" motivations are completely absent, and the different family relationships are stupid and low. For example, Dad announces that a violent reaction to aggression is a BAD, but he turns out to be a "marvelous" person because he "ignores the idiots" philosophy, but because he is pretty good with his fist ... <br /> ONLY the message I can from this card to understand was that the nuclear family is good and the dwellings are poor. Oh and bad people happen to good people.
