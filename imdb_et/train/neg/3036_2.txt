This movie was completely strange! I can't understand how this movie was brought. Nothing is cast in the film, it's all the fault of the writing team. You're taking an old middle plot - dancing our way out of poverty and poverty - or STEP. But it lacks real plots - or at least one that one would care about. With Canadian-speaking actors in what should be the American environment, this film falls very flat. In case of a positive note, the management was pretty good and the cinematography was pretty decent. The production budget also seemed very generous. My only request is that this team leaves the writing alone and find the actual scriptwriters to help them bring the words that live in the movie. Net Result - How does it move? How she sucks.
