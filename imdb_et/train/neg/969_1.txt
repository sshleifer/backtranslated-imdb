I was the roots of this film because it is a remake of the 1970s children's television series "Escape to Night", which, although chaotic and at times somewhat dirty, was certainly odd, exciting and disturbing. "Paperhouse" is a wooden, involuntary joke. The overdubs did not add tension but only confirmed that I had sat watching the bot. Casting annoyed the terrible dialogue that resulted in a relationship that was lacking in heat, chemistry or conviction. As in most cloudy films, there are some good supportive actions, these people must be comforted, comforted, and assured that they are not responsible. Of all possible sections, the most unexpected ... lamer was chosen if I had dreamed. <br /> <br /> "Escape in Night" deserves a decent remake written by someone who has a life experience and is guided fine.
