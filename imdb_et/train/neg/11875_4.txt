Mmm, isn't a big pancake good? Maple syrup and canned fruit. Take the bite. Mmmmmmm. Take another bite. Another. Another. MEAT. Eat it, you !!! Keep the shovel under your throat until the face turns green to nausea. You have the experience of Ally McBear. <br /> <br /> I hit it with '98. Like this pancake stack, I worshiped myself. But the joy was soon worn because Ally McBear's character (whom we see to be cute and loving at first glance) will soon become the most annoying, insecure, and saddest applicant you've ever met. (Call me a feminist, but I prefer my female to lead the spinal cord.) The curves and tricks of the show are also becoming attacks, Vonda Shepherd's music (which is really your face moved) becomes a grid, and the unchanging character changes and transcriptions make the exhibition a fucking soap opera. <br /> <br /> My recommendation is to take this exhibition in small doses and finish as soon as it gets cumbersome (and it will change). I did this for 2.5 seasons before my pleasure was completely sour. It was good if it lasted, but like a crazy, neurotic ex-girlfriend, it just changed after the English expectation when she had been waiting. <br /> <br /> Next time go to IHOP, skip pancakes. Order something healthy like a fruit bottle. It sits much better with you.
