Look, I loved the PROPER Anchorman movie, but it was really bad. Such a bad thing that makes you want can get that time back in your life, what a bad thing that makes you think, "what on earth did they think to film it first", the bad thing you want you took 50 minutes more stuck in the kitchen to take snacks during the movie, what's bad, what makes leprosy fun, such a bad thing that makes you think you would like to have Pauly Shore's movie rented ... seriously, I can't explain how it was bad. <br /> <br /> Having said that ... there were some semi-fun laughs, but they're all so much fun with LESS as Anchorman. Of course, they tried to make it fun and fun, but the entire sub-block excluded from Anchorman, which made this a real reason, was truly unjustified ... it wasn't even a little good. <br /> <br /> Do it yourself (or in the US) and don't watch this DVD ... it hides a good movie that Anchorman is, and you don't want to do that. Okay ... I'm fine now.
