Complete signs of the contents of this film, in British, I did not know that the US Navy had segregation during World War II. A very bold attempt to bring this fact to the world. But the film is pathetic, there is no direction, wood is exemplary, and the script is just one clich√© after another. I can honestly say it's one of the worst films I've ever seen. I sat down and started very poorly from the beginning to the end that it was put together. It could have been a great movie, the story of many of us outside the US was new, unique and also interesting. The sad thing is how it was put together. It is unfortunate that a real story that could have changed people's attitudes has been devastated by a low budget for a poorly managed film. I only hope that some time in the future one of the main studios will take this issue and make it fair.
