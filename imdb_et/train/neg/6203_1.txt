I saw it at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was terrible! Every cliche, a violent, rich boy fantasy, was on the screen, you knew how it would end especially when rape of chef's wife and first girl. <br /> <br /> The worst part was Q&A with the director / writer, and the writer / producer tried to become intellectual, but you could say that they are released from violence. I bet something they often do in brothels and drugs. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. I had to get my boy out of it.
