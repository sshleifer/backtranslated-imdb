From the very opening scene you will notice how hard they tried to emulate very intelligent and powerful bold intentions and how it landed. You will also notice what a terrible choice is when choosing Robin Dunne as Valmont ... Then you will meet two of the best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and his mother. This means that if you get past the fact that Kathryn wasn't blonde in the first movie, then the movie will continue, you will see a cheap romantic story miles back, and you will notice that Sebastian has already met Anette's past, here's Danielle and Cec, here is called Cherie ... When the original is for prequel. Then it becomes a low budget "Wild Things" movie with lots of o-my "spins". As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice. Not that he's a bad actor, he's good. He just doesn't hold the charisma of Ryan. Amy Adams, who I think is one of the most talented young actors of our time, brings us back again. But with the talent of the whole world, it cannot be saved in the trash. All in all, this "movie" looks like a "Beverly Hills, 90210" episode. The result has been stolen from "cruel intentions" and "Jawbreaker" ... Yes, they used the JAWBREAKER score ... Did they ever leave it alone?! You want to hand it over. If you want more bold intentions, look at Stephen Frears' dangerous ties.
