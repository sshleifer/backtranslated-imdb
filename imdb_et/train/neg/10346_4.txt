You would think that with Ingrid Bergman and Warner Baxter, this movie would have been much better. Unfortunately, the film suffers from serious beliefs, as well as the problem of large plots that makes some characters temporary. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Ingrid Bergman, who works for the Stoddard family. Everything is so peachy and swelling - family loves Bergman and things can't be more perfect. Well, until the mother (Fay Wray) dies, the stock market falls in 1907 (wiping out family happiness) and Bergman is forced to go home to France. This part of the movie is a bit sticky, but not bad. <br /> <br /> Later, after family treasures, Bergman is back. Four boys have now grown up and there is no real reason to hire him as governor. But in short, everything is swollen again. But if WWI happens, then all four wars - gosh! In the middle of it, one of the sons (David) brings his new wife (Susan Hayward). The character of Miss Hayward is as black and white as the others, although although they are all good and swell, she is obviously a horny she-devil. To make things worse, he must live in a family home when David is in war. <br /> <br /> This is the place where the movie really is, really stupid - brain-painful. Hayward starts communicating with one of David's brothers, but when his father sees a silhouette of lovers, Bergman enters the second entrance of the room and pretends it was him, not Hayward Jack! WHY?! Why should any sensible person do this to save obviously the back of the evil and binding woman? That was exactly the excuse Bergman had to get out of the gutter. It's just a sad case of writing and made me crazy ... and most likely I did the same with the audience in 1941. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is made up of unfortunate chances of Hayward's failed opportunity to show evil. It just flies common sense and made the film silly melodramatic mess. As expected, the truth will eventually come out and everything will once again swell --- glad to be one big loving wonderful family minus the bitch, Hayward. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from poor writing. Hayward's point didn't make sense - at least in dealing with it. And having such symbols that are both gosh-darn good or evil (with nothing), this film sucks to the level of the second level soap. The only thing that saves it at all is acting --- they tried as well as they could with a market-safe script. Suffice it to say that the writers of Columbia Pictures who made this movie should have been killed by a dead chicken!
