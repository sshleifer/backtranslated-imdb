It seemed like a good movie, I thought it would be a good movie, and for the whole movie I was hoping would be a meaningful use of my time, and yes, I have to admit that Dimple Capadia and Deep's acting talent in Naval, where I really appreciate but despite the best efforts, this film cannot effectively deliver a meaningful message that seems to be what Somnath Sen is trying to do. The last point is short and the end ended imperfect after what happens; a bit like a real life in this regard, but films, unlike real life, end in about 2 hours and the end should leave the audience alone if it was the director's intention. It is short in this respect and it will destroy me the most. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that touched me was the national stereotyping of American characters - everything seems to have been carved out of the block. It seems to me that most of the American films that are Indian in English are based on how ordinary Indians themselves see Americans as similar and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring the film to any American depth or complexity. /> <br /> These two aspects bring together a disappointing story.
