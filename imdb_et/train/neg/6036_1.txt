Without knowing the known lie that seems to be so persistent, this "film" is another cheap sliding flick that amazes me how it was released. I have no problems with horrors and slasher rails, in fact, they are my favorites. But when they do, it actually takes the monkey and it is no wonder that the genre has such a difficult time. The story is both clich√© and imaginative as possible as a number of people in the woods lounge, which this zombie / ghost leaning down. It is not the story that sucks the most, its terrifying act and dialouge, the quality of home-made control and the terrible sound. Not to mention the ridiculous effects and some incredibly lazy movies - these mores are out in clear daylight, but we have to believe it is night? What the hell was the director thinking of this move? What was he only one day to film it all? He was afraid of the blind? (It is a joyful sight that a policeman is walking in a clean daylight using a torch that works the way it is black) <br /> <br /> I think the positive side of the actors is that they look like people who work at a local supermarket so that at least they can escape from the movie without ever noticing. I'm sure one of the "teens" will play bingo from a local pub - but he's 40-45. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a good laugh, but just a waste of another movie and time.
