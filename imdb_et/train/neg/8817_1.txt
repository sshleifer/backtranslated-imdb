No, I've never seen any "Santa Slasher" series, "Silent Night, Deadly Night", "Black Christmas" or "Christmas Evil". I've heard everything about their reputation, or MADS (mothers opposed to Santade.) I thought I'd rent this one, as I've heard it is a reference to the "Fat Guys at the Movies" segment. /> <br /> Mothers should be against it, but not ooooohhhh "killer" for Santa, but for this movie it was just plain. Bored, long? even just 92 minutes, crap boy. <br /> <br /> A little boy sees Santa coming down to the chimney in 1947, delivering gifts, eating some goodies, and miraculously swimming in a chimney. The boy goes to bed but returns to the living room to recognize his mother and Santa Claus (sort of). Obviously, this child was confused with the rest of his life, although the scene was about as steamy as when Ralphie's father received the "Lamb Light" "Christmas Story". He was so upset, he went to the attic and cut his hand well. <br /> <br /> Fast forward to the future! Now it is 1980 and a confused boy works at the toy factory. We get it to be a bit off-the-scooter, and it supplies both children and parents. Who is naughty, who's nice, blah blah. Finally, is it necessary to make the film two-thirds of the film? as if it wasn't for the first frame. NO MOVIE should take so long. When he finally does, punishes "who's naughty", it's as graphic as the "Garbage Pail Kid" card. And I haven't mentioned the end of the WTF. I think it was a metaphor, but actually it's just as strange as the rest of the movie. (Take the brother who is his sister's brother, kills and his solution is killing.) Don't open this confusion even on Christmas Eve or evil. Again, I did not look at other "Santa-Slashers" but it suck bad. It created tension caused by the nature of the film and never gave it a proper presence.
