Some people think it was the worst film they've ever seen, and I understand where they come from, but I'm really worse. <br /> <br /> By saying this, the movies I remember (ie those I haven't blocked), which were worse than that, were so bad that they looked physically at all in the sense of watching the movie. Films that are worse than War Games 2 are the ones that make you want to pull your eyes out or turn sharp objects in your ears to keep you from other pieces of your soul. > <br /> War Games: The dead code is not so bad, but it's pretty close. Yes, I was a fan of the original, but I did not expect this miracle. Let's face it, the original wasn't really as big a movie as it was in the first place, it was just a romantic flick of 80s teenagers with a geek complaint. <br /> <br /> That's all I was hoping for. Something's bad, but it could have been drawn to my geek. Was it too much to ask? Is it really not possible to do better than the original war games, even when the video is released directly? Probably it was too much to ask. Stay away from this movie. At first, it's just bad, like "Oh yes, it's bad, but I enjoy it, maybe the end is good like the original." And then it gets worse and worse, and finally trust me, you want you not to see this movie.
