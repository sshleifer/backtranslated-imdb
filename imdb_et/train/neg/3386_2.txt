Yes, I was fortunate enough to see Michael Bennett's hit musician for a long time. It was an amazing experience and I paid to see the movie when it hit theaters in 1985. It's terrible. Almost everyone fails. First of all, Attenborough (a good actor, a good director with the right material) has a very bad choice - almost as bad as when John Huston was hired by ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - they cut songs and CASTING !!! They are terrible - the forces of the game were those dancers - those hungry, talented performers just wanted to show what they can do and when they got their chance - you couldn't take your eyes off them. But this cast can simply be dancing, with a "nice" song, but none of them shines one. In fact, look up the IMDb - none of them really did anything. (OK, OK, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). So this cinema does not break the magic, the despair, the passion for the music of the production within a second. Full withdrawal! (But even though they try to stifle music - big music rises from time to time and reminds people how big it was).
