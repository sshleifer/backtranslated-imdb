Some have praised - Allantit: - Lost Empire as a Disney adventure for adults. I don't believe it - at least not in adult thinking. <br /> <br /> This script suggests starting a live action movie that hit someone other than what you can no longer sell to adults. The "cracked workers" of many older adventure films have already been well done (think The Dirty Dozen), but - Alantis - is one of the worst films in this motif. The characters are weak. Even the background that every member omits seems at best hidden and uncomfortable. MD / Medicine Man, a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons, if we haven't seen them before, we've seen the game before and again. The story of how one of the companions, Vinny, played Don Novello (Fr. Guido Sarducci) went completely unconvincing at the flower shops. <br /> <br /> Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a young Atlantis obsessed academician, Michael J. Fox, says he has his depth. Finding Milo from Atlantis continues with his grandfather who picked him up. There's a lot of younger Milo in the scene, sitting on his knees, because his grandfather puts a helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> And if the characters were at best thin, the best part was - Atlantic. voice talent. Commander Rourke loses something that James Garner publishes. Though Rourke is a pretty stocky type, Garner shows his ability to breathe life with just his delivery. Garner's vocal performance is the highest point. I'm sorry to say that Leonard Nimoy's dying king is nothing more than mandatory. In addition, Don Novello, as a demolition expert at Vinny Santorini, had one or two well done, funny lines - but I have always loved Father Guido Sarducci. <br /> <br /> Computer animation was also well done. Wallpaper animation, that is. Character animation does nothing if the flat characters do not even straighten. Apart from landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is little to be impressed. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say hackneyed or trite. I'm not so sure. Any cultivated parcel can do something new for proper treatment. Shakespeare often began with a well-known story and plot and was only famous for the new color cover. So this is the thing. And -Alantis obviously lacks it. <br /> <br /> I can't go all logical spaces without the spoiler part. The plot was bad. Plot bridges come in like a thread and the end doesn't make sense. It is accompanied by a script and animation with annoying sloppiness. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> At first, when Milo shows that the silicon or Celtic symbols have been misinterpreted and "Irish coast" should read "Icelandic Coast", we are going to have trouble generate. Script writers should know the British victory for Eire or Eureann in "Ireland" and ignore the older Latin term Hibernia. But more than they need, they need to know the Viking conspiracy to call the greener island of Iceland and Greenland. it was executed after the English version of the viper and the post-roman date of the script. Because it has been a long time since Atlantis had to sink into its underwater cave. And without visible clues and less technology than Milo was, the title made it much less reliable. <br /> <br /> Shepherd's Journals couldn't write before Atlantis sinking or knew about a cave or crystal. lies "in the king's eyes". It must be written after the sinking, but without the technology that Milo's expedition had, how the devil was taken by Leviathan. So how do you know more about it? And why would it be written in Atlantis? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. However, weather conditions and astral movement do not need to be written in Atlantis. So it must be some kind of automatic writing. Since someone who is not in Atlantis cannot be read, the spirit of crystal messages must be on the surface. It would have made more sense. But it could have been explained in the film: Milo could have discovered the shepherd that this power had called him all his life - it appeared in dreams, etc. It had to be studied in the film. <br /> <br /> The Atlantic should not just be able to understand modern languages. Nobody expects the original Indo-Europeans to talk to Europe anymore when the Romans would realize that "c" or their day got the French "ch" (pronounced as "sh", not less!) <br /> <br /> Current Atlantis they were alive before cataclysm - when they probably * could read * but now they can't read what they used before or what they use. <br /> <br /> Massita's illiteracy is a sign of a significant shortage of the film. Nothing seems to have happened to this culture. The air seems to have stopped until Milo can save it. Although life does not seem to be a lasting struggle for survival, no one wants to write poetry or write novels, and maybe it is a combination of Atlantis school systems that go downhill and lack of good fiction that caused Atlantis to enter illiteracy. <br /> <br /> Kidat can be apologized for not knowing how to read or operate the machine when he was so young when the foolish cataclysm is set - but WHAT IS ** HIGH ** qualifies his father for Deity! Kashakim's stupidity almost wiped out the existence of his people. A bunch of cataclysm was killed, progress progressed (not much killed here, but he was watching huge culture and progress) until someone killed the crystals when they were not boiled in the lava, because the giant robots were not protecting them. <br /> <br /> The blue electric bolt should have shattered the similarity of Kashakim when Kida tried to combine his father's image with the GREAT Kings of Atlantis. <br /> <br /> While Milo was the only one who could read Atlantis, Rourke and others knew quite well that they saw a book in the book and found a crystal sheet he knew was crystal and not some stylized astrological or "phases" as sun "diagram". <br /> <br /> When Milo's grandfather talked to Rourke, it doesn't explain how Rourke would have suffered this part of the book when reading Milo. Rourke handed the dog a juxtaposed page, although Milo did not obviously find the sign of a broken page in the book - it was only that the viewer slipped, "nothing was quite right". If the word "crystal" hadn't brought Milo's head out of trouble to try to steal it, Milo would have suspected something. It's just a thick look. <br /> <br /> The team's "double-cross" did not become a sign. We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie had been with Rourke from the beginning. But "heart change" is gradually falling. It was a change and needed to be better motivated. Difficult to do with signs that were not given to get started. <br /> <br /> A little bit of the lava flows over the dome, instead of filling the rest of the area we look at. It's a liquid; it does not flow over the protective cap until it fills all the lower areas. <br /> <br /> Finished Hours! - And there is no point other than confirming political correctness. By restoring this capability, Atlantis is no longer a weak force that needs coding. The giant robot's guardians and the blue flashes that come from the blue flash indicate that they have less fear than we can. Technology is higher than ours and certainly in the early 20th century. After all, Milo has to teach the Atlantic to read what? The whole idea is to leave your little quiet, corrupt culture alone, not to send it in hyper mode. <br /> <br /> ** END THE END OF THE END ** <br /> <br /> Perhaps the land of the lost world and the beginning of the century should give me the hint that it is more of a cellulose respect. The defects found by the film are in agreement with this idea. But I'm at a loss, why should I pay to see thin characters and plot holes just because many of the fine books also had them. Nevertheless, the pulp stories are part of the "crap that they are no longer able to sell to adults". We have become a bit more complicated and our pulp also needs to grow. The lost ship's Raiders didn't lose any pulp feel and avoided so much badness. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 - The movie is enjoyable, but if I think the plot will be getting lower.
