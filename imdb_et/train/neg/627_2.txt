Oh dear lord. This movie ... It was terrible. I'm a big fan of fear films. And most of the time, the movie is bad, I like it. The actor who played "Scarecrow" was amazing, I say it. But this plot was terrible. It didn't make sense! It was too much gore and unnecessary (and loud) sex scene in the beginning. I believe the director was trying to be "shocking" or not, but it just came awfully. To add a bunch of hairy mess, they invited the actor, the actors (other than the peacocks), we are terrible, and I care so little about them that soon I forgot who was who. All in all, this film made me sick. If you can't watch this movie, do it.
