This is a film that takes some digestion. On the one hand, we are offered a tough outward crust, a story that not only gives the Catholic Church, but does it in a foolish and uninformed way. The inner layer is offered to us by the Orthodox story of orthopedic and what happens when people blindly follow the faith they cannot understand. <br /> <br /> At first glance, it seemed to be comedy. If so, Mr Durang must open the dictionary because he does not clearly know the meaning of the word. Jokes are pale; humor is uncomfortable and poorly edited. Especially Mrs Keaton's performance is flying and up, far below the quality of her Annie hall and bedtime. Jennifer Tilly is again with a strong voice and a whimsical style. All this can be forgiven if it wasn't the last 20 minutes of this movie, which probably was a controversial game made in 1981. <br /> <br /> *** Caution, front spoilers *** <br This all starts with the appearance of four former sister Mary Ignatius students (by the way, Ignatius is a male name, and the nun would not take it after his promises under no circumstances just because of this fact). just to show you how much tireless research work started in the project.) If they all admit that they do not live the teachings of the church, the sister will go unchanged and abuse them in the way the audience wants to believe she went back when horny, all- too-clichÃ© sepia tone setback. If one of them admits to having two abortions, the nun becomes even more abusive until the student pulls out the weapon. After he was thrown away from him, the nun kills a student, probably in self-defense. Then he goes to a screaming rampage, killing his ex-student for his sins. The last shot is a dead female student standing in a position similar to Christ when her shadow is crossed. Can you say it's hard? I knew you could do it! in this train wreck. I have heard from the writer and director that this is a film of hysteria and why orthodoxy should not be followed so religiously. This explanation is difficult to swallow, simply because we are never given an authoritative perspective that is not biased in one way or another in relation to the Catholic faith. This film is just a catholic roof that, for the sake of fairness and equality, means meditation and hatred. <br /> <br /> This is a film I would like to be Catholic, namely to awaken the reality of their cynicism and ignorance that they are facing today. If it were "Rabbi Ray explains all this" or "Imam Muhammad explains it all", the streets would be unrest and Showtime would lose all of his order. But, unfortunately, because it is a film that captures most of the film, it is accepted and even accepted by those who share the same awkward view. <br /> <br /> I certainly hope the member of this story was a practicing Catholic, so it's not just ignorance that brought them to the movie. <br /> <br /> I give him 1.5 stars out of five, not because of his offensive nature, but because it was a badly written, poorly directed, and at all bad film. Don't even waste your time.
