Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has a big problem with him. The seraphic killer, Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober), for whom Pessic extraordinaire Tess (Tracy Griffith) helped him to seize, has resurrected with the first power (giving him the devil after his execution in the gas chamber) and may have weak bodies. Somehow, Russell, who unites troops with Tess (... who understands what they have accepted), must stop Channing or many women continue to die in their bloody hands. They are looking for help from Marguerite (Elizabeth Arlen), who has tried to inform her superiors of the first power in the Catholic Church, but has been denied access to a weapon that could stop Channing ... with a cross blade that could penetrate through Channing's heart releases your evil world. He will still take it and give Russell a helping hand who needs all the help he receives when Channing rob Tess, preparing him for some sort of satanic ritual / ceremony. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Mykelti Williamson, always a trustworthy welcoming supporter, becomes a partner of Russell ... so you know what's going on with him. As with this type of film, everyone dies around Russell, but when he tries to kill Channing, he just kills the weak host of another poor soul he has. <br /> <br /> Clean the occult garbage ... stupid from the gate to the finish line. Phillips and Griffith are trying, I'll give them this, but they don't have a chance on such a flick. A kober who is usually always difficult as hard does not really do anything more than a funny villain jumping into the air and throwing rotten peaks.
