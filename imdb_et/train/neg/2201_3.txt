Horror / Sci-Fi, which is interesting because it is ridiculous. F / X is pretty good ... what you see. Made for a TV thriller that is not as bad as the worst. Jeffrey Coombs plays a brilliant but misleading scientist who prevents stem cell research and manipulates human DNA with hammerhead shark. The scary results give birth to one kill machine. A group of scientists led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo are invited to a remote island to look at a new great experiment. Of course, after laughing and frightening ... Coombs' creation, by the way, is his own son, who is thawed with a hammer, to let go of one of his father's colleagues. Revenge is not always cost effective. Also cast: Elsie Muller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.
