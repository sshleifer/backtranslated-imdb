The assumption was intriguing, but unfortunately this film does not make him any justice. The casting was pretty good, and it was shot beautifully - but stylistically, the direction was inconsistent. ), the characters were only identified by the use of screen coke (and pretty much anything else left to Boogie Nights for character development), and no personal characters to draw the viewer's story. A very forgotten movie.
