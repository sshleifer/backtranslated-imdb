I really hope that Concorde / New Horizons didn't try to make a serious horror or even a movie when they did Carnosaur's 3rd. The film is stupid from start to finish. Even C3 humor is funny because it is bad. Certainly a high watermark is "so bad it's a good" genre. If you have the worst, it is for you.
