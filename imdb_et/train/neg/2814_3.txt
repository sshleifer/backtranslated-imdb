View 1 8/26/2001 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): Frightening but sadistic (which makes sense) the portrayal of the Marquis De Sade relative to the same sadistic acts and enjoyment allegedly done by his predecessor. This Tobe Cooper movie does not do much more than its similar style with Freddy Krueger's films with the same star (Freddy himself - Robert Englund), who has a double role (Marquis De Sade and his relative). He also seems to want to strike in Christianity, but eventually loses that much to my passion, but leaves the film with an inconsistent feeling. It could have been a lot worse if the excesses and the violence were overwhelmed, but they try to keep it to a minimum despite the terrible scenes. My last point is why Hooper would like to make this movie. Obviously there was a time to actually distribute it, so it should be advertised in the title of gruesomely and Hooper, hopefully earning money for his name and his gore. It's obvious that it doesn't work.
