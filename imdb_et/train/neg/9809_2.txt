Some don't know why there was no more Mrs. Murphy movies after that. Is it because this movie created a tatt. Disney wasn't the right movie to launch this movie. MAYBE Touchstone (well, they belong to Disney, but it would be an adult). The film is too child-ish because there is no book series. Selection is wrong for characters. The characters don't work as they do in the books. And why did Tucker get lost? She's a girl with fregging books! Did it happen to make the movie enjoyable? Sheesh. And where was the Pewter, the gray cat? There are no funny characters in this book. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but promised Disney to do the wrong job. An animated feature film, perhaps on Don Bluth's art, would be better suited to Mrs Murphy's film. In general, I'll give it 2, because at least Disney made a movie in a series of discounted books. But I wish they were better. In both cases, I still have my books for entertainment.
