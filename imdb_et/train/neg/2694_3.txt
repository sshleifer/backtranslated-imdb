Warning: Includes spoiler. When a movie starts with a sex scene, it's a bad film. (see, for example, 300). This confirms the above-mentioned lemma. The second scene is the spinning center of the whole activity. The fact that we know the end makes the movie boring. Even more plots appear when the story goes back and forth several times. And it was more disappointing. In order to compensate for the resulting tension, we find more and more information about how characters are unbalanced. And yes, they have a lot to show. Andy (P.Hoffman) is, for example, a drug addict, more ?, he's cheating on his wife, more ?, he's going to rob his father, more?, His wife cheating on his brother, more? he does not regret his involvement with his mother's death, more? etc etc. There is not enough room here to write ... I don't know how to get a top job. And why his wife didn't leave her before. On the other hand, I enjoy many performances by actor Hoffman. <br /> <br /> Even here, PSH saves this absurdity from its $ 7 spent. Why absurdity? Because it doesn't make sense why I should take care of despicable characters? Another broken lemma is that the film should have a sympathetic (at least pleasant) character. <br /> <br /> This is also a lot of sentimentality, for example, we should take care of the widow's father's suffering without knowing anything about the life of the parents before the crime.
