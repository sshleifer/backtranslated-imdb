Madhur has previously given us a powerful movie at Chandni Bar. His next film was one of the worst films ever. Obviously, this is the story of some high-level people in India. Having seen a scene where a man forces another man to film for sexual reasons. I felt that the DVD was spitting and crushing. By chance I did. The reason this film was, includes child pornography and torture scenes. I literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children. It was not necessary to show the children completely naked things very disturbing. One rich boy likes to rob poor children and sell them to foreigners, British men in this movie. I'm shocked that this movie was part of India, otherwise Super Flop in the UK, the US, and Australia. I'm from the United Kingdom and this thing makes me sick, shouldn't be released in the UK.
