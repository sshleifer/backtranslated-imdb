It had all the very good films - good actors (Robert Loggia, Ellen Parker), a good plot (a mysterious rocket from the planet threatening to burn the planet) and a lot of film material (when the air force had a movie to fire rockets, it was used). Unfortunately, it destroys too much melodrama and impossible timing. <br /> <br /> The film is about a space rocket attacked by the Soviet Union and involuntarily directed into a low atmosphere orbit. With less than five miles and speeds of over 4000 miles, it emits one million degrees of exhaust gas, burning everything on the ground, including glaciers, distant early warning (DEW) lines, and Eskimos. <br /> <br /> Each missile destruction attempt fails. <br /> <br /> The first drawbacks of this movie will appear early on. Although we do not expect a lot of low-budget films, some things cannot be forgotten - like a little research. For example, both Soviet and US fire-ballistic missiles that are on a rocket whose accuracy is smooth. But the first successful activity-based management tests were not by the Russians until March 1961. <br /> <br /> Too much melodrama. Dr Loring (Loggia) and his assistant Joan Woods (Ellen Parker) play about the same amount of wood as a log house. Parker's character cries out and the boofo-swing is the victim of Loggia as he was on the screen. Loggia is about as heroic as a boring businessman. The scientist (Phillip Pine) humps it so much that he makes William Shatner seemingly. The bus driver runs the end of the world constantly after the scene. The only good actor is the film narrator, played by veteran actor Lawrence Dobkins ("Naked City"). <br /> <br /> All this may be overlooked if it was not on schedule. After the missile information is sent to DC, the Pentagon brings a group of scientists. General (Larry Kerr) announces that a missile will hit New York in 63 minutes. After that, the discussions of the scientists and the deadly wind like the word are sent from the ambassadors to see if the rocket is a Russian attack and if the answer is necessary. <br /> <br /> The film shows the army is completely mixed. Civil defense people leave work and go to their stations. Eight million people seize shelters, while school buses pick up millions of children (and we see the white city of New York I've ever seen, though watching 50's sci-fi movies seems to be this standard). Journalism is kept in the dark for tens of minutes. Then, incredibly, the Pentagon man says the rocket will hit Ottawa, Canada in 51 minutes! All of the above actions took place within 12 minutes! Then, to add fuel to the fire, Loggia is somehow thinking of the way an alien's rocket is stopped. He slowly produces plutonium, loads it into Jeep and moves it from DC to a long rocket base to put it on the rocket. Along the way the wild driver leads the way, breaks down and then flies. Finally, he gets back to the plutonium and drives to the base for rocket launching. Again, all this for the same 63-minute period. <br /> <br /> The movie also features a viewer when it seems like Ottawa is saved, but only roasted for men, women and children. Then it is said that the rocket has five minutes to reach New York. Loggia is still on the base (another 4 miles). He reaches the base and holds the rocket, then reports two minutes later. All in five minutes. New York City districts should have been at least burnt. <br /> <br /> By the way, the missile is destroyed if you don't think so. The head of ABM destroys this massive plutonium-based nuclear explosion. Five seconds later, the explosion fades and everything is clear. Yes, they caused 100 nuclear pressure in Hiroshima on the outskirts of New York and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The film had all the necessary elements to be a good B-film but wasted them. Loggia played his character so flat that you didn't care that he finally sacrificed himself. You didn't care about other characters, not even the smarmy scientists played by Pine. The tension that would have had to move the film was not physically possible during the allowed period (it wouldn't be today, not even with Jack Bauer). <br /> <br /> This movie is very hard to find. As far as I know, it has not been released on any medium and for good reason. I don't know if the film should be or was a common practice, but there is a scene where the government sends all the best scientists, military and businessmen to deep shelters, saying they are too valuable to lose. There are no women or minorities in the bundle. Hari Rhodes is the only black guy in the movie and he gets a little bit of piano. It was worse than "27 days", where an alien gives way to the ground to save or destroy the planet and does not contain black or Spanish. <br /> <br /> I saw it on a special Sci-Fi night in Turner's classic movies and I don't expect it to appear again. If you find a copy of it somewhere, you might want to put it on Amazon.com.
