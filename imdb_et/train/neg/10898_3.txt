If you want to comment on movies where the script arrives at the movie, that's it. Provision and action like in PornFilm, but nothing happens with just a few third types of gripping and touching. What really becomes very boring after 45 minutes, but no action. Some of the actors I've seen in real x rated movies and working there were much better. All special effects are made by the great "Rondo". A cult film is written in the box. Does this mean that this movie is not being monitored at all? <br /> <br /> Stay in touch with friends and watch this movie on the eve of new years.
