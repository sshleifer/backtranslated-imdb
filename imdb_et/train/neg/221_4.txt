I was gifted by this film because he had such a great prerequisite, a group of three women who was in love with a younger man. <br /> <br /> Intriguing. <br /> <br /> NO! I hurry to add. These women are all drawn into extreme cartoons, not very supportive of each other and agreeing and competing with each other. <br /> <br /> Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton could not see it in my book before, but here they are given a bad script and they say they are balancing the action between slapstick and screwdriver, which doesn't work too well when women are all great well-known professionals in a very small town. <br /> <br /> And intelligent women who spend a whole bunch of peoples lives / sex / lust in their lives. I felt that it would have been a lot more than if I had a proper script and more tension, the lesbian subset did not go anywhere and those smoking / drinking women (all thirty forty?) Were very unreal - even in the baby scene - screw the baby, give the cigar! Right. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's shameful. 4 out of 10.
