It was a totally terrible movie. Don't let him attract Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are big players, but it must be just their worst role in history. Even their great actors could not redeem the ridiculous story of the film. This film is US propaganda in the early nineties. The most pathetic scenes were those when Columbia rebels made their turn. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared fake and her pseudo-love relationship with Walken was nothing more than a pathetic emotional plug in a film that had no real meaning. I am disappointed that such films destroy the actor's name as Christopher Walken. I can hardly sit through it.
