Another American Pie film has been pushed under our throat and it is the worst of all of them. It doesn't deserve the name of American Pie. They should have stopped at "Wedding". <br /> <br /> This movie just looks like a stupid porn movie that they would call "American Pie". When I watched it, I felt like I was looking at a different series. It didn't fall like an American pie at all. It has a different sense of humor and is much more rude and has much more sex spots than other American Pie movies. <br /> <br /> I never recommend it. Actually, I don't recommend any "American Pie Presents" movies. Just stick with a nice original trilogy. <br /> <br /> 2/10
