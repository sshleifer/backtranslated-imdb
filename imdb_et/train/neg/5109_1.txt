"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is another "feeling good", so-called "heart-warming", and estimates show that ABC has had time to put together. <br /> <br /> I understand the problems that these families are going through. For that, I'm sorry. But do you not think that placing four wide-screen plasma TVs, a three-flat desktop computer, a terrestrial pool in the back yard, and cabinets full of expensive designer clothing, is a BIT that is too big for a family? Of course, these families have been a lot. Of course, they deserve the most beautiful things they had before. <br /> <br /> But frankly, the things Ty Pennington and his team put into these houses are enough to fit the neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Another thing that really matters to me about this exhibition is how Ty and his team always have something good to say about every little thing about family or family status. By saying to a wheelchair person that he is "so strong" or "very brave", he gets old after a while. It may seem rude, but believe me; see this example and see what i mean. <br /> <br /> All in all, this show is overestimated. If you want to see it, go ahead. This comment is just a headrest on what you look at.
