I didn't expect that much, but I was disappointed. It was my least favorite Halestorm production I've seen. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but I just finished 3 or 4 jokes. Is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy who eats donuts and falls down? What was the heavenly keeper? Fred Willard has been fun with some of his Christopher guests, but it didn't work. They must have spent the entire budget in order to get "known" participants to enter because there were no lighting budgets. It looks like it was filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark. Do you really take so many movies to show that someone is actually shooting and putting on the basket instead of removing and editing the ball that hits the basket? I am trying not to be too critical of low budget comedies, but if you want to see something funny, instead of this movie you will go to the real basketball game.
