This movie was so ridiculous that I didn't even see it. I thought someone had made their own version and duplicated it from a movie shop. This movie made me sick not because it was nice but because I wasted 2 50 !!!! It looks like my brother and I went into the house and made a movie of myself and changed the footage of this slaughterhouse! I've noticed that even the BTK Killer deserves more credit than it wasn't even accurate, I mean the cowboy has probably come from a gaming or BUBBLE GUM OMG. NOT THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!
