OK, I'm not an American, but in my humble Scottish opinion, Steve Martin is never, and has never been a funny man when our posterists are facing south. Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko was a funny man, no doubt thanks to qualified writers and directors and to all the other talented teamworkers who made a great contribution to the comedy of a fun and pointless situation that America has ever done. How could anyone be faithful to even try to copy Phil Silver's character over me. In the case of combined things, the exercise was repeated in the dishonest attempt of Martin to be Peter Seller's inspector Clouseau, the second intermittent attempt, in my opinion, to revive a clearly failed career. Some of your contributors say "Steve Martin is putting his temple in sight", which I would say "balderdash", his portraits have long been forgotten when the Silvers and Sellars awards are dignified for future generations
