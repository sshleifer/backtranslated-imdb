I'm going to make a lot of movies, often I bring my 5-year-old son, I'm so glad I didn't bring him here. However, there are many references to gender and thin watering, but this is not the main reason why I did not take it. In the case of trailers, you believe this is a frivolous comedy; however, the preview is almost all the funny moments. I was expecting it to be interesting, funny or something other than serious; but I almost drowned when the plot's less story was pulled. I understand that dogs can be big companies, saying the whole story is focused on a poorly behaved dog that the owners could not train enough. If a person caused this great harm and chaos, that person would be banned. The worst film I've ever seen with Jenifer Aniston or Owen Wilson is the waste of these talents. The best way to summarize this film is that the couple gets a troubled dog, the couple falls in love with the dog, the dog dies, the couple is sad. End.
