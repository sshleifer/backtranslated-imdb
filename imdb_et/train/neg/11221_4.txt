Lolita is a rebel and she shares some of her sexual stories with sci-fi and fantasy with our wide open eyes. Well, this cinema production is not very good: very bad performance, terrible music and story without any story and any line. HOW, sexual scenes are pretty well done, lots of lesbian scenes and Jacqueline Lovell, as beautiful as Exotic House Of Wax, offer us a very good final and very hot strip show. Only for Lovell fans.
