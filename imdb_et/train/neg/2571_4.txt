Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in the movie you think it doesn't go wrong. But what am I saying? It was a terrible failure. The film speaks of Peter Sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with really strange young people, not to mention the attractive hippie Goldie Hawnis. The film is very inseparable and I didn't understand it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people, but this movie doesn't prove it. <br /> <br /> This song about arabella Cinderella is pretty cool, but that's it. I recommend this movie only to people who want to watch an extreme new movie, it's almost one concept. I think this movie is something other than a sign of the time when it is certain to be experimental and all unusual, the problem is that the quality is completely taken off and writing, not to mention that the direction is just so out. <br /> <br /> Peter Sellers is especially hit and he goes from Dr. Strangelov and being there throughout his career to scams like this and Magic Christian, which was very similar to this context and style, but in this movie there were some funny moments. It's pointless and I'm sad that someone as big as Peter Sellers was in this movie. Not recommended for anyone.
