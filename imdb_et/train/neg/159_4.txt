I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her honesty and honesty both in her private life and as an actor. That's why I found it strange that he would appear in that movie that so distorted those facts. Rescuing His Character From the South, a Canadian ordering company took place in Edmonton, Alberta, which drove a Canadian-designed Twin Otter. The US Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard had abandoned their journey as their capabilities. A few years later, the same company directed the same rescue to bring out the man from the South Pole base. I feel that the film represented a fairly captivating subject and documented a very courageous woman with a scary task. I don't see why manufacturers find it necessary to ignore the bravery of rescue projects and show the level of rescue in the USAF Hercules.
