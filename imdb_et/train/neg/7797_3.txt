This is one of the worst films I've ever encountered, but I want to say that some of the criticisms I heard have turned out to be unreasonable. It has a limited budget and VHS camera, but the actual editing, camera angles, camera movements and scene staging are quite professional. I've seen many movies where "leadership" was much worse. At least scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and has some smart pictures here and there. Forest scenes also contained a decent atmosphere. You can only do so much with the VHS camera, and it does a nice job in the technical work. There is no artistic value. The scene where the camera is put down so that we can view urine in the forest within 15 seconds, represents the artistic style of the film. It's a clean trash ... All the garbage. <br /> <br /> Gore is a decent film for this budget line. It's obviously fake, but there's a lot of it, and it's very extreme. It was a good idea (and that's the only thing that allowed me to do the movie) ... Unfortunately, it's superfluous, especially for the end. <br /> <br /> This is really a terrible movie, but I have to recommend it as a camp. It's really hard to find such a film that is worse than what it has in a unique category.
