This movie is so bad that you almost feel it is polluted. In fact, there is a strong relief when it is over, a relief that you can now take the cartridge back and RUSH back to the video rental store before it contaminates the rest of the video library. I suggested joking when we rent it so that it seemed like a movie where William Hurt "would" present his performance. I thought he wouldn't be trying very hard. But, look, a great number of scenes in this movie are Bill Hurt on the phone! The realization of this irony was the only joy we had with this confusing confusion. Cinematography and editing are twilight and fallen, the story is chaotic and the sound track is barely audible. There is very little resemblance to "Falling Down", but this film was boldly disturbing, with great writing and acting and an interesting sound. The "contaminated person" is just a trap for some old European tourists and looking at it as being traveling in an unknown country along an unknown way back, where you don't speak the language constantly in the rain right after the night when the windscreen keeps foggy. You get a picture? Don't get it.
