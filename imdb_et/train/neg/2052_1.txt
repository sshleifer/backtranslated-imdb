This waste of time is a completely unnecessary reprocessing of a big movie. Nothing new or original will be added except Perry's rebound, which is of marginal interest. There is no documentary feeling in the first film and no raw speed that made it so effective. The sharp Quincy Jones soundtrack, which was added to the original film, is also painfully missing. I can't understand any high ratings at all. That's pretty bad. Why doesn't anyone waste time or money so it would be a mess and why would I waste that time?
