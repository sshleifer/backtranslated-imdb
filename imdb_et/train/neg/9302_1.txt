This movie is just terrible. It's boring, it's low quality, the actors are the worst actors I've ever seen, and the scenario is so bad that it's fun. <br /> <br /> The main actor should be a hot man who gets all the girls, but he's ugly, overweight and looks like he's been in the early 90's. <br /> <br /> All characters have come together with friends over the weekend, but no one really is friends! The couple have not seen the "main" man for more than 5 years and even then they were not really friends. The "date" of the chief man only knows him from work and when there is a girl he can get at the bar. Now tell me you would lose your job to spend the weekend with people who are not even your real friends. Because that's what he does at the beginning of the movie! <br /> <br /> Don't waste this lemon in one minute. I made the movies at home more frightening! <br /> <br />
