Returning is one of those films for the niche group who like movies that are both interfering and distracting. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a lame buisnesswoman who doesn't kill vampires or not let the movie at all naked. I was ready to do this, but I never wanted to put down the worst editing with meaningless setbacks. Finally it turns out that he falls into his car when he was young. Or maybe I was wrong and it was just a setback. It is impossible to say with this film. Do you believe that the same guy who made the army of darkness did this mess? A much better idea is to stay at home and watch the darkness of the army on the Sci Fi channel. This movie had everything: sluts, zombies and a guy with a chainsaw. Not even one of those things was forgotten.
