Horror movies can be very fun with low budget, bad deeds and a bit. I think the film is just missing, because one sudden dull scene after another, people make a ridiculously harmless claw of hand grabbing in the air. If it wasn't so boring, it could be funny. <br /> <br /> The horror film can go a long way from a tired concept, like "college kids haunted by the house", like Evil's Dead Movies, with a similar standard line of fun. Hallow's End, unfortunately, doesn't go far. In fact, it doesn't go anywhere. It spends the better part of the lesson, creating false and anonymous signs of what seems to be an endless drama of interpersonal relationships. I have nothing against character development, not even a horror movie, but these are strictly one-dimensional characters (alpha-man, milquetoast, ... um ...) forty plus bloodless, with them in the minute of beating, was more terrible than at the start of bloodshed. Well, it meant bloodshed anyway. When college kids change whatever they dressed for their haunted house (one vampire carrying the O.R. scrub and some white pancake), they see pretty much the way they did in the costumes of their amused haunted house; Dead Hate Life, using a similar theme, is a comparable master. There is really no gore to talk about, nor any real fears. <br /> <br /> I've been thinking of any approach. If it had to be a tense, relaxed horror movie (which would explain why things were moving so slowly), pathetic sex scenes and cheap monsters would have canceled it. If it should be a real blood and a ghost fiction film (which would explain the script) ... where is the blood and guts? And the anti-climax is one movie I've ever seen. This is a film that, although it does not have a narrator through the film, is reserved by voice commands because all the meaningless dialogue was simply not enough. <br /> <br /> It's hard ... coming out of it, I don't know if I'm just through a Christian horror movie. Maybe there was no opening "I know hell" wasn't, but there are some tips (or mismanagement - I'm not sure what). For all the contempt of the film, a line like "gosh-darnit" is a bit absurd and so most of the crucifix, worshiping, godly and devil-frightening, especially after some tiny scenes of R&D (one heterosexual) one lesbian). If this is a Christian company (the Highland Myst logo is even a bit like a cross-strike), this film will weigh into an atheist camp. The omnipotent creature cannot be this bad filmmaker. <br /> <br />
