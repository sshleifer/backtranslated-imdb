Imagine the harsh annoying Gothic children of the college, throw a tie and story into a terrible act, and you're still not close to how bad this film is. <br /> <br /> Shot badly, bad effects, worse. Won the test of shocking horror. Anyone I have shown to get depressed. Sexual scenes are disturbing, not necessarily about their content, but more because they are just something you want to stop as soon as possible. The last sex scene is just unpleasant, even before she reaches the guy. <br /> <br /> I'm one of those people who love watching movies that people hate, so I picked it up. But for your own sake, save yourself time and avoid this fear. It's so bad. I literally threw garbage.
