An insignificant and little intertwined (haha!) 80 horror as in the Thirteenth is still twelve, but it can be considered fun if you look at it right. Special effects are sticky, acting scary and the scenario seems to be a few important paragraphs! "Brain" takes place in a typical quiet American urban environment, where every young person works in the same canteen and where a cool high school boy rubs cherry bombs in the toilet. It is here that the TV guru, named Dr Blake and his divine pet brain, is beginning to look for nationwide mind control. Under the "Independent Thinkers" label, the giant chewing brain sends waves through televisions and forces innocent viewers to kill! How cool is that? Now it's the Meadowvale teen rebels to save the world! The funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr. Blake and his monstrous brain really are coming from. There are obvious references to extraterrestrial life, but it is. Meh, who needs a background in such a movie, really? Unfortunately, there is not so much bloodshed, and the "evil" brain looks like a too big shock. The only more or less interesting elements for horror killers are the filmmakers and the team. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same men who made "Bloody Birthday" (innocent pleasure for me) and "Plague". Both of them are much better films and they decided to leave the film industry. The most familiar face is undoubtedly the great David Gale, whose fear fans forever worship their role in Re-Animator. The girl named Christine Kossak offers a nudity factor and she's probably a great talent? He has exactly 3 films from his repertoire, which is his "masterpiece". Her debut was credited as a "runaway model" and "3 men and children" are called "one of Jack's girls". I really don't know how he feels his career as an actor?
