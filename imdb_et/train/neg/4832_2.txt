I was curious to see how a little vision 2008 movie somehow won the Oscar for the best picture of 2009 and thus went to see The Hurt Locker. Unfortunately, what I got within two hours was a serious confirmation that this film had won prizes only during the screen. <br /> <br /> The direction and visual style of this movie are some of the weaker you will ever see. if it is not occupied with respecting another Bourne's identity with horrific, disturbing "trembling dolls" visual images, it will show all the features of the second level daily soap opera in terms of lens. <br /> <br /> "plot" is complicated, testimonials are as well developed as rejected by Beetle Bailey's comic book ideas and dialogue - in cases where the film gives up being "minimalist" and for no apparent reason makes one or two soldiers into the right boxes - have some of the worst ever registered. fairly, actors do everything in their power, just not enough to hide how bad a project is. <br /> <br /> The whole film has the feeling that it is meant to be some "mockumentary" that they were left with humor and so edited as well as possible to give it a serious drama. <br /> <br /> If you spend two hours on this film, they will be two hours, which you will never get back to, and two hours will be wasted to regret your rest of the life.
