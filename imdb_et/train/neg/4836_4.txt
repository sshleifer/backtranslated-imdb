Let's start with simple lines. From the viewer's side, there are a few good "director details", some views of the movie scenes. Special effects are good enough, good effect / good terrain. But the story is too simple. This shows how the elite army's bomb unit lives, acts and sometimes dies. It shows the drama of living in war. As a film-addicted "addictive" man in my film experience, I missed the clicks that my eyes and mind have stuck on the screen. One thing that has to be in the film to keep it in mind is the ability of the viewer to film reality and time. It didn't happen to me. I became aware of the whole movie. not enough use as a film celebrity generator. More than a movie war, its popularity is growing. <br /> <br /> A simple idea: if it were World War II or World War I, but changed time, everything remained the same whether it was given? Of course not. Why? Because there are big ones that raise the bar high. <br /> <br /> Compared to Oscar's competitors, I do not believe that all the prizes he won have been given correctly.
