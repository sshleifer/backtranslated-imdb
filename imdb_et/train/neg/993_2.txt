I'm writing this movie and the "irreversible" (in this) famous scene. So you will be warned if you haven't seen the movie yet. This is just my thoughts, why I think the film will fail (eventually - pun intended). <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson is wisely working and gives almost a few years younger (teenager) other words). The villain man is good but loses his "evil" touch just before the end. If she doesn't really change, why would she let her bind her? He wouldn't have that time. Then we also have a bartender / 2 rape. Actually, I don't think you need her. At least not in the second rape, but more later on. <br /> <br /> Repeat the story. Rosarios' character is sexually insecure, maybe even lesbian trends (see her female friend). It was not intentional, as Rosario himself says, but there is sexual tension between them. The Rosario character meets men who are a sexual Predator in all the bad minds. But he gives him the impression. <br /> <br /> Rosario noted that his character had a boyfriend. I ask you to differ. Because he's acting as if he were his first boyfriend, which also emphasizes his phone conversation with his mother. Talking about the mother, there's another problem here. After the first rape, Rosarios' character does not tell anyone what happened. The fact that her relationship with her mother is very close, is something that is not being studied. If Rosarios' character would no longer invite her mother or behave strangely, her mother would be worried as crazy. There were so many options here. Also his female friend: We see him at the party, it is obvious that something is going on and the "boom" is gone. <br /> <br /> The first rape is almost unbearable for viewing. But it seems like a pinch when you compare it to the end (rape), which seems to get you banged! After Rape No. 1 we can stretch out the scenes too. The yarns are opened (as his construction shows he may be a lesbian, like a man who tried to hit him ...) but stayed open. No real social contact is created when you leave the barman who is involved in the 2nd and final rape. It is obvious that he is not a "nice" boy and his character is a bit crushed. But when Rosarios' character returns to the class, being in the film seems to be pointless. We get a point that the character of Rosarios is no longer the same that he went "bad" and can hurt people. (Too Much) Many scenes show exactly this, its nature without emotion just about drugs and other things. Back to rap # 1, who cheats with the test, gets Rosarios' character closed and they decide to come together again (really?). As absurd as it sounds, the man meets with him without having seen him before, with another girl (very likely he will rape him, even though we never see something like this fortunately) and his football career. Well the career is stretching and he is bullied. It's an attempt to give your character some depth and it almost works, but again it's a clich√© to stay with you. So, Rap # 1 presents Rosarios a character ... why exactly? Because he promised him it was his day? Really? Such a man never loses control, especially with a woman he raped before ... I think it should show us how stupid he is. The boy's boyfriend would have worked as someone who could have kicked him out or hit him, but he allowed him to do so, just seems wrong. Another option would be a drug in his drink. <br /> <br /> So the rape # 1 gets rid of it and sees the eyes shut, and let's see that Rosarios character binds him to bed .... seriously, it's just crazy! But what's next is even crazy. First he speaks to him, then he "closes" him and forces him into him. It's as hard to look as the rape scene number one. That doesn't mean what this man deserves or not, it's just intense. And of course it was their purpose. Now that he is "ready", the barman man comes and rapes ... rapist # 1. If it really should act as a revenge movie, it would have been better if the Rosarios character itself had done all "revenge." Having a henchman who does the job takes away everything that was built up. <br /> <br /> It doesn't have to be entertaining / enjoyable, it's hard to watch and it's Art-house. But at the end of the 10-minute (I did not consider) rape scene, just crushes everything. Rosarios' character is more or less, just looking at what happens. Which brings me the greatest disappointment. <br /> <br /> Irreplaceable Comparison: "Irreplaceable" was a rape scene, but the movie went on (even when it was time back). Rosario finally looks at the camera and says something about how to get over it. First, it's a bit too late for him to see that after the initial rape. And secondly, and most importantly, this is where Art-house film should come. It is more interesting to see when Rosarios' character followed another rape scene and how he would deal with what he had done. But then again he didn't really do as much (see above) ... the broken character that the movie cut off ... <br /> <br /> Good intentions (Talia and Rosario had worked before) but can't go on most things give, but they did it (even if you see what they meant, it must be convincing, otherwise it won't work) ... not to mention a longer rape scene, as they are ...
