It happened to Assault in Prescient 13 in 2005, it happened to The Lost Boys in 2008 and now it has happened to another classic from the 80's Wargames ... :( Why, oh why, oh why can't I Hollywood will never learn? Alone ...! They can't be rebuilt ...! They suck ...! We all hate them ....!. <br /> <br /> Those who haven't seen the original 1983 version with Matthew Broderick & Ally Sheedy, let's rent / buy it now ....! Hardware may seem dated, special effects aren't new millennia, but it still hurts the garbage of hands. <br /> <br /> from us who lived through the 80s when hacking was sexy, the Internet was mysterious and your disks came as an 8-inch floppy, but we now have the wisdom to avoid this movie like a fusion war! Never before had a "beautiful chess game" seemed a better choice.
