Before seeing this movie, I waited loosely for fictional drama on the ideas of the book; Instead, it is a book interrupted by dramatic scenes that illustrate various "diseases". It didn't bother me much, but it prevented my movie from enjoying. In my opinion, one story, or even two or three long stories, made in parts of the film would be preferred. When you start a movie with a psychology text, you need to find more interesting (and preferably exact) text than that. The film drags the parts at a time when it is a bit more than a video-encyclopedia of 19th-century sexual psychology and would be totally intolerable if it is not sexual (because for most of us, even me, "sex = interesting"). Fortunately, there are many stories with the development of the real character that draws us. <br /> <br /> But disappointingly, Krafft-Ebing's sexual theories are mostly unchallenged. I had hoped that he would use the stories to show how his archaic views of spiritual psychology, which many still hold until today, are. <br /> <br /> So finally, what do you have? A detailed catalog of some of the fetishes and orientations, some interesting stories that show some of the "sexual abnormalities" attempts and miseries before they heal. For most movies, the film moves with the speed of awakening (and mood). And if a film with a clearly low budget, cinematography and acting are not exactly the top level. Although I * was * satisfied with music, costume and interior design. <br /> <br /> I felt that the theme of this movie was next to me, and I still feel it is below average. It deserves 3/10; 4/10 if I were very generous. I can't imagine that someone who enjoys it would not be against sexual fetishism.
