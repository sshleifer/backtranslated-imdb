I just finished this series of marathons, and it was agonizing to look further. From the fiction of historical elements, O'Herlihy's terrible accent to later episodes, the play goes even further. If you are looking for some of the lower quality productions in the generalized WW2 fluff, then I could recommend the 1st season, but after that avoid anything, it degenerates into one step of a soap opera where there is an ever-worse story and sensitivity. The Old B&W movie is by far the best form of entertainment to which Colditz's name has been added, and even that is not what one would expect.
