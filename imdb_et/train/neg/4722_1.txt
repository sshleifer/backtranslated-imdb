do not look at this documentary and Serbian propaganda for this documentary and see facts and truth http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/ <br /> <br /> The documentary series of Yugoslav deaths (five episodes) is a carefully prepared and studied report extended mass bleeding, which marked the end of the old federal Yugoslavia and lasted almost the first half of the 1990s. It includes a large number of news and interviews with the parties, both in "Yugoslavia" and in other ways. The only real "correction" that could be made for this amazing achievement would be that the Balkan countries are involved in subsequent developments after the program was drawn up. It really did happen for BBC television repetition in the late 1990s, but adding some of the more recent events would help improve this admirable and perfect work. Maybe there may be another episode? The very short title of this documentary was made even more relevant when the now-mentioned Serbian and Montenegrin Federal Republic abandoned the concept of "Yugoslavia" - a much belated and formal acknowledgment of what happened years ago. /> <br /> not fiction like "Yugoslavia: avoidable war (1999)"
