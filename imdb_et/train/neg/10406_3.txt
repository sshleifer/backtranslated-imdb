Warning: This review includes smaller spoilers. <br /> <br /> Well, the first tremor writers are officially out of ideas. I'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two are pretty good for the video price. Shakes 4: Legends begin with a very boring film. Where the hell are Graboids ??? <br /> <br /> Thanks to the relative lack of Graboids in the first 90 minutes, I am convinced that this series entry is expected to be a "character study". Unfortunately, there is no interesting sign in the movie, except for Billy Drago's character, who is given too few lines, too little to do, and finally too little screen time. The second and third films were recorded by Michael Gross Burt Gummer. If nothing was done on the screen, you can be sure that Burt Gummer was also interested in listening and / or watching. But in this film, Gross Hiram Gummer plays a very poor and boring substitute. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, when Graboids (Dirt Dragons in this movie) are on the screen, they look good, but it's about as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> I was impressed to see that Tremors 4 was 101 minutes long. Pretty good for video. But after that, I'm sure this movie is 15 minutes too long. There are long dialogues that are boring and do not transmit a plot. Was it rushed to get this movie? I think more time could and should have been spent on the script. <br /> <br /> I thought I was hit by a gold well when I saw Tremors 4 packed for sale .... Tremors !!! What luck I thought you would pay for # 4 for free # 1. Well after watching Tremors 4 I like to think I paid for the original and got this mess free, I can't imagine paying a single dime to Tremor 4. The series for fans is best to forget to Tremors 4: The legend begins even exists. <br /> <br /> Shakes 4: The legend starts with a 3/10 rate.
