Do not listen to the misleading title of "werewolf wife". Europeans are known for their fear films, emphasizing sex and nudity against real fears, but it is just too much here. The "Widow's Wife" seems to be a buggy sex scene with a headline crazy and brutally killing her partner. Have fun for the first time, but after a hundred minutes it will quickly become monotonous. He is not even a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor was a lychee. The film is not even able to decide on this tone, as the first ten minutes (setback) is a legitimate supernatural horror (I thought I was a classic in the trash after that) in a rather poor study in which a woman is repeatedly abused and tortured to a thriller. Finally, the director requires it to be based on a real story. Yes, all right. <br /> <br /> To be fair, production has some fun aspects. The title werewolf wife is a looker and there are some nice gore effects and nude scenes. But they become quite monotonous. The dubbed dialogue is also quite fun in the camp, especially the most rocking doctor in the world (he runs in the workplace). Unfortunately, the movie becomes quite irritating. There is no real plot or anything else. It is a shame because reading the description felt that the film had real potential. The "werewolf wife" is far too long, moving slowly and a little too meaningless even according to the standards of the use channels. (4/10)
