I also liked the high (8.5) rating of the movie and it was very disappointing. I had just seen a couple of good foreign films and waited for it in three consecutive, but it wasn't. I went with a Spanish friend who felt the same way. There is not a lot of land if it exists. I don't necessarily need it in the movie, but it must somehow entertain or bring me along. The best thing I could say is that he wants to be an Altman-esque movie, though an extremely small ensemble. Of course, there are moments, but a few moments will ease from 97 minutes of slow. I don't understand the high rating of this movie. I'll give her 3. <br /> <br />
