At least I was able to enjoy the mocking of the film, which is surprising because I barely sit through it. To be honest, I think the DVD cover covers more than the whole movie. And saying it is the same manager as Boogeyman, when this new version just came out ... nice guys, it was misleading to be fascinated. The only thing that betrayed me more than what was copycat was her hairstyle. You usually see only such hair on a ten-year-old boy and that sign worked. The film looks like a D + grad student in a film school would have wanted to use the techniques of every film he was studying when visiting classes .... sometimes there are fewer friends. Through this I would lose a random plot with twists that did not lead anywhere or were inexplicable. All this makes a bad movie, but if the end is not even close, it pulls very badly. Undoubtedly, this is the worst film I've ever seen, and it includes the latest French video of my friends about college years, but hey, maybe I'm a bit biased, I mean I got extra play. P.S. I don't even think it deserves a star ... not even a party. NOT YOU !!
