This is definitely the time when Axis & Allies played espionage games all over North Africa and around the world. It is not the best of the films, but certainly not the worst of the budget films, as it was the case with the classic of war. <br /> <br /> Duncan's "Cisco Kid" Renaldo was really good in his first feature film. I really enjoyed Harry Parke's activities (credited as Parkyarkarkus). Why he never got bigger roles outside of me. He played a perfect friend / partner role and recorded the movie ... imho. <br /> <br /> As has been said, this movie was part of the Superbox-Mart budget package titled War Classics. Eight movies for eight bucks, which also included other unheard-of movies with some decent stars trying to pay bills. <br /> <br /> This script is ... well, not so hot. Editing and cinematography are ... worse. If you can miss it all and want to see the upcoming Cisco Kid & great sidekick that unfortunately never fulfills its true potential, be sure to do it! Otherwise, you must watch other WW2 movies. <br /> <br /> -Thundero.
