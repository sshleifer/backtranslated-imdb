Character by Charles Dance in this movie "Bollocks!" No plot, no character development, and absolutely unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Full of things that just won't happen in the real world (because when were British police inspectors armed with hand-held shoulder pads?). Filled with errors (Bulgarian trains in London?). Complete dull and artificial dialogue. Managing / Editing is terrible - a strange handheld camera frame that does not add anything to the movie except the vague feeling of the sea disease; confusing cuts; there is no structure. <br /> <br /> The character of Wesley Snipes is totally atypical - why should we care what happens to her? Direct video? Direct to Trash!
