I found a "I Dream Of Jeanie" on a DVD in a $ 1.00 container at Wal-Mart. When I saw that it was Stephen Foster's story, being a musician and music teacher, I had to see it. I had no idea in what year it was made because it didn't say on the cover, just that it was a 1939 "Sewanee River" remake. Bill Shirley's depiction of the composer is sometimes painful, sometimes ridiculous. The man has no testosterone and it's witty all the time! It is a hard time for me to believe that Stephen Foster thought the music publishers would benefit him by publishing his songs ... without paying him for them! In addition to this ridiculous thought, Ray Middleton and his black-headed "Christy Minstrels" are a 20-minute segment that performs Stephen Foster's songs that were difficult to watch. I can't believe that someone thinks this movie is suitable for our resurrection at this time. It is embarrassing and should not be forgotten. Fortunately, never forget Stephen Foster's songs ... also the depiction of Eileen Christy Jeanie was certainly the lowest point in Hollywood history.
