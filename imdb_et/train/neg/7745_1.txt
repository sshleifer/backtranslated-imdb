Where to start? special effects should be called special defects when the director called "action", he also thought to the actors that they were performing the worst. Perhaps he was upset with the producers and wanted to make sure they did not restore one cent of their investment and that the work would be a case study of how not to film. Or maybe he hated the art school and wanted to be an accountant, but his family wouldn't let him. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is sure who will work for him in the future is that he is in love with him (so his objectivity jumped through the window) or because he changed his name and deleted all previous earlier references.
