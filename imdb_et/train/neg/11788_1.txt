It was one of the worst movies EVER !!!!!!!! It was so bad, I laughed through the movie! The plot was SO-cheesy; especially the end. This movie will change from the end of the world disaster to save-eels! I mean, c'mon! And I swear ... I think they're using the eel SOCK PUPPET! And in the middle, it was a terrible kiss with two main characters separated. If predictable! It was so terrible that my mother, my sister and I couldn't finish it and when we finished it, it was about a year later! The second time we watched it and we finished it this time, we made MST3K-like comments throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Look at it only when you're a movie basher! Make fun comments, check it out at a smile, and I think big laughs. Also observe mockery. An explanatory metaphor for this film: This film is a very shallow soil full of cheese and socks.
