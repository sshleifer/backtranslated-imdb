I was expecting comedy like "Big Mama" movies. Instead, the film had a strange mix of comedy, drama and love. <br /> <br /> This film consists of three plots: the first one includes Madea and her child support. The second involves a woman who is involved with a rich man who abuses her. The third involves a relationship with a single mother with 2 children and one father. <br /> <br /> There's very little comedy in the movie. The film also contains a number of very twisted messages. For example, Madea strikes a stepchild with a lap (comedy) to persuade her to stretch out. The child is doing it himself. Obviously the kids are beating. <br /> <br /> Plots (with the mother's consent) dealing with child rape. There are scenes with old men who are related to them. (Ogling is at the family reunion.) The movie jumps from plot to plot so you are always out of balance. Is it a comedy, a love story or a drama? In fact, this is nothing but a waste of time and money.
