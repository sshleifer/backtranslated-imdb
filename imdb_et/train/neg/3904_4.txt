I admit that Emma, ​​in my opinion, is the only major novel ever written. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation. Jane Austen comes to the top of her art here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the best palimpsest. <br /> <br /> A comparison with the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable - this version is a much more faithful book for the spiritual spirit and much more enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> Here are some good elements - Kate Berkinsale (having previously played at Flora Poste's Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's wiser spiritual twin) is wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes Frank Churchill a decorative one. Production is beautiful, but the interiors are too dark. <br /> <br /> There are, however, many major problems. The first is Mark Strong - first he doesn't see Mr Knightley. This is probably because he plays a role as he is a rude Victorian. It is badly tuned. <br /> <br /> Another problem is long. Simply put, the film is too short - it must be twice as long to get the right feeling. <br /> <br /> Finally, the quality of customization is paramount. Austen is the dream of an adapter - all the dialogue already exists. It only needs to be cut and placed correctly. Andrew Davies seems to be different. First of all, this is a rather gloomy film and the last thing Emma should be is gloomy. More importantly, Davies has seen fit to rewrite the end as a bucolic party. Which planet, or Thomas Hardy, little work, does it come from? It is completely out of style with the novel style and spirit. And I believe that it makes great sense to try to make improvements - perfection.
