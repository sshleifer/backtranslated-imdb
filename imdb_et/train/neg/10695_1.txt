... Ok, I've read this movie somewhere on the internet and many have criticized how bad and sucking this film is. And I would not agree any more. Then I saw this movie on DVD, I thought about it twice, and then I came to this movie for commercial TV on television. Fortunately, I saved my money for this piece. I had sacrificed my sleep for this movie and soon it turned out that this film couldn't satisfy me. So I can't judge how the movie was made, but still ... it still sucks. Like those who liked this movie, I would apologize for the flame of this movie and tell you how this film is a miracle. I don't know what you think about this movie?
