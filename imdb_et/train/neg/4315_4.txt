Seriously the only good thing about this year's ceremony was the winners. <br /> <br /> Although the ceremony itself was quite short, it was still a bit boring. I think it's a good time to look for a new director and producer who can do something new. It is quite obvious that this year they tried to show more hip and more attractive to the younger audience, giving Beyonce a show and giving P. Didd and Prince a list. Chris Rock also promised to be a performer attempt to renew the ceremony and make it more attractive. None of them really worked. <br /> <br /> Of course, Chris Rock is a funny man, but he wasn't really a good performer. I just saw him as a man who just talked about every now and then between different categories. His presence was not as great as Billy Crystal. <br /> <br /> The prize transfer was also stupid from time to time. Don't let everyone on the stage, but sharing some of the awards in the middle of the theater was just strange. <br /> <br /> However, I no longer remember that the prize winners were more satisfied. No movie gave prizes because the last few years have always been. Does that mean it was a good year for competing films? I do not belive. I think most of the films are forgotten for a long time in 20 years, with the exception of "Million Dollar Baby" and "Christ". Of course, I do not agree with the award given every year, for example, Caleb Deschanel should have won the best film art, not that I do not like Robert Richardson's work, he did a really amazing job for most of Oliver Stone's work, but I feel that Deschanel deserved the prize more. I would also have liked Jim Miller and Paul Rubell to win the best editing and John Debney for the best music. But so, academy awards can hardly please everyone, I understand it. There are always complaints about winners. <br /> <br /> It was also funny to see that most of the prize winners were more nervous than candidates and winners. Did the Prince say that any of the candidates' names are right now? And does Sean Penn have a sense of humor? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I Hope They Didn't Answer" Irons were the best performers of the night. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very forgotten exhibition, but with beautiful winners. <br /> <br /> 4/10
