I stopped losing this episode because I thought the deaths of Ana-Lucia and Libby were unnecessary and really frustrating. Then I learned that they kept Libby the next episode! Gah! I can't handle it. <br /> <br /> I liked this show in the first season, but it certainly stayed down in the second season, I found Jack and Locke's little religious frustration. The death of Rodriguez & Watros characters was the last shoulder! <br /> <br /> I give this episode 4/10 because I finished this Alias ​​legend J.J. Abrams. I hope his series will improve in the future.
