I was miserable when I saw it at the Sidewalk Film Festival. The sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this film was the final pound of the coffin. Being a devoted fan of Lewis Carroll's "Alice" books, I was very excited about this premiere of the movie, making it much more uncomfortable. Usually I am enthusiastic about modern repetitions if they are treated well. It is usually interesting to see parallels between the past and the current story. Unfortunately, this film was a less modern and pop culture perversion. The adaptation of the characters in the original seemed minor and usually proves to be terribly annoying. It is probably not that the actors were not very good either. Most of the performances were ridiculously up, which I assumed was due to a bad direction or an attempt to offset a bad script. I'll never laugh through the length of the movie. All the jokes were outdated references not so much to the current events that lose a definite loss over time. Indeed, the only highlight of the film was the starting sequence where the white rabbit is on the way to Alice, but even then this result was a poor imitation of Danny Elfman's work. I also have to say that transforming the croquet into rave dance was terrible. It was undoubtedly the lower point of the film. <br /> <br /> What is a joke. Don't look at this movie. After that I was really angry.
