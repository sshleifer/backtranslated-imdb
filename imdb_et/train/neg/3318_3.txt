How Good Is Gwyneth Paltrow! It's the right movie for him ... too bad that he's completely out. I haven't read Jane Austen's book, but I can't believe it is so superficial and the characters aren't much more than cartoons. After 2 hours, it was probably not so easy to reduce the book to about 600 pages, but I was expecting more than just seeing the old furniture and teapots. I took relief every time I saw an actor who did not cross the movement (a few times).
