It displaces my way of thinking when someone overcomes such a film and says it is one of the worst films. It is by no means one of the worst, but still not a good movie, but not the worst. Go see Death Nurse or Blood Lake and come back to me and tell me if you think Night brings Charlie to the worst. The film has a decent work and editing of the camera, which is much more than I can say about many extremely dark films. <br /> <br /> The film does not die on the screen, there is one death where you can see how his trimming saw his neck, but all other deaths are hardly interesting. But the lack of graphical violence on the screen does not mean that it is not a sliding film, but a bad one. <br /> <br /> The film was probably not meant to be too serious. The film arrived at the end of the second slip cycle, so it was certainly a reflection of the traditional sliding elements made on the tongue in the cheek. For example, after killing, Charlie goes to the "welcome" sign of the city and denotes less people. This is something that can only be laughed. <br /> <br /> If you're in slasher movies, be sure to watch this movie. It's a bit different than your usual movie with two killers, but not much. The comedy of the film tells the audience a lot of relaxation and not to shoot so that God is serious. You can forget about the movie. I remember it because I love the name.
