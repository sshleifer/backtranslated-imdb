In fact, it had to stop. Don't get me wrong, I love bad monster movies. But it was too boring, no matter what kind of music that never happens to you. The actor had too many teeth and the moment he contacted one animal was too obvious a clich√©. This movie completely captures the DVD, which seems quite interesting. A giant monster is expected from the lid, but they are not as gigantic as the expected eels. Move to watch another movie called The Killer Rats, but this is another review. Deep Shock was really a mess, a big shame, because it looks like a very big budget.
