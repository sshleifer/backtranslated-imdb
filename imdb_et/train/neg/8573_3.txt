I don't like Sean Penn very much, and this early work, the Indian runner, is no exception. The film has no kernel, it is painted in a sort of redneck, an anti-authoritarian tweeness that all honestly taints most of Penn's work, her last job even more than before. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole batch seems to create such a fundamentally banal product that apparently manifestly against honesty, but mostly reaches to the praiseworthy pro-wrestling and moral, almost the same as Hallmark cards would have developed the hell Angels welcome line and put on for a long time, Deliverance, a good movie. The behavior of Viggo Mortensen is much more plausible here than the ridiculous East Prom he did with Cronenberg, and that's it. The film is dead meaningless and seems to be an exercise, several techniques, more than a story. But for Kudos Charles Bronson, he proves he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis's character. 10 Ranging 10 from India.
