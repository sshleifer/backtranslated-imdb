There are many obvious leaps in this film. Let's just face it, the main reasons why anyone would watch it for Leo and Cate, who might not be the best actors in this movie. I'm not saying they're not good actors, I say they beat in this movie. The special effects were decent (and I say that the filmmakers did a good job of making the ship look pleasing), but IT has even a lot of big mistakes. For example, just before the ship is moving, you will see the image of the unfinished blue screen behind the main characters. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I love the story of REAL Titanic, but I find this movie an insult to this story. Editing was cruel - there is no reason for the film to be over 2 1/2 hours (except for the MAYBE biographical film), the writing and the scenario were terribly cunning. <br /> <br /> I say the music was perhaps better than I would have predicted (and not just "My heart starts" song too). There is one scene that seems to me when the ship is sinking and bass music is heard. This can be a highlight of the movie. As for the whole mood, it was extremely boring. I was easier than sad when Jack died, which I know is not what the director intended. <br /> <br /> I find it terrible in the nut shell that they changed the Titanic's beautiful story over the hypothetical chick flick.
