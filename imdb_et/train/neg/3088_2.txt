1. Aliens resemble plus toys and hand-made dolls, but they have hands that don't work. <br /> <br /> 2. Aliens learned about intergalactic spaceships, but they don't know how to unlock an unlocked vault but can open a door that is held by five people. <br /> <br /> 3. Old security guards know how to get C4, and just wait for the right time to use it, for example, when they suddenly get fired without explanation. <br /> <br /> 4. Apparently, in the 80s, US military camp camp included a number of "garden tools" sessions, including killing pirate spin. <br /> <br /> 5. To impress your proud girl, you have to "save the world from aliens ... err ... neighborhood". <br /> <br /> 6. All women are bitches either publicly or secretly. <br /> <br /> 7. Twilight nightclubs look like bad places to eat. <br /> <br /> 8. Scummy reporters doubles as dancers to The Fontanelles (how did they speak?) who can only do a bad 60's dance performance. <br /> <br /> 9. Army private dreams that they are Rambo. <br /> <br /> 10. Garnets probably have a "flash bang" setting. <br /> <br /> 11. Live burning will probably leave only one hand with a small burn. <br /> <br /> 12. US Army stars are always in the area and do nothing about the aliens in this area. <br /> <br /> 13. Aliens are always always "home", which means back to the vault where they were unlocked. <br /> <br /> 14. Aliens are attracting bright lights, apparently in the Los Angeles area, that the main character is the most brightly lit thing in the area. <br /> <br /> 15. Displaying 16 parking spaces in the film makes the audience amazing. <br /> <br /> 16. The 80s vans have apparently terrible suspension systems. <br /> <br /> 17. In this movie, comedy should happen. <br /> <br /> 18. This movie should be a horror. <br /> <br /> 19. This film should be looted and honored. <br /> <br /> 20. This film heals insomnia. <br /> <br /> 21. Apparently, garden tools will make electronic keyboard noise when used, not just in combat (tell me I'm not the only one who noticed it). <br /> <br /> Just the truth is this movie has just come out wrong. Period. Bones do not have much meat and do nothing very well. Even average. It's just bad. But I have seen much worse and the rake fight scene is pure comedy gold, deliberate or otherwise. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - Jaws 4 were worse than that. At least the film never took it seriously.
