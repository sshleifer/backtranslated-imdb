I had a clear misfortune to catch the two worst films of 2004 this morning: first, the CGI-led emptiness of the Riddick Chronicle, and then the embarrassing vanity known as Greendale. One paid multimillions and other costs, but both are bad. Really, very bad. <br /> <br /> I should say I am not the world's biggest Neil Young fan, but he has given his share of classical stories: from Buffalo Springfield (whose best recordings were Young compositions) to Rust Never Sleeps. Harvest and Mirror Ball, the man has put some really great songs. Unfortunately, there are no good songs and some good stories in Greendale, and the film around them is a truly valuable and simplified political slogan. Absolutely no merit like art and unimpressive as polemic, Greend is best forgotten. Buy a book if you feel compelled to contribute to the Young bank account.
