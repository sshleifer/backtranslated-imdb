I'm a big fan of terror and zombie films are my favorite. That means Zombie 3 is one of the absolute worst films I've ever seen. So let's say I really enjoyed it, it's the best bad movie I've seen for a long time. The story is similar to Dan O'Bannon's "Return of the Living Dead", but this movie was deliberately funny, the opposite. It has some of the most ridiculous acts I've ever seen, especially the character of the principal scientist. His scenes with the general were just hysterical. There are also consequences for the subpar and in many cases sloppy and death scenes are often just downright fools. This, of course, makes it even more fun. POSSIBLE SPOILER - The worst is a scene where a man opens the refrigerator door and sees a broken zombie head that opens his eyes and somehow CLEARS HIGH (apparently pulled intuitively with a little string), locking the boys around the neck, killing him. Zombie heads now have the opportunity to swim in the air? It violates all the physical knowledge that is known to man, and it is one of the most absurd things ever filmed. It's just one of many really funny moments in idiotic confusion. I can't believe it is so highly appreciated. If you're a fan of bad movies, do it yourself and rent it.
