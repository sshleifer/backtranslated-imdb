Regardless of the overall pleasant plot and expensive production, one can ask how the director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes. Where were the Japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants? Not in payroll obviously. <br /> <br /> A Japanese friend smiled loudly at some of the cultural absurds he was looking at. In a later conversation, he said: "Imagine that a Finnish director will make a film about Fnnish in the American Civil War, using blonde Swedish actors as officials and French as confederates. Perhaps some people in Finland may not realize that the ring skirt was" missing a strap "or recognize the strange hair of Jane Mansfield, but they did not believe in their eyes or ears in Atlanta and laugh in the aisles ... a great story and photography is cursed. <br /> <br /> So ... watching Geisha's memories was painful for everyone who know the nuances of Japanese culture, the actual geisha or the Japanese dress, and that was the theme of the film! Hollywood is amazing from the point of view of making the film - they often get big money rightly by letting details that really polish movies, wrongly wrong. The movie from Japan: Geisha's memories are at the same time embarrassingly better and worse.
