I agree with most other boys. Waste of photons and valuable time. <br /> <br /> Almost no fun is worth the paper being written. The only highlight of my pov is Olli Dittrich Pinocchio. ("Egal, ich muss eh Waldsterben") It resembles old times with RTL Samstag Nacht. It is difficult to describe the actors' performances, as most of them do not even look good during production and simply "do their thing". The camera is OK, the plot is ridiculous, I think you would be ashamed even when you discuss it with a lot of beers. <br /> <br /> Besides that, I always created all the time, wondering how such a script might even consider production and wait for the end. <br /> <br /> My 9-year-old son was happy, but then he is so little at this age :-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, the 1-point rating here is almost 1 point too much. .
