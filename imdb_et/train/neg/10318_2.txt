Who wants to show terrible "comedy" like a little mosque prairie? Only two types of people I think are the ones who look at it: One, Muslims and Liberal Defenders proclaimed by themselves for each ethnic group that is so excited to show Muslims that it's not even important if the show is good or funny (which is not). Two, old people and people whose idea of ​​comedy is incredibly predictable, poorly written, hidden jokes. <br /> <br /> The CBC really needs to look at what they do and who is their audience. If they only write comedy for really old people, think what's happening, their audience will soon die and have no audience. I'd be curious who even writes for this show? Do you think it's actually Muslims or hip, funny young people? No, I bet old white boys who have written the same jokes about the same type of bad CBCs since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> When you look at the CBC comedy, Air Farce has only been finally taken off the air (thank you for the good!), but we still have flat ducks like this for 22 minutes and Rick Mercer we pay, not to mention this bad pretext for "comedy". It should be funny and funny? Only the CBC thinks this flat show is funny or funny at all. Shame on the CBC to destroy our tax rates shows that only a few people are bothering.
