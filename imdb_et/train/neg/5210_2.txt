First, let me be honest. I didn't watch this movie. I looked at the first five minutes and when I realized that I was almost asleep, I decided that I could go ahead and see if it changed later. This movie is just a collection of sheep samples that makes an already uninteresting and badly spoken story that will never be: a decent horror movie. Because I feel it is important to say that even a film with poor special effect can be good if it is well done. This movie is not and only puts you in a deep sleep when you try to watch it. Finally, I feel it is important to say that this film is in the public interest, so if you feel you have to look at it completely as an Internet search, it will definitely show you where you don't have to pay to watch it in a movie.
