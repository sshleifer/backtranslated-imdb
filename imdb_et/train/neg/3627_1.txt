I'm never a classic film. I liked movies like Patton, Going My Way, The Green, My Valley, The Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, The Wind, Arab Lawrence, and Citizen Kane. However, I would rather look at any of these films 3,469 times while being tied to a chair as someone in America in Paris once in a luxurious suite. If I did, I'd probably sleep all the time. <br /> <br /> The direction and music of color art didn't interest me, Gershwin or non-Gershwin. Dancing and singing can help reduce sleeplessness. The dialogue is not compatible with Singin in the rain. Basically, this movie is boring. The only other film I watched was Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid. But you can't blame me. Before bedtime I slept only 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (too bad that we can't give zero.)
