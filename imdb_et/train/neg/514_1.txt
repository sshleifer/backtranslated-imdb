This is one of the most amazing, weak, unoriginal and pointless movies ever made! It almost seems that not all the people involved in this project even tried to make an attractive movie. This is nothing more than a tiring series of movies trying to get into the success of Smokey and Bandit, which I think is the best movie for all of them. Regarding this waste of film stock, Burt Reynolds dreams go through the film, Jim Nabors is wasted, other actors don't do much, car races are apparently equipped with film material, humor is uninspired, and many scenes are more boring and lifeless than watching the wall for two hours . "Stroker Ace" is just a superfluous film that has nothing unique or distinctive.
