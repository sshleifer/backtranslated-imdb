This film speaks of extra-terrestrial black men destroying women on Earth to create a gay universe. <br /> <br /> I looked at it to see how bad it was. However, I was shocked at how bad it was. It seemed like a film made more than 50 years ago. Working, if any, is very bad. Sets and props are so ridiculously fake, changing the college movie's mega-budget. And the special effects are ridiculously simple, indeed the jaw falls, as others have commented, but the jaw is a little embarrassing. If I were from Denmark, I would be very embarrassed and humiliated that my fellow countrymen had made such a terrifying film.
