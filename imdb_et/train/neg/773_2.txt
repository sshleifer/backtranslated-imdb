No, not GWB, Decider / Strutter / Smirker management, but the mini series "Monarch Cove". Life must be understood by the dog as it was a series of two episodes burned at the same time, most of them being transmitted at 11.00. Friday nights and Saturday morning in the morning. Why did I look at it all, but I can just say weekly anti-Masochism attacks. <br /> <br /> Most cast is unknown, probably unaware. The only two recognizable names are Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, who only turn to decent performances (Jones doesn't make it through a whole lot - happy woman). The fairy tale, aging, is getting pretty good, because it's the "Thorn Birds" days. <br /> <br /> One of the main threads on the plot - who murdered the heroine's father who has been mistaken for his father's murder, but has been released after six years of slammer - has been stretched so long and so hurried that you don't particularly care who dun that. There is a lot of "steaming" sex, multiple murders and any rude behavior - virtually none of them are interesting or credible. Most cast is not particularly attractive and certainly not talented. Writing and direction are cast on the same level. <br /> <br /> When you finish, there is a postcard (very small). <br /> <br /> USE YOUR WARNING!
