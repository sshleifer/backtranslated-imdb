I saw it on a DVD (known as CORRUPT in this format) and blasting the body really pulled up how Harvey Keitel's character Frank is as much as he played BAD LIEUTENANT's "This sharp and powerful police thriller." , it was the old Italian movie. How old is Theo? Well, when the character plays music, he doesn't put it on a CD player, he pulls out a big plastic pancake, puts it on a kind of rotating cooker, where some mechanical hand touches the pancake that causes music You see my point that this is an old movie? The DVD bag didn't give the idea that it was a film made 20 years ago, a movie with bad product values, like many other Italian films that disguise like America. except for Keitel, is cast horribly, although Johnny Rotten's presentation is strange, not terrible, cinematic is static with image and sound quality, giving the impression that I am watching the fourth generation pirated copy (I don't know if it's tired of a DVD or if it's a very bad film print) and the worst is the result of Ennio Morricone. It is impossible to believe a man who made irritating intrusive music for CORRUPT the one who made the music for their Clint Eastwood Westerners. <br /> <br /> All this is a shame because CORRUPT has its own moments. It's not the biggest psychological thriller ever worked out, but it was in my interest and as always, Keitel puts a good result as a violent nutty. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie didn't meet its high standards
