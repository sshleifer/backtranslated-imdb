<br /> <br /> This movie didn't even see the audience's entertainment, except for one fairly amusing toilet joke. Christopher Lloyd is by his way his main and actually quite tiring in this role, although an excusing excuse for writer's jokes does not help. Elizabeth Hurley is uncomfortable with an allegedly comic book. Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah are avoiding humiliation. There's really no reason to make this movie, especially since it's inevitable to compare it to Robin Williams' often brilliant improvisation at Mork & Mindy. <br /> <br />
