This is a collection of clich√©s, a sorrel, assembled in a straight line that has no noticeable plot or proper way of doing things I've seen for a long time. Canibalising's scenes from Star Wars, Fire Reign, Godzilla, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter went out of war against the intelligence of the viewer. Was this movie good? It wasn't a movie at all! <br /> <br /> Even if it doesn't go so low as to be really funny and get the status of culture as a comedy, it's some movie laughs. The trick is to put copied scenes in the context of your original movies. Gandalf may be funny, speaks Korean, looking for a basil snake fun when compared to a kitten, and the evil henchman can go back and forth between Sauron and Jaja bing, or whatever his name was. <br /> Bottom line: Any joy from this film will depend entirely on the drunkenness and imagination of viewers, not on the director / writer. Shame on you, Shim!
