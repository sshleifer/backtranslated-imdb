Wow, what is the waste of action. My husband and I were sitting, so I thought it had to get better, these actors are too good to waste their time. The unpleasant characters, the hackneyed script and the innumerable pace make it a long time for two hours. I really couldn't hack it and leave the grocery shopping (cat litter was more attractive than this movie). Her husband stayed and confirmed that it didn't heal - by the time Buddy was killed, you wanted everyone to get in the car and end your unhappy life. It would be endlessly fun. Beautiful scenery and costumes can't keep it alive.
