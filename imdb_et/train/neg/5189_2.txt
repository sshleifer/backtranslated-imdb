This series would have been much better if they had just done one simple thing: The code name of Ian McShane: Diamond Head instead of the codename: Tree. Diamond Head who needs a character who can handle the role of a lovable traitor, which McShane proved to be able to do with the Lovejoy series. Roy Thinnes, the actual Diamond Head, is really just that important. McShane isn't really as good as a bad man. France's Nuyen character, Tso-Zinc, can't seem to be an unhappy victim or a hard and ready-made woman. He finally earned his salary when he was to play the role of a Diamond Head lover. After watching the episode or two, I didn't care about what happened to anyone. The tree gives us a lot of hatred, but Diamond Head does not give us something he likes. Unfortunately, the 1970s spies genre was not exactly the same as in the 1960s.
