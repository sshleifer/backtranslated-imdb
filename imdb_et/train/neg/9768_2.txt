When I first jumped to a happy birthday, I checked the timer to see how long the movie was. I was surprised by the length. Both animated and horror movies share a common ground: attentiveness of the selected audience and it should be about 90 minutes or right. What's more, and you lose a large part of your audience. <br /> <br /> After 110 minutes or 20 minutes, your main problem was a big problem for me. I would like to say that half of this movie could have been worked out, but I would be too generous to say that. Go ahead and look at it and tell me how many scenes you could have edited even without a movie. <br /> <br /> Whether the movie is too long, the film was below average. He spent all this time trying to be the great mystery the "elite 10" would kill the rest of the friends. For the most part, they not only do it over, but increase the face and say pretty much: "That's the guy! No! That's it!" You spend more time when the camera misleads you when you actually enjoy the movie. And don't start acting on me. Okay, this got me started. I had to laugh at the beginning, trying to remember if Melissa Sue Anderson was playing the dark character on Little House at Prairie (later the investigation proved my doubts correctly) because she seemed really blind throughout this movie. Strangely, when he was an actor, he would have had to be the best in the group but proved to be the worst. The rest of the staff, aside from Ann (Bregman), was also pretty damn bad, but he took the cake. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a group of ten friends and is killed off immediately. Hardly anyone thinks twice about the "expensive" loss of a friend, so they continue their joy. Slower, then faster, are revelations about Virginia (Anderson), the main character, the past, and his psychologist, who are then a little more personal (AND IS 24/7, probably) when most shrink. There are more and more deaths everywhere. <br /> <br /> What is funny, just like the first "disappearance", the more "best buds" disappear, the less rest. Of course, they give a couple of seconds of air time to say "Wow, (this person) just doesn't run off" etc, but then they return to their sexual ways. And talking about it is probably due to a terrible script or maybe it was the one who lost interest within 30 minutes, but it was really hard to keep up with the one who liked the group because everyone seemed to be sexual partners next or someone would be so that the other and best friends go out to MAX. SEE: Creepy guy who kept the mouse / rat in his pocket? literally? and was the most obvious suspect. I give the film too much credit (and time), but how he got part of the "elite 10" I never know. <br /> <br /> But I ground, there is a mystery here. Why are these children targeted? Why does Virginia think she is killing someone if it was never shown ("to the end") that someone was actually killed? And why should the trailer and the poster on these killings be "Six of the most bizarre murders you will ever see"? Hell, even in 1981, most of them were shown on the first two on Friday the 13th film? randomly enough, on Friday, part 13, part 2 appeared for 2 weeks for a happy birthday. Maybe they talk about it when they filmed it for several months before, but were late, well, party. <br /> <br /> When the "mysteries" appear, trust me, you have to roll back 3 -4x to get ridiculous and inconsistent motifs and even put subtitles to get all the mumbling victim / killer words. Even if you get it for the first time, it's an incredibly awful and fun finale. It's almost worth watching the whole movie, but playing with the drink. <br /> <br /> This birthday collection should be avoided. Is this a terrible and illogical first script project? please, please know that it takes several rewrites before the role of the cameras, it includes a way of action or extreme action and it is 100% unrealistic for people to react in exceptional circumstances. <br /> <br /> Side Note: When I was a kid, or say 10-11 years old, I loved horror films. (Still, strange. Certainly blame for the joy, but they are getting harder and harder to watch than the years have passed.) We have the first VCR, and I stuck so many horror movies online (or EDITED VERSIONS). I am reminded of a happy birthday for me that I get the last 10 minutes of the tape that frightened me? and obviously made a big secret about who was the killer. Although I've seen other clips of this movie, I think it's the first full-length view I've had. Fortunately, this terrible movie didn't hurt me as a child. I'm older and I can take it to the trash. But never. <br /> <br /> Note 2: It's that crazy "happy birthday to me" song that was played on the final credit (and as a whole score) still hitting me enormously. I think this film (or a few minutes) influenced my childhood. Shame on you, Melissa Sue Anderson!
