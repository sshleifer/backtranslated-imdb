I've seen my fair share of badly thought-out endings and final twists on movies, but I don't remember any movie that was committed to suicide as it was. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers clearly hoped that the big twist "made us surprise" all ... and it did, but perhaps not in the hope of the leaders. I was surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had something to do with this turkey alone or collectively. <br /> <br /> Until the last thirty minutes, the film was more interesting and I like the way the story was expanding and the nature of the movie at all. But when the torsion became clear, the plot holes and contradictions were remarkable, the motive behind revenge was poorly prepared, and the ways that Bobby Earl was so well designed were ridiculously drawn away. What's even worse is that after the twist, the rest of the film became extremely predictable. <br /> <br /> Harris gave a terrible job and Connery is like Morgan Freeman because he never gives a bad result, even if the movie isn't that big! All in all, it starts well, and the opening keeps the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of the cinema.
