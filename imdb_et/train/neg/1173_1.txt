If I had only one camera that was accidentally glued to the floor, then only one shot would be enough, and then I lost that movie and had to buy some digital video cassettes. For over two hours of the French Revolution, it had no set and had to paint his 4-year-old autistic son, and the only actors I found were people who didn't. Don't make this year's soap opera listening and I was forced to use all the music in the movie, and the camera's zoom function didn't work except once it accidentally started zooming and couldn't do it. Stop, oh, and when I hate my audience, I could do something like a terrible but mistakenly fun hell of a waste of time. Almost grand are looking, but totally fake, that reminded me of some of George Lucas' latest creations, which made it so disappointing, because throughout the film, I thought it was a little hope that the film would be the climax of the duel / space laser battle. I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, but it's not like it ends. The only thing I think it is wasting more time writing this movie is writing this review. Peace.
