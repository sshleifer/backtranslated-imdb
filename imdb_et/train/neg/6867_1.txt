We can start with wood, but this film is a disaster. Having grown up in NY, I can tell you that this movie is an insult to anyone who knows the community or people. I'm not even a protector of culture and I found it to be a Hollywood trash that fits with its fictional, ridiculous culture presentation and the language that anyone watching Seinfeld is inaccurate. This is a historic waste of time, and worse is not quite interesting, because the result is obvious and the confrontational scenes are ridiculously bad. Who works in this way? No one. <br /> <br /> The writer's name sounds like an Israeli or something like that, but it is clear that he has no idea what he's writing. Looking at his biology, it is shocking that he lived in New York and does not know how much of his community has a real connection. Even a mediocre film like "Our stranger" is better and closer to the truth than this dreck. By reading this bag of credit, it is no wonder that he has written scripts for all C-Class movies that in some way mark the stars. shocking. Maybe he knows someone because this script is even worse for the Dolph Lundgren movie.
