This movie is so bad that I can't believe it. People who voted 10 or 9, 8 and even 7 are crazy? Are we actually watching the same movie? Or should I say the same sh **. All this movie is bad. Story (is there a story?) Going somewhere, totally inconsistent, acting (some dialogues are just ridiculous), music score (what is ****?), Editing and especially artistic direction, pure disaster. Reminds me of old Macist movies ... To give you an example of production from an amateur, a mermaid costume is a sleeping bag with spangles affixed to it. I'm not kidding, that's exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> Another example of the tremendous errors we find here: You see a woman in the scene with an extra 200 pounds of fat talking about her cell phone. The next picture, in a completely different place, you see the same woman, still speaks of her mobile phone (!) Yes, it goes so far. <br /> <br /> Big, big, waste of money. Use.
