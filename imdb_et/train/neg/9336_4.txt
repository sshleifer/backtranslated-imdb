Poorly made "blaxploitation" crime drama that was aimed at the black city market in the early 1970s. Pam Grier's stars in the title, a nurse who receives one woman's vigilant after drug treatment, makes Coffy a little sister junk. Violent nonsense rains sharply, conserved with energy and excitement; only Griere's burning mood gives a narrative to the narrative (he's not a lot of actors here, but he's joining the audience first). There is not much difference between what Charles Bronson did, marketed and advertised at that time, as crass still managed to find a great urban environment. Today, however, this is just a footnote to the 70's film history, and there are no other films in this genre. * 1/2 from ****
