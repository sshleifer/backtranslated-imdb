Ladies Man is a funny movie. There's not much thought behind it, but what about waiting for an SNL movie? It's actually better than most SNL movies (ie Superstar or A Night at The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny. Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene (one of the funniest movies). In addition, the rest is average and is just there to support Meadows. I've definitely seen more funny movies, but I've also seen those who are fucking. Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's good for some laughs. But it was more fun than skit. But still, if you are looking for a pretty funny movie, I would recommend it. Just don't think about it too much or hate it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 6/10
