This is one of the few episodes (if not the only one) with an undeniable error. In dealing with Ralphie's situation, Christopher claims to have heard about the death of Pie-O-My in a fire. This is an important detail because it is obvious in this context that Christopher knows from the beginning that Tony is the one who must kill Ralphie. However, Chris has heard nothing about the accident. Who should have told him and when? By the time Tony called him out of his delirium, no one was informed. Tony knows this - what makes it even worse! Talking to Christopher about the death of Pie-O-My could therefore lead Tony to the conclusion that Chris himself had set fire. Considering the impressively complex writing process written by the authors on the DVD, it is not known that none of them understood the problem there. The story just doesn't work. There's no need to add that I'm a big fan of Sopranos. Otherwise, I certainly don't care.
