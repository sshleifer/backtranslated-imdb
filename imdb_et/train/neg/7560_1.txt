How this film could be truly remarkable due to the lack of exciting, complex and mysterious aspects of so many original or original texts. Incredibly thin and loosening plot, ankle-deep characterization / motivation and really terrible soundtrack (replacing tensions with a lot of noise, replacing the original musical references to digitized accidents and rumbles. Then there are specific references to the original that is simply "plastered" over the cracks ... In a world where brown brain-dead American remakes from Italian work (a tear appears), Get Carter (breaks uncontrollably) and Alfie's screens have recently been consecrated, it is taking an old cookie that can be done when Ellen Burstyn ever participated, is a miracle ... Trash.
