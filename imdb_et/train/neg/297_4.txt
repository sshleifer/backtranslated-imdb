For this movie, this film is intriguing but hardly original. In 1998, Talia Shire starred in "The City Owner" with almost the same accuracy, but with younger stars. <br /> <br /> The story of Amanda Lear has been a bad life, a malicious father, a horny doctor, spiritual homes, and so on. She has finally released her happy home under the guidance of her perverted doctor ... who abuses and kills a poor guy in the same way. (Now that it was original) The doctor had financed the manor before he killed him and was buried in the backyard. After moving, she loves a plaque named Richard who just happens to be married to a blues singer. If you have seen the City owner you know, he kills or tries to kill someone who gets between him and Richard (including the road). <br /> <br /> Much of the idea came from the previous movie, the same idiot sidekick that sticks to his nose, the same spying boy with a bowl of popcorn, the same flying bodypress. It had original materials, the beer bottle thing was brutal. The highlight of the movie was Amanda's beautiful breasts to the top. Somewhat ripoff, but not a waste of time. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
