It was definitely the most stupid, the sharpest and most repulsive film I've ever seen. I was tempted to turn off the video deck, but as I was enthusiastic about looking at a terrible car accident, I found it literally conceivable and hesitant in every sense. I am not a bride who contests the comic depiction of sexual antics on the screen. Animal House, Porky, There's something about Mary, both American Pie movies and the notorious Freddy Got Fingered, which I found very enjoyable in my crude oil conditions. Mamie Van Doren's bra is the most terrifying look of nude geriatrics from The Shining. The endless editing and shooting of the film, with incredibly annoying productions by Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman, ended without strangling me. The only useful purpose of the film is to give an example of how not to take a general picture. Oh, and it would also serve nicely as a grass fertilizer.
