Despite being another for a stronger original, it is more of a comic transformation on Friday in the 13th year, concerning additional psychopathic Angela words, killing more nubile teens for their "immorality" in the camp. <br /> <br /> Pamela Springsteen (Bruce's sister) looks good. There are some pretty funny scenes with some pretty attractive girls, but the film is both (inadvertently) comedian, not suspenseful, it's smelly. <br /> <br /> * out ****. MPAA: Rated for graphical violence and gore, nudity, and some sexuality, language and drug use.
