OK - helicopter shots are fantastic and the director used some of Barcelona's best sights. Otherwise, the output value was blown in the first few minutes and the rest of the film seemed to be a movie of the week. Ellen Pompeo was charming and fun to see, Abel Folk was the deepest and most effective, and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. He had to make good use of his martial arts training and to be a rolling figure for a rolling jump. The rest was, at best, wood, but mostly paper. So - if you are nostalgic towards Spain - this is a postcard of images with a functional and healthy dose of El Greco. If not, skip it.
