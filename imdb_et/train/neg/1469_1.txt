Like watching the home movies of a neighbor's summer camp, "Indian Summer" is a dream-making hole. Eight alumni campers are barely deployed when incredibly forgetting letters begin with characters we don't know about. Fine actors, Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton, have been completely wasted with this movie. One tenter's observation that "everything seems so much smaller than I remember" is repeated at least ten times enough to worship you. Expected worship is neither funny nor original if you think a short page is a real "cart". This film was a great disappointment given that it was a talent. "Indian summer" didn't make me home, just sick. - MERK
