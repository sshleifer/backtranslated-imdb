This film is not just a bad thing, not just a cold, it is repulsive. Something about Daphne, about a horrible talk about the whole fuck (and I use the word literally), grotesque, offensive to the brothel lover. This film changes my skin crawling, regrets me for reproductive organs and feels clean. <br /> <br /> The one thing that most disturbs me about this movie is that they used such a good concept. A creature that makes fantasies with catastrophic results, not the worst nightmare of a clich√© and redundant Twisted Wish, is a truly exciting movie idea. <br /> <br /> Idea: The reason why hobgoblins should be killed before the day is that they are attracted by bright lights. During the day, the bright lights don't work well so they can go somewhere. <br /> <br /> Read Hobgoblins: Four hobgoblins fly out of the movie studio, but at least nine dangerous prickly toys are killed throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Discussion Question: If you had a cold, demanding and unacceptable girlfriend, would you enter the military head to fight garden tools? Explain.
