I'm really shocked that a big director like Chuck Jones started some of the most incredibly boring cartoons I've ever seen. I never laughed in this short time and this is Bugs Bunny's comic for Christ! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny, not boring! Unfortunately, it turns out that this short is a Good Night Elmer (another incredibly boring Jones short) with Bugs Bunny. <br /> <br /> The first warning sign of an eternal comic is not always a gag reward. Good evening Elmer was bored because it pulled the same two paws forever with predictable profitability. On the other hand, this comic is another warning sign on the nerve comics: too much dialogue. The coat has at least two paws, but most of them look longer than the huge padding of the dialogue. At one point, Elmer stops eating dinner and commented: "It was a stigma of a good wamb," perhaps the most superfluous dialogue I've ever heard of as a comic (characters that read text later on from Woody Woodpecker's cartoons) does not count in my book). Although this comic is only 8 minutes long, it seems to be 20 thanks to such a superfluous dialogue. <br /> <br /> Elmer's pet rabbit was not a fun comic for me, but if you sold your soul to Jones Chuck and could not admit that he managed some clunkers during his career.
