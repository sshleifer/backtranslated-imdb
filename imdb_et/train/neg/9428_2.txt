It usually does not take time to comment on the fact that few people read, few people see movies. But in this case, I feel I have to warn all those who might consider wasting this time. I finished it just five minutes ago. It's just one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. Action is terrible, the plot is non-existent and production values ​​are at best the poverty level. I know that even a low budget movie can be big but not that. The only thing that could have saved this movie for any spooky fans purpose - more screen shot and slashing! This triple total is off the screen. Although it is effective and reasonably disturbing, if it happens - especially in the final scene - it is simply not enough. The film is too long for it to be minimal, too big for a dialogue and thus almost impossible to watch. What happens? To make all the brief summaries with free space, three teenage girls are irresponsibly and consciously traveling through an isolated area where more than 20 girls have been abducted and murdered before. Of course, their car breaks down and they are taken to an old boring house where three mad people live, one of whom is a psychotic killer. Finally, all three, one by one, after the screen, after what seems to be boring, slow tempo crap. As I said, the only values ​​worth looking at are murders. Please do not buy it or rent it for it, and do not be fooled by the description of the art and film of a misleading box. Save your money and time.
