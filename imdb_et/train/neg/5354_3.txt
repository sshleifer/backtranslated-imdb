Lack of good PLOT, lack of proper ACTING, lack of good CINEMATOGRAPHY, lack of proper looking special effects ... I have to go? The review may include a spoiler. Participants seem to be reading their own line and not very well. Most "participants" acted as they were in the second level game. The story seemed to be written by one of the other graders mentioned above ... it is not all that is twisted ... it's just that simple and DUMB that a person thinks they need something missing to think it's complicated. No, it is not as easy as you think. ACKNOWLEDGES the "movie", this is how I know it is STUNK! Most of the film was just for people who were sitting talking (reading their rows), HOW TO MAKE EFFICIENCY. The narrator was ANNOYING. "Special Effects" were LAUGHABLE. I love low budget movies. I also like Carolyn Munro, Tom Savin, Jack Scarry and Michael Berrymore ... just not in this movie ... you can say they don't get paid or paid much because their hearts NOR their talents were in it. I love Tony Todd ... but he was enough in this movie. Tony Todd's play is ONLY the reason I gave it to 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony was only in that two minute (seriously)! I would recommend sending the DVD quickly to the Tony Todd segment for two minutes. If I had gone to the theater and paid more than DOLLAR to watch this movie, I would have been P.O. and I demanded my money back. Hopefully, people doing this will do better next time.
