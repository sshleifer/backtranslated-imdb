This is an art film made in 1969 or 1972 (National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film seems to be very noticeable for this overall period - with some camera works and pop-art styles that are clean in the early 60s and 70s. <br /> <br /> The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using various strange camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is no dialogue or plot. It was probably almost like a form of performance art, and like most of the performing arts, it is interesting at first, but it gets tired quickly. The film, to make it even clearer, is a complete concern and does not want anyone, but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends, and perhaps some people just too hip and "with it" to understand us mortals.
