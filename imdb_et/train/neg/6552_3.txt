The money (now played by Khrystyne Haje in Angelina Jolie) has gone after the apocalypse (after her defender has died of old age, this defender was played by Elias Kotea, a true dignified actor) and now she finds people traversing the rubble looking for cyborgs to trade in metal waste and cash. He directs a group of burnt cyber (including William Katt, Evan Lurie, and Zach Galligan human scientist) against Richard Lynch, a merciful hunter. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as Lynch's employer. Cyborg 3 manages to be better than the other two scraps, but it is largely dull. This time, the problem is that potential ideas are never well used, the action sequences are routine, and the name, like McDowell, Katt and Galligan, is little to do. Haje is indeed a gigantic heroine and Lynch is too up (as usual) and the film lacks inspiration or ambition to be as fun as bad because it is a fun predecessor. (Van Damm with the other, the other is just boring.) The frustrating scientific literature is almost aggressively opposed to any good idea. As an action clip, this is a routine and number-B-movie stuff, and it's done competently, that's the only thing I can say about it positively. <br /> <br /> 1/4 of 4 (bad)
