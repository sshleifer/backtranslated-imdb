Directed by Warren Beatty, with the intention of making Chester Gould a famous comic strip (with Beatty, a leader in square detective), sweet innocent nostalgia holes - quite unusual and intriguing, which came from Warren Beatty. Unfortunately, the picture is a necessary ham, for some time fun, but finally tiring. Dick Tracy tries to bring down the mobster Big Boy Caprice, helping him with the loving Tess Trueheart, but bouncing on the evil Breathless Mahoney. In the first half of the year, the direction and design of the art of winning the Oscar is wonderful to absorb, but when the plot tends to be predictable (without a written pull), things begin to work. Al Pacino was surprised to support the Oscar nomination as a poor boy, Caprice and Madonna (who is mostly a decorative proportion) singing Stephen Sondheim "Sooner or later (I always get my husband)", which ended the best award for the Song. Many hearts, thanks to Beatty, who was committed to his vision - but the picture is too cool and calculated. He has no heat. * 1/2 from ****
