Funny, how the studio thinks it can continue with a classic Christmas story that was brand new and expected to float. Of course, they used different actors for Batman, but in that case, Batman was a classic sign before any actor took off his claw. In that case, you had glasses with classic horned horns that suffered from Ralphy, who wanted a red ryder bb weapon for Christmas ... Somehow, we should forget about it and accept another small boy who doesn't have the original similarity. If I hadn't known it was a sequel, I wouldn't have guessed it ... except, of course, that Charles Grodin tries to imitate Darrin McGavin so that you are constantly reminded that the original was much better ... <br /> <br /> Ultimately, he may have a job if they made the film better. They should have looked for a look or just ignore the original and did not try to copy their appearance and feelings. It's just a cheap imitation. Ralphy does not cause compassion, but a desire to feel his character when he dies or dies.
