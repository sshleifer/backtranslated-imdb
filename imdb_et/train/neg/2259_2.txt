During my lifetime, I can't justify why they'd like to make a "Jerry Springer Show" movie. This is incredible. Some led, unfortunately, to blame for pleasure. We all have to admit that we have seen at least one episode. This is part of our pop culture. I saw it recently in the US. It's pretty bad. I admit it. Jerry is doing a terrible job, which I think he had to act on. Or something like that. Jamie Pressley is in that. He plays himself basically. All he needed was his lover boy, Kid Rock. It would have been perfect then. So, I would recommend skipping "Ringmaster". Just look at "Jerry Springer Show". It's more enjoyable than this. <br /> <br /> 2/10
