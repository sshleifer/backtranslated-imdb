I grew up (b. 1965), watching and loving Thunderbirds. All my mates at school were watching. We played before the school, lunch and after school "Thunderbirds". We all wanted to be Virg or Scott. Nobody wanted to be Alan. The shooting down of 5 became an art form. I took my children to watch the movie, hoping they would look at what I loved as a child. How bitterly disappointing. The only high point was the delicate topic. Not that it is comparable to the Thunderbirds original score. Fortunately, on Saturday morning, one of the television channels still plays in the series Gerry Anderson and his wife. Jonatha Frakes should run under the direction of his directors, his version was completely hopeless. A waste of film. Use garbage. The CGI remodeling may be acceptable, but replacing the puppets Homo sapiens subsp. sapiens was a big judgment error.
