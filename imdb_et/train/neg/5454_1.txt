Wow, this movie was just a bloody fear. So bad that even though I didn't see it, I still wanted my money back. <br /> <br /> The film is not understandable. This is a sci-fi clich√© mish-mash made by better qualified filmmakers. The performances, especially by the leaders, were on the right in the less pure Ed Wood. Speaking of Ed Wood, he would be proud of the character's dialogue. It's just too quiet, without the hint of irony or a sense of humor. In addition, it does not make sense, nor does it have a plot or a lack. <br /> <br /> Visual effects are okay, but not enough to go "oh wow, it's cool" and they just seem to be thrown "to be cool" instead of being a good plot device. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was another thing that never set the mood. Again, it seemed that the director was simply throwing the songs in the movie to "be cool". <br /> <br /> What brings me to my last point. Perhaps, if the director were to worry more about the plot, the story and the dialogue instead of trying to "be cool", he would not have made such a short film. "/ <br /> <br />
