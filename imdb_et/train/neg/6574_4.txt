(Avast, small front spoilers) I got this tape from my local library, which keeps a copy for obvious reasons. <br /> <br /> I once went to the town of Matewan, West Virginia and a small museum there I saw the timetable of the city theater in May 1954. Movies change every day in the theater. Since there would not be a tenth of television in these parts, it was a lot of entertainment in the city. "Raid" seems to have been made for cities like Matewan in the 1950s. Although it wasn't listed this month, I'm sure I saw a Monday or Tuesday night for an audience that was probably not too demanding. The historical attack - bold and remarkably successful - did not seem very well researched, so the film is full of Hollywood decorations, including the cool cannon played by Lee Marvin. Marvin takes the opportunity to practice Liberty Valance. And St. Albans has probably had more Yankee soldiers who came through the city and went through Washington D.C. was. <br /> <br /> What really made me lurk when the riders became their confederate uniforms. Only sticky civil war paintings see Rebel's uniforms so pristine. When Anne Bancroft's son tries Van Heflin in his uniform just before the attack, I waited for the boy to think it was Halloween. <br /> <br /> Then there is Anne Bancroft. While watching the movie, I actually looked at IMDb to see if there was another Anne Bancroft. At that time, the actor in the studio did not see anything similar in his later films, and he had no presence that he would later "Miracle Worker", "Agnes of God" and, of course, "The Graduate". br /> It is worth seeing only 1). you live in st. Albans and 2). You have a few hours to kill your home country's biggest newsletter in Hollywood fiction.
