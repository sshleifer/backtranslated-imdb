I waited much better for the Battlestar Galactica franchise. Very boring prequel series. After the first 30 minutes I waited for it to end. The characters speak a lot about religion, computers, programming, revenge, etc. There are gangsters, mafia types, that hit the hits. However, Caprica's original series does not compensate for slower parts. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some helpful tips when watching movies: As a general rule, if there is a lot of excessive exploitative titillation, you know the movie is stupid. Caprical has that much. The director / writer usually tries to compensate for his poor abilities by throwing a naked body. It never works, and all this is a weakened (very) young actor and I am sorry about them. Managers / writers who do this should be banned from doing business. <br /> <br /> If you want an hour and feel bored, rent a Caprica. 'There is (free) porn on the net if you really want to see a naked body. Otherwise, skip over, there's nothing to see here.
