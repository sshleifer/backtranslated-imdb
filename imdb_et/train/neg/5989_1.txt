wow i paid Â£ 3.50 to go see this movie cinema. Cant think I wasted my time. The actor is at best worthy and the special effects are crude oil. Probarly is the worst script in history with some very embarrassing quotes I've ever heard in my life. I swear that God "wipes away" is better. Madonna should compete and Oscar compared to their men. An hour and a half of my life I want to return. Frankly, people don't see it, even a toddler thinks this film would offend their intelligence. I found this movie very strange because it was hard to tell who is more of a wood, doing real dolls here. states that boys do not waste their time with the film you live to regret.
