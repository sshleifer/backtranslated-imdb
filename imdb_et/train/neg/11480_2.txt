I watched it with my girlfriend after it stumbled upon it sliding through the channels. <br /> <br /> I think we both hoped a happy family for a cute Christmas movie, but we were very disappointed. <br /> <br /> An actor who plays a soldier seems to have 0 emotions, his face looks the same whether he finishes a Christmas tree, seeing a girl whom his boyfriend kisses, or when he loves to surprise him happily, is he was a terrible actor, and at no point did anyone make us laugh. <br /> <br /> Then the cute blonde girl, blessed with the ability to read points and cheat on her boyfriend, what a catch! and his ambition in life is to live with his parents and read more points. <br /> <br /> So it is basically a story of a man who has no emotions or feelings falling on a boy who reads boys and cheats on his boyfriend. It is just as predictable as it is, and a waste of time, you won't get anything to look at except some strange laughs because it's all so outrageous. <br /> <br /> I love the fact that his father says he is eating only French fries and not French wine, and they all laugh, this is a mountainous attitude that this film speaks, in addition to my girlfriend's father around me, I'd say something to her or not, but not our army veteran, no sir, she'll let her boss drive. <br /> <br /> Film is what First Blood would have been when John Rambo was burned as the biggest wimp in the world.
