The thin story concerns two small town brothers and their struggle for family honor. David Morse is a responsible, straightforward policeman and "good" brother; Viggo Mortensen, a "bad" boy, is a former soldier and former convict. As an actor (especially in his earliest years), Sean Penn seems to have modulated his methods with his own method. Turning for the first time a writer and director of this artistic, strange drama, he works his script and characters through the same methodological process, slowing the pace down to crawl (apparently so we can catch every nuance and slip). This approach can be exciting when it comes to three-dimensional characters who care, but the photogenic Morse and Mortensen are not really convincing as siblings. Worse still, we expect more prominent paid veterans from Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, who hardly get anything interesting. The picture has a dirty sequence, a weak narrative and confusing editing (always inclined towards artistic articulation). Penn tricks with the camera showed a talented eye, but these are mostly irritations. * 1/2 from ****
