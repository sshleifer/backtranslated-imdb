Daraar went pretty good to the beginning. The first scene left me at the edge of my place, wondering what would happen next. In addition, the first side of the film is BORE. The first half of the movie is about Rishi Kapoor's falling head, which is in love with Juha Chawla. By the way, don't you think he's a little old for him? <br /> <br /> Things end up in the middle of the movie when the driver speaks to us about his previous spouse; and wow what crazy he is! He was extremely protective, clean and very hot TEMPER! He barely tried to beat the driver for no reason! One reason I really don't like this movie is that I can't see the Driver (my favorite actor) being so abused. In general, this film has too much abuse and bloodshed; I find it so sick! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'd like to say that if you mean renting Daraar, you should put it right on the shelf where you found it and chose something else!
