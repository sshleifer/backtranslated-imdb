I chose it in a video store because of Tarantino's suggestion ("If you don't (it), go f & ^% yourself!"), It seemed like this was a ringtone confirmation .... I was expecting something a bit more like "Death Proof." .. not much actual violence in this one or mansion, character or dialogue. <br /> <br /> See the poster. It's all there. Stunts and rock. It goes back and forth. A week or so in the life of a LA band that looks like a funny magic at a level you might see in one of the smaller casinos, and Aussie stuntman, who is a new shoe in the city ... They work, meet girls, they are a party. End of story. <br /> <br /> The band probably needed all this stuff because they are honestly on the second level and play the style dated back in 1978. It has to be said that the film's stunt bits are really spinetingling - that Aussie companion is really something and the film seems to be largely motivated by love and respect for "art". I hung it from there to see what a crazy thing to do next. I wish he had found a better vehicle.
