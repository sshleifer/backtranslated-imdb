The film is based on a true 1950s novel. <br /> <br /> Colin McInnes, a journalist, wrote three "London novels": "Absolute Beginners", "Pot City" and "Mr Love and Justice". I've read all three. The first two are excellent. Last, perhaps, an experiment that didn't come out. But McInnes's work is highly recognized; and right. This musician is the ultimate nightmare of the novel - to see that the fruits of the mind become brilliant, malfunctioning, complicated one-dimensional apology of the film that says it captures the spirit of London in the 1950s and does nothing. Thanks to the deity Colin McInnes was not witnessing it in life.
