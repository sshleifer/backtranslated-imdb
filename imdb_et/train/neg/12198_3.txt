I grew up with Beast Wars transformers, I didn't know the original Transformers very well, and now that I've seen a fantastic movie and now I've seen the older comic on which it is based, I have to say that I like the original comic and the live movie is more as Beast Wars. <br /> <br /> Not that I don't like BW characters, but I think characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal. I mean: "AUTOBOTS TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT!" sounds much better than "MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE!" The original voice of Optimus Prime still makes me a strong believer that he is a true commander, more than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> Moreover, Powermaster Optimus Prime is much more optimistic than Optimal Optimus. Just look on the web! <br /> <br /> The Megatron BW symbol seemed like a humorous version of his original series. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> for vehicles and spacecraft? Give Original Transformers Every Day Beast Wars!
