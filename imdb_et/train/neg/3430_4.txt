A bloody maniac with cannibalistic tendencies rape a woman. He has shot two police officers and then has risen from the grave because of some satanic ceremony that has been made by evil heresy. Women's hunting continues with this zombie demon. The sacrificed baby returns from the grave and wants the maniac to die again, but only with the help of the police can it ... <br /> <br /> Bloody 65-minute confusion ... scarers looking for refuge in front of Jesus Christ and three texts at the end of the screen movie, telling us what finally happened to the policeman who lived (yes, we should know!) ... Two decommissioning cannot save the situation. I've seen the worst horrors, but it was also pretty bad. Recommended only for genre deaths.
