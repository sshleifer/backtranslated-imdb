WOW! <br /> <br /> This film was just given to my friend who bought it for 1.98 in Walmart and felt that he took it! It's boring, most scenes are filmed in front of a green screen, the actor is somewhat improvised, almost as if they had no script. Mars are CGIs that look like a film produced by a beginner or a Fan. I can't stress how bad this DVD really is! <br /> <br /> Example: In one scene, Marines torture local female prisoners. She goes for a woman on a green screen with a copy of that woman's CGI. The change is quite noticeable and, when it is killed, you see that it is a computer indicator that looks like nothing in 1990! plague! You can download two trailers from your site and see how terrible it is!
