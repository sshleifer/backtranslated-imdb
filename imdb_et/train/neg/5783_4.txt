Ah, sex-and-gore movie. It's too bad if they don't do it anymore (if you don't live in Japan). But if they all turn out to be that, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> The film consists mainly of two cute vampires pulling the "highway" along the road and taking them to the castle. they have crazy sex and eat them (except for the first victim they don't hold for any particular reason). Things are difficult when camping with her husband becomes too curious for these mysterious women. Here it really gets ugly. Finally, both vampires are in such blood that they eat everything in sight and are able to let the victim escape their captivity. Oops, so much for this secret existence. <br /> <br /> The fact that two vampires do not take off their clothes and stupid with one another is the only thing this film does for it. Otherwise, it's a bloody, confusing confusion (why is their tomb so far away from the castle?), Which can be seen in just a few minutes of vampire time. The only thing I got out of this movie was these two valuable tips: lesbians won't let them kill; it only makes them vampires and don't take horses along the highway; they are probably vampires. Moreover, it was not worth my time.
