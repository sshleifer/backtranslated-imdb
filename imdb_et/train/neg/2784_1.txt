My husband and I are the parents of an autistic boy who live in the same movie as the scriptwriter. We were very excited that the Joint Advisory Committee would bring this film to a Jewish film festival, because it is a depiction of a mentally disabled Frankie. We went to see this movie in the local theater when he came out. We demanded the money back. We would encourage the screenwriter to donate some of the funds to the Joint Consultative Committee's Achad program to apologize. <br /> <br /> We didn't like Frankie - a mentally disabled and maybe even an autistic teenager - to be part of the joke she misses to look at the baby's chest. <br /> <br /> Frankie's character didn't make any sense to say, "Hey, mentally disabled is funny." Challenges like Frankie are serious. Families like me are really suffering. <br /> <br /> The script must explain itself. Does he know families with disabled children? Does he see a week after a joint advisory committee on disability families?
