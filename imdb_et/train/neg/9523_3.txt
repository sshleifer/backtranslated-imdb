The plot of this movie is not strong at all, many holes. When you approach it as a car movie that is not bad, there are many such cars. The reason I like it is that I come from the region where it was filmed. I enjoy the most picture of St. Cloud MN in recognizable locations and seeing how the city has changed since the 89th year. This is an interesting historical piece for us. It seems that every time a film is made here, everyone wants to communicate with it. It is not possible to find a copy of any of the local video shops, because everyone was stolen after it came out of VHS. I was getting a copy of Japan from eBay if I was interested in how the track route is across the city. I didn't know the director was St.Cloud.
