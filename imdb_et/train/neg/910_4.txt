The story was very straightforward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no-brainer comedy that just bored. Some of the audience seemed funny, but I like more intelligent humor. <br /> <br /> There were several well-known Swedish actors in the film and their performance was decent given the script. Lena Endre looked as always. <br /> <br /> I can't remember the original movie, so I can't tell if it's better or worse. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movies like SÃ¤llskapsresan, this movie may be worth it.
