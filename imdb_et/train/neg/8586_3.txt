What a disappointment ... really is the best of the preforms, but the story is weak, the plot is rushed and the end result is just a set of pieces that have been poorly realized and encountered. There are a number of continuity flaws that contrast with the original movies, and the emergence of Darth Vader was so terrible that the legendary moment of contemporary cinema is now rather funny, which is ridiculed for years. I do not complain about the debilitating dialogue because it is Star Wars ... the three original films had style, cult feel and split stories, and strange dialogue adds charm. Prequels were low attempts to make more money and this lack of love shows a shovel. All the disappointment.
