This film was probably just as stupid as Naked Gun (which was supposed to be). The case at point: <br /> <br /> 1. To make him fake, drowning Roberts takes secret swimming schools at YWCA. After his "death", the YWCA calls his wife to work to give compassion. HELLO how did they get their job number? <br /> <br /> 2. Before he leaves the city, he falls to his wedding ring. Days or even weeks later, he finds his John. Does this mean that the toilet is never rinsed? <br /> <br /> 3. There is no explanation of how he pays for his mothers in a welfare home (because he did it for his RICH spouses). <br /> <br /> 4. At the end of this tiring movie, Roberts doubts that his wife is in the house. Instead of running his own life, he runs instead of the kitchen to see if the cans are clean.
