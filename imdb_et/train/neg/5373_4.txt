This is a classic example of the growing problem of films. Why is background noise and soundtrack more dramatic than dialogue? What's the point? This movie is not alone. Most movies look like this right now. For 2 years I was wondering if it was something wrong with my TV, but then I got a new television and it is there again. BACKGROUND Noise that may occur behind participants in a city group drives a dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie was even more annoying because in English the woman was always mumbles. I was hoping that Jean Reno would say, "Excuse me for talking or getting out of marble." If you look at this DVD and even have a French secondary education, I recommend the French version with subtitles. <br /> <br /> I give to him 4 because Reno was so good in Leon.People rejoice over the landscape, but I saw it on television and I lived in rocks for a few years, so "Enh".
