"Man in the attic" is a film set in the 1910s. It's inspired by a real story. Unfortunately, this is a story that really did not need to be talked about. <br /> <br /> When looking at the box, the people responsible for packing the film tried to make it film-free and erotic. They use terms like "illegal passion", "forbidden thing" and "unlimited enjoyment". They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris (little Doogie Howser, M.D.) with a gun! <br /> <br /> The story includes Krista, played by Anne Archer. She is unhappy with a gentleman who owns a business. Edward (Harris) is an employee of the spouse's business. Krista and Edward fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The supposedly "shocking" part of the movie is: Krista's husband finds it and forbids them to see each other again. What do they decide to do? Krista comes when Edward lives in his attic. Wow! Krista sees someone else, and Edward is very jealous. So on and on and on. <br /> <br /> "Man in the attic" does not include any new territory. This is the original showtime of Showtime, which explains why stars are a couple of B-list participants and both appear briefly in the buff. <br /> <br />
