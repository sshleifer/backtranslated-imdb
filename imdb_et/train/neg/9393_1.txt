Really, truly, abysmally, harshly, terribly. But actor Clayton Moore (Lone Ranger) feels competent as an actor. He's the only one. <br /> <br /> A rare treatment within five minutes if you want the depth of grotesque, transparent special effects, in Southern California as a "month" (again and again) and acting so unfairly on wood that it may be a scam. . . except that it is clear that it is not - there is no humor except inadvertently. <br /> <br /> Dialogue can be worse than any of these other aspects and costumes. . . well, he said. Fuck? What's the plot? Bad guy (well, bad bad boy) and his henchmen, including his reputation agent Krog (listen carefully or suspect it's McDonald's founder Ray Kroc's name) and his incredibly failed weapons (who are still handguns that never need recharging , as well as Commando Cody, so there's a lot of fire interruptions). <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
