I love the West. I can watch them all day. "Good, bad and ugly" is my favorite of all time. I watched "Silveradot" probably for the eighth time just the other day, because it was in CMT. But this film, Shiloh Waterfall, is undoubtedly the worst western country I've ever watched. Action was terrible. They do not explain anything in the search for a mysterious compass. The only good part I think is a good looking girl. The very noticeable long pause between the dialogue seemed deliberate only to make time for an acceptable length of film. This movie wasn't even worth the new rent I paid in our local movie rental shop. I felt like I was kidnapped and deserves rent support if there was such a thing. The only reason I stopped it was that I hate not seeing the movie until the end. I turned to this side because it was so bad. Please do a better job for the director if you decide on another. It's a movie that has the potential to turn people off to Western countries.
