Monika Mitchell's show companion has some laughs and some cautious violence. I wouldn't say blood soaked; but there is insult and injury. Max Matteo (John Cassini) is an actor of character who has a unique adaptability on the screen, but has a terrible experience in selecting the parts he follows. It is always the manufacturer's nephew or the seemingly trivial reason why he is not given the role he is looking for. Well, the best thing to do is get rid of the competition ... Max is obsessed with such thoughts. A rewarding career is simply swinging, pushing and shooting. Other cast members: Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and Eric Roberts and Sandra Ohi came. Well, it's business ... or is it?
