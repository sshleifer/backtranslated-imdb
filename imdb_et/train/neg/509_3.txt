This film concerns the escape of British war prisoners from World War II from a camp in Germany. <br /> <br /> I find "Wooden Horse" disappointingly boring. The object could be exciting, tense and adrenaline, but the "Wooden Horse" is spoken in a very simple way. It is a set of common and badly spoken events that have no suspension or excitement. In the first half it is clear how the prisoners of war dug the tunnel, but the events are so simple that there are not enough mistakes and close shaving to make the edge. The last part of the movie is even worse, they just move from one place to another without the cat and mouse. And could the characters talk a little less and act more in the movie? I'm disappointed with the "Wooden Horse", it wastes the potential to be a big movie.
