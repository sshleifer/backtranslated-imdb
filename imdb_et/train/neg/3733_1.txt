Weak, stale, tired, cliched; wants to be a Basic Instinct, but leaves the opportunity for new insights after fresh perspectives. Insipid, tritized, grotesque and without any possible redemption value; oo, wait ... it was only 90 minutes long ... it had to be just * seemed much longer! I'd rather brush my toothbrush with the bus station than sit back on it. I express my opinion here: I think that means I didn't like it.
