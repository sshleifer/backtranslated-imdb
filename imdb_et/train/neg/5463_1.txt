I saw Arthur (TV series and books) years ago and did not show much of this example (if you are a fan of this comic, sorry if I break it, but that's what I think). didn't do it. <br /> <br /> The characters of the schoolchildren seemed to be fighting all the time (especially Arther and DW), they were often nice to each other, but gradually became tired of Arthur's complaint against each and his sister's DW (but the name was written ) and DW was a 4-year-old Arthur sister like ADHD (or ADD), who was sometimes demanding (which may be the reason Arthur got angry with what his routines were like his imaginary friend and his stuffed animal collection, etc.), Arthuri friends like teens as they were like in Arthur's books, and parents, well, they didn't care very much. <br /> <br /> The biggest comic was Rocko's modern life, not Arthur.
