This exhibition is terrible, jokes are all terrible and worsening. I am one of those people who was never a big fan of Corner Gas, but at least I liked it first, until it got through the second season, all the jokes were played and the characters were nothing to them. Well at least in the corner the gas was good at first, the little mosque in Prairie is usually a terrible and inconvenient CBC comedy with no episode. who actually live on the prairie? Maybe there are jokes on them and are they working there? I don't know any people who like this exhibition and can't wear it, jokes are completely predictable and characters are even less advanced than Corner Gas. Hopefully, it will not last much longer, because all the success that this show has shown is, in my opinion, entirely the basis for the assumption that it is a Muslim that is different and could / should have brought an excellent show.
