The full title of this movie is "Waqt: Race Against Time". This is a race that nobody can ever win, but you can definitely lose your loss margin if you don't waste any of your valuable "waqti" on this buckwheat. This film was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made K3G honest. It made my obedience too far. It was ridiculously silly in her story and deserves to be mocked. <br /> <br /> It's not as terrible as Baghban or Black, but there's nothing to suggest on this film. Stupid, pointless, Amitji ridiculously with OTT. The central "plot" is another nasty example of harshly manipulative propaganda that infects so many "family" BW movies. If my father, who picked me up and loved me, treated me like Big B, then Akshay, I'll shoot him. There is nothing to say about the trivialisation of the terminal disease.
