It's like a bad 80s TV show and he tried to get a soft core for porn movies. Oh, my god was that bad. The plots of each character were of little importance. The plot itself was nothing to talk about. Something with a stalker, I think. Finally, does he let himself down? It's not really clear, but somehow the volleyball game is involved. And the main character (Randy) sleeps a lot. The only reason my friends rented this movie was because Casper Van Dien was in it, and they were looking to move forward with him in these scenes, which is hardly traceable. Thank you God for not spending any money on it, but I want this hour back from my life.
