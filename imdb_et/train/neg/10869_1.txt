My friend drove this video to me and I was quite excited to watch it, but after ten minutes of James Hetfield's slow song and Lars, who would hit his drum that showed slow movement, I started thinking, "Why am I watching it? This question speaks through your thoughts 5? 10 minutes after playing. I gave the tape back the same day as you suspect it wouldn't be worth buying or watching! <br /> <br /> Just my opinion! <br /> <br />
