I don't even want to waste the time it takes to write 10 lines to this cruelty. Hyung-Rae Shim is happy that bad filmmaking is not a capital crime, or he would die twice to write and manage this disaster. I'm surprised that this film had a $ 75 million budget, but it was really a joy in the sense that it was such a huge flop that Shim hopefully could never make another movie in the rest of his life and thus not waste. more filmmakers time. I think the actors would come together now and lynched. <br /> <br /> The sources of these effects could make a big movie with this budget. As usual, the failure would have been a terrible script and story at first. "Transformers" was another visual party with a weak script, but it looks like "Citizen Kane".
