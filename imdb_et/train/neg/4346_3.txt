Why oh, why do people make good material and feel the need to change it somewhat? Having read a book that this film is supposed to be based on a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little or nothing at all in the original book. I went to this movie with little expectation - I knew it would have a cumbersome telemovie feeling - but it couldn't even do it. <br /> <br /> This is not a prequel - the only relationship he has with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is a story of a completely different character, given the same name. They've just come out of Carlos's Way fan; insulting the injury by adding Luis Guzman, who plays an important role in the original film, in a different role. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing is that now that this film has been made, no other original material in the Carlito's Way book is being treated - something I really would have seen. I felt like Chopper - they have four books, as well as interviews about the value of fantastic non-fictional material and could have made the brilliant biography of Australia's most terrifying underworld face instead of twilight, but a strange pathetic little run (though Eric Bana's performance was at times) . Now we never see Carlito's real initial rise and fall. <br /> <br /> The three stars are because it is not so terrible when you look at it as a purely independent flick - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is not Carlito, but she could be good with other roles) and the story is not too bad. Even Puffy Combs fits his role. But they do not understand the essence of the underworld at this time (I am a little criminals) - something that the original film and books got right (after writing by a lawyer and now judge Edwin Torres) The fact is that it is not independent - it is perhaps the most a disappointing prequel that was ever filmed.
