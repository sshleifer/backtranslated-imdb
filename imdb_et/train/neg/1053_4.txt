Dare to take Cinderella's story. Badly bad script, but Kathleen Turner turns into a pretty decent step-by-step mother performance. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning in some parts, but that's it. The costumes of the period range from Elizabeth's to the 1990s. Fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself completely in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> If you're really a Cinderella story - I recommend "Ever After: A Cinderella Story" or "Glass Hatch".
