Not as bad as it is credited (the hell is much worse)? more frustration for me. Such an imaginative concept that Hooper never uses in its economic direction and even less in smoke (apology). It goes dead in a serious tone of both evil and overflow, becoming ridiculous and unreasonable, giving the entire pessimistic mystery / conspiracy-blessed narrative just to a telegraph to stop something completely steep. That is why the pace of change continues to be quite slow and Brad Dourif (to cool down to see him in the lead) seems to be struggling with unbalanced performance, despite the fact that his color, the glitteringly confused intensity, has been etched. Although it is cheap, it has a competent technical attitude. At the same time, it does not seem to go beyond the usual idea and wants to flaunt unpleasant fools (which some do) and instead create special effects (flames, flames everywhere). The beam shows some elegantly frenetic shapes (more in the latter direction) and the camera work is shifted quickly and the radiation pattern is titrating. Performances are a bit like the performances of William Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have small but fun fires? especially Landis. There is no surprise, but it is penetrating.
