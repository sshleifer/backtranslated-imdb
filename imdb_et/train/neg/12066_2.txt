OK, how it is about to originate - that is, the rich old geezer leaves his legacy to his adult children, all to ungrateful losers and two horrible servants when they spend a week in their horror in an old house. What happens at night will only surprise those who have never seen a movie or television before. After some murders in which victims look like a bleeding ketchup, we have a painfully obvious twist. Participants will be guided a few times by honorable actors who need to be desperate for these pay controls. There are also some actors in the second instance who rose at that time but forgot long ago. As a result, the film creates the drama and mystery of the "Matlock" episode. I'll give you credit if it's due - the end scene is smart and amusing if you're still awake.
