Geez, the second lifetime movie, but again not the worst film in the world, but by far the best. I think the main problem is that it is quite obvious who is responsible for it, and it is generally quite predictable. Worse still, some setbacks were confusing and the viewer didn't know, "How much should I care for?" One thing I did is that the film goes to show you that it is never easy, because "good guys are good and bad guys are bad" and sometimes it is better than evil rather than evil. Hadley did not do what he did in the sense of justice, he did it because he reserved the right to work for the family, and to eliminate the race. As for Alice, it simply proves that the victim is not always a good person. Some of them really "come", even if "it" was a painful, terrible death. "The Burning Bed" is a good example of this, but the difference is that "The Burning Bed" whistle man got exactly what he earned. But is Alicia "coming"? Some say he did, but others disagree, and the law is not at all. Some do a good job, like Mia, but others just got indifferent to their roles. They were mostly wood or just convincing. The music was pretty cool and some scenes are nice and steamy, especially if you like a girl / girl. The movie is not thrown at all, but due to its outstanding weaknesses, the strengths are unfortunately in the background. <br /> <br /> I've heard of the rumors of the rumors, but after years I doubt. happens. But I wouldn't be surprised if the steep queue appeared. If Alicia is the same as people say, she doesn't believe she thinks, "YAY! I woke up! Oh, Hadley was responsible? Oh! That's okay! And you want the charges to fall!" Hadley wouldn't have been in prison anyway if he doesn't even do anything because the murder didn't really happen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, look at it at least once!
