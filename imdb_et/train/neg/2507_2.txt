It's not a good movie. It's separate, all the actors are bad and have a flat story you've seen a thousand times better. Not to mention that you can see every point on the plots that comes away from a mile. Worst of all, nobody bothered Lonette Mckee to say she can't sing. But who cares, he's so bad joke. But I ground, something new here. Bottom-line, hot girl group gets off, some get hooked on drugs, someone gets hooked on man, some gets hell out, and then terrible things happen. Surprise, surprise. Welcome to the music company. I can't believe so many people think it's a good movie. So many of you want to use a sliding scale to classify Black Movies. I don't play it! If you want to support these movies, you'll see them great! If you liked it - super! Everyone has their own. But don't try to tell me that it was good. Pleeeease! I want colored people not to chew on their films just because they have black actors. Want to see a good African-American movie? See Love Jones. Ray. Or colored purple. These would be big movies, regardless of the color of the actors. Why? Because they talked about convincing stories with great acting that made you feel like leaving the theater. Just because it is our experience, it doesn't automatically make a good movie. It's only good if it's good. Period.
