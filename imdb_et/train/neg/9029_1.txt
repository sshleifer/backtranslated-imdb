This film is practically wasting the talents of every actor that could best be called a "potboiler". <br /> <br /> Even though Top Gun opens, it's all down where there are many stereotypes and unlikely situations to follow each other until you try to stifle your popcorn. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are so many dead stories when I think it was done at a time when the discarded TV series was united. <br /> <br /> Quinn's Mexican drug addictive role is ridiculous, and his "companions" have immediately reached Quinn-Martin's 1970s show. Costner's character is wood and doesn't give us any reason to believe he really loved Mendez's woman. Nor have we convincingly believed that a woman is a painful companion and jumps to the first hot body. <br /> <br /> B-film is definitely a waste of time and a great waste of time for everyone involved.
