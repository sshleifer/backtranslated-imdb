it's not bad, but it's not good. it's just fun. <br /> <br /> This is a comedy that it should be, it's terrible. not a lot of laughs at all, because the fun of every movie is done millions of times before. <br /> <br /> It's a disgrace that all movie actors are usually big, but none of them really do a lot. and ends with sucks.
