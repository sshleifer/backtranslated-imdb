I remember watching this movie when I was young, but I couldn't remember the title, then I went through the horror films I found and think to myself that this is the title? This movie is a combined disaster / insect film with less noticeable stars. It is also somewhat boring because it has this television where you can see that the movie does not disappear from ads. There is such a resort on the land of ants. I think they were a little disturbed by the construction or something in the neighborhood, but don't quote it. The most memorable attack for me on the entire flick was the first guy to get into the pool after swimming and, of course, the Summers attack scene. What this other eye looks like is a very funny ending where survivors use cardboard tubes to breathe. Finally, as with most television movies, this film is very tame and not particularly scary if you are not panic in the eyes of ants.
