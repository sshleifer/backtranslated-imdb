I happened to love the exhibition with millions of others. So I called this movie, wondering if it's not good that it can be at least dazzling and fun. I just have to think about whether, at the end, Charlie's angels were really so boring? I don't seem to remember it like that. But this film, as bad as this type of film, can be a little like the excitement of this period and show. I saw it all, despite the negative, it was not invisible. But it was much happier, which I do not blame the performers at all, especially the women who played the angels as they actually saw them. The film wasn't that interesting. He tried to make every angel "character". (One angel is weak, one is a "good girl", one is her husband. There was no excitement in the show and the dialogue was .... dialogue. That's pretty much it. <br /> <br /> Not terrible. The worst of TV movies.
