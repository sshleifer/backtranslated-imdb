In the days when gore and sex took over, real horror movies were made. Blood Castle is, in my opinion, one of the best, although other reviewers have given it a mixed rating. Strangely enough, it resembles the newer The Theater, which was in theaters a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Directed by Antonio Margheriti in 1970, this year's title is Web of the Spider (AKA Nella Stretta Morsa del Ragno). Why did he do it, I don't understand, although the remake celebrated Anthony Franciosa and Klaus Kinski and was very good. Perhaps he saw a good story and wanted to adapt it more to the American audience. I really do not know. The interesting thing is that he made the original in black and white and in color. <br /> <br /> Castle of Blood is an excellent Italian Gothic. La Danza Macabra is reportedly an unpublished work by Edgar Allen Poe, who appears in this film. The store and Lord Blackwood, the owner of the haunted castle, put the American writer Alan Foster (George Riviere) on not being able to spend the whole night in the said castle and survive. Foster accepts the wager but will soon regret it because he is witnessing several murders of murders. The ghosts seem to come alive once in a couple of years, but have been condemned to reintroduce life crimes. Lord Blackwood forgot to tell Foster that his blood is needed to get up on the next breath! <br /> <br /> It doesn't take Foster and the beautiful Elisabeth Blackwood (described by incomparable Barbara Steele) to fall in love, even though their romance is doomed, because Elisabeth is one of the ghosts. I'm not giving up, but I just say that Vere Castle is a very romantic tragedy because it is a horror story. <br /> <br /> Comments. This film is very atmospheric even according to the excellent standards of Italians. My personal opinion is that they do a real horror when someone else, and somewhat dusky black and white filming only increases that. In honesty, Web of Spider was good in itself, even in color and brightness. I loved persistent shots that most modern drivers don't have. Indeed, when Alan enters the castle for destruction, we will be treated for several minutes if he does nothing but travel from room to room, fear and relieve the building of his face and manicans. By the time the first ghost appears, the audience is bound and ready. There is a great dialogue between Alan and the ghosts, nothing else is done with the usual ghost stories. There are also memorable scenes that are very visual for this type of film. Elisabeth's "murder" and the dance stage (resembling somewhat similar to the dances of the 1962 soul hall) were particularly good. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, few viewers of general interest hear much less, this movie. It's a shame, because it's over the rest. I got my copy of Sinister Cinema and I'm not sure if it can be bought elsewhere. It is necessary for people interested in this genre.
