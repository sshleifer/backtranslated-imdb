*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** With its very opening credits, this fantastic movie sets a record: it's a quick classic. It does not take long to understand that this film is large, larger than "Kindergarten Police" or "Police Academy 7". The enormous size of it left me hesitant when I left the cinema in the cinema and immediately went back to the ticket counter to buy another ten tickets. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that simply requires a number of views. The first look will definitely leave you with this strange "Huh?" feeling but not embarrassed - it happens best to us. The story is so damn worthy to ask for the mortality of its authors. What seems to be a simple story of an idiot that is intrusive to the FBI is an allegorical story that works on many levels and teaches us everything about things that are very important in life. The complexity of the plot structure disturbs you at first sight, but don't give up! It was only after the sixth or seventh review that I began to unravel some of Corky Romano's hidden secrets. And, at the end of the day, an unexpected twist, otherwise you could be caught completely if it turns out that the FBI agent Brick Davis is the FBI's most desirable criminal, Corky is not a real FBI agent, Pops Romano is innocent, Peter Romano admits he is illiterate and Paulie Romano admits he is illiterate and Paulie Romano comes out of the closet homosexual. Surprised me of hell, I can tell you so much. <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan's comedies are unbalanced as he directs his character Corky Romanot through the labyrinth of completely unpredictable situations. Reminiscent of John Reynolds' performance "Manos, Fate", Kattan takes many innumerable personalities and deals with all scenes with perfect comic timing. But Kattan is not just comedy. He is also a master of drama because he controls the audience's feelings with the slightest movement. His facial expressions reflect life itself. For example, in the scene in which he drives his brothers' faces, you see the manifestation and alienation of social injustice, which is clearly reflected in his irritated face. At this point, finding a dry eye in the house is difficult. <br /> <br /> Scriptwriters David Garret and Jason Ward are "Corky Romano" real heroes. The story with such proportions is easy to understand why two experienced writers had to be used to complete this ambitious project. Their skilful storytelling and unusual structuring makes Pulp Fiction look like a mediocre Saturday night. The story of Garret and Ward is so convincing and appealing that it grabs you hair, swallows you completely, shakes you and spits you out. At the end of this world-wide experience (Corky Romano) you will find yourself from different people with different worldviews and different ideas, and with just one question in your opinion: <br /> <br /> Why, God? Why?!?
