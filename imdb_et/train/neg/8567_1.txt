When I rented this movie, I had very low expectations ...... but when I saw it, I realized that this movie was less (much less) than expected. The actors were bad (the doctor's husband was one of the worst), the story was so stupid ... it could work for a Disney movie (except murders), but it's not a comedy, it's a ridiculous foolish masterpiece. The title is well chosen except for one thing: they can add stupid movies after Death Husbands! I'll give him 0 and half of 5.
