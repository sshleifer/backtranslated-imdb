It was a long time ago. At that time I didn't know that the girl settled when "Shannon Wilsey" was actually a porn star Savannah, but she was so beautiful (and got naked so often, thanks to God) that I actually sat through this brain-rotting generation. I like cheese that pulls as much as the next guy - more than the next man - but it was more cheesy and more rancid. Exceeding the truly annoying mad scientist and director, writers, and special effects, the almost complete incompetence of people undermines the free film of humility, which is the only rescue arm of the film. Savannah, before he became a plasticized Barbie Doll, became king of a pornophene, is really interesting to look at - he's fallen dead gorgeous, breaks in at times uncontrollable strangles, looks out of the camera and laughs and just seems to be a good time that is more than telling the audience . Because even though Savannah and his colleagues spend this picture alone naked, it still cannot hide the fact that it is an incredibly stupid, badly made and annoying film. If you know someone who has this on video, or if it's a cable at night, check it out, but don't waste your money on renting.
