Take: <br /> <br /> 1st famous game <br /> <br /> Director 2, who now has his own idea, using <br /> <br /> 3rd copy of popular theater production in staged productions which includes the game mentioned in point 1. <br /> <br /> 4th Leader - Who doesn't know the part he plays And you get: "Hamlet, Prinz von Dänemark" <br /> <br /> I heard the Hamlet radio show with Maximilian Schell Hamlet and me we were so disappointed. I was hoping that the filmed version would be better for Schell to have at least body language to emphasize what he was saying - something. Then the set ... minimalist design is not everyone's taste, but usually I like it when the stage is just enough to explain what is a device and something more. Unfortunately, it's on stage, in the theater. It doesn't work in a movie based on a game that has really credible settings. Because the idea of ​​the collection was copied from theater production, in which Schell was already playing Hamlet ... let's say if it was the only thing to complain about ... I'll ask myself how Schell would be a part of Hamlet's first place and how someone could play him the second time. If you have the chance to watch any of the 60 movies based on "Hamlet", don't look at it if you are not a masochist, or really hardcore, or you want to bother uninvited players.
