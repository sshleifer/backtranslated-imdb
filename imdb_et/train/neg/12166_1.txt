Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - yes, she's connected to Bruce), the first movie killer, is back in her old tricks. He is one of Camp Rolling Hills advisers. As long as the girls in the camp are nice and away from sex, the drugs and things fall in love. But a few steps across the line and Angela kills them - breaking bad jokes all the time. <br /> <br /> The original "Sleepaway Camp" was a cruel and nasty splatter film, but it had some good points for it. It is also outrageous and disgusting, but it has nothing good. The plot is made to death and it adds something new to the formula. There are a lot of terrible killings (people are burned alive, heads are cut off, cucumbers cut), but all the gates are so obviously fake that it really becomes a comic. It also has the smallest number of tents I've ever seen and almost everything is too old for their roles (especially Higgins). As expected, the woman's nudity is free (here is a huge lie to Valerie Hartman) and a compulsory good girl / good boyfriend (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). The only exception, with the exception of Springsteen and Higgins, is weak - even according to film standards. There is also a brutal edge on this film, where one character perishes in a building! Bored and sick stupid plot, meaningless nudity and bad gore. Skip it.
