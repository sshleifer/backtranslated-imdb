On the way back from IMC6 (San Jose, California) all five (of us, three of us hardcore Kamal fans) had reached a unanimous decision; VV was a strong hunt and thanks to the film we had a rather difficult Monday. Not to mention the fact that we swore to leave the theaters next year. <br /> <br /> I am not accusing Kamal here because he was hinted at a recent interview with cartoonist Madan (Vijay TV). He said something like: "Tamizh Cinema'la photography, editing as a namba munnera's wrestling scenario, direction, Acting'la innum namba munnera'la" (Tamil cinema has grown in photography and editing, but we have barely improved when it comes to scenario, direction and action ‚Äù). While watching VV, these words really ring. <br /> <br /> Now there are 10 reasons why I hate this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> > 3. Harris Jeyaraj I have hardly used myself here, but in fact HJ has learned to bow down to every recent movie (remember 'Anniyan', 'Ghajini') with the cofon, let him play as background music, the next time I have a headset transplant, he pays he's for that. <br /> 4. Songs Also, the songs do not help to move the film's narration spatially / temporally, nor do they make your sitting and message because the film seems to have been made of four very long songs with some scenes n their between. <br /> <br /> 5. Short went too far. VV is best suited for a short show, not a 2-hour plus "thriller". The use of Klis here, like the Energizer's rabbit, continues and continues; only in that case you don't want it. The later part of the film is a great drag. <br /> <br /> 6. Kamal-Jothika Mating Two ice cubes rubbing together could have produced more sparks than this pair of controls. There is no reason why you should root them to do it together. In fact, each time they come together on the other side of the film, they are very encouraging about the story. Hate to say this, but Kamalini Mukerjhee's 10-minute romance does more than what Kamal and Jothika in this movie achieve plus 'Thenali'. <br /> <br /> 7. Kamal Haasan Accent Kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody is talking about in India or the US; and it's not new. He has done this since "Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae". It just goes nerve. Imagine what it can do if its affection for using this strange accent matches that of the US. He does not leave it to the immigrant, he gives his men advice (puzzled by TN Cops from Cherry, Sathor and elsewhere) daring in Kamanglish ("Wha we here here is a common bad police wok"). nausea. <br /> <br /> 8. Logic There are some drivers you expect on a certain scale. Gautam fails us badly with some funny shows in the common sense department. What D.C.P in your mind corresponds to the interest of your love in the streets to discuss issues like your own and your life after life! The scene inside the theater was so bad, culminating; we heard that the people behind us are heroically challenging the hero IQ. "Is he stupid, can he just use his siren or light?" (The busy Madras highway runs Kamal-the-cop-on-a-a-a-a-a-police-jeep on a bicycle like every ordinary guy!). "Can't she just use her weapon?" ("The cyclist starts walking and we have Kamal that has traveled a great deal of time.) I will not vote for later, but I just try to explain the mood inside. <br /> <br /> 9. If I would like to watch how women are raped, the fall of their throat, more women are raped and thrown into the bushes with tortuous authenticity, I sit at home, and rather look at the "police report" or "Kuttrami." The use of excessive violence should take place so that the story is expanded, not puzzled! Gautum is confused about what extensions (rapes, murders) are and what is the main (story)! <br /> <br /> 10. Even a double blow to Espresso didn't get the pain out of the head.
