I like shelter movies. I've made it a habit to see as much as possible. Even the ones they've done have been cool like EXORCISM and KILLER QUESTIONS. It's just flat. I can't believe that the same people who did the DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA COURSE also made this movie! It is not even ridiculously bad as JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which by the way is quite bad). It's just BAD! I mean, I can evaluate and / or forgive badly acting or flat special effects on the asylum screen, but this movie is too serious. I really hope the train has better shirts. Now this is a movie I can't see.
