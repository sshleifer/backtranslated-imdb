This movie should have been just 10 minutes. I mean, there is really only 10 minutes of traceable content in this case (I even doubt it is a movie). The opening credits of the film were somehow promising. Since the film starts with a man's short comments, rub your hands really and capture more materials from Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave does a decent job involving one of Cohen's famous songs. The length of Cave's performance makes you even more enthusiastic to see more of Cohen, whose intelligent and well-spoken words are already yours. But as it turns out, Cave's staging is just the beginning of long super boring stages that are literally the number of those who don't even have the minimum of attractiveness to keep you on your seat. I mean, what does the filmmaker really think? five-minute close-ups want to be singers in Australia's fake concert !!! What the filmmaker really thinks to offend the audience by adding "fake applause" to these endless unpleasant performances. Film is the perfect torture that shows very little of what you saw. There is no material in Cohen's past. In fact, with the exception of some photos of your early days as a singer / poet, there is absolutely nothing! If you add all the minutes Cohen speaks, it may not even reach 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes are somewhat missed by the catastrophic camera work that captures some of the most unpleasant people screaming at Cohen's lyrics. If you have ever decided to waste your money on your film, DON'T! just throw it in garbage and save at least time.
