Linda Lovelace was a sadistic woman hate Chuck Traynor. I don't understand how a dog with sex (which is also an abuse of animals) can be entertaining or funny. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was forced to make these films. I know that some people criticize this comment, but I firmly believe that this type of film will bring hate and hatred to women. This society continues to represent women as sexual objects, not human beings. We call ourselves "civilized", but I feel we have a long way to go before we can scratch the civilized surface.
