Ugh, what can I say after ugh. I rented this movie because it was labeled the original vampire sequel. This movie couldn't be a lamer. Not only the plot, but the behavior is cruel. With some obvious plot holes, this movie makes it very difficult to watch. How many times did I ask my own peace of mind to watch the film continue for a long time after the plot was jumping. Here is a sample of the camera problems ... <br /> <br /> SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Professional "Slayer" requires sleeping outdoors in the evening. She wakes up to a woman who cries, sitting at her no more than 3 feet. She is going to comfort her immediately, without suspecting her sudden appearance. She goes to cry to seduce her, and she lets it happen with obvious results ... <br /> <br /> Zoe, one of the main characters, is bitten by a vampire, but as long as she takes these "experimental pills" she got In Mexico, he's fine, although his body temperature is below room temperature ... <br /> <br /> The Guard outside the monastery, where the hero sleeps, dies in vampires, the hero leaves the next day. He then returns after one day to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery at night after leaving ... <br /> <br /> ... to avoid this movie.
