The soul of the ancient mummy goes to one of his offspring so that he can punish all those who are involved in the death of the grave. The soul transfer makes the young man tremendously fast until he reminds the mummy himself. Blood from blood diggers one by one. <br /> <br /> To be as short as possible, Pharaoh's curse is quite a weak thing. Although the film has some good, original ideas (mummy blood, soul breathing, interesting make-up effects, hand ripping, etc.) and some atmospheric moments, the direction and pace are very accurate. To make matters worse, the 15 short movies of a short 66-minute run do nothing more than cushioning. I usually go to their slow moving mummy movies, but the pharaoh's curse even tests my patients. The cast helps very little. Just one exception (Ziva Rodann is a bright spot on her own, you want the film to be more focused on her mysterious character). Finally, I do not know whose idea was to put a mummy-looking servant in what seems to be pajamas, but that is ridiculous, ridiculous to look for a creature who should be scared by the audience. <br /> <br /> Despite mostly negative comments about Pharaoh's curse, I appreciate it 4/10. There is no good rating to be sure but generous considering all the film's problems.
