... And being bigger than ever. I don't make any direct references or anything here, but by saying this, this movie is pathetic. If you have been trained in military training, don't worry. I put it on a DVD with 2 friends who want to see some interesting action / warfare. Why I couldn't read the comments first. <br /> <br /> Already in the first "bomb" scene, the film has major failures, and they still show and become bigger and bigger. My two friends, who have not been in contact with the army, showed a couple of filmmaker mistakes almost as quickly as I did and asked if some of the things we are doing are realistic. Well, as you thought they were not at all. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you can't forget these totally idiotic and repetitive mistakes. 2/10 to catch my interests.
