What can I say? I ignored the comments and went to see it myself. The devil's reviews were so right. What is a waste of money given its budget. <br /> <br /> Good thing, I went to see Kill Bill after that. <br /> <br /> To see a really scary movie, Crossroads! br /> <br /> Bottom line - I like "girl in gold boot" better than this.
