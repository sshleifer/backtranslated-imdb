This is really a stupid movie. It may be fun looking for aliens and country setting, but it just isn't. <br /> <br /> Some foreigners hear the World of Wars broadcast when a small country radio station plays it on Halloween. They come to Earth to kill people, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and act as whores. The front panel of the movie shows the aliens who travel on the spacecraft ... not actually what they do. They are not party foreigners, they are stupid cartoon idiots that give annoyingly annoying annoying high inclines. The alien with the most acceptable voice is also Jack Nicholson's hanging alien, who always carries his sunglasses. Apart from foreigners, this is terrible. Writing is probably meant for children because every character is written like a child. <br /> <br /> It's a stupid movie that only kids will appreciate, maybe. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 100 minutes. PG for light language.
