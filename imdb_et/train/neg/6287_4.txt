I read about this movie in a magazine and I was interested. A woman who one day sees herself in her car ride. I thought it might be interesting ... <br /> <br /> ... but that's not. First, the title. Broken? Broken ... what? What is broken? Oh, wait ... I get, the title itself is "broken"! WOW, smart! Unfortunately, this is practically the only thing that goes for it. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite is not so bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland did much better as a mirror. Cross between body snatchers and mirror invasion and quite mediocre. A more suitable title would be "The Boring" because it pulls out every bloody scene. Or maybe "confusing" because it does not explain anything at all, not in the story or the story itself, but some vague ideas about evil copies and blind people, which are accurate with bad fears and scenes, but nothing tangible. It's just confused. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, effective and special effects are pretty good, but then it is not a difficult role. <br /> <br /> After watching a movie twice, I still feel dissatisfied, maybe a little confused, not EA Shop or Stephen King. Do yourself a favor and don't look at it. Simply put, there are better thrillers.
