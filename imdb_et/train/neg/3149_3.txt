Being an independent filmmaker and Edward D. Wood's big fan, Jr., I bought this documentary, believing that it finally set a record high when talented and brilliant Ed Wood was in fact. <br /> <br /> What I got was a frustrating, self-centered, controversial, controversial compromise of bitter self-expression has-been. <br /> <br /> When people remember Ed Wood's Jr., people really remember another man's cousin who has a chicken breast who knew someone in the nine rooms of the planet? <br /> <br /> It seems like a minute is new to Ed Wood, these people come out of "Wood"! Only the central bold swipes will take someone who really gave them the opportunity if no one else was! In 50 years, I would recommend that many of these people should give up not getting the $ 75 they promised! <br /> <br /> Ed Wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker who knew how to entertain. In fact, it was all he lived. You can strangle when you see Ed's movies, but somehow you know you laugh with him, not him. <br /> <br /> But I drag ... Back at hand to the movie. When you wait for "Edward D. Wood Jr." you won't get it here. If you want a movie from tough old old actors, this is your movie!
