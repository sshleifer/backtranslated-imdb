Although I recently gave a positive view of OPERATION PETTICOAT, I didn't like this film, although it had so many similarities. Both were done in just a few years, both marked with Cary Grant and both were WWII comedies. However, the overall tone and style of the films were quite different. KISS HER FOR ME In general, it seemed to me cheaper film - poor writing, little energy and some very wide-ranging performances - even compared to OPERATION PETTICOAT. I think at least that is the fault of Jayne Mansfield. The combination of his great talents and limited ability to act made this A-budget movie similar to a tertiary studio. In addition, Cary Grant was not associated with much chemistry or energy when he was tied up - the actress generally loved her grace and class. It's sort of like linking Sir Lawrence Olivier to Marjorie Main.
