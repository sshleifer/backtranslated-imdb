This US soap opera, "Knots Landing", contains all the entertainment value to be trapped in the elevator. Each episode included parcels, such as rape, murder, kidnapping, and drug smuggling, which did not differ much from the plots of other press exhibitions. As for cast, I've seen better actors in the cereal box. From the mid-90s to the late '' knot '' repeats on U.K-Gold, like the mountain of the winding game. I'm sorry to have reported that I had to suffer because my mother was a big fan of the show and would look at it religiously. Since then, the trips have been few and far away (we hope it will remain so). The only positive thing to say about the "node" is the memorable saxophone signature that was later used as the title music for I.T.V sitcom, The Upper Hand. Great legacy, right?
