When I read most of the other comments, I felt they were too glowing for this movie. I found that it had completely lost the sparks found in earlier Zatoich films and simply proves that after a long absence from the screen it is often better to let things go. I fully agree with Star Trek's analogy with another reviewer who compared the FIRST STAR TREK movie with the original series --- millions of exciting fans waited and waited and were waiting for the show to return and were forced to see a joyful and sterile alignment of the original. <br /> <br /> The plot is sometimes incomprehensible, it is terribly gory (although Beat Takeshi's recent NEW Zatoichi is much more bloody) and lacks the heart of the originals. I didn't know the blood at all, but some might turn it off (especially scenes with split nose and isolated heads). In addition, Ichi has not had a good time - he seems to be a broken and sad guy in this movie (much, much more than usual) - and that's what the series fans might not really see. <br /> <br /> It was a great disappointment for Zatoich. If you're not like me and you want to see every Zatoich movie, it's very variable. View one of the earlier versions or the 2003 ALL-NEW version.
