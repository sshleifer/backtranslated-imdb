It was Jon Pertwee, who said, "It's very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly". Well, if that is the case, PASTY FACES is "very simple". David Baker (director / screenwriter) and his casting seem impressive that comedy is stealing scenes and styles from higher Britcoms, such as LOCK STOCK .. and TRAINSPOTTING, using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down, speaking very loudly very quickly. Alan McCaffrey suffers particularly from this type of OTT, but is not enough to destroy the film because it is not enough to destroy the film. <br /> <br /> PASTY FACES is especially horrible on all fronts, especially in the letter. I did not understand why it ended as he did, it just seemed that it stopped steeply and stupidly. Oh and other outstanding mistakes are that you need a visa to visit the US and have a green card to work there - this movie would be if you think you can get out of the plane and start a new life in America without permission - that you still pay for donating blood in America - People I I know in America and who donate blood, tell me about the suspension of donations that have been suspended several years ago - and that you can buy a weapon in any type of weapon. As far as I know, the weapons laws in America differ from country to country, but no arms store sells tanker weapons. So we have a very wrong view of America from a very unrealistic and threatening film. Perhaps this is the revenge of BRAVEHEART, a very Hollywood Scottish view? Maybe, but it doesn't prevent PASTY FACES from being a mess of comedy
