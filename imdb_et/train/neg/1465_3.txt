First of all, I would like to add that I myself am a historian, so what I'm looking for in a film based on historical events is that it is actually based on historical facts. But this is not the case here. Of course, the movie is fun and everything, but the fact that it's not entirely based on real facts is more than annoying. Hitler was not anti-Semitic in his youth, he even worked for the Jews before the war. It was, however, during the World War and after it, its views on the Jews. Her upbringing in this film is also inaccurate, Hitler as a child was not disturbed little. He had more or less normal education. Nothing is mentioned about his missing brothers and other important pieces that add to Hitler's puzzle. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle is a great actor, but he doesn't match Hitler's role. Hitler was not as impossible and unstable as he was in a portrait here. During his younger years he was a charismatic person "manipulated" by people using his charms. His unstable behavior and rage began at the turning point of the war. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a movie about Hitler's life based on real historical facts and not on charges. I really hate when people point to an accused finger, such as Hitler and others, and say inaccurate stories to paint them pure evil. It is much better to tell the story exactly as it was so that everyone could know what it was! Those behind this film should have studied it before doing it. Because they don't even know what really happened. Hitler wasn't even let down on Munch's revolutionary march, his shoulder hanging out of his nest. <br /> <br /> This gives you more to see a good documentary than to see it.
