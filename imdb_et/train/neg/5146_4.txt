I had a lot of time to see this movie, here in Latinamerica Japanese or some oriental film is not broadcast in theaters, we find some of these movies in some underground stores, and I just found Avalon, I was expecting something good, but the only good thing about this movie is the first scene, the rest of the movie is boring and meaningless, just stupid, a lot of useless scenes and a boring story. I waste my time even on this movie. I'm sorry, but that's the truth.
