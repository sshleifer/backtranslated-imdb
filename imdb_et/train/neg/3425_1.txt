I spend as much time on this review as the writers did in the script. IT IS EASY TO PROCESS EVER MADE. <br /> <br /> They killed Navin Johnson. Not only was Mark Blankfield's performance GOD EFFECTIVE, so everything was elses !! Physical comedy was forced, flat and predictable. The script seemed to be written by the Mongolian monkeys, using the names Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. The way manufacturers can push such hostile cinematographic faeces over me. They even made a veteran actor Ray Walston look like a talent-less holiday. Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> I want a 96-minute lifetime when I was looking back at this shining comedy so I can try and get all the cinema out of this intimidation.
