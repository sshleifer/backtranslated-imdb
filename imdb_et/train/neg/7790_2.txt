Like some other people who have reviewed the film, I also looked at it nostalgic ... before I was afraid to watch it again. Unfortunately, my childhood memories of this film were completely unreliable and Paul's dangers have now been manifested as embarrassing in banal, racist, and routine boring filmmaking. Even the presence of old experts Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas cannot overcome the dirty scenario, the terrible theme song and some bad "special effects". In addition, the stereotypical images of African and Arabic characters are painful to look at, especially given that it has emerged immediately after the movement of civil rights. Michael Weldon's original Psychotronic Encyclopedia reports that Paul's hazards were originally produced for television, but inexplicably received a theatrical release. Based on the results, this is a completely plausible (and confusing) scenario.
