I have never read the Bradbury novel that this film is based, but what I have gathered is interesting (when I finally read and want it). My comments are only based on the movie. As soon as I saw the trailer I knew I had to see it and I was so excited, but when I finally did, I was so disappointed that it hurt. This is because the film itself felt so amateur. The participants were not well cast (although Robards and Pryce are both good actors - just not here). It seems that the boy's actors were asked to show up, get characters, say lines and make faces. The set and props were cheap and unreal. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised at the terrible place that I had to go online and check who drove it to see what job he was doing. The editing was cut and pasted, and the plot (scenario) was just that (though the author was himself, irony?). Building up tension, fear and intercourse was so easy that the ultimate result was ineffective. that. The most painful thing is that content is interesting and fun and interesting. It had so much potential. Unfortunately, the film was so technically bad that the story was taken away by the shine of the story.
