This film is "riveting", but in a similar way a car accident is riveting. It's hard to look. All in all, this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment - and a futile, biased experiment. Filmmakers are manipulative and have no problems with the lowest possible denominator. The way Ted lends money is to take advantage of it. The steps taken by filmmakers at Ted (the so-called expert meeting) were empty and there were no substantive attempts to connect with Ted. Instead, it is painfully clear that they are intended to cover the positions of filmmakers and to further exploit Ted's situation. The worst part is that filmmakers stop following Ted in 6 months; and seemingly completely broken down on a topic they had been following for so long. If they had taken care of them, they would have found better "experts" to help Ted. If they really wanted to see what Ted was doing, they would have to let him spend the money without intervention. This movie is at best a high-level Jackass stunt, not a documentary. It is sad to think how much $ 100,000 would actually have changed the life of a homeless person if it had been put into the right hands.
