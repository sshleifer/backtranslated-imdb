Worst of Bob Hope's comedy (which includes some heavy competition). I hope that the sailor on the island dreams of being out loud in a bath with a gay girl who "drives her ship". Someone definitely drove this Hope hacker over the cliff because it has Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida, and they still can't laugh or do the excitement. Where's Bing Crosby when you really need him?
