It has been a classic with a totally amazing casting and team. Instead, there is a recurring paraphrase of all the 1979 conspiracy theories concerning the murder of JFK, which has been trying in vain to murder the fictitious President Kegan in 1960. Many great characters are wasted because they are enough to do it - for example, Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach, or they are asked to go quite widely - John Huston. Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins manage to use themselves very well in a variety of ways. <br /> <br /> Photography is fantastic but does not justify one and a half life for an hour. Buying a DVD.
