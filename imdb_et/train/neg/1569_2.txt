Weak plot, unlikely car performance and helpless fumbling characters. At first I thought this film was made in the 1970s because the picture quality, as well as the story and drama seemed to be taken from the old Kojaci episode. When I checked and found it really as late as -97, I was surprised. This is by far one of the worst and least (triller) movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If you read it, we recommend that if you see that you waste time if you could have done something exciting, like drying the paint.
