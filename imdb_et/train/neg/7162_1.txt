This film takes what might have been a good idea, a mummified 2000-year-old witch and completely destroys it. Nora and Jim are alcoholics who are going to dry in Ireland. They go with their Nan and Uncle. Uncle has discovered a 2000-year-old witch preserved in peat. He revives him and he is a Nora form. He cannot be killed normally (more damage). However, Nora works the way it does. <br /> <br /> This is a gothic horror movie that has been made inexpensively. It's a striking mess. I have to ask why anyone would want to do such a bad movie. I am tempted to learn witchcraft to disappear. <br /> <br /> ALL COSTS
