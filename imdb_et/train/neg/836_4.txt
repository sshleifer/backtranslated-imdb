A fan dedicated to ICD films, the first of which is a milestone, and another probably the best success for Disney, is this movie ... Now I am not arguing with animation, voice, music, but it is no more than Timon / Pumbaa screwed in the TLK atmosphere. Although not bad, it doesn't add anything. Basically, this movie is one big joke ... and that's all that saves it. Make a real TLK3, Disney! There is a possibility. <br /> <br /> 4/10
