(aka: Bloodsucker Leads Dance) <br /> <br /> Lots of nude kids throwing this lesbian scene. The film should be in Ireland, but it seems to me Rome and Adriatic. <br /> <br /> Gothic Lesbians are invited to the County Island Castle during the weekend. One by one, they seem to be missing their heads because madperson runs around. <br /> <br /> It is not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are a lit luminaire, even though candles are illuminated. Go figure ... (sic) <br /> <br /> Copying is worse than usual and the plot is just for eroticism and nudity. Euro Horror actress Alfredo Rizzo leads, this is one snoozer. <br /> <br /> Pretty boring 2 out of 10
