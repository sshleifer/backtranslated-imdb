Man, it gives a lot of good comments in review books. Frankly, I found it too slow and unpleasant from the start. I was expecting this bit of steam to accelerate, but it didn't happen. This movie is very overrated. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare, King James of England, hasn't approached me anyway, so it's just me. The latter has a fair share in the first half of the film when they show Ronald Colman's Othello role. <br /> <br /> The movie's good points are - thanks to the restored print - some decent cinematography and a young, thin and attractive Shelly Winters. <br /> <br /> Generally it is just too boring, too many repetitions in some scene to watch again. Besides, we all know that most of the participants are nuts, but Hollywood's praise for showing this story here.
