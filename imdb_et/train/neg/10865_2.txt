I like bhai MBBS, but "Lagge Raho ..." SUX really SUX. I've never seen such a boring movie in my life. And these high ratings surprised me that Wat happened to the taste of Indian cinema viewers? ** MAY BE A SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> An educated girl needs Bhai's advice to discuss her personal problem. phones come from people from the world part u r ??? I agree that the films should be fictitious, but these things are really undigested. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (2 stars are 15 minutes good)
