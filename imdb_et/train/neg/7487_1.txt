Unfortunately, this movie is so bad. The original Out of Towners was manic and very funny, of course they used a script written by Neil Simon. For some reason, Neil Simons' script is not used in this movie, so it goes down again and again. Even the audience I was, never laughed. The direction is very slow and tedious, and if it is fun, it is given away so that the joke dies, ie a couple in the park. They say it's a New York lighting ceremony. We all know that the lights are coming and we see the cute and looting Goldie & Steve. The whole movie is filming like this ... jokes are created and given away. Why is Goldies hair not even confused in the film. You will also notice every Goldie closure (they use a very intensive soft lens). I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis if you want to laugh.
