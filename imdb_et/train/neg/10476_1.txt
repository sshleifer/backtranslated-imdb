I'm a Christian. But I have always been skeptical about the films made by Christians. As a rule, they are "knowledge" in film production. I admire TBN for trying to show God and Jesus positively and honestly. But they did a terrible job for it. The act was terrible and if no one knew the Bible, no one could understand what the film was trying to overcome. Not only was the film terribly done, but the people who made it even had some facts wrong. But in this "criticism" these facts are irrelevant and too deep to come into contact with. In short, the Omega code is the absolute worst film I've ever seen, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except the comic relief every day.
