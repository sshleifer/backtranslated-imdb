Wicker Man. I'm so angry that I can't write a proper comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot was ridiculous, thinly bound and just flat. Nicolas Cage ... shame on you! I assumed that since you've been in it, it would be at least decent. It wasn't like that. <br /> <br /> I felt that much of the film was left on the floor of the cutting room, and even if it was complete, it was simply surprised and stupid. <br /> <br /> Finally, you have left foot agape, desperate and good taste offended. I've never heard so many people who leave the theater on the day off, so much hatred. People complained about it in small groups in a shopping center, four floors from a theater near the entrance. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> I heard it compared to Glitter, an American werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My boy was so bad that he didn't even talk about it. <br /> <br /> Grrrr!
