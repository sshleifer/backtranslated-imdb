The term Paradis was exceptional, but "Niki ardelean" is too late. We already have enough and we want something new. Why do people only see Romania as a post-revolutionary state? Most people do not remember or want to remember, and the new generation of movie users does not understand a bit. It should be the first day of the Romanian film, not the last song - priveghi! Maybe younger drivers should move.
