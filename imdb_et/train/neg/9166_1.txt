Recherche is a good word to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> Suppose every movie has a sales point, a trick. The transformer's trick is a fantastic effect and fans of nostalgia. The Seattle trick is dreamy that it has its own horizon: "What if someone you never met, someone you didn't see, someone you never knew was the only one for you?" Many Romans rely heavily on these tricks and some great names. The leap years make use of both Irish folklore and fact, and are characterized by remarkable names in the country. <br /> <br /> So now that the audience is in the cinema, in addition to all the usual elements that are characteristic, conflicts or consequences, the crisis, the solution and the generation, they are also waiting for stimulating dialogue, faster years, sub-regions of interest, and be somewhat good in the middle or end of writhing. story that favors the situation of the characters. <br /> <br /> This is not what Jean Yeo is trying to achieve. When they tried, their goal was probably in another court, in another stadium, on the other end of the planet. He and his writer Alain Layrac were unable to provide a stimulating dialogue. Most of the lines were developed. They seem to have a bag full of the characters he wants to use in his movie: "Okay, these are the rows and quotes I've heard or read about the movies I've seen or the books I've read before and all sound good to me when they sound good to me, it sounds good for the audience, so I have to split them all. The result is cathartic. I can't say these lines are unnecessary and have no connection with story or plot Managing, but they look somewhere away, trying to get you quoted quotes. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I know people who quote quotes based on most of our dialogue situations, trying to make it meaningful while nodding. secondly, the images depicted are foolish and one-dimensional, as an exception to the unnatural dialogue that refers to their motivation (m required) there was no conviction. I don't know who they are. They are all Simpletons from the column of advice for a female-oriented magazine. <br /> <br /> A fast year trick is not enough to steer the story because the circumstances are too low. Then again there are fewer movies, but they are better than that, no. They did it with my first and second points. Moreover, sub-plots are irrelevant (not that it is bad for movies) and thin (bad thing). <br /> <br /> Jean Yeo and the manufacturers are trying to get out of the terrible plot with fancy spots and satisfying photography. This is because they obviously realize that the acceptance of some viewers is possible and easier than others using cinematography, soundtrack and filming. These non-attentive viewers. <br /> <br /> It's not even a movie that's so bad that it's good. It's just bad. Don't look at it.
