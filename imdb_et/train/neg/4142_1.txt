This is the absolute worst film I've ever seen! There was nothing good to say about this movie. I've seen some bad movies, but it does. There is no plot and most of the movie you have either fast forward the movie to get it done faster or you don't know what the hell is going on because you can't seriously guess that someone thought about this movie and you look at it. I'm sorry for anyone who has to sit in this painful and half hour. Please take my advice and don't watch this movie because I know you think it's the biggest waste of time you've ever spent in your life.
