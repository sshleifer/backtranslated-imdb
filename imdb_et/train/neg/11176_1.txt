I saw this movie in an early preview and I can't stress enough how bad this movie was. From the beginning, the audience had met Pacino's terrible southern accent. Poor Al seemed really, really haggard, and I can't decide if it was deliberately part of his role as a drug addict, or maybe he couldn't sleep before the set. Much worse than Pacino's close-ups, this is a bad excuse for the plot. At the beginning of the movie, there are signs that Pacino's character is gay and I suspect it is what the screenwriter originally intended. Later, however, we should suspend our belief and believe that both Tea Leon and Kim Basinger (both of whom are sleeping through flat roles) covet an afternoon, half dead, ridiculous man with a ridiculous accent. The worst part was the thread of the main plot associated with espionage in a company that was never fully explained and never looked after. Since this was a preview, I reserve my final judgment because it is possible to shoot and edit again, but you can bet that I won't pay a cent to see it in theaters.
