The lethargy direction hides an otherwise convincing era, which marks the miraculous Zhang Ziyi, in an excellent role as a woman joining an extremist group in China in 1928, just before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and reunited with a former lover who is now working for Japan. Any movement of drama and story will be sucked dry with the style of director Ye Loui's somnambulistic director. The characters are still standing on each other for a long time, saying something, the handheld cameras will hold faces forever, showing endless reactions longer than they need. We do not know anything about such characters when the story begins and they are given little new information when the story progresses, only in silence and static images of lovers who do not speak who communicate through silent dances, but who have no obvious emotional intimacy. Very sleepy film.
