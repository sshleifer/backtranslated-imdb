I read the comments before I watched this movie, and I didn't believe them. I love crap movies and I thought it was average. It wasn't. This film makes the appearance of Camp Blood 1 and 2 great. The film has a bad performance, a bad sound, a bad confusion, a bad makeup, and it missed me so much that I turned it off. even nudity was garbage! Did they even have a budget for this movie? I don't think they did it. You can tell if you like this movie or not in the first 5 minutes. if u want to go for a good cheesy movie, see toxic avenger 4 or even camp blood. Avoid this in the trash - I watched it on TV and felt hung so don't spend anything on it. The best part is probably the end.
