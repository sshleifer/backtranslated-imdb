Wow, which is a great prerequisite for the film: place it on a filmmaker whose writer is a block who decides to do tango. Hey and the better idea put the filmmaker, who is interested in the tango, in the center. I wish I had this genius. Yeah, I'm sarcastic. <br /> <br /> It amazes me that these zero potential money for making movies has been made. Come on if you are not a rabbi tango fan (I agree they exist according to comments) or a dead member of the Sally Potter fan club (?) There's nothing in this movie that would make you hurry to see it. Even if you are a big part of the tango in the movie, it is meaningless scenes, such as a house renovation or a wheelchair man traveling along the road. <br /> <br /> Soon REVIEW LESSON, where a scammer from Scotland sits in front of the computer, writing very sarcastic, but very fun comments about the movies he saw. Grasp the shock when Theo Robertson puts up the latest Hollywood blockades, crying for compassion if he receives another filmmaker's rejection letter, lusts when he takes a bath, and rubs the soap on his well-toned body. REVIEW LESSON coming soon when someone is stupid enough to finance a movie <br /> <br /> PS Sally Potter is not involved with Harry Potter
