This movie is terrible. All of this has been done in the past. There is nothing original. I can't stand when writers don't come out of their parcels. <br /> <br /> Girl wants her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult. Hmm, it sounds like a movie from the 80s called Big. Even more annoying is the action of Jennifer Garner. He doesn't act as he is 13, he just acts as he is stupid. <br /> <br /> Since then, you can guess the whole plot. He gets a good job and it just happens that his 13-year-old friend works with him. Wow, how awesome! But, no .... his friend is bad and turns to him trying to get his job done. But of course he will eventually win if he gets a "big" idea. <br /> <br /> There's also a dance scene in a movie I've seen thousands of times before. <Br>> <br /> I hate this movie.
