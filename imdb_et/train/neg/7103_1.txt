This is the best way to describe this film, which focuses on a newly married couple moving in a house that is the haunted man's first woman who died in mysterious circumstances. It sounds good and good, but what's playing is pure boredom. In fact, one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of the movie that allows anyone who dies of fear to have a free coffin. Well trust me, nobody ever took these offerings if nobody is afraid of plastic skulls, peacocks, strange gardeners and doors that are knocking. And the music is the worst, it consists of constant tube music that sounds like a sixth grader. And you realize that the terrible secret is so obvious that you really have to think about what the people in this movie are thinking. Someone dies when they head their head and the police have never been investigated. Finally, it is a slow pace (which is very bad, given that the film is just over an hour), a boring little story that the average person easily understands. Apparently, none of the characters in this flick was an average person.
