If the author gives himself 2 credits before the title and about 15 credits before the start of the film and the first picture shows the author who rolls the shorts of a lycra bike, it is not surprising to note that the author is a body that should never be seen in spandex. Such a look that can be useful for a homosexual reluctant therapist. <br /> <br /> Others have given it what it deserves. For me, the most difficult moment was when the trip from LA was marked with an airplane that lets LAX see; and the return was celebrated by a Fedex cargo plane.
