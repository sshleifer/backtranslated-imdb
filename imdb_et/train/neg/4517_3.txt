Here's a lot to appreciate: remarkable places and flying sequences; costumes, props and kits; and competent written and acting. But to enjoy drama, we need at least one principal who has some qualities that we might like or admire. In this heap of butterfly snobes, we found only one character that is pleasant at all? an unhappy person who is a helpless victim of a brief peripheral role. From the reviews carried out, it is clear that we have taken a whole step, but we did not find the behavior of these malicious schoolgirls amusing or amusing. Even a dog is frustrating. We threw the towel out of two of the six episodes, so you should deduct those observations, but what I wrote about this mini-series didn't give us any reason to expect a change or redemption of character.
