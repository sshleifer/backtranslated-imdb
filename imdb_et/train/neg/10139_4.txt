You have to hand it over to Steven Seagal: regardless of his other mistakes, he may have a good taste for women. If you choose a Seagal movie, it is likely that there are one or more very beautiful women. And usually they don't just work as eye candies; they participate in action and fight, shoot weapons, kill with knives and so on. "Fury's Flight" offers Ciera Payton's duo (who has a very sexy face, lush lips to match Angelina Jolie's) and Katie Jones, and she'll find time to get involved in both a cat cut and a small lesbian! And if I think I spend too much time talking about it, it's because the rest of the movie, although it's satisfactory, is so unforgettable that it's hard to find much else to talk about. Ironically, the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself, who looks like he can't even worry about trying to take care of it. It is a military-type maker, it has very little fighting, and it does not fit its role (stealth fighter, "the best in the world", very well), which can explain his almost offensive sleepwalking.
