LOOKING ON THE LOVE (is it a double packer with a letter?) It's like combining white noise or the sounds of water produced to help you sleep - put it in a DVD slot because there are nothing else on the shelves of the store and you're on a hectic day. And it works for it: being a British romantic comedy, it's a little more. Sam (Jimi Mistry), who has been detained for his busy law. His partner, Archie (Dougray Scott), is against both Sam and Alice, but has a long-lasting attraction for Alice going beyond friendship. Alice loves her sister Felicity (Kate Miles), a free love defender who encourages Alice to have things. On Valentine's Day, Alice sends her sister a drink, Samar writes an "Anonymous" card to see if Sam responds by testing her fidelity. At the same time, Archie sends Alice a red-haired package to which she has not written loving love. Both are ex post facto regrettable. Sam actually spends his lover Katja (Branka Katic) and deceives Alice. Alice organizes Sam's tasks via e-mail and phone calls and plans to meet Sam in covert as "Anonymous" to test her fidelity. The whole characters are captured in foolish charades, and the ending proves that true love must be based on truth - and how it results in different couples is a fluffy script (sorting). British comedies work because of the high quality of written quality and performance. Perhaps Director John Hay had chosen British actress Alice instead of pasting a fake accent to Jennifer Love Hewitt, the result of which could have improved. In the end, this story of Peter Bloore bounces slightly between humorous and pathetic messages. One terrible confusion is a musical result that is consistently so strong that it encompasses all dialogue and is intrusive. London has some nice scenes and a few moments of satisfying humor, but in the end this little movie is really the best used background music / white noise. Grady Harp
