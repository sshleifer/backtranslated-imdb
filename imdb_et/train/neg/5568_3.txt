Dolph Lundgren stands for a former policeman / boxer who is looking for a Boston kinky scene to find out who killed his brother who was well thought in the community. blame. Dolph Lundgren is very good in this film, in fact, on the basis of his performance, Lundgren's fame in the role of activities is forgotten. This means that the material gives Lundgren something that cannot really be done, in fact, Lundgren's dry thriller, which is both predictable and incomprehensible. Co-star Danielle Brett is also good, in fact, the film works best when it focuses on Lundgren and Brett chemistry, indeed there was a time for the film to study their relationship so that the film would have been fairly decent. But the film is weak, it does not exist, the plot is not sufficiently researched (Too much boring in the case of B.S. Lundgren's investigation of his brother's employer) and the film is unnecessarily harsh and ridiculous. What's more, Lundgren is actually very good (as is the newcomer Danielle Brett), but the film just lumbers from one sequence to another, making this movie particularly disappointing. But if anything else, it shows how undervalued Lundgren is an actor. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 4- (bad)
