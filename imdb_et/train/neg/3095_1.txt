Wow, I finally managed to finish watching this goddamn movie after a series of attempts to find out that Rick Sloane and his production team have finished the direct video this year. <br /> <br /> Of all the films reviewed by MST3K - and they really dig from the bottom of the barrel, the bad "Manose", the "werewolf", "the incredibly weird", and the lesser the catastrophes like "Laserblast", " Zombie Nightmare, '' and 'Time Chasers' - it must be the absolute largest amount of garbage they ever showed (which makes it ideal for reeling). Very simple, the movie is about a bunch of munchies-like gremlins loose, using people's desires for fame, happiness, ability and of course sex in a way that eventually kills people. But this is a movie in which the actors are so ridiculous (for example, two men fighting the garden tool in the front yard illustrate the mechanism test), writing is so forced (like the often described gremlin scene on one girl's hand who would notice it if only she turned your head quarters left ... and this is not the first time the film happens to be) and the story is so ... rarely attention (hence the MST3K reef about the "law of the future where movies need to be done by FILMmakers) that you actually root hairy dolls kill everything on the screen.
