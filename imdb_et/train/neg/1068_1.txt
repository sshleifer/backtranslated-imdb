My wife and I finished this movie and I got into IMDb to work with appraisers who found the film less than satisfactory. Only 10 negative reviews are negative. I feel this movie is a great concept that is terribly frightened and I want to warn those who want to look into the future of the film. <br /> <br /> I testify that I am more inspired to write than I don't like the movie when I do it, so my handful of reviews are all negative. But this does not mean that I am inclined to not enjoy the movie, but I often find more beautiful movies that I enjoy. <br /> <br /> Paris je t'aime is the most terrible movie seen for years. Using the "intelligent" concept and adding some great talents to some short stories for some WAYs, the film will reach all the worlds. It's an art for art, but something that a 2-year-old can dream and achieve. Managing the director's free 5-minute screen is a testimony to sharing work even in entertainment. Directors can't write, writers can't look for it. (I would also like to throw Clint Eastwood overrated, but it's because he's an actor multiplier who rarely works,}}. <br /> <br /> What's on the screen is a messy mess short stories that have no meaning, have not been completed in 5 minutes and spoil me in Paris. Why call it Paris je t'aime when more headlines are in cluster f * ck? There are only a few stories that can be tracked, especially the work of Alfonso Cuar√≥n but everything else is in the shade. Coen's brothers are short, but can you name your own movie that doesn't contain a scene selection with a guitar? Just like all the directors decide to do what they want to do, and chose it in Paris. , involved in the company, we are blinded by the fact that this film is SUCKS.In fact, I think they put the names of the directors on every short pants, because the directors saw how poor the film is and decided to make sure they were accused only in those 5 minutes. Difficult. <br /> <br /> People, Natalie Portman, are not a good actor. She is not a thin dream girl who is waiting for you. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, why?!? Are you the people who are acting or just reviving the performances of other films? I look at you at Natalie Portman (Garden State, closer), Elijah Wood (Sin City) and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full of Grace). <br /> <br /> One last comment about the action: I give double joke to Nolte that they are acting and looking more human than you are aged or maybe once again. Find your short youtube if its 5 minutes is quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Writing short stories is very difficult, and only a few authors have just received it. I mean Ernst Hemingway, Raymond Carver, F. Scott Fitzgerald and John Cheever to name a few. It is much harder than writing a full novel and only truly talented can achieve it. The same can be said for short films. It seems that only one director lives in history magazines. <br /> <br /> If you support Paris as a pearl that you discover and mirror with your story, don't wait to enjoy this movie at all. Directors didn't care or were lazy. In both scenarios, this means reading it as being rented. Thank you for not paying $ 10 for the head restraint.
