I was interested in the title and description of Big Rig at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. But I was eager to get out of the seats as soon as Big Rig ended. Big Rig is made up of a number of large rig drivers who intend to deliver goods that travel across the United States. Characters are all wonderful people, but filmmakers never dug deep into their complexity as people. Instead, the story sounds as much as the cards on the film are meant to guide, but never. Most mistaken. We - the audience - reach somewhere and, like the story of storytelling, we reach somewhere, but without direction, location or plot. Why are we here? Where are we? How did we get here? Storytelling is sloppy and the directors' intention to "humanize" the group of people they consider "ignorant" and "invisible" is so unconscious and irritating. The problem here is that drivers look instead of truck drivers. Directors bring their naive assumptions about trucks and then just approve them. All in all, there is no tension, the film is too long (it should have been a 15-minute drawing), the big question "So, what" has never been answered and the whole film is one of the propaganda to be reviewed that would "enlighten" (as the directors claim ) about the great riggers of the outside world.
