It is hard to say what was the worst thing about this show: bad performance of different parts, bad acoustics, bad CGI, inappropriate kits for the period, bad script. It would have been nice if the script followed a somewhat closer original story - Beowulf has enough tension and good material to provide a lot of good material and a better story when the scriptwriters could come out. <Br And why bring in a strange new weapon like a crosshair that burns explosive bolts? <br /> <br /> I see that this movie is only made "21 days". This indicates a lack of quality. I think this is the general (bad) attitude that the Sci-Fi channel (and others) have towards classical stories about making movies in recent years. <br /> <br /> What kind of waste!
