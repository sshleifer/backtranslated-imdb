Cynthia Rothrock, (China O'Brien), "Manhattan Chase", 2000, made this movie enjoyable, and of course this cute petite gal burned the screen with her artistic abilities and hot sexy body. China O'Brien irritates the police officer and decides to end it and go back to his hometown and return to his roots and father, a local sheriff. His father is aging and the city has changed, the gangsters have taken over the city and started to turn local women into gimmicks, and people in the city got sick and tired of their city from hell. Well, you almost guess what's going on, and you are right, China's O'Brien fights back after a great tragedy in his life. Bad acting through the picture, but Cynthia Rothrock brings this movie to a great conclusion.
