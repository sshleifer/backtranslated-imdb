"It could mean the end of the white race!" draws the public over ten local zombies who drive during the "great war" on European battlefields. The expedition sets out a long-lost, retreating city of Kennif-Angor to stop such a thing and keep the battlefields for decent honest whites, to kill one another tens of thousands. /> It's a little hard to say if people are zombies or not in this movie if the actor is so woody. Even in the 1936 standards, acting in this film is bad. Last decade. It looks like it came out of the schoolbook "How to Act" <br /> <br /> ------------- Chapter Three: Emotions ------- ------ <br /> <br /> "How to express fear and reluctance (Female) Turn both fists into place. Place one hand in the fist of the heart. Hold the image for longer than 10 seconds as it is comfortable, then turn the head 90 degrees away from the stuffed object and fist. "<br /> <br />" How tough, heavily emotionally charged scene with ex-fianc√© explain your love for someone else. DO NOT make eye contact. Don't move .. Don't show any emotions. <br /> <br /> In order to get rid of the driver's action, he suddenly cuts long breaks, where nothing happens except that the film runs through the projectors. Thus, a 35-minute value is a story for 60 minutes. <br /> <br /> The Zombie Rebellion, when it comes, is so slow! The exiled zombie-ministers turn the army into their former captain for the liberated spiritual slavery, slowly defeating the hill, and then sort of worshiping the door a bit and breaking the window. "Yes ... let's ... oh, I dunnno yes. Let's get grrr. Frankenstein must be destroyed - manana." (although I have just found some hidden emblems. Jagger has been hit by the native as an ironic counterpoint to all the natives taken off by the Germans at the beginning of the shooting. Look, even the fallen natives do not want the end of the White Race!) Retroactive sex (it may call it) is fun and worth it alone. Roy D'Arcy has a long time to go home, but he's completely wasted, like Colonel Mazovia. <br /> <br /> There is one interesting moment in this movie. A nice little assembly of zombized natives and white cast members falling under the eyes of evil. face after face, perpendicular to fade each other. This works, although in the middle of every loved one there is a strange little flap as the frame is cut. I think they have to be Neg Cutters shots between the fads. <br /> <br /> Best of all I looked at friends and stupid mood.
