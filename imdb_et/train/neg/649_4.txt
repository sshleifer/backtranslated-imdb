OK this movie was made for one reason and just one reason to make money! The producers probably didn't care about killing the classic horror film. I knew this film would suck as soon as it would be pg-13, how many pg-13 slashers movies have turned out to be good? It's like asking how many women have had a month? The answer is NO! Prom night 1980 was not a masterpiece, but it definitely deserves a film that remains credible to its genre and tries to be more. <br /> <br /> My Prom night 2008 problem is that it works with the killer and I have 3 big problems with him .................... <br /> <br /> 1) How he escapes, he was locked up at the spiritual institute and he escaped through the air-conditioning system! WHAT ARE THE DEVIL? why would they have air conditioning in the patients' room? Do they want him to be comfortable during his stay? 2) His intentions are somewhat uncertain that the killer wants all the major families and friends of the victims to die so that he can get all his self, he says he loves him, but the next minute he tries to kill him so he wants to kill him him, love him or just rape him? 3) The killer is too good how did he develop all his skills? He used to be a teacher, so in this one scene where he kills the main boyfriend of the victims, while he's basically on his sleep and he doesn't notice, it's all stupid 2 stars in 10 horrible, stupid, stupid attempts
