Clusterophobic Camera Angles That Don't Help Movie: Too long a face is just the shots where most of the time you feel the bottom side of the movie is missing (that the screen is cut off) because there seem to be important steps you won't see them. There is too much confusion in the film anyway, so these perspectives make it worse and do not contribute to the artistic vision. <br /> <br /> I like artificially made movies and unusual camera work. I can handle a deep and slow movie. But it tries too hard to be something artificial and can't seem to me painfully. <br /> <br /> Something that can't be added to any character, because they aren't working well enough. More than just a few minutes of face images are required to work with characters, at least for this script + director + actors. <br /> <br /> I don't know if any not so good actor is due to the script in front of the manager or participants. <br /> <br /> I will stay away from the movies Le Le has definitely written and directed in the future. <br /> <br /> What a tedious movie even for a person interested in history and someone who spent time in Shanghai.
