I rented this movie because it sounded quite interesting, but for my fear this film was the worst film I've ever seen! I read the Gumby-8 commentary and must be part of the cast or team. If Gumby-8 is not a 4-year-old child or a demented cult member, nobody believes in the right sense that this film is at all potential. <br /> <br /> I couldn't believe Gumby-8 comments. <br /> <br /> Citing: "" Dune "inspired by opening animation to fast pace ... this movie keeps the eye moving and works so well that repeated viewing isn't unexpected." <br /> <br /> Animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact that the film keeps moving, well, because you're looking for some type of relationship. I mean to break Halloween down with a $ 100,000 budget, and a painted mask, and by the way, became a cult classic. As far as "repeated viewing is not unexpected", I think he made a mistake. <br /> <br /> Another quote from Gumby-8, the only fan: "Action is also a strong aspect of the movie." <Br /> <br /> With respect to the actors, their performance is nothing more than the talent of Robert Napton. <br /> <br /> Exciting Tagline: "Watch out for the brightness and darkness in an hour" <br /> <br /> Because there is no darkness or darkness in this movie. <br /> <br /> MPAA Rating "Estimated R for Some Violence / Gore" <br /> <br /> The only gore you see is some red colors on a page over a dead body that you never see. As far as I know, it can be a lawn burst. <br /> <br /> All in all, I've seen the horror strikes of the 50s, 60s and 70s. I've seen what I thought was the worst and some that were very good. The director of this film did not make any attempt, slept, or strike an acid. Whatever the case, I think the actors deserve applause for trying to save a very bad job. I'd give this film an evaluation of the "B" movie.
