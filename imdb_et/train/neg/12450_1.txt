A ten-minute story pulled out a two-hour better. If anything that was important in some way wasn't halfway. But I never hoped I stayed. And guilt for wasting time. Action was OK, but the story is so transparent and weak. The script is about as flat as it can get, but the ten minutes of the plot's omission will leave little room for good dialogues.
