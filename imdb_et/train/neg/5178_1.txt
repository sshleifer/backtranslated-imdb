I feel it is my duty as a lover of horror films to warm other people over this terrible and very bad "horror film". Don't waste your time or money on this movie, the actor is bad, the story is just one of the worst I've ever met, and the script was just terrible. Something about that was not good, you finally think of yourself, why I look at this mess. The plot had so many holes in it and they never got out of the way, it was just so bad, I don't know how to make the movie so terribly. As I said before I love horror films and I was so dead, it was 18 years old, but you see little blood and are not afraid or jump at all. What was irritating to me was when the film had stupid things that had no idea on the plot, like the brother and sister kissing, why? is all I can say. Just do not worry, there are many bigger horror films, just don't waste your time, life is too short.
