As a wonderful admirer of Marlene Dietrich, I had to (finally) look at this very, very dumb picture. This is Miss Dietrich's first color film and the world's most beautiful blonde is redhead! Bad start. The story is a tremendous hole that involves a hard-hitting topic: religious guilt. (Who needs it?) Suffice it to say that all of Dietrich's films (and I've seen the most, including "Pittsburgh") are the only ones where even his performance is hardly worth it. Color Photography is OK (this is a very early version of Technicolor) but in no way. Ridiculous pain: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (enough said?). The only thing that is interesting at all is John Carradine's extreme caricature, "The Sand Diviner," who predicts what's going on. The alleged "happy ending" is one of the most frustrating ever. Another example of David O. Selznick's highly inflated reputation (did he ever make a really good movie? - besides?) And with one final resentment, the MGM DVD soundtrack is a mess that is seemingly randomized in volume. Very Unwanted.
