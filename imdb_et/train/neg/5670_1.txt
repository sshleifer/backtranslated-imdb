The only reason Norliss Tapes deserves ANE stars is Angie Dickinson's presence cast. Except for seeing Angie Baby before "Police Wife", there's nothing worth it here. <br /> <br /> SYNOPSIS: <br /> <br /> MINOR SPOILERS ** * <br /> <br /> David Norliss is asked to write a book about supernatural. One day he disappears mysteriously after calling the publisher, assuming that he has stumbled upon something that has put him in mortal danger. The whole series for which this unfortunate pilot was written was apparently meant to be a "setback" through "Norliss Tapes" - a set of recordings recorded by the writer in the investigation of supernatural cases. <br /> <br /> A rich sculptor dies in a pilot episode, but not before buying an old Egyptian scarab from a local occultist who assures him that the butterfly will give him death after death. We will soon discover that the ring itself does not provide immortality. Instead, the sculpture will restart the body only, allowing it to escape from its crypt so that it can circulate all its blood from real girls. <br /> <br /> Blue Face, Yellow Eyes, and Fragile ARRRHHHHHHH Heard that you last watched "Scooby Doo" cartoons, a sculptor attacking his wife (Dickinson) in a dark night. He escapes and, through mutual acquaintance, contacts Norliss to get help for his later husband's unpleasant recurrence in his heritage. <br /> <br /> So this man is a vampire? This story is not a vampire, regardless of what you have read or heard. The sculptor does not drink the blood of his victims - he collects it. How? Do not know. We see him only attacking, never collecting. Why? To fulfill the second part of your immortality offer. It turns out that the transformed sculptor is allowed to live forever when he builds a living demon called Sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood. When it is finished, Sargoth intends to live in shape using it as its gate in our world. <br /> <br /> FINAL ANALYSIS: <br /> <br /> Norliss tapes were not accepted as a good reason for the series ... it was a garbage. As you can see from your summary, this story is a bad and poorly understood confusion. Action and dialogue do not offer better. It is not even a "so bad good" award winner. Sometimes bad is only bad. <br /> <br /> After years of underground attacks on the great advantages of "Norliss Tapes", I was very happy to find it on the 10/15/03 Fox movie channel. I wish I didn't let myself fall. <br /> <br /> After reviewing it for the first time two days ago, I can only afford the other applause you have heard from other IMDB reviewers. come from those who look at the exhibition on the basis of dark memories and nostalgia for young people. Or maybe they are just loyal fans of Dan Curtis. In both cases, they have provided you with misleading comments about "Norliss Tapes." <br /> <br /> Pauly Orchid - October 17, 2003
