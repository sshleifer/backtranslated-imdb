Is good. It's bad. And then their Sentinel, the lower barrel political "thriller", is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The mystery of the mystery of the secret service is good, but never has such a film with such a great potential that is so fully polished. It seems to every actor of this film that Clark Johnson's "edginess" led by the "tooth-hand" works on the autopilot. Even big Michael Douglas looks bored here. I can honestly say that I've never seen another movie with so many prominent plot holes throughout my life. The turn is a predictable grid, and the character's motives are so ridiculous that they inspired laughing from the audience. Avoid it at all costs. This is a catastrophic film disaster.
