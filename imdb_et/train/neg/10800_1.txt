What was the idea of ​​this movie? What was the plot? I do not know. Shaq can't act, people don't know how to run, and I'm Kaza! Genie, who rape? Come on. Maybe there is Eminem or Linkin Park in such a movie. I remember looking at it just for killing time. It didn't interest me. I just remember thinking, "Who put Shaq in this movie?" The whole story seemed stupid. It didn't make any sense. I think the unrealized morality of this movie is that there is something in the ghetto and something can happen. I can't comment much more because this movie is so terrible that nothing is worth it. I want this movie to go away.
