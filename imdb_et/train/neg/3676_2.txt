Susan Swift is an appealing adolescent, a flowered child who has been implanted in the 1980s (like the young Susan Dey), but has no real vocal choice for demanding dramatic leadership and tends to whine; Yet, he is quite sweet and has bright eyes and a beautiful smile. "The Coming" (as was briefly mentioned in theaters), Swift may be the reincarnation of Salem's witch. Flick has a very low budget and borrowed so many other pictures that I gave up in about 15 minutes. It starts strongly and has some camp complaints. Obviously, there are more serious films dealing with Salem's witch processes that deserve to be seen; but when spamming goes, it's not too terrible. Boston locations are a solid plus and supportive cast is fun tooth. * 1/2 from ****
