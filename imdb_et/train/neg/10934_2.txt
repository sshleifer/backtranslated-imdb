First, let me say that I am a LDS or rather I am a Mormon. So when I watched this movie, I automatically questioned him. I usually find every movie I watch, something redeemed. And that was no exception. It has its redemption moments. But they are little and far away. <br /> <br /> One of the first things I noticed was very disturbing that it seemed like Halestorm was shaming our church! LDS churches are called "congregations" and the basketball court is in the "cultural hall". Never mention either of these two names. The church is never called a name, and "standards" are so far as it mentions what our church believes. <br /> <br /> This makes me wonder if directors are really LDS or LDS wannabes? This film had so much potential! It could have really shown our church in a positive light and helped the public not only see what we have to offer, but also what we believe. Instead, it was just a little bit of fun and much wanted. If I weren't yet an LDS, I wondered if the Mormons were stupid, idiotic, and shame their convictions. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie I recommend to my non-public friends. <br /> <br /> Sorry Halestorm. You can do it better!
