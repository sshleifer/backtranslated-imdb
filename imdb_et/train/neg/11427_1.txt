I do not know who is the director of this film, Sue Kramer, but I have a strong suspicion that A) is her lesbian and B), but she somehow disgraced all the participants in this project to prove they are not homophobic. br /> <br /> I can imagine everyone thinking, "My God, it's terrible. Not funny. Pedestrian. Completely flat." But keeping their mouth closed because they fear they are labeled with anti-gay or they don't get gay lifestyle. (This is probably why Kramer did NOT start homosexuals for homosexuals.) Anyway, it's not worth it yet. Participants are all geared up to play every scene completely, so something they do is not sincere or credible. It's full of clich√©s and there's nothing in this movie that is at least a little fun - much less funny. <br /> <br /> I hated it and I'm not afraid to say it. Too bad that the dwarfs who gave Kramer money to make this bomb were not as impartial as they thought.
