If you are not already familiar with the letters in this movie, save yourself time and stop reading this review after the end of the next sentence. <br /> <br /> INVITE YOU TO KNOW HOW THE FILM AND THE COFFEE ARE NEEDED. <br /> <br /> But if you ask for reading, consider: <br /> <br /> A flat vehicle for Japanese teen idols who have a pointless, complicated "plot" that will take time until you are ready to yell. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie makes sense. It is an endless number of people who express different emotions, joy, happiness to tragedy, NOT GOOD REASON. We will probably see something incredibly "dramatic", but we just don't give the reason why the background is not. <br /> <br /> By the time this movie is over, you're sick and tired of the face of these stupid, harsh, girly stars. You are revolutionized by spending all this time looking at them with a smile, a smile, a cry, a mystery, a "serious" and some other pointless expression that they face. <br /> <br /> Never go so far as to point to the barrel of any "participant" "soul", to prove to you outside what the trailer and countless comments on this site tell you: <br /> <br /> Only converted, meaningless minions like this movie, most of these teenage girls who have pathological adoration of something androgynous. Freud would have a field day. <br /> <br /> If you are not one of those frantic "fans", leave hell away from this abomination.
