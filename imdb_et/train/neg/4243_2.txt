The funniest scene in this movie is probably when our rescuers get their medals and slabs and nothing. So the basic idea is that the police crosses these gangsters as one million, but they are powerless because the villains are just a little bigger. I think the police ammo just strikes. They decided to make this movie in a documentary style with fake interviews and all that was wrong with these men? They talk like they were armed with newspapers. Okay, I admit it's probably still dangerous to be at the fire, even if the situation is so much in front of you, but don't go nuts. And why did hell do everything for solving anyway in 44 minutes? I would say that this is a very long time when you are surrounded by them and you are allowed to shoot. They're like ten feet, they didn't hit anything. Then they go and buy bigger weapons to increase their heroism. And then yes, there is one, one cops are caught. The bullet is likely to have led the bullet post or something. I thought I had a good laugh.
