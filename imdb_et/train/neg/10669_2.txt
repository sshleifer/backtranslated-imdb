The ensemble of interested and unlikely characters spins and turns its way through a thin plot that may be interesting if you could take care of yourself. The "twisting and twisting" I am talking about does not mean the story (which includes the entire recipe of tuna pots), but the director's inability to keep the characters in the frame even in the middle. On the other hand, Angie Harmon has very nice nostrils and left ears. <br /> <br /> The only real surprise in the movie is the big names they convinced. If you think that this movie has never been released in theaters, even though it is all cast with an asterisk, you may be inclined to think that something stinks. <br /> <br /> And indeed, it is.
