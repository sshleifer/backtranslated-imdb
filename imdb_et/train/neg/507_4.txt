Unlike my colleagues, I always try to find something redeeming in any movie I see. Yes, the quality of duplication and illumination is uncertain, acting on wood, and the opening order misleads what all these ridiculous lesbian vampires are misleading with Blood Dripping. The word "Bloodsucker" in Italian is to be lost; almost as if the producers had originally filmed the story of Gothic Vampire and then changed their thoughts, but could not afford to give up their dramatic opening sequence, so it would in any case shut the film. <br /> <br /> This movie was released in 1975 on a recently released DVD and comes with its own theater trailer, which in some respects is bolder than the movie! Now everyone who buys this movie probably already read his synopsis and knows what to expect - Italian softporn in the mid-1970s. I bought it because I am interested in Christa Nelli (most often credited as "Krista Nell"). Due to the lack of characters, I find many of these Eurosleaze films in the 60s and 70s. had hoped that Imdb would show a lot of movie characters, but without hearing the list, it is very difficult to associate them with the actor. I think Krista Nell played "Corat", but with its massive hair, costume and make-up it's hard to distinguish her for sure. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors in these parts have depicted a two-dimensional image and no one really looks. Maybe something has been lost in the duplication process. What were the positive points? music was atmospheric and, of course, when you're in beautiful lesbian soft porn. Used external locations were good and I would like to know where they filmed their movie on their island. North or Republic?) In 1902, so that all the sporting period pieces costumes.Some scenes that I found inadvertently funny, especially those sex scenes! Anyway enjoyable romp.I rated it 4/10.
