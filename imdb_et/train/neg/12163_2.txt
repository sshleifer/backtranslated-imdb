An absolutely inclined film does not have the quality to redeem. It has camp advisor Angela (Pamela Anderson ... as a murderer, she smiles, if she doesn't waste people, not even amusing). We ran with boring clich√©s, such as a throat for a child looking for a glove with his Freddy nails, a boy who gets a chainsaw, a girl who has been drilled, who pulls a stroke, who is roasted, etc. <br /> <br /> He has no original idea to offer and it's just a waste of time. That's where you don't want to see Valerie Hartmen (who plays slut Ally) tits. Most of the violence occurs outside the screen so it doesn't even respond.
