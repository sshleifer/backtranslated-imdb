What a terrible movie! The idea of ​​fighting robots is cool, but the story is ridiculous, the real ridiculous human activity, the non-existent, and the special effects (to which this type of film must depend) are archaic. I thought it was supposed to be done in the '80 -84 round and was surprised that it was since 1990. It's 5 Years After Aliens! OK, many people said it was good considering a small budget, but I just mean "what is that?" it seems incredible. I wouldn't want to see a reorganization with modern special effects and a completely rewritten story because I still like the idea that huge robots beat each other out.
