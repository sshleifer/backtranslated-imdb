I just note this as a "spoiler" just because some of my comments about the content of the show are not, but the content itself. <br /> <br /> When you read the comments, it is obvious that these Republicans somehow tolerate this example, but despise it, while Democrats seem to rejoice in their so-called truth. One reader, even (it seems), actually shows that he believes these events were happening or might have happened when Bush was in a classroom. <br /> <br /> But the content that I see is trying to be neutral, the fact that the series that made this series must actually be Bush's hatred. In the previous episode I saw last time, s02e03 showed that the program had to be prepared for a long time before McCain was nominated at the forefront; because all the other former front runners are all highlighted. <br /> <br /> Another thing that drew my attention was using additional cabinets. I thought this series must have been made in Europe not necessarily in the US, because I know that the US is not home with no built-in lockers and probably in artists' homes. <br /> <br /> If I see this example, I'll stick to it, I'm surprised to see what the writer's desperate desire to do to stigmatize our president. Of course, there are problems because most Americans agree, but this is not a reason to be so angry in the public displays we see all over the world. Perhaps this trend and the network have now set, so if Obama or Hillary entered, would they continue and produce the same "humor" for them? <br /> <br /> One more commentator comment. If, according to this journalist, there was a change in the 2000 elections, he was so confident that he would be a completely different acceptable president. Wow, wishing to think about him. As for the 911 event, I believe it started back when Clinton was president, and I don't see how President Gore would be if anything else was different.
