It's so bad, it's funny. The only way to explain this in this way is to have a porn party with drugs, which resulted in a decision to make the movie fun. I mean: you see porn to actors topless in sex, then kill human mutants. There's a lot of gore, including classic "something wrong with him, oh no, it's half of the person he used to be," and a panic-induced casual murder. But you can also find funny things, such as the intestines that are pulled through someone's ass, and the boy who runs in the woods, finding himself decapitated with a wire between two trees (which makes the metal later, like drawings). Somehow there is a market for people who go beyond porn, they really need to know what's inside the actor, just genitals are not enough. Therefore, you can see that the killed bimbos have many summary copies. There is no dialogue. Jenna and Chasey really have small parts and I really don't know what Richard Grieco wanted to do here. I think this is a movie that needs to be viewed with a back and forth button and just look at the juicy things, just to remind you of the old school C-class horror films.
