I found the temple to be a glacier and the original story blew out of the contents. My wife loved most of it and I didn't try to wake her because I felt she wasn't missing anything. <br /> <br /> When Holmes and Watson enter the house and then potentially caught, it is unclear how they can enter all the entry and intrusion tools so quickly. It is also unclear how the door is locked into the study, preventing staff from entering. <br /> <br /> What was puzzled by me was at the end when it was bright in the eyes of a broken statue. I have no idea what that should represent.
