You can say, "Don Johnson as Elvis? Could it work? Is it possible? It seems to me a terrible choice, but maybe I should have an open mind. Maybe I'm surprised." <br /> < br /> NO! <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is not a bad actress. But he's terrible Elvis. He's too short, too weak, too sharply highlighted ... well, you have already imagined how bad it would be. Add to this a hokey black wig and a heavy eyelid and mascara, and it's a greasy embarrassing mess. The best thing I can say is that because Johnson's behavior is decent and because his incarnation is so far away, after some time he no longer thinks Elvis. You see her as some other mad pop star. Then you can view the movie at this level. <br /> <br /> Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideal as a tall, queen of beauty, Linda Thompson. But he is attractive in his own interest and plays a part in his honesty, elegance and intelligence that we have been waiting for all of our roles. There may be too many intelligence in his work. You need to have a wire rope to stay in the rope. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new about this story; we've heard it many times before. If you are looking for new information or a review, you will not find it. It is said to be a story of love - unique: Linda to Elvis and Elvis to drugs.
