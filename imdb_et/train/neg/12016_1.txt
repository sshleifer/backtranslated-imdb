If Bob Ludlum saw this mini-series, he would have called. It was a complete waste of time and money. I've read the book and although the movies aren't exactly what the book can be, CBS wastes time and money on it, and it's embarrassing to say it was Ludlum's work. <br /> <br /> It may be the creator to look at Bourne's identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good this TV series was. <br /> <br /> Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign this low drop? <br /> <br /> Dreadful!
