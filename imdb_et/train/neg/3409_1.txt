The rumor is that when NASA's technical advisors on this film were asked to keep the picture credible, they laughed for hours. After all, if you are not a politician or a work / team, you will not get a shuttle. In addition, Space (Cadet) is a camp in Alabama, not Florida. The truth is that everyone on Earth can win multi-billion dollar lottery prizes before the events depicted in this movie become possible. This film was meant for children and was supposed to be written by one because they are not aware of the unacceptable restrictions and requirements of using the KSC / CCAFS. <br /> <br /> This is the most useless movie and it was a well-earned flop.
