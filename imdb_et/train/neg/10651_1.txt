Want to know what the secret is when you have filmed in the gym? Just put a movie with a nice lady in super tight training equipment and let them break and grind the floor as they are in the gentleman's club. That's what the terrible filmmakers did, and this little trick keeps me watching until the bitter end. This is the worst film I've ever seen, but every time I was ready to change the channel, they'd add one more scene to the girls and stay here. The classic movie, Killer Workout, fails in every category I mean. As an example for beautiful girls who work out, this is a success. A strong recommendation to avoid, unless the idea that half of the movie is a large R&D, shows you.
