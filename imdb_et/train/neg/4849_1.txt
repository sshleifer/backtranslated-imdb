I just rented it today .... I heard a lot of good comments in advance. WOW! What a number of vaporizing poo this movie is! Does anyone know the director's address so I can get my five dollars back? Finally, someone "Stop Loss" "hit the worst Iraqi warfare", which was the first number. To be fair, I don't think there are any good Iraqi films, but it was really bad. <br /> <br /> I can't get into technical inaccuracies, there are a hundred comments from other GWOT veterinarians who describe them all. If the director even struggled to consult the lowest E-level on technical accuracy, they would have made the film somewhat realistic. I think the writer should be given a "credit" for wasting this movie. He obviously showed the plot of this film of some living imagination that was not affected by the constraints of reality. Does anyone, but I don't know what the film was? Was there a message? Seriously though ..... WTF ???? <br /> <br /> I am quite surprised by all the positive reviews. This movie is hard to look at as a vets of all the outstanding inaccuracies of the vet, but even if one could forget that the plot sucks, the characters are low (or less) and the actor is at best bad. It's ironic, I think this movie should be about explosive disposal because it's the biggest bomb I saw this year.
