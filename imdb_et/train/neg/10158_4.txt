I could hardly think of the masks behind: the rise of leslie vernon (a tremendously amazing film) when viewed as it is realistic and a great innovative idea. it could have been a big movie. acting ... some actors. from others ... it's awful. <br /> <br /> The idea is great and the format is great. this story is also pretty good, although it often suffers from a big blow to a logical mind. <br /> <br /> Is this right? that's a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I really want to see this remade ... I really want it to be a fantastic movie he wants to be. <br /> <br /> But (And you can't really blame this movie), it's obviously built on the shoe string budget. and fx generally harmed the movie. <br /> <br /> Great movie. ... if you should exchange some better action and a little better fx. <br /> <br /> Whoever wrote it should continue, a great idea.
