"Vampire Bat" is definitely interesting because it is one of the early genre games of the 1930s, but in isolation everything is a little too funny for true praise. <br /> <br /> The film is in some of the 19th century, with vampirism of suspicious locals attributed to a series of murders. James Whale's 'Frankenstein' feeling is very similar, and is accompanied by an introduction by Lionel Atwill's Dr. Niemann's character, which contains his erroneous ideas for promoting science. <br /> <br /> The Vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red herring when you suspect a fall in a bat-loving village, Herman (Dwight Frye), thus apologizing for the torch on your mobile to go rampage - as if they were needed. <br /> <br /> This is one of the early horror movies trio, where Lional Atwill and Fay Wray celebrated (including "Doctor X" and "Wax Museum of Mystery of Wax"), and like other collaborative projects, the film suffers badly from comic relief and tendency to scare the mainstream thriller elements. But in the context, Vampire Bat is still weak and derivative. <br /> <br /> Everything we leave is a Frankenstein imitation of poor quality, where vampire elements are purely a device for Drakula fans. But for the title, it would even be necessary to judge the film, and it is worth noting that director Frank Strayer made "Blondie" a few years later.
