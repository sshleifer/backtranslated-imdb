There have been so many films on the same subject. one cute girl needs a beautiful boy to impress, pays him and then (guess what?) he falls in love with him, there is a bit of noise, followed by a line before everyone makes a happy ending ...... it's done many times. <br /> <br /> The thing is that I knew it before I started watching. Nevertheless, I was still waiting for it. With the right hand, good pain and a bright script, it can be a pleasant way to go a few hours. <br /> <br /> It's none of them. <br /> <br /> This was the head of a woman who didn't have the magic or the mind who couldn't even shine the slightest spark in me. I really don't care if she "got her husband" or left alone and unhappy. <br /> <br /> A man who, after some endless words, wanted to kill. Just to remove this secret look. I had no idea that directing a male whore's life was the way to comprehensive all-encompassing enlightenment. <br /> <br /> A totally unrealistic movie full of unrealistic characters. none of them saw jobs, they all had more money than the mind, the groom who continues with his wedding after learning that his bride was sleeping with his best friend .... plus "I miss you even if we had ever met" !!!!! i could go but i just realized that i'm wasting even more time with this dross ..... i could bead around imposing character just being very cheap laugh name "woody" but in fact it was only remotely humorous thing that happened in the movie.
