Like all cult TV shows, there are a group of people who love Twilight Zone so much that they value virtually every episode as they are the biggest EVER shows. Although many of them are really great classics, the truth about every big episode, there were several mediocre and at least one that hesitated. But like hard trekkies, these zone lovers require that everything is gold. In fact, this is what originally got me a few cultures instead of reviewing individual episodes of films I usually watch. <br /> <br /> Although this is never the worst episode ever made, it is not very bad, it is bad with some reasonable standards. The widow monitors the long procession of the soldiers of the civil war that goes past her home. Finally, there is a very unexpected twist and there is no excitement or tension here.
