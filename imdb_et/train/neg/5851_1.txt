I doubt Jigsaw was pure at the same time, the whole LSD theme marryed with a murder mystery, which was an obvious obvious attempt to seize the young audience of the era without really demonstrating any understanding of the counter-culture of the sixties. Jigsaw suffers from many problems, including burned actors, foolish and harsh dialogues, LSD setbacks that continue to persist even after the point has come home in the first 60 seconds, although no real intercourse has been created, although the actual plot is an excellent tool on paper to to do, and the end that is so subtle and predictable (not to mention a lot of bad TV shows) that climax is actually the climax. If it were a better film, we can stop the belief in some of the things that it would enjoy, but the weaknesses are so prominent that they only show that viewers can otherwise forget. I saw Jigsaw on television and it is definitely a late night television ticket that was meant to fill the airspace and lose someone's insomnia, not something anyone should be actively looking for. Best of all, three out of ten.
