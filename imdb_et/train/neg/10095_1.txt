Someone gave this movie 2 stars. There is a very high probability that they will have immediate professional help, because anyone who does not spend 30 seconds to see if you can't give the stars is a very frightening word. <br /> <br /> This movie is ... well ... I think it's pretty much an experiment in horrible porn movies with no porn and no real terrible bits (apart from show, plot, story, set, dialogue) and sound). I wrongly assumed it was zombies. <br /> <br /> Tracking it is fairly frightening; you are frightened that someone will come over and you will never be able to describe what it is and they will go away thinking that you are a freak looking at home-made amateur torture videos or something on this line. <br /> <br /> I am so amazed that I write this review on my mobile, so I don't forget to try to downgrade from the current 1.6 to save others from the same terrible fate I just suffered. <br /> <br /> I am the worst film I've ever seen and I can say (with my heart) that it will never be added.
