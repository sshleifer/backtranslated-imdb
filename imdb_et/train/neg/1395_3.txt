You know that you are in trouble when the movie you are watching has a number of substitutes. In general, this means that they were trying to hide turkey in different markets. This turkey is a brain machine with seven different headlines. <br /> <br /> This about a secret government project that requires you to use your computer to read people, but it drives people to kill one another or yourself or something like that. It's full of B-level TV actors sitting in a panel room with lawn aspirations that try to act as a script that doesn't make much sense. <br /> <br /> This is an untastey turkey. Avoid it.
