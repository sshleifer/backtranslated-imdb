The family was fucking <br /> <br /> This movie is a decent film but may be better <br /> <br /> The problem is that there are many old-fashioned clichÃ©s and many scenes are too filmed and long > <br /> The character of Ajay Devgan is shown very well, but his character becomes heroic, which can be subtle. <br /> <br /> Long setbacks could be avoided because the ears are just long. <br /> <br /> Even the street scene on the other side looks too simple and hardly the message is well outlined <br /> <br /> The direction of RKS is decent even though it could be better Music is fine <br / > <br /> Ajay Devgan looks very well and is often playing his part, though from time to time he sees the light scene badly, he is dramatic. Vidya stands out on the front of the media Pankaj doesn't have the right defined role and he's too cinematic to point out to Darshan Jariwala's gifts, like the rest of the old man is okay
