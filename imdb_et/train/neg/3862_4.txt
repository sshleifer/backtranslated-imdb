I just looked at it. The couple laughs, but nothing writes home. Jason Lee looked like he was having fun. The (long) DVD gag reel is almost exclusively made up of someone who has an uncontrollable laugh. Selma Blair seemed to be driving the clock, but again she had to be mud, so "well done" I think? Jim Brolin was surprisingly funny. (Babs marrying can't be a picnic.) The soundtrack was hip and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played Julia Stiles' father (fun), 10 things I hate are funny here too. He's great, but the best aspect of this movie was pouring Julia Stiles. I can spend two hours watching my lingerie and I feel like I just did.
