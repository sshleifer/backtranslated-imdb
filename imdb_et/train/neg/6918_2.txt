I went to this movie, believing it had a good rating. Firstly, it is ridiculous that they initially release a film made in India in 2001, seven years later. Everything in the movie looks dated. Even in 2001, the film looks like it's made from the shoe strings budget. There's a scene where a taxi hits a man to find out how small a budget gets. Anthony Hopkins doesn't seem to know what she's doing in the movie. He ends with a long monologue. When the film had a bright sparkle during this scene, I missed it when I sat. Something about Jennifer Love Hewitt doesn't like Devil. She wears a badly-fitting trick with random children. As for Alec Baldwin, you should not ignore the scene where he first meets Webster. What a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins rightly said, "Go back home and write better!"
