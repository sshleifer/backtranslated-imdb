Okay movie, fine lady, but terrible leading man. Stephan Jenkins, who plays the man, is really a bad actor. Joyce Hyser, however, is the arm of the movie. He's the best actor in the cluster. <br /> <br /> NOTE * The man's first comment that praised the film (and according to his IMDB.com account, he's only a written ONE review and think what movie?) is probably a plant. Although the film is well captured, it is by no means fine or large, or any other hypobolic description used by the assessor. <br /> <br /> "Art of Revenge" is a fair movie, but it's a big tease. It offers any sexual situation, but never goes through it. Similarly, see Skin Flick on Cinemax, but editing all "naughty bits". <br /> <br /> The movie as a whole is a bit vague and ends and the third part is really a big mess. Of course there is a twist, because it is necessary for each film to have a twist. <br /> <br /> From 4 out of 10. <br /> <br />
