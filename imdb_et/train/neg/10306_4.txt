After viewing the ten episodes, I decided to abandon this exhibition because it represents unrealistic mathematical modeling. When Charlie predicts the future behavior of people using mathematical models, I thought my profession was fun. I am not a mathematician but a chemical engineer, but I work with many mathematical models. So I try to explain to an ignorant why what is shown is near the "belief" of fairy tales. <br /> <br /> First, choosing the right model to predict the situation is a demanding task. Charlie Eppes is shown as a genius, but even she should spend a lot of time exploring a suitable model, especially to guess what someone is doing or where she will be in the near future. Individuals are insecure and casual, without modeling. Isaac Asimov wrote about it even in the 1950s. Even if there was a model for a particular individual, it would be likely (stoichiological), which means he has a good chance of making the wrong prediction. <br /> <br /> Secondly, assuming someone or a situation is found, model parameters must be known. These parameters are constants of equations, such as gravitational acceleration (9.8 m / s2) and are often not easy to determine. Again, Charlie Eppes should be somewhere far from the genius to find out the right parameters for the selected model. And after selecting the model and the parameters, they have to be tested. Strangely enough, they are not and by miracle they are perfectly suited to the predictable situation. <br /> <br /> Third, a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected not only by numbers but also by sci films: the computational effort needed to solve these models. Try to solve Excel with a complex model with many equations and variables. Even if Charlie Eppes has the right software for solving his models, he may have hardware that is terribly slow. And even with the right software / hardware combination, the model solution can take some time to be achieved. He solves them right now! I could use my computer in my research, I would be very happy. <br /> <br /> Like drama, it's not the best show. The characters are somewhat stereotypical, but not even far away when Big Bang Theory is. Crimes are boring and the way Charlie Eppes solves them makes the FBI quite incompetent. <br /> <br /> Exhibition with some layman may work. For others, how things are handled is difficult to swallow!
