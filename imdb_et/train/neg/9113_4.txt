They had such a potential for this film and they are falling off completely. In the first cruel intentions we have left to think what motivated the leaders to become the way they are and act as they do. There is almost no character in this prequel. It's a really sad story, but this movie didn't make me anything. It would be like writing a good letter instead of unsuccessful words. And the end doesn't make any sense and doesn't explain anything. Writing was just terrible. Another thing that bothered me was that they used the 3 EXACT SAME line in the lease that was in the original. For example, "down boy" or kissing, and some others that I can not remember. I wasn't impressed by Robin's action, but Amy did a great job. This is the only thing that agreed on this movie.
