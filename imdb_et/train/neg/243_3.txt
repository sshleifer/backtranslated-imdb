William Russ is the main character of this film. He left his family only to recover his debts. But he's trying to keep his family away. Thats where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes in, playing many different roles to persuade him to come home. <br /> <br /> The story is medium and they managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use him for a pretty nice degree. But William Russ was not really a star. However, it seems that his actions are still in order. <br /> <br /> I found the delivery and the story very fun when everything was predictable. In fact, in the last 20 minutes, I took a word before it happened. A good movie should never be like that. <br /> <br /> Generally it was a sub-par movie. In the mail classification system, he gets "D".
