I can only assume that other reviewers of this film are shareholders of the production company because it was probably the worst film I've seen in the last five years. It was clear from Rabbi's uncontrolled laughing that the participants in this film would kill them to be considered "B-level". Both my husband and I were in a great mood before the movie started and we were really waiting for funny popcorn material. We knew we weren't renting Citizen Kane, and we didn't expect to see the most amazing movie. But after the 40-minute duration, the most painfully forgotten garbage I've ever seen, we closed it instead of wasting the second minute of our lives. <br /> <br /> If "comedy" doesn't laugh, terrible behavior, thin plot and annoying signs are your thing, then this movie is for you. Frankly speaking, Troll 2 is better - at least I laughed at the popcorn sex scene. <br /> <br /> I can't justify writing a longer review of this picture because I've been wasting almost one hour to find one joke.
