OK, as everyone has noted, this movie is a complete dog. To some extent, this is because it was a gory sexploitation film that had a lot of material cut (or darkened almost invisible) to escape the censor's X rating; but the film also has many other errors. <br /> <br /> First of all, it seems that the scriptwriter has a mix of werewolves and vampires. The bad ones in this movie are furry and do not like silver, but in any other way they behave like vampires. Now you just can't do it when a dirty genre flick, you have to stick to the rules of the genre or fans can get all confused and annoyed by stopping the disbelief of the wrong thing. In fact, the whole (confusing and poorly presented) plot has already been made for vampires, but there is no point in the werewolf movie. has ever seen. Anyone in the werewolf movie business should know that werewolves costumes and transformations are something that fans will critically evaluate, but some of these werewolves are just normal. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of good bits. I really liked the score. Others have mentioned Sybil Danning's tits. And ... <br /> <br /> (*** SPOILER ***, if such a thing can exist) <br /> <br /> I also liked the plan to attack werewolves. There are so many horror films based on foolishly acting characters, but in this case they acquire a very sensible and effective anti-werewolf arsenal and kill monsters. I mean, you can kill the werewolves with silver balls and we have quite powerful firearms these days. It shouldn't be too hard to put together two and two, hmm? But in a typical style, this movie goes over the top and adds some other very interesting and fun lycanthrope weapon.
