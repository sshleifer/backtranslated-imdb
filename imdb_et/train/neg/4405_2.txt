I can say that before watching the movie, I had no clue as to who Annemarie Schwarzenbach was or what was her biography .. and I have to admit that the film was not able to get that data. couldn't convince me to do some research by writing some words on the Google website; But all I can say is that actress Jeanette Hain was very good in her mutating facial expression, she really played well and expressed a deep mental state of depression because it is real. <br /> <br /> After all, this script movie is based on both Turkey and Tehran and Afghanistan. But believe me that I am familiar with this area, it was all in the Arabian desert in Morocco. and culture is a completely different language than Arabic. <br /> <br /> I think it is imperative to have a thorough study of all these smaller elements to make a documentary like a movie.
