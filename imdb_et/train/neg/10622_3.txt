I really have a fondness for Christopher Lee, but it just wasn't for his other performances ... and he was one of the best actors. <br /> <br /> Film does not live on its own. It's not that scary, it's too melodramatic, and it shrinks. Every time I thought, "Oh, here's a good part", a good part is never quite achieved. <br /> <br /> Evil is convincing at all. Most of the other symbols were also lacking deeply. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, if I had been right, I could have had some MSTiefication at the expense of this movie, but ... Naaahhh ... It looks like it's not worth the effort. It wasn't really very good, it wasn't really bad, it was just mediocre.
