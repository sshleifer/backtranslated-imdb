I honestly believe that anyone considering filmmaking is subject to this mysterious failure. As in the 1960s and 1970s, Edward Woodi Jr. "Movies", this movie is a beautiful example of why true filmmakers spend so much energy on rewriting scripts, re-editing their movies and changing their special effects until they finally look right. This film is also a good argument for the studio's pre-screening process. If Mr. Hines was forced to withstand the honest reactions of an unbiased audience, he could have reduced 75% or walking / running / creaking scenes and edited the film at 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Film students should watch this movie as an example of how dangerous their "good" idea is. Every presentation, every line of dialogue, every digital effect, every filter effect, indeed every video frame is a threat to mere mediocrity. A start-up filmmaker may from time to time be tempted to think of "At least I reached SOMETHING" or "It's just an end in itself". This film helps them understand how badly the film can appear. <br /> <br /> Critics can also benefit from seeing this movie before they replicate the last movie ever made for entertainment in the summer. <br /> <br /> Beginning writers can learn from this movie about the importance of rewriting and perhaps understanding the need for rewriting. Beginners can also learn the importance of a good scenario and some respect for how difficult it is to write a script that causes the audience to be emotionally forced. Writers and directors who watch weekly cable films and think "I can do better than what I can" see the idea of ​​this film as to how difficult it is to even create mediocre results. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that this film can be an educational tool for the emerging filmmaker. Especially those who enter this current post-Lucas and Spielberg environment. There is a reason why filmmakers are capable of having special effects. The World War clearly shows that not everyone can pull it off. Some can't even close it.
