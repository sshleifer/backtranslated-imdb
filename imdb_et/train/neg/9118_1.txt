It is literally the worst film I've ever watched in my life. This may be the worst possible film. Some movies are so bad that they are good; this film is so bad that it passes from an enjoyable camp and becomes simply awful. It is an anti-enantiodrome. We bought this with the intent to hedge, and all my family gathered for smart comments for a fun evening; Instead, we were sitting in a stunned silence, grudging the poor Peter Sellers. <br /> <br /> It's worse than the animated Lord of the Ring. This is worse than the Matrix sequels. It's worse than Krull. It's worse than any Batman movie. <br /> <br /> Don't in any way let this movie approach 10 feet away from the TV.
