So I'm looking for a DVD to rent and this movie is called "The End Game". He celebrates James Woods and Gooding JR of Cuba and has a summary of the trained political thriller. Then it's worth a look. Or so I thought. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The final game has almost the most ridiculous plot I've ever suffered. Now that I am something strange, I can't really tear it in, because I wouldn't want to destroy it for those who haven't experienced it yet. But questions like "Why did he / they did this?" And "Where on earth would resources be available to remove it?" after the inadvertent fun conclusion of the film, they are too rich. <br /> <br /> As for the actor, you know those movies where you can almost feel the actor has realized that they are forced to sign up. the movie and then it shows their performance? This is one of them. It comes with a ridiculous script and a serious faulty, irritating direction and you have a cinema poison recipe. <br /> <br /> Of course, this cinema did not work and for the same reason you should not allow it in your living room; it is terrible.
