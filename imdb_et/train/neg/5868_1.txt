Absolutely one of the worst films ever. <br /> <br /> Low product values, terrible storyline, bad script, weak performance ... and I can't even come up with an adjective that is descriptive enough about how poor Joan's control is. I know that hell has a special place for people who have funded this film; <br /> <br /> This movie is a train attack. <br /> <br /> (terrible) x (infinity) = rabbit test. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> It's so bad, it's not funny how bad it is.
