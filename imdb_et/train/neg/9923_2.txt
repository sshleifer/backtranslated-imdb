Since I am writing this review in 2008, we have been rebuilt. Film studios seem to have decided to destroy as many classic films as they get thoroughly meaningless innovations, including 'King Kong' The Wicker Man 'and virtually any movie ever played by Michael Cain. This lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon, but proves "Do-Do Dough". A completely useless color version of Bob Clampett's surreal masterpiece "Porky in Wackyland", "Dough for Do-Do" sucks the original through life, spraying the entire Clampett on the original film material and adding Fame Freleng-controlled flat new material. Freleng was a totally inappropriate director to manipulate Clampett's source material, although in fact no director could count on Clampett's inspired madness. Inevitably, "Do-Do-Do-Do-Dough" is nothing more than a new terrible title for classic rape. Like the fans of the cartoon, this is equivalent to "Casablanca" painting.
