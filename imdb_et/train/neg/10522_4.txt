This film is a pretty original idea - I've never seen the nymphs that were thrown out of the sky anyway before in the horror film. But how he fills that idea is not the least original; we follow bunchy kids who, for some reason, decide to go to the woods. The fact that these nymphs live in the forest makes it more interesting than just another forest filled with red / nuts / zombies, etc .; But really, monsters are just a variation in the common horror of forest music. Many of these films do not have one good idea - and it seems that it has carried the brain cells in this way. The only real asset that monsters bring to the table is that they are the beautiful women the characters love, rather than being the dirty grotesque they want to escape. It's up to the point good; but soon the dull and almost complete absence of a central monster will ensure that the film never goes out of the "horror trash" category. <br /> <br /> It has been for years Evil Dead made the forests the main hotspot and despite such films as the Blair witch project; it still makes a great horror. This is one of the main assets of the film because the forest gives an unknown impression - the only problem is that the forest forest never looks like its sleeve. The sequences of deaths clearly show a lack of imagination and the fact that all the characters are extreme does not help because you are more likely to expect them to be killed rather than the hope that they will get away. Children are mostly cast, but Tom Savin has a role to play; who, unfortunately, is not entertained by the special effects department. The only real highlight of the film is the nymphs themselves. Naked expensive women tend to look great, and if it weren't for them, this movie would be very boring very quickly. There is nothing that would recommend this movie; but if you want a little horror film that retracts in the style of the eighteenth century, you can find some enjoyment here.
