Django Ballad is a prone mess of the movie! This western spaghetti is just a set of scenes from other (and much better) films, allegedly associated with "Django", saying how it brought different laws. Hunt Powers (John Cameron) doesn't give anything to Django's role. Leave it out unless you just need to make every Django movie and even this may not be a good excuse to see it!
