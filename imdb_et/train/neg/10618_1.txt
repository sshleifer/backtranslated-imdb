The film is seriously terrible and humiliating for the victims of violence. On the surface, it can be a cruel movie about rape, but if you dive under the surface, what lies about the rape is not so positive. The victim of Aishwarya's rape has proven to be a helpless victim who cannot cope all because she is a WOMAN. She needs her to help her. If society makes him jibe and throws him comments, he does not stand for himself. Everything is left to Anil Kapoor to talk to everyone while Aishwarya is all crying. <br /> <br /> Director (Satish Kaushik) went the wrong way, depicting the victim of violence as weak and submissive. What would have been more effective would be a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a bold way. The director is famous for the chauvinist. His films are usually full of weak women, but he tries to hide them in hidden roles. He must learn that precisely because the role is controversial, it does not mean that the character is strong. <br /> <br /> The film's most humiliating scene is when Aishwarya “cleans” after rape. He does it to his father who thinks he's dirty now. While it is commendable that Shah shows stigmatization against the victims of rape, what he does not show us is if Ashi's father had done wrong to have his daughter do such a thing. So we have a rape message about rape. <br /> <br /> This comedy is not necessary in such a strong film. What's more, comedy isn't just funny. Ash is in his role as wood, Anil Kapoor does nothing but scream. The music is mediocre, except in the title that is beautifully captured (the only bright point in this movie). The role of Sonali Bendre is disappointing and pointless. In general, what could have been a great movie to remember is this terrible mish-mash that gives some viewers a serious digestive disorder.
