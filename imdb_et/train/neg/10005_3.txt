Another attempt by New York intellectuals to make a "Swedish" movie in less than ten years - the first is Susan Sontag's "brother Carl" (made in Sweden with Swedish actors, no less!) Results? Oscar Wilde said it best, referring to Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop": "There should be a stone heart to not laugh out loud about Little Nell's death." Here is quite the same thing. The "interiors" are filled with holy, solemnly equestrian animals. ("I'm afraid of my anger." Looking at the average distance: "I don't like what I get.") Bergman quotes (polite to use the term) are close to the parody. An incredibly engaged family reminds us of how brilliant and talented they are, to exhaustion. ("I read your poetry the other day. It was - I don't know - New Yorker." "Oh. That was an old poem. I worked around it.") Those people don't care much, but I found them quite fun. Much of the dialogue is just like the funny stuff of Allen's earlier films - he's only directing his actors straight. She hasn't cast herself in the film because she has a bad Mary Beth Hurt who copies all her dances, intonations, and neurotic habits, making her an embarrassing substitute (like Kenneth Branagh's Celebrity). <br /> <br /> The main plot - a dysfunctional family with a quietly dominant mother - seems to have been more or less raised in Bergman's "winter light," the main family melodrama cheating much existentially. All this is done through visual visual / phonetic tricks: scratching paper with pencil, harsh surfs, dwarfs walking on the beach. etc etc. <br /> <br /> Allen's later "serious" movies are less embarrassing, but also much less entertaining. I'm taking "interiors". Woody rarely did a funny movie.
