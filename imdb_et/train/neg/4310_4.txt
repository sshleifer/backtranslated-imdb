This movie is a very sexy star of the Olympic Games hired as a coach for a high school boys' basketball team. Like Goldie Hawn's WILDCATS, this is the title of Cathy Lee Crosby, and she does as the script allows. I think Racquel Welch would have been a better choice but, given the film's obvious TV movie budget, they probably couldn't afford it. Cathy Lee looks good in every picture, but we never see her naked. The story is quite predictable, saying no surprises. Young and happy Michael Biehn has a leading role. She is a team star and also Cathy Lee's love interest. Keenan Wynn has a couple of fun scenes, like a rich old man who runs an athletic program and doesn't believe a woman should do sports. This point rises throughout the movie and it goes without saying that it is dated. Ironically, Cathy Lee doesn't put her team through unusual training; he does nothing that a male trainer does. There's a funny sub-block that includes a high and not-so-bright player who goes through hypnosis to go through his classes and play as a pro basketball player at Sydney Wicks. It seems everyone had a good time to make this movie, but the only real reason to see it is Cathy Lee Crosby. She is not such a big actor, but she has a dazzling smile, beautiful hair and a very dark body.
