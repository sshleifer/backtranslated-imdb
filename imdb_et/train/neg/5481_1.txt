<br /> <br /> Alien visitors do not see exactly like a hairy embarrassed human woman, and not just strangers who can speak English well (with an Australian accent). They are all given! <br /> <br /> All alien life knows how it means, how bad, evil, wasteful and destructive to us. And they are quite ready to tell us how bad it is. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the chance to see this movie, don't do it. Well, if you do not suffer from insomnia or the choices are this film or exploratory surgery without anesthesia. <br /> <br /> This movie is trying to get a moral, ecological point, but you can shake it and pray that it will end soon.
