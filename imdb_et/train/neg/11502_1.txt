This film is painfully slow and has no plot. It will convey the lives of the redundant boat workers. One of the parents is a sincere attempt to get a job. There may be some social comments here, but it is confusing because nobody is painted very sympathetically on the white. I looked at the whole annoying thing and built expectations for a huge redemption payout. No luck. The IMDb rating has always been so good for my taste. Everything over 6.5 was worth watching. <br /> <br /> And my wife says Javier Barem doesn't even look good in this movie. He's not my type, so my agreement doesn't mean much. <br /> <br /> Sigh. I'll give her 1.
