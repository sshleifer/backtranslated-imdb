I enjoyed A Man Called Horse thoroughly when it appeared in 1970, but Return played like a typical sequel. All this - budget, script, plot, casting and action - was lower than the original. Gale Sondergaard, as Elk Woman, the elder of a yellow-handed tribe, sees nothing of the Indian, nor does it do any of the other "Indians" played by Italians, Mexicans and Latin with cheap wigs. And the old man who played the chief acted as a fat rather than an acute leader of the soldiers. She even used a bow like a woman! Finally, it seems that Richard Harris, who made such a great job in the original, looks around this time. I guess he couldn't resist the slight salary he got from his horse's role. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are some interesting moments in the movie, such as a horse that passes through a painful ritual "to find your vision and rally Yellow hands against these Indian enemies and white oppressors, but as a whole, return is uneven, boring bright and predictable - like most after-results.
