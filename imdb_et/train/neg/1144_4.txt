Recap: Doctor Markov has developed a new theory on how to produce energy, knowledge that can unbalance the world. He keeps his knowledge coded and secret and desperately wants it from the Soviet Union. KGB desperately wants new technology. So, they set the scheme to move. In a rescue attempt to release Markov, the KGB steps, Markov takes a secret place and attracts him to reveal his secret by saying that they are in Sweden and work for the UN. KGB Markov's foreign daughter is kidnapped as a backup. The CIA is now sending its best representatives (Sweden?) To the Ninjas team to block the KGB and rescue Markov and his daughter. <br /> <br /> Comments: A cult film that, despite being not very good. The film is quite ambitious, but in many areas it is incomplete. First of all, it is very dark, apparently to hide places and bad effects that some scenes are difficult to understand. You don't see what's going on. The other thing it touches is martial arts, despite being a ninja movie. Of course, some are of rather poor quality, but mostly ninjas are firing automatic weapons or explosions. Automatic pistols are also a problem because they seem to have an endless supply of ammunition. And ninjas seem immune to bullets, while Soviet guards die like flies. <br /> <br /> What is it? Especially the idea and ambition. Some actually and especially for Swedish film, decent activities, though not martial arts. Some nice slow motion scenes and pretty much blood and gore. And some very interesting new weapon technologies that put victims in the heart or explode the brain. Mostly all the parts you are looking for in a B movie. <br /> <br /> Since this is definitely a B movie, there's no mistake there. But if you expect it and watch it as a B movie, it's fun. But do not forget that this is not just a B movie set in the eighties. Some girls, for example, like ... promise to say "interesting" clothes, have deadly doses of eye shadow and makeup. <br /> <br /> First of all, look at the status and ambitions of the cult. Enjoy it and forget about it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
