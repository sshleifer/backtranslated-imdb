Or "Marlowe At Sea". Another ridiculously overrated old movie with Bogey. Quite conversational. Bogey basically plays the same character as Marlow's movies; always check the situation, never nervous - no matter how dangerous the situation is, women call "thin" and "dames" and other such jamaica, the only "real man", the alpha-man in the film (the only other alpha man) a man who is the leader of Gestapo - but he's just an alpha-man of fat, and - of course - every attractive young woman who comes on her way can't tolerate her charms and wants her penis within a few hours of their first introduction. Character classes are all here. Bogey should have the same type of claw-re-reform as "Casablanca" and, of course, he often refuses to offer them money or other valuables - but how does it fit with his claw? It is not that he cannot be cynical; The Hawks wanted it in both ways: a character who is both a "lonely cynical" and a well-meaning humanitarian. I don't think ... Bacall does the first routine "cold baby" routine for the first time and there are many overpriced, not too interesting, "sexual enthusiasm" exchanges between him and Bogey; these dialogues sounded to today's standards. "Just hit your lips and whistles ...". Short Load ... She was 19 years old when it was made, but looks much older and is much less attractive than the days of female stars. His bones face, with its sharp qualities, is nowhere near the beauty of Havilland's woman, the brightness of Myrna Loy, not to mention Irene Dunne's pleasure. Bacall was more suitable for playing vampires than femme fatales. (In real life he is very similar to his face: Hollywood bitch.) There is a scene where Bacall breaks down; very inappropriate to his character. There are two or three bad musical numbers - but my fast back and forth button was ready. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading your "biographies" from Bogart, Bacal, Huston and other Hollywood personalities, please contact me by email.
