Similarly, a relative who gives you a bad gift is in the right place in the heart of Soul Survivors, but is traveling badly. Stephen Carpenter's writing / directing efforts lend freely to other, better films, such as the Jacob ladder and Abre Los Ojos (open eyes). For those who haven't seen these movies, I don't give that assumption; it is enough to say that it is almost as well handled as the two higher films. <br /> <br /> Melissa Sagemiller's stars are Cassie, going to college. His current boyfriend Sean (Ben Affleck) and former friend Matt (Wes Bentley), both friends, and Annabel (acerbic Eliza Dushku) are in a car accident after two killers (?) Have gone into transparent masks. He lives over the wreck, but when the college visits, the hospital's trials and dead people appear and destroy, leaving him in complete confusion: who is dead? Who is alive? What is real? <br /> <br /> Soul Survivors is looking bad-there, ready-it, gore-filled, blood-splattered, body-stacking teen exploitation flick. True, part of it is killer-stalking-the-victim scenes (abundant, repetitive, and mind-numbing), but at least it tries to build ideas rather than clich√©s, unfortunately, rather unsuccessfully. This creates confusion more often than cohesion, because the story is confused, dirty and inconsistent near the main points of the mystery (predictable as it is). Credit goes to Carpenter to try to create something that is beyond the horror flick of the derivative of the derivative; Too bad he has created a derived psychological thriller. Sagemiller also deserves praise for showing strength in the central performance, actually developing his character and creating some emotion when Cassie fired. It's nice that filmmakers try something else, but the movie comes in a mixed bag and a failed attempt. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
