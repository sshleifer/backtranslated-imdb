I will keep this program under review in the shortest possible time. Skip it. Low budget, not funny, bad script. Acting not as bad as writing, but still bad. This is all you need to know, but I will continue to do more than you need for writing. <br /> <br /> This is a movie with three segments, each reflecting some other type of movie. OTHER A funny movie with the same exact idea is "Movie Movie" by George C. Scott. Very unclear but worth looking for. World Championships' 30s exhibitions and elegance, precision and dryness. <br /> <br /> This movie was not. It parodies three types of films, supposedly from the late 70s, the beginning of the 80s, but this is the parody of films I've ever (almost) ever heard of. The first is, in my opinion, the "Kramer Vs. Kramer" parody. Peter Reigert does his best dirt with a bad script. Another is a parody, I don't know what ... Danielle Steele's novel? I mean, you see such a story on Lifetime TV, but in the cinema? I mean, I remember the 70s, I was there. It is a soap-opera-type parody of a young woman who is pulling her sleep. These things usually parody themselves, so I don't see how it was even necessary. <br /> <br /> We have a somewhat easier land with the third segment, "Municipalians", which parody cop movies. I note the "New Centurians" and some "Dirty Harry", both of which were almost ten years old when it came to film production. Yes, nice and current. Robby Benson plays an idealistic young rookie (overall contest), while Richard Widmark plays whiskey in the car while drinking a whiskey (OH! Stop! My party! Note that this was the first movie "Animal House" to add " The name of the National Lampoon. Wow. After five years of this classic flick, this earth bag is not just shocking. I could go on for hours in a sad downfall that caused American top humor and most original voices (this would be the National Lampoon, the original magazine for about ten years) to sell and start a long and slow glide in a mess world where now the magazine has long since disappeared and it exists only as a trademark for low budget films. Another reason capitalism (and cocaine) sucks so bad. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is a serious time. Don't waste your 90 minutes. I want your back. On the positive side, Fred Willard is in it!
