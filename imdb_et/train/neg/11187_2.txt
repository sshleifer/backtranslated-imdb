Orders fatal errors - in addition to the asinine piece - is that the character just doesn't resonate or even respond. <br /> <br /> Two examples: The priest who is driving to the graveyard late in the night is suddenly attacked by ghostly spirits. After fighting against them, he will continue to calmly walk when his friend comes out. "Something Wrong?" His friend asks when he has seen the attack. "Just some demonic spirits - something I couldn't." No reaction, no surprise, just as he would have changed the tire. His friend is just as worried ... there must be a standard priesthood training ... ["And then you put a wafer in your mouth. Questions? Ok, moving forward, Demon Spirit attacks ..."] <br /> <br Example 2: At one point the priests need the answer and only the demon (or something that now cares) could offer it. How? Why do you have to ask a dying person! So the demon has a couple of random people hanging over the two priests so they can ask what kind of person he is strangling. "Hey, don't kill him!" or maybe "It's not nice!" their answer would have been more realistic. They never ask them to let a man go or stop because the closest response to them is a slight resentment. They ask their question and go. <br /> <br /> I had to close this point - my brain started to atrophy. <br /> <br /> Avoid <br /> <br /> * / **** (One Star from Four) <br /> <br />
