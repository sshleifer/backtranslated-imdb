I saw this movie at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Based on a novel by the author of the film, Brian Aldissi, this film seeks to tell the story of Tom and Barry Howest, who are united by families that are impressive for their family to form a rock band. /> Almost deliberately a trick, the movie is too half-smart (if you give punishment to grace). By mixing genres, styles, and moods, directors (whose previous film was a great documentary, Lost In La Mancha) are losing fast. I was never sure if I had to take it seriously or not. Returns, dream sequences, it was just a little bit. Plus, promised rock and roll just didn't move me. I was reminded a little too much of Hedwig and Angry Inch, a movie I found original and moving. But in this case the songs were not so good, the main characters were not sympathetic either. A less favorable comparison would be the same disappointing Velvet Goldmine.
