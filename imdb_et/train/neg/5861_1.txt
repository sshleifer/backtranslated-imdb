I saw this movie when it first appeared in 1978 when I was a high school graduate. I took a date to view it. I didn't know anything because the movie was so bad! Joan Rivers' quarry never refueled as it deserved after this terrible and unforgettable mess. In fact, misfortune is not a serious enough term: this movie is ANTI-FUNNY! You walk out of a feeling like all the laughs that might have occurred, beaten you before it happened. It is not worth looking at curiosity or having any idea that it is "so bad, it's good." Not even the MST3K gang would be worth seeing! The fact that Billy Crystall's career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle.
