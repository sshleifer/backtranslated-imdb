After a reasonably successful MASTI, which was better then Inder Kumar returned to comedy PYAARE MOHAN based on Hollywood film. WATCH FROM EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL <br /> The film reminds you of HUM HAI KAMAAL KE (1994) where Kader and Anupam play blind and deaf <br /> <br /> This movie is a tedious workout <br /> <br /> The movie is so funny that you don't feel like laughing like Snehal Dabi's head at the back of the horse and all those comedies we don't laugh at today, but look at the movie with clich√©s and some scenes are unfortunately funny, The moments aren't going to last long, if the story doesn't move in this half even for comedy boring. The turn is well handled and the second half will be a feature film where the blind boy and the deaf will rescue the heroines and we will have all the scenes and fighting scenes of the OTT. <br /> <br /> The direction of Inder Kumar is bad Music is fine, one song stands out I love you angel <br /> <br /> Vivek is in terrible comic, his timing is very bad and is serious in serious scenes. For some reason, he makes comedy and destroys his career. Fardeen Khan is better, but too much wood Among other things, the heroes of Esha and Amrita are Snehal Dabbi
