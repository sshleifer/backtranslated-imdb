I rented this movie purely because the cover has turned to me. But as soon as the film started, I regretted it. It seems that they used this video to take home video camera and let the kids do it. They also used inappropriate haunting faces and shapes to try and scare people, but I found myself laughing, I could have put it together and do a better job. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, I felt that they had really good ideas, but because of the bad guys and in some cases they overshadowed it. It had no direction. <br /> <br /> I didn't want to sit all this because it caused me physical pain to look at it, but I always end up with what I start to take a deep breath and let it go. Certainly 98mins of my life will be wasted. <br /> <br /> I was embarrassed by knowing that you watched Haunted Boat and found something entertaining. I am a fan of low budget horror movies, but it was a big disappointment that I thought nothing could get worse after Terror Toons, but it made me reconsider. Cancel your genre. <br /> <br /> * out ***** (the letter is for the ideas that concern their worst fears)
