I went to the screening of this movie and although I had a few moments to laugh at me, it had very big mistakes. First of all, it is a humorous use of the separation of real life that seeks to find love in LA. What it breaks is a frustrating, narcissistic and ununny romp through the director's love life and work history. The jokes are getting thin thin and you will find yourself suddenly, not caring about how this man progresses from time to time. The ridiculous thing is that the director performs at the same time with an extremely annoying and heavily faulty character, and then waits for us to worry.
