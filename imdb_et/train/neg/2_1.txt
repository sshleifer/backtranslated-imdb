I saw a capsule comment saying "Great Action". In my opinion, these two great actors, who are making terrible performances and with each other with zero chemistry, are an excellent director in the most difficult times ever. Robert De Niro must be the most brilliant and attentive illiteracy of all time. Jane Fonda's performance goes uncomfortably across the map because she obviously has no such character, mostly because the character is so badly written. Molasses would be too fast for the torture of this film. While the purpose of the film is to be a story about improving illiteracy, looking at it is a real "traitor". I'm going to give it to 1 in 10, really one of the worst 20 movies on my budget level I've ever seen.
