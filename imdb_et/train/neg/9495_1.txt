It's a terrible movie, and not one scene has the real emotion of a dream. The characters are unintelligible, obviously drawn, predictable, and the story is an obvious and typical Hollywood desire for fulfillment. <br /> <br /> William Holden (as sad as he saw in this role) was 55 years old when this movie was made, but he plays someone in his early 40s and looks like he's in his 60s. Kay Lenz was 20 years old and wrote that he found it irresistibly attractive. I think the road they found along the way was sexier and had more life than an erotic connection. <br /> <br /> The character of Holden - the same age as Clint Eastwood, when he directed the film, (not) randomly - is put down with the cool pre-hippies of the 60s: a bachelor's cushion, swinging hi-fi, lunches at Yamashiros. But the film is a ridiculously unpleasant, dirty blow of old mist that desperately wants to see the free spirits seen in Sunset and Laurel Canyon find them and their big cars sexy. <br /> <br /> Ugh. Youth culture was never so desperate. And I despised thinking that Bill Holden was so desperate for the youngsters that he took this embarrassing part.
