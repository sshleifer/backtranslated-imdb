Story: A 4-pair-hour film contains enough detail in the Kargil sector near LOC in 1999, when Pakistani infiltrates had crossed the LOC and entered deep into Indian territory and India's revenge. To learn more about the story, I would recommend readers to read the news about Kargil. <br /> <br /> Comment: If there is a formula in this movie, you can be sure it is missing. LOC is a story of pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage, and many balls and blood. The film hall, where I saw this movie, was full of whistles and joy when the film showed India's bravery. The audience of the movie seemed similar to target groups like India vs Pak cricket game. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie's respect for the army and characterize the true war heroes (4 heroes of PVC heroes) who have sacrificed their lives so that we can see that day. The film has provided an excellent army of armies who have won all sorts of harsh weather conditions. The negative of the movie is that it is too stretched and the songs are very boring.
