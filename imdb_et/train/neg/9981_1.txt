This film was presented as comedy and mystery. It both fails. The only secret here is why someone should make such a poorly-built movie. The only comedy is laughter, what I got when I saw how high the readers are here. Could there be two films with the same name? The movie I saw was marked by a girl with pretty blue eyes and a plot that wasn't there. <br /> <br />
