Oh my god, that's a terrible movie. The movie has all the right people, unfortunately, it's not worth watching. I saw it for free in my local library. If I had paid for it, I'd still be upset. This movie is invisible. How could Tarintino participate in such a slow-paced and unmistakable film. No wonder it didn't get much distribution, all involved must be ashamed. I can make a better film dated video camera and my big toe. It's boring, I hated it. Tarintino just lost my eyes. It must be a sick joke. Don't worry about this movie. If anyone even hints you should look at them, kill them.
