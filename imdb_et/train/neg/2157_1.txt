In this respect, Siskel & Ebert showed terribly whether you had accepted them or not because their real conflict had arisen. Roeper took one or two steps to show it because he wasn't really a movie critic and because he was nervous. Now that Ben Lyons arrives, I feel like I'm watching "Teen News" - you know that children's news shows what kids are offering to kids? Manckiewitz is not much better. It is obvious that they have experienced only the constant feeding of ordinary films throughout their lives. The idea that these two amateurs have something interesting or to say about the movies is ridiculous. When they watch a non-formula movie, they are completely lost. Show them something original and intelligent - they just find it confusing. Wait - I think I'll get it ... ABC belongs to Disney ... Disney makes movies for kids. Although Siskel, Ebert and Roper promoted independent films and were only with a big budget studio productions - which is a surprise: these two men love a big studio and can only withstand some of India. Plus everyone knows that age group TV ads are targeted. Dirty nepotism is icing on the cake. In which alternative universes do these guys qualify as film critics?
