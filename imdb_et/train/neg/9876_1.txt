I went unaware of this movie and I was about to feel for half an hour knowing all about it. It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I am a nice person in general, but when someone told me that they liked this movie, I never talk to them again. Everyone who likes it is most likely an extremely dry, extraordinary personality. I also add that they think they are also quite intelligent, just like self-centered fart bags that make sounds for the movie. I know everyone has different types of humor, some people may not even like me, but that's okay; I don't think it covers all the sense of humor. This film is both flat and dull as Wes Anderson's mind. Go inside and get ready for a walk; it's the best money to get back.
