I was waiting for a documentary that focused on the North Carolina tobacco industry. Instead, I looked at a man who proves that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the Duke family. And it went on and on. When Mr McElwee's family ruled over the Dukes, I doubt Mr McElwee would have problems with the death of tobacco-related illnesses. I grew up near the area where Mr McElwee's family started tobacco business; I waited more than McEwee's constant focus on his family. I learned very little about tobacco history in the NC economy and the consequences for the national economy of stricter regulation of tobacco products. Countless references to "Bright Leaves" are away - What if Gary Cooper played with Mr. McElwee's grandfather? Does the viewer get a little understanding of the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy, showing the old movie clips of a fictional film? I didn't.
