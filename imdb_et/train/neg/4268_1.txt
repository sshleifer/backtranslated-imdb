I remember this show when I was a child. I didn't remember too much about it, but some small things from the characters. for some reason I remembered it was really intense. it was really early in the morning in PA. Finally, after watching the web for a long time, I found an episode. the first episode is no longer. Criminey! This show was so terrible. It was obviously just shown to show the kids a laser tag and played a great time. the exhibition opens with bhodi li, who tells his mother "my names, not Christopher, I'm bhodi li-PHOTON WARRIOR !!!!!" then we are forced to look at the children who play the laser label "foot loose". and not just a quick bit, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh my brain hurts to think about it. Oh yes, and as I can't get worse, you can't even see the laser beam of your weapons. its like they just run across the "leg loose" songs. Later, after the bhodi goes into space or wherever, they have Phil Collins songs "su-su-sudio." ah, trust me, you don't want to know the rest. what can i say ...... LIGHTS !!!!!!!!!!!
