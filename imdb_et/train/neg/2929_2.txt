Not Funny - How Can Someone Connect With Monty Python? It's completely ridiculous - no laughs. That's not funny. Up, but ugly, weird, but weird, and it seems to me that these people were always something. Unfortunately, there is something that is not funny. <br /> <br /> This should be given some effort, etc. In fact, it seems to be a laugh - or is it one? Hummm .... Because there is barely a laugh, which is a controversial issue. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'll do it unfairly - maybe it's some exercise. No art - in this case something goes, never. <br /> <br /> But these boys play with high voice, turned to the nose. Come on !!! Not funny. <br /> <br /> There is only one heir to the intellectual thought of Monty Python and that is Stephen Colbert and maybe Jon Stewart.
