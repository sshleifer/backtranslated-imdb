One of those thank-God-I-non-live-there documentaries. It talks about two warring factions in Colombia, the Guerrillas and the paramilitaries, and the peoples around Medellin. <br /> <br /> Guns, drugs and death. Boys who are not over 22 years old, not in the middle of a war, are in jail. Girls ?? not women, girls? always react in the same way as one of them is killed, tears and screams. You scratch your head; what did they really expect? I do not know what is more disturbing: night shootings and civil unrest, or that everyone seems to be passive for things. Or, if you see that this guy is drinking, which is obviously his first beer, all 10? If you took these young men out of your situation and put them in a place where they could do more, be more than many would choose not to stay? <br /> <br /> Based on this documentary, all scared.
