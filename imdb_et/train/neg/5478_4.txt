Nothing better to do I decided to check "Aztec Rex" (as it was in the bill) for this hell it. <br /> <br /> A stupid story may have played better when the dinosaur effect was convincing. They actually saw animations (the rough shapes that the artists later used to complete the CGI effects added more detail, smoother movements, etc.). One redemption factor was the lovely Dichen Lachman like Ayacoatl. He kept my interest; if only the budget has been increased and some convincing dinosaurs could have been used. <br /> <br /> Fraud. At least the majority and the team received a free trip to Hawaii, where the film was filmed.
