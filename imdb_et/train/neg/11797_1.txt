Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time in my life and 2 bucks. If something catastrophic does not happen before death, it is the greatest regret of my life. Who even thought or funded this film deserves a stroke between the legs, because the one where they made the film was thinking. It's about an overweight man who is hopeless romantic, and writes a pretentious drivel that tries to go away as a poem. He connects his love to his friend's coast. Where they meet girls and such. Only a fat boy can't get a girl. The skins don't mind me, I take the par value. However, this film tries to be more than a slip of the skin. It's about a fat boy who is looking for love in some girl, but then meets another bikini with a silicone girl who enjoys her poetry. She thinks that her talent for volleyball, which gets money for her family and impresses women, is just her lady. The dialogue is even terrible for even a C-film. It supports tons of black stereotypes, no character, it's an award winning porn movie, without any porn. Never watch this movie.
