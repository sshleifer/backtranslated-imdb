I saw it randomly in a lazy summer afternoon. He played on the HBO family programming channel. First, what I thought was Disney's animation. But then, after a few minutes, I found a remote control to find the "INFO BUTTON" to find out what was on my TV in the world. I have nothing against Harvey F. I enjoy him in many of his films, but one thing he doesn't have is a speaker. Of course, he has one of Hollywood's most unique voices, but it only works as part of a larger visual package. Attaching your voice to a cute duck that made the viewing somewhat difficult. As for the rest of the cast, it is not necessary. I think working on this film did not bring a really good voice that talent was. <br /> <br /> So, weak voice talent, strong animation ... who was this movie directed? Gay teens ducks? I can't get it. Is there really a shortage of young and future homosexual role models that we need to use animated ducks? Lovely story, and like the title, this movie I found hard to love, just like the ugly duckling.
