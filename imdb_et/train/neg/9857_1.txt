I just stopped watching this movie and found it wasn't funny at all. <br /> <br /> I am an RPG gamer (computer type, no DnD desktops), but I couldn't find any fun. this funny at all. <br /> <br /> Some scenes seemed to be dragging out a lot (tilting and zooming could have been cut for 5 seconds, not over a minute) and it seems like the director was just trying to spend time. <br /> <br /> I think I laughed 2-3 times in the movie. <br /> <br /> By acting on their own, not everything was so bad around the standard a B-class movie should have. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't want to disturb this movie if you are not a big DnD fan, and even then it would probably be best to avoid it.
