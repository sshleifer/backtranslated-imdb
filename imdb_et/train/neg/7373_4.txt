I don't know what you are watching the rest of Steven Seagal's films, but I watch them because they are as stupid as they are, at least always a good laugh. Why would you rate this movie from 1 decade on the basis of duplication, if such a thing is what makes such a film a favorite of the cult, which becomes ridiculous? <br /> <br /> Attack Force is not a great movie, but I felt it was just as worthy of Steven Seagal's vehicle as many of his other films; In fact, I didn't think it was one of his worst shots. It mostly had one and a half coherent lines, which were mostly exciting in principle. The end really miraculous, but even it had nice trick elements. After all, the story itself did not give what it promised, but I thought that acting, characterizing (when I use such a big word) and the rest of the production values ​​gave exactly what the real Steven Seagal fan is waiting for. Especially Seagal himself was a precious stone, a man of no sense, whom we are expecting, and the rest of the majority supported him quite well without ever raising him. This, people, is what Steven Seagal does. Deal with it. Or better: laugh at it. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
