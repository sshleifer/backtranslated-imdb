I went to this movie, thinking it would be a pure football drama (the same as I remember Titans); but I came to feel like I had just participated in Ted Hagger's sermon about Rapture. The only thing missing was the tenth application at the end of the movie. In fact, more television would probably get more out of sermon than this poor excuse for entertainment. At least with the preaching of televisions, the Scriptures are quotations, not quotes from popular self-help paper pulp. The plot was far too predictable that anyone who had long paid enough attention could have put the whole plot out in the first 15 minutes of the movie.
