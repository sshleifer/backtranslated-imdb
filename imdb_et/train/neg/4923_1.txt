It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. There is nothing positive about this film. Some of you really like this movie! I've seen many Dracula movies and I liked everyone I've seen, but when I saw this movie, I said to myself, "What the hell is that?" What a stupid movie. Now they have Dracula, who he is, because he is Judas. For those of you who do not know who is Judas, he betrayed Jesus Christ and then felt so guilty that he hung himself. You are kidding. That's the eternal reason I've ever heard why Dracula was bad. Who asked for some reason? What movie is this movie **. Who ever came to apologize for the excuse of this film, has been beaten. Even Dracula is terrible. If you ever saw this movie, it wouldn't even be Dracula's. Wow, Dracula 2000! Should this title impress? Don't waste your time or money on this trash.
