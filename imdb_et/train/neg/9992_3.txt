Ah Yez, the Sci Fi Channel produces Yeti's second terrible movie. Especially, immediately after the crash scenes, where, when the survivors were in dire straits, did at least half a dozen fires burn? for no apparent reason? different wrecks. The fire seemed to prevail. They searched for the corpses of lighters and races, and eventually found a box that built a fire every day, probably 12, but no one collected wood. When the vegan (hah) bodies burned, what did he use for the accelerator? I mean, these guys were frozen? maybe not. Despite the visible low temperature, all that Yeti was driving was blood. Perhaps this is just me, but even a totally unbelievable story (no survivors ever heard, nor a surprising snowman, until the end) if you take care of the little things the bigger deals are more acceptable. What did the prologue (1972) do with the rest of the film? And the revolver that was warm enough to hold in his hand, froze and didn't come. Give a break. Well, at least we have a Carly Pope, another very cute Canadian girl. And with little irony, Ed Marinaro as a coach. <br /> <br /> Well I can also add a rabbit they ate (even though they look like a chicken) not a rodent, but a rabbit. Now, if it had been a squirrel (or rat), it would have been a rodent, but it still seemed to be a chicken. And the writers left a real chance that someone would notice "It tastes like ..."
