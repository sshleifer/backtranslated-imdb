This movie is now my gauge, comparing all the other movies ... as it was, "was it as stupid as Revolver?" I was also at the Toronto International Film Festival last night, where a room filled with more than 2,000 people went into a terrible silence after being completely dumbstruck buggy for 2 hours. Jason Stratham would have been amazing if he had only a goal. For the first 10 minutes, he has made a Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (Soprano fame) proposal that makes NO SENSE ALL ALL! Then there are some shots and then Ray Liotta's embarrassing bikini briefs, there are some animations, Ray Liotta's naked butt, lots of shooting, teeth grooming, the art house wants to be pretentious and more Liotta's embarrassing body that smiles with every smile. which i'm not quite sure if he was looking for a reaction ... not 5 times. Everyone in this movie thinks they are smarter than the average bear and Guy Ritchie thinks he's Yogi Beater. The story lines could have gone somewhere, but the post was outstanding! The only way this film could have been worse than Madonna herself.
