First of all, anyone who thinks that the "French connection" of William Friedkin is yet another is better, definitely crazy or moral, or both. The problem with reviewing this movie is that a.) This is another brilliant film that always makes tracking objectively difficult, and b.) It is directed by John Frankenhimer, one of the best American directors, so I wanted to. William Friendkin was the perfect person to lead the drug trade in the disintegrating city of New York, because his documentary approach to action and story, Frankenhimer on the other hand, is one of the most stylish directors, ie "Manchurian Candidate" and "Seconds" and his "French Community 2" seem to someone is trying to have a sharp and not a real understanding to pull it out. The fact that Frankenhimer decided to direct the sequel of Gene Hackman himself talks a lot about Hackman's understanding of the original film. It is well known that Hackman hated a set of Friedkin and promised never to work with him, and he noticed that the character was more one-dimensional, losing weight and trying to play him like a straight character. it shows that Hackman, despite being a great actor, had no idea who made the movie and the story. The point of becoming a Doyle drug addict is interesting, but it doesn't guarantee the rest of the movie. An unfortunate low point in Frankenhimmer's filmography.
