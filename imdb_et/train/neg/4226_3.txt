Wow ... I can't believe how bad the ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3) really is. I heard rumors, read the comments, but I had to prepare my thoughts for myself. Well, let me say ya - IT BLOWS !!! The worst performance of any movie, the duplication that has to be done when all involved were completely wasted, inert and ridiculous Gore FX, no noticeable plot, "cinematography", which looks like my grandmother, filmed it with my camcorder, gun cards that is not a joke - made of tin foil - this list goes on and on ... <br /> <br /> Three boys get to the island where a bunch of weird runs around with plastic and tin foil swords. Two prisoners are released with the island freaks rebels, and they are given a start to the day before the rest of the "tribe" hunt it ... it's pretty much ... <br /> Honestly - this is one of THE WORST movies I've got has never failed to myself. The budget was supposed to be about $ 200, and it was spent entirely on Gore FX (which wasn't really a bad idea ...). ZOMBIE DOOM has nothing but ridiculous ridiculous scenes with lots of HORRIBLY dubbed dialogs. This movie makes other budget events like PREMUTOS: LIVING THE DEAD looks like TITANIC. Some may belong to the ZD "so bad, it's good" category - and I think if you are really drunk or high and look at it with some friends in the MST3K style - I think it could be viewed. But not by me. I hated all this. If ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is equally horrible and added as a "bonus" to the release of ZD Shock-O-Rama) shows Andreas Schnauz's other works, he should never be banned from doing a movie with the death penalty. There's a lot of fun kung-fu battles and lots of blood on the last side of the movie - so I'll give it one very generous 3/10 - do it yourself and skip it.
