Maybe the former Moscovite himself and the elastic sense of humor will not let me throw this arthouse / festival crap into the trash. It is not the biggest film of 2005, nor is it a complete waste. It's just a lot of problems. I doubt that this film was forbidden by any "ideological fears" or "conservative taboos" or any other reason that the film could be called "bold" and "uncompromising" on the contrary. It was forbidden because the censors knew that 99% of Russian filmmakers thought it was offensive because of the bad taste that they used to take this otherwise stupid movie while shooting and editing. <br /> <br /> So we have a strong openness to shoot. Wonderful sound, great space - meaning and symbolism. The use and placement of symbols is always the strongest aspect of the film (not that number 4 is a daunting visual challenge). In the next 40 minutes, we will have the same strong setup. An amusing and well-written bar conversation between the three (main) characters and we know the sins of those people, the great Russian state, the human situation and all that. The film then begins to slow down. We are going to think about what -yawn- is ahead. <br /> <br /> The rest is just boring. Of course, the man in the village pulls his hearts and has some fun moments. Nice sound, sure. But enjoying this movie, not to mention the plot, is a serious threat to tempo control. And that, the fact that it is worth the absence of all the (beautifully fired) evil and darkness sessions, is what ultimately makes people angry with "offensive" things (personally, the main offensive scene, limited by the fact that it is loving) can lead to a pathetic harmless drunk ). <br /> <br /> If you would like to watch a nice movie where Russians are wasted over a long period of time (full movie), check out the details of the National Huntsi. Much more profitable post-Soviet things. So yes, from 4 to 4, nice and symbolic for my post-mediocre movie status.
