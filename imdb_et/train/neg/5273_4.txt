*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** When I saw a preview of this movie, I thought it was a very admirable story. But since most of the superstation's original movies were bad for me. This gully family travels through this "abandoned" city to slow down and find this camcorder that shows these people are doing everything they do and discovering that they all disappear, the family goes through all these mysterious steps and can't find or show ever what the hell is pursuing. They are more loopholes than I can hope for and they do not explain what happens, how or what. It ends where the family gets into a car accident and gets a posesti or brainwash or something (which has never been explained). The next thing you know, hoping they will know how it all happened, but it will end, leaving you completely confused.
