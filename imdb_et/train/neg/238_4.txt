Cinderella story for adults living in Dreamland. Romance is very unreal, fluttery, lovey dovey, perfect etc. Cinderella plot until the end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you're looking for dreamy romance with twists, it's definitely a movie, but for the rest of us in the real world, I would recommend saving your three-hour time. Don't forget people! <br /> <br /> Four of the ways that saw the movie with me do not recommend a movie. We had a great time against the majority of unreal scenes. Maybe I'm missing something .. I just can't believe that such a movie can win a classic like HDDCS !!
