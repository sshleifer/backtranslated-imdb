I admire "kiss in the mouth" for this honesty? hair loss and masturbation, especially leader / director Joe Swanberg. They were not afraid to prove their daily "private" appearance. Unfortunately, the film "Brown Bunny" belongs to the field, though a little more understandable jealousy. Yes, it reflects "Bunny", which has a lot of things that don't happen, or too many cinematographic techniques that are focused (or sincerely directed) absolutely nothing? feet, hands or genitals. Again, unfortunately, I see why this film was released and why people rent out: real living salts and full frontal (equally male and female) nudity. It was also a waste of time. We quickly learn from a post-university male / female roommate couple, who has obvious feelings about a woman who just sees her as a friend, constantly having sex with her former boyfriend. In addition, we are living our eternal lives under everyday events: it works for its parents; she works on her computer with a very uninteresting sexual awareness project. To make it work, the dialogue must be interesting and real. Either work and it's not as boring as watching someone's feeling, i.e. "brown bunny". The only actor who stands out is Kate Winterich and even does some questionable action. (DVDs extra with him in front of mike are actually worth it. It has stories that are not suitable for scenes, too many boring everyday events and persuasive behavior that you don't know except the soft porn factor why you rented it.
