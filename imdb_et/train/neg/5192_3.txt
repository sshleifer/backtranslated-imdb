It does not take long to see why the code name Diamond Head did not do it on network plans. A TV pilot movie will not be sent before the credit before it is obvious how bad it is. Maybe I missed something because there wasn't much point in the plot. Based on what I got out of confusion, a terrorist or a thief, or something called "Tree" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something with a secret weapon. The world's fool's secret agent, Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), is stopping him. There may have been more, but trust me? it really doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> Action movies should have action. There should be intercourse at moments of pause. And in dramatic moments, there should be a drama. In the name of the codename: Diamond Head has no such thing. I've seen others use the word "markets" to describe it for TV snoozer? and it's better than any word description I can come up with. No characters are the least exciting or caring. And Roy Thinnes makes the worst wires of imagination. His charisma is just north of the slope. Ian McShane is the best thing the film has done for it, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to have come back first. Now that McShane had been put out of the series, maybe you had something. <br /> <br /> I have quickly discovered that these awful 70s TVs from Gawd make great Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes. And it will double when Quinn Martin was involved. Very funny things about Mike and Bot. So if I can only give the movie in 3/10, I appreciate my MST3K rating scale Episode # 608 a 4/5.
