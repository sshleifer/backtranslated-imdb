I really wanted to like this movie, but it's so stolen / borrowed from other works - some of the borrowings are painfully blatant. The review of the New York Times revealed that their singing frog resembles a terribly famous Warner Brothers comic ("Hello, my baby, hello to my darlin, hello to my ragtime gal ..."). But I invite anyone to look at the Fox / Blue Sky animated feature of Robots (2005) and find no ridiculous similarities: storyline - Young inventor who grows and one innovative company shares all the great inventions. <br /> <br /> Cityscape - Extremely similar camera angles to very similar futuristic urban environments. <br /> <br /> Robots - Robinson's Robot has a very similar design to that of robots and both films use a retro-futuristic look. <br /> <br /> All this seems to be in stark contrast to Disney's endless quotation, which means that the company has been a constant innovator who never looks back (which also contradicts their entire 90's movie catalog that were a lot of clones, some small-scale stories and ethnicity). <br /> <br /> Filmmakers can't tell the story alone, and instead we are constantly sending objects and noise moving towards us, although we have no less attention. <br /> <br /> The villain is really well-designed and perfectly animated, and he is happy to watch. Much of the rest of the movie seems to have been thrown together. Some landscapes look like the CGI in the mid-90s. <br /> <br /> The film actually opens with the classic Mickey Mouse. At the end of this comic, it is recalled that Disney has never had much interest in innovative or good stories - they think that just about getting on the big screen is a proof of their virtue.
