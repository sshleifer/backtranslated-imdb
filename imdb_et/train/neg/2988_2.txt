First I enjoyed Lucio Fulci's Zombie 2. This movie was a perfect trash. I couldn't see it. The story was a joke, the actor was a joke, and the fact that Zombie 3 has nothing to do with Zombie 2 is even more of a joke. People back to life. No matter this, the movie is not worth $ 1.00 that pays for its rental. I really enjoyed lucio fulc's movies, but it was terrible. If Zombie 3 is an indicator of how zombie 4 and 5 are going to be, then I think I'll just skip.
