The only possible way to enjoy this flick is to head against the wall of your head, allow some internal hemorrhage in your brain, let your brain cell heap die, and if you have officially slowed down, maybe * MIGHT * enjoy this movie <br /> > The only sustainable arm was the story between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of a cab driver and so was a British girl. Perhaps, if they had created the whole movie in their espionage in India and how they finally fell in love, it would have made it a much more enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave him this is that Govida and his ability as an actor in comedy. <br /> <br /> Driver Chawla and Anil Kapoor were wasted unnecessarily. In addition, the transformation on the Heathrow scene was simply surprising. Being an international traveler after the September 11th world, Anil Kapoor would have been a lot before she even reached the bridge of the sky bridge to acknowledge her true love :) But the film's point was once again the defeat of logic, gravity, physics and throw the egg * GENERAL * to the audience. <br /> <br /> Look at this at your own risk. At least I know I'm in love with life:
