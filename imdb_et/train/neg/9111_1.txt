The cruel intentions 2 are bloody terrible, I mean uber-bad. Words can't explain how bad it is, but I still give him a go. <br /> <br /> The 2 plot of cruel intentions is very similar to the first movie. Sebastian (Robin Dunne) kicked out of a private school and is forced to move to New York. There he decides to start fresh and just live a normal life and settle down. Unfortunately he has to deal with his sister Kathryn (Amy Adams) who wants to drag her. Sebastain begins to fall in love with Danielle (Sarah Thompson), the innocent daughter of the school's director. Kathryn wants Sebastain to just sleep all the school that was described as a "whore house". Kathryn also wants to get Cherie (Keri Lynn Pratt) who lowered her during the school meeting. Kathryn wanted the first to be the biggest bitch in the school, the same underline for the first film. <br /> <br /> Brutal Intentions 2 is basically a canceled TV show that turned into a prequel. There are so many problems with the film. It is badly written, unusual and badly acted. Luckily for Amy Adams, the show never went because she is now a big actor. Although cruel intentions had a reality and can be seen in the real world, cruel intentions 2 are set to sitcom land, and as described in the amazon.co.uk 'randy version saved from Bell'. In the first film, there were blind topics that included sex and drug use, but for cruel purposes 2 they tried to joke and some movie ideas should not be, for example, Kathryn, who has communication with the teacher. Other ideas do not work, for example, in a secret society where all popular children meet to discuss the decline of other students. The film also had a big problem with sexual 15/16 year olds. I know teenagers have sex, sometimes a lot, but when it is done in a movie or on television, it is treated very seriously. One famous feeling was when Daneille encouraged Cherie (who is about 14/15 in the movie) to simulate sex on the back of her horse to orgasm. The idea of ​​switching a 14/15-year-old girl into a slut is very wrong with me and should not be the subject of comedy. The movie jokes fall into the apartment, either when it is a verbal gag like "he's going to get wet when he sees you" in a visual gaze where Sebastian pushes Kathryn's face first into the mud. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of wrong with the movie I don't have time to go, but I say it should be avoided. Just look at bold intentions, though it's not classic, it's still a decent film and treats the substance well. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a perverted damp dream where school children are very sexy with each other.
