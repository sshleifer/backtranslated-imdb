In India, cinema sometimes has come up with a movie like Sholay that changes the audience's good movie. And just once (hopefully) over time, we have a RGV ki Aag that violates all standards and creates one. So low standard, it can never be crushed. Ram Gopal sure can take the talent melting pot and create a cup, so the drug u can smell it far away. Classic like Sholay and murder are totally unforgivable and I can't believe he called almost the movie RGV out of Sholay. Although Sholay had many folklore elements, the film succeeded in relying on its plot, defining its character so specifically that they lived forever. What Aag does, take these characters and mix them so badly that you need the worst competition. The element of reality is completely absent, and what the film offers is a set of "actors" who, together with the plot, paralyze a lesser and seemingly interconnected set of events. One of the stars in this movie is the ridiculous waste of voice. It was time for RGV to wake up to the reality of its failure and create another "different" plot that can be categorized under the cinema.
