Okay .. it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but I had heard a lot about it and was very disappointed. I saw where the filmmakers came from and tried to express the fact that both sides of this battle were not much different from each other, that individuals were lost in the fight, and so on. (Well, this is my premise, anyway = ^ _ ^ =) <br /> <br /> Anyway .. movie type boring. I watched a lot of really long movies, but it just seemed to be dragging on and on ... basically because I couldn't take care of any character. I just thought .. who cares ?? I also found that the actor is quite dead and the dialogue is tense. I understand that it was 1800s and everything, but most of the conversations seemed rather unnatural. Nobody felt the emotions in most of the movie except during the melodramatic events. <br /> <br /> The "romance" story seemed to be nothing more than "I am a man and you are a girl", which I do not find much romance, and yet I felt that I was led to believe that these people were in love. Well, I think it's all "our fear around us, we have each other to hold on" or something else. I also hope that the two best friends (who both initially knew the girl interesting) were dynamic, but it was just Maybe avoid the cliche of love triangle. I don't know. <br /> <br /> Well. Daniel Holt was the only one I really liked. And Sue Lee was fine. I didn't like Jake exactly , but he seemed a little too ... spineless, I think Jack Bull I don't care at all, and I'm pretty sure you should hate almost everyone, except poor normal people who just mow left and right. quite graphic and it was all the "fears of war" under, but i'm seeing have made many other films with the same themes that have been made better. (For example, I liked Patriot even though it was a bit emotionally manipulative) But, as I have already mentioned, I'm a cynic. What can I say? :)
