It was one of the most ridiculous and badly directed films I've seen for a long time. I've never liked Spike Lee, but I thought I'd give it one try: a bad mistake. The film should show how Sami Son in 1977 influenced the neighborhood. What he actually did was central to the most boring characters I doubt they care for their drug problems, marriage problems, and so on. Shooting and then back on Saturday night! Even more ridiculous is that Spike Lee is ready to play as a reporter in the film: Spike, trust me, you are not Hitchcock, stay away from movies, it makes them even worse. The most stupid scene was to be a dog that spoke with a joke depicted before it was supposed to shoot? Spike, what did you mean by making this movie? Not to think at all is my guess. People who think they see a criminal drama take my advice and don't waste time or money on your loser. In this case, you look better at Jerry Springer! A waste of film, I gave it to 10 1: a terrible dud.
