There were some beautiful poetic bits, but it is really just an artistic-fartsy toss-with no direction or resolution. How can these people get through the film school? who gives them money to make that mess? could have been so much more, a fine leader actor, and i'm always like the fairuza Balk, but come on, the alt-rock metaphor that just looks effortlessly that can't find anything convincing is just so tired, and it certainly doesn't do good movies. the director must go and live for a long time and will not return to the camera until they have something to say. it is like a school of spaghetti-wall artworks, just by comparing the serious picture and the hope of hope that the poem will be like hell. it can work if the director actually has some kind of vision or a brain that knows when it is in the presence of potential, but here it is just a space filler that doesn't affect. I felt the lazy ends going for moments before it hit, and screamed the screen "you lazy bastard" when the credit jumped.
