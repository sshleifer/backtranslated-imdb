A foolish, pointless generation about an hour after mechanics gathered, who have never worked with airplanes (led by Burgess Meredith) who drove a Porsche racing car that runs for decades with a petrol sediment led by Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace as runaway techno - wiz, who gets McGyver's spare parts for a radio receiver that can handle all frequencies at the same time and who somehow learned to acquire chemicals and use explosives in a completely peaceful society. As moral as it sounds. The terrible waste of Burgess Meredith, but Chris Makepeace may at least be forgiven for being his second film.
