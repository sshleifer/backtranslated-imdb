Oh, brother ... after you've heard of this ridiculous movie for over fourteen years, I can think of the old Peggy Lee song. <br /> <br /> "Is it all there?" ... I was just an early teen when that smoked fish hit the US. I was too young to get to the theater (although I managed to jump into "Goodbye Columbus"). Then the screening of the local film museum appeared - finally I saw this movie, except now that I was as old as my parents were when they saw it! <br /> <br /> The only reason this movie was not Anonymous time zones were condemned by the release of the United States. Millions of people died of this stinker, thinking they were seeing a sex film ... Instead, they got a lot of gnarly, repelling Swedes, street interviews in lively shopping centers, asinie political pretension ... and a weak man caring for simulated sex scenes with dirty, bright actors. <br /> <br /> The cultural icon, holy grail, the historical artifact that this thing was, crushed, burned, then things in the ashtray! <br /> <br /> Elite aesthetics still scratch the value of their boring pseudo-revolutionary political sutures. But if it was not a censorship scandal, it would have been ignored and then forgotten. <br /> <br Instead, "I Am Blank, Blank" repeated the rhythmic title for endless years when movies (I'm curious, lavender - gay movies, I'm curious, black - blaxploitation films, etc.). and every ten years the thing rises up from the dead to see the new generation suckers who want to see the "naughty sex movie" that "r evolution of the film industry" ... <br /> <br /> Yeesh, avoid like a plague .. Or if you need to see it - rent the video and pass it on to the "dirty" parts to get over it. <br /> <br />
