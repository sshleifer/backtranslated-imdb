Wow and I thought any movie by Steven Segal was bad. Every time I thought the film didn't get worse, I was wrong. The story was good, but the actors couldn't do it. They also made a lot of mistakes in making the right archaeological excavation. For example, items are not considered before they are logged in and counted. The biggest crime management was an archaeologist. He's a weak actor and I felt his act really made the film more realistic than it was. The whole concept that these knights are underground for all these years seemed pretty stupid to me. I like the idea of ​​how they disappeared and things, so almost looked frustrating. I thought the characters were not explained well enough. You didn't find much background and made it harder to communicate with them.
