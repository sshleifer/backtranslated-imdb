What?! ?? Why do people say it is "mind blowing?" Just look like the end is the worst end of cinematic history! 4 left and the whole world is over! Not to mention the character 9 was the idiot all the time when he was all killed. 1 was always right when he sacrificed 9, it wouldn't have happened. The people who live there are foolish reasons and what? I testify that the film had its parts and the whole concept was exciting. But it was a lot of clich√©s one after another. And did anyone get the feeling that it was like "Lord of the Rings?" The characters died for foolish reasons; its useless and stupid. It was one of the shortest films I've ever seen and thank God! How robots are creative against people! It's done like a hundred times! This movie is really stupid, watch a movie that's worth it like Star Trek, Hangover or Inglorious Basterds, these were good movies!
