Usually I love lesbian movies even when they are not very good. I'm biased, I think! <br /> <br /> But it is only wells. Yes, landscapes and buildings are beautiful and there is a short but beautiful erotic interlude, but otherwise it's a waste of time. Annamarie alternates with alternation and high / rock / outlay, no matter what drug or milk is expedient, and Ella inexplicably puts this dreadful behavior across the film. We never give any idea why this is so, or even why Annamarie is both depressed and withdrawn. <br /> <br /> If at least there would have been some kind of closure (potentially romantic? Not even known between the two! Maybe there would have been some satisfaction. But even though Annamarie at one point asks Ellela "why do you love me?" It is never clear whether this is more than a (badly behaved) lesbian's eternal journey with a straight woman. Even the relationship between the two women and the local people they meet on the trip, which might have been lively and informative, is rather flat, tedious and mostly incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The film has one good joke, though I'm sure it was inadvertent. However, when they camp, they have a huge tent, a cot, a sleeping bag, and even a desk, chair and typewriter! In addition, we see luggage compartments on board the ferry, probably also those that are likely to be transported in a small Ford luggage compartment! <br /> < br /> And through the film, we never see a petrol station, or somewhere that looks like a place to buy gasoline. Mostly they end up in an endless mile of endless desert. So where did they get the fuel? <br /> <br /> Maybe there aren't too many lesbian movies out there, good or bad, but there's a lot better than that, and very few that are worse. Leave it on the shelf.
