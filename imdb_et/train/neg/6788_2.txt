The Idea in the Name of Man is good, the murderer does not want his only daughter to reach the institution and ask the girl's parents who were killed to take care of her daughter. And you could expect actors, especially Scott Bakula, to do good actors, unfortunately they don't! On behalf of people, it turns out to be a normal Friday night. The dead girl's repercussions are quite pathetic, and at some point you can just predict what the actors say ... If you want a good movie about this topic, check out Dean Man's walking!
