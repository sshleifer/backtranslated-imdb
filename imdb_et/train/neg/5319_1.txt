Recipe for the worst films of all time: his man-villain, who looks like WWF escapes, is a terrible target with a weapon that has inconsistent effects (the first man he seduces, but when he lets someone else disappear) and takes time for cows' pets. Then you have unlikable characters, 30 year old college students, flat test surprise end and much, much more. Avoid at all costs.
