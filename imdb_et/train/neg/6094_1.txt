I've been quite convinced that I am writing this review for a number of reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) This is undoubtedly the worst film I've ever seen. list all the time in the worst movie list it deserves 3) I was very happy - I paid five pounds for it. I've seen 15 pounds in the shops. DO NOT PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE ATTENTION TO THE FILM! You are very angry 4) There are many movies in Horror's genre that do not give the correct rating (in my opinion) and give this film a higher rating than they are in criminal proceedings <br /> <br /> plot summary: a friend who doesn't have friends a tramp that promises to the world - well, magical ability to appear to everyone else like someone else. Our hero becomes a wise teenage girl and joins her gang - sitting on swings, babysitting. He kills them one by one until he is monitored by the police and found. <br /> <br /> Why is it so bad? To start acting is very bad. Someone else compared it to school production. No, it's worse than anything I've seen in school. <br /> <br /> I have bought several of these previously banned movies from the DVD company vipco and were not as disappointed as I was. Okay, the operation is bad, but the film can't provide any other meaning. What was the idea of ​​making this movie, if not even a gore! okay, not gore. What more can such a movie offer? Scares? No, not even any titration! <br /> <br /> It is true that this movie may have a unique smile, but any potential buyer / observer of this movie should be quite advised that this movie is at best worth only one in ten.
