I only today, I picked it up 99 cents only to maintain today, and I still think I got ripped off. "Dream to Believe" is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and $ 1 is too expensive for it. This film is probably only significant in two respects: 1. He has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. This is led by Paul Lynch, the man who also made Promo Night. Now for the movie. It's about a girl named Robin (played by Olivia D'Abo) who has been badly injured in a car accident that also costs her father's life. So the accident prevents him from competing in gymnastics competitions, he is often trained during his classes, and eventually he meets some natural children called Tommy (played by Keanu.) stepfather owned laundry. Finally, he is chosen to compete. In general, Keanu alone and some memorable 80's songs are what prevents me from giving this 1-star, and it's not one of the worst movies ever, but still far from good. The DVD itself does not receive medals because it seems to come from the VHS old and to the end, the sound goes out of sync and when the final credits are almost over, it disappears black, although the sound may still be heard. So it can probably go through the bootleg. There is no point in the DVD work because it has the latest photos of Keanu and Olivia, and there is nothing to do with the film in the background, because it is not in the film, so the cover is obviously photoshopping. In any case, avoid at all costs if you are not a Keanu fanatic. I'm probably no longer hanging. I will probably give it to The Cinema Snobile, who is an excellent YT critic. Hey, if somebody has a movie they don't want in their eyes, give him donations for their show.
