I'm really starting to believe that Seagal is on a mission to see how his films can get. This particular film was complete and full of time wasted. My first complaint was the DVD cover, where they wrote their picture and made him look weaker and younger than in the movie he looks like crap. She has her big pot of belly and a double chin on her and the most unhappy and boring face in her face. <br /> <br /> The whole plot was ridiculous from the start and pulled out too long. The whole film brought the finals where Seagal and his team had to take a lot of people under the influence of a secret military chemical adrenaline booster. a lot of useless dialogue, and not to mention Seagals' voice of ridiculous and constant duplication even in the middle of the statement. The dubbed voice sounded like a frog with a frog and was quite comic. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes in the movie were terrible. Half the time when Seagal foug ht you couldn't even see what was going on. It would be close shots of her yelling at her hand on the camera and then the person flying through the wall or something. The old Kung Fu series on television. They used the way too much in a slow motion. <br /> <br /> I believe this is still Seagall's worst movie and I'm glad that I didn't buy this movie or I would have been very upset because I'm a huge fan of Seagal Aikido. The star of the action is rapidly disappearing and every occurrence seems to be getting worse.
