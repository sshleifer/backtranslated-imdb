A friend told me about John Fantest last summer when we got a chat about Charles Bukowski. I didn't know that Fante was Bukowski's favorite writer - an author with a similar edge and humor, except one generation earlier. "Ask Dust" was the first Fante book I read, and this is one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant writing about a sad, frightened young writer who represented himself and an exaggerated, masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write real world experiences. In the novel, the main character is a virgin who has no idea how to win the grace of the men she desperately writes in the press. The story of his strange relationship with Camilla, how he lives with his "wounded" admirer of his first sexual experience, and how he ultimately leaves nothing, but the story of his failed love is biting and real, without the touch of Hollywood. The adaptation of the film will remain faithful to the book for a while, but tends to be a cinematic trap of love that is persistent through racism, disease and death. The heart of this story is that Bandini is jerk and Camilla is crazy and their love has never been and would never be a real thing, no matter how one wanted to find one another. This film brought out the true meaning of the story and replaced it with schlock. I can't believe that a man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make it a movie that's so wrong.
