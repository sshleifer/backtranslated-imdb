I bought this video quite cheaply ex-rent, thinking that the cover looked pretty nice. And it was nice, but the movie is a trash. I can handle a B class, sometimes even enjoy a good B romp (ie "Surfers must die") is a classic example of how the genre can be fun. Incredibly dull scenes were shattered too thinly by the horrors of good healthy cheap porn and entertaining dreams. This movie has very little to offer.
