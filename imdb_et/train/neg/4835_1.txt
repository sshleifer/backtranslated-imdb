Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already making a sequel to the Afghan youth in the US. He is also a highly qualified surgeon and freely smuggling around Kabul, acting on wounded NATO soldiers. In a particularly challenging mission, he randomly takes a sniper rifle and makes Osama Bin Laden about 3000 meters away. Finally, he is promoted to a sergeant, but he cannot decide between a sniper and a surgeon's career, so he leaves the army completely. A year later, in a frustrated civilian life, he joins the navy and the last scene shows him proudly white.
