... or maybe it's just that bad. The plot is the first one that is weird because it should be a prequel, not a sequel. Quite a lot of the film seems to be cheap, the first one whose scenes imitate the things in the first thing, but much more ridiculous and unlikely. When the first one was big cast, it is made up of list B participants and rejection. Operation is usually terrible. Half of the movie's good lines are taken straight from the first, as is almost every major character, including those who were not in the first movie. I understand that it was produced by the pilot episode of the TV series, but that is no excuse. They didn't have to (film) change the material. Only one thing is a little good and it's an erotic sequence. However, since they are not nearly as good as the first ones, it doesn't even raise it above 1. If you have the chance to see it for free and you're a straight boy, it may be worth checking out if you want something erotic that isn't porn. If not, avoid it at all costs. 1/10
