I'm going to the cinema for entertainment. Nothing fun about this movie. From the beginning to the end, this woman's life is not a relaxation for the gray, polishing reality. It's at one pace, without changing the mood. I just ended up just because I was convinced that things had to get better. They are not, and I do not think that I was the only one to be proved by the many fears that wander around the cinema when the movie was fun. Honestly depicting social exhaustion is not a crime, but the audience is not bored with how to gain public sympathy. Terrible movie.
