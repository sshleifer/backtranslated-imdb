I have to admit that I have seen a couple of carts during my time, but it is the worst. Be alarming. Sex and violence that are being thrown away by pulling out an unpleasant and really badly-assembled movie. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine that the majority casts back on the final product and wants it to collect dust on the shelf, not one generation or two. Unfortunately, I have my DVD. It sits on the shelf and looks at me from time to time.
