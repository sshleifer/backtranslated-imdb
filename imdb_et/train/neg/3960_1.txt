Hi, it may be because I am not a big or complicated observer of the movie ... I think this movie is "boring" and "stupid". <br /> <br /> I rented this movie to Charles Bronson and because of that the title ... but the boy, the waste of time ... just looking at 2 guys sitting in the vault and talking ... <br /> > The movie on this DVD was so "DARK" ... I had a hard time watching the movie ... I know it's a 1968 movie ... but they put it on a DVD, they should make a digital revaluation . <br /> <br /> I was also totally surprised to see these high signs of IMDb for this movie ... as I said before I was as complicated as the other people who commented on this movie before.
