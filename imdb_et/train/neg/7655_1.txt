We must all congratulate Uwe Boll. He has made it unthinkable. He can be the only director who has two films on the bottom of the IMDb! He's like a movie. No matter how few talents he has, and no matter how bad these films are, he can continue to do them. I know he is funding them all through some strange fund, but even his ability to keep movies in absolute absolute failure is one of the greatest secrets of the universe. <br /> <br /> would not be so bad, except that video game developers give this man the best features. I really enjoyed the series of blind games alone. Even the last, New Nightmare, was a great game within hours. Edward Carnby's adventures were a good movie, but that's not the case. Now Uwe Boll has received Bloodrayne and Hunter: Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Destruction? I can only imagine that the guy this guy adjusts between games and movies, if he's not stopped. Someone has to take out their credit line or those video game publishers need to understand and understand that if they make a bad movie out of a game that kills a franchise, no one will be interested in that title. Think about whether a dead house or alone in the dark is a more viable game title? Not possible. A new dead house appears on the X-Box, where no one cares. The title is dead and all thanks to Uwe Boll. So if someone else is out there with a game publisher or knows the publisher of the game, or if you have access to the game publisher, please warn them. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even worth it. I can't separate what I didn't like from the rest of the pile. The word literally sucks it all. Writing, Drama, Music, CG Effects, Editing. I thought if I waited until it came out on the DVD and then rented it out with low expectation, I wouldn't be disappointed. Boy, I was wrong. Never underestimate Uwe's ability to bring out a large, steaming stack of BOLL sh * t.
