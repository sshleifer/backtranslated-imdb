Do you want to know the secret? This movie sucks. Well, actually, I don't know, because if you allow yourself to be allowed to plagiarize versions of original movies, maybe you can find this movie incredible (this movie is a plagiarized copy of what I knew you did last summer). The first 30 minutes of the movie are based on a typical story setting; a number of so-called cool teenagers who are resting in Florida and are themselves, behaving very much like the adolescents they have. The only knowledge we get here is the extent to which the director has succeeded in illustrating the young decadence mindset of young people. The other half-hour of the movie gets a little bit of momentum and begins to illustrate the beginning of non-whack-to-unprecedented killings. The third half of the film will definitely remain a mystery, because I turned it off before I can deceive myself, thinking that the film still has something interesting and the original left to show. As for the story, it can be easily explained by a few lines. A lot of teenagers go on vacation to Florida. Though they are busy at the party, they begin to slowly (and I mean slowly) start killing because they know a foolish secret. The only thing that was killed is that all the victims were matriculated with a common high school. One thing that amazed me about this film was how much betty (im not sure about her name .. blonde character) looks like a reese witherspoon. The other thing that surprised me about the film was that it changed my jump a couple of times. Does this make it a work of art? absolutely not because my 12-year-old sister made me drip into orange juice because she "me" when I was just going through the guest door ... what's the difference between the director and my 12-year-old niece ???? <br /> <br /> Do you want to know the secret? I'm not sure, but I'm not ..
