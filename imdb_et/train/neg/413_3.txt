This is a movie that gives you one impression. Writing a story is what is making movies. Amazing visual effectâ€¦ Very good action, especially Shuen. Everything is perfect .. Except .. The story is just poor and so, all fails. <br /> <br /> Imagine if you could be invisible. What would you do? Well, our crazy scientist (played by Kevin Bacon) couldn't think of another thing, but cherish and rape women. It's all his allegedly "genius" mind that could think. Does he try to gain extra power? No. He doesn't even bother to investigate to get it back. The man is mostly a maniac. <br /> <br /> Add the atmosphere of a laboratory environment to all of these young boys. all white coats and outfits, you think it's a bad imitation "Cheers". Very low and poor personalities and very little care that you think these boys are nothing but sheep for the Hollow Man wolf. <br /> <br /> Even as a thriller, the film is short because most "exciting" scenes are written so badly and are full of illogical behaviors that the actors just scream "it's just a stupid thing I have to do to hollow A man could find me alone and kill me. "<br /> <br /> When you read a real book while a scientist (pink) goes after a woman, there is a lot of mental manipulation and distraction that goes into her character. In the film, Cane is just a sick man who goes to a crowded market to rub his body on women and go down there. Just sad.
