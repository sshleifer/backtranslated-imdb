It is unfortunate that someone in his book decided to hit the best horror movies of all time. This poor copy steals a lot of material from the first three movies, even copying the way people die and what will happen to key characters in the future, and will mainly try to cram and fail in three movies. She can't even create a good scary atmosphere (except for the strange exception, when the impressive choral music brings back the memories of old movies). <br /> <br /> The only thing we thank is that it is not Omen V.
