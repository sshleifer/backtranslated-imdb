It seemed to me that the miniseries of Berlin air transport are one of the most interesting German (post) war films. This is a topic that has not been studied much. However, the makers of this series made clich√©s. It starts with the movie DVD cover, which is a direct copy of "Pearl Harbor". <br /> <br /> Luise Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) can hear that her husband, a doctor (Ulrich Noethen), has died in Russia and after the war he is fighting to survive. He finds work on an American basis, gets to work in the city with the coolest and highest officer (Heino Ferch), falls in love with m, gets pregnant, and suddenly his wife gets up again. Come on!!! We have seen it repeatedly. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen play their role quite well; However, Bettina Zimmermann never seems convincing. For some reason, it always seems too late to give the scenes the right emotional response. It just didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> Airplanes and aerial platforms, we are sometimes exciting, not frequent. Nami things always seemed to happen to the same pilot. <br /> <br /> If you are not a big fan of World War II movies, I suggest you spend money on other things: chocolate ice cream brings a lot more satisfaction! <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10!
