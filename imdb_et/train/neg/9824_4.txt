From the unknown television stations in the US, when I slipped it on my cable, I thought first of all that it was just a low budget sci-fi movie, but after a few minutes I thought it might be a wise satire for the worst misconduct of Christian fundamentalists, and then this gift me - good grief, these people are serious! It has been a while since I saw something so involuntarily fun. I hesitated to write that I was afraid of believers, but then I saw other comments and thinking, hey, they can do it. Tough Philosophical Confusion: How do you criticize a movie without actually showing what you criticize?

You might be offended by filmmakers in contempt for those audiences who have not been confirmed with the J **** C ***** myth, but I didn't do it that way - It was so funny!
