American Humane Association, a familiar source of disclaimer "No animal is harmed ..." (registered trademark of AHA), began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago, after being stuck with the eye, the horse was forced to jump from its death to the cliff at Jesse James (1939). Needless to say, the cruel act of killing me for the whole aspect of this movie. I think it can be said that at least the horse did not die in vain because it was the beginning of a public awakening that had caused harsh and terrible pain that caused the animals to honor the film, but I can't help that if poor animals had a choice, it would certainly have been the path he would have taken!
