It was the third effort of the director von Stroheim - it is a crude oil and does not show any extraordinary appearance to the camera and to the mastery of editing it a few years later with his masterpiece GREED and WEDDING MARCH. In essence, we have trio drifters who disguise as Russian figures and two Russian princesses who have rented Monte Carlo's wool. Their purpose is to use counterfeit money in gambling tables and win fortune. Part of this plan is that Count (von Stroheim) hints between a visiting American ambassador and his "foolish" woman, trying to get him and hoping to make money by playing his weaknesses. He makes a mistake by also saving the maidservants he promised to marry. When he sees them, he puts a space on the fire (von Stroheim and his catch on the balcony of the room). Here, von Stroheim first determines his personality as "the person you love to hate". He is profoundly bad and his character deficiencies ultimately lead to a very bad and earned end. The film is crude oil in cinematography and editing, and it is not worth seeing if you are not a director. It's a little bit cute - when he first tries to meet the ambassador's spouse, he reads the book - we see the title - the keepers of Erich von Stroheim. It was originally intended as a 210-minute film cut in the studio for 140 minutes and finally released for 70 minutes. Cinema Video Restoration restores the material retained from the earlier version (which is in some way damaged in most scenes) to give us a 107-minute print.
