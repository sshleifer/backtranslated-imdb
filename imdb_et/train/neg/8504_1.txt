Semana Santa is jaw-bad. It is so wrong in so many ways that I won't. So, let's see ... Mira Sorvino, whose judge's husband has defended him, goes to Madrid for Seville to work as a police officer. During the Holy Week (Semana Santa, look? ... everyone's going to fall asleep. Seeing it was so many points, even bad from the start), the killer fills his victims like bulls in bullfighting. He is with his teammate Olivier Martinez and nice Feodor Atkine. He will soon discover that he is the next killer target (who is wearing red clothing). Why, oh, but why? <br /> <br /> Why ..; this is a question that has been in the head of the film. <br /> <br /> Q: Why go to A: Because I love Mira Sorvin (I even apologize for seeing it for the first time) <br /> <br /> Q: Why do we only have 8 people did we announce this Saturday in the first week after release? A: ah-ah-ah. The Spider man got back on the same day. But also the fact that the film has exploded. <br /> <br /> Q: Why has this movie been made? A: I think money. But the boy needed money for Mira. <br /> <br /> Then ... why ???????????? First, there is always something wrong with co-production in Europe. here is French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Danish production. yi-ha. <br /> <br /> Then he wants to play on the same line as USA thrillers / slashers / whodunit / mysteries / whatever. Even VALENTINE, though it is unnecessary and poorly written and photographed, was much better at midnight and fun. <br /> <br /> In order to give some hope, the scriptwriter wanted to add a story to a political view. Wrong: flash-made in traffic-like photography is definitely the most interesting thing about film. Could it have been detained, it shouldn't sit across the film. Better go straight to Guillermo del Trose THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE (El espinazo del diablo) for some smart fun. Then homophobia. Bullseye! The first victims are the twins of S&M addictive gays who died of death. The pesky olivier Martinez goes to the dating agency in possession of a poorly shaved overweight transvestive with blonde platinum wig. Mira Sorvino calls her character all the time. Do we need such stuff? Nah. Just unnecessary offensive comments like ol'times. <br /> <br /> Then take a break. Yipee. There is no obvious motive. The first murders are a beautiful illusion because they represent a famous painting. But not. And the revelation of the killer (of course, a terrible fascist) could have been done from the beginning when he appeared at the end of the movie, as I think the director had time to say "time to stop the film, who is the killer and why he kills." br /> <br /> Then the director thinks he is a director. Wrong: no tension, no thought, no action, no knowledge of the change of pace. Giant, mega-bore. Scenes of the week are unnecessary (maybe also a co-production rule says: ok, shoot in Seville, but show there a beautiful and historic city with Easter, where we are: a secret movie for tourists!) <Br /> <br /> Then actresses. nothing except when he is caught in his right hand. Everything he did best (substitute warriors, mighty aphrodite ...) were as they never existed. Olivier Martinez ... hello, anyone here? that he is not an actor but a dummy with no speech or feelings? Feodor Atkine, blissful and transparent. Only we pay great respect to Alida Valli, one of the biggest actors of the last century (and I hope there are still some roles in this one). He is the main attraction here because he is the only one who gives the lives of his poor lines. I do not mention other participants because they are only one-sided characters, uninteresting and low. <br /> <br /> Consistent direction, contradictory participants, incredible plot. Idiocia incarnated. <br /> <br /> Superwonderscope says: 1 <br /> <br />
