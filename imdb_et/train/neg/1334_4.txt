So last night I saw the movie "My Left Foot" after my mom said it was amazing ... The central performance of Day-Lewis is indeed remarkable and amazing, but anyone with even minimal exposure to their second job should wait nothing less. <br /> <br /> The deadly misconception in my eyes was to get obsessed with proving that man's normality; The film decided to show him a complete and complete jerk. On the one hand, I see that this is a logical correlation; humanity always has the ability to be reluctant and disability should not hide it. I just wish that impartial spectators would not be so forgiving of abnormal behavior and would expect the circumstances to make it automatically forgiving. They are not. Acting is normal, and so, yes, disabled people are acting - but they don't do it because they are banned; they do it because they are unreasonable. Physical damage does not give you the right to throw the hissy openly, but because someone you love will take you down. <br /> <br /> There are certain things that make sense whether you are disabled or disabled - a body. One of them is to give a tacit permission to start football directly with your head just to install. (True, I was punished for one week by a school-killer, but I was already part of it. It was not acceptable.) \ T By proving that your father extends you to each other after proving that you are able to jump physically instead, masochism takes too far. All these things are foolish and suffering through how to show your courage, not making them less stupid. <br /> <br /> So yes; just because you have overcome obstacles to achieve great things, do not make you less jerky ... A good person is a priority; An inspiring example for people with disabilities should appear below the list.
