: Spoilers: <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting for this for a very long time and finally got a chance when he went to Hallmark in the evening of the tower. I love the first three "Love" movies, but it wasn't like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, it was a way for many goofs and editing was very bad - for many of the scenes left out of context. I also think that baby Kathy's death happened soon and Clarks appeared in the movie just not suitable. It seemed that no actor wanted to be there - not all emotions. There seems to be no interaction between missie and Willie. <br /> <br /> I think the script writers should have gone further than the book. Every film that has been done so far seems to be sliding further beyond the writings of Janette Oke. I mean in a movie they never mentioned about a mine and two boys or Clark. And I think Missie and Willies' reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard, not just heard. Of the four films made so far, love is a joy is my least favorite. I hope that the next four films will follow more books, and if Clarks' character is in them, I hope he will have the greater part and I hope his part is not so cute. I also hope that there are more Scottie and cookies and maybe even Marty, but who knows what the script writers will do next.
