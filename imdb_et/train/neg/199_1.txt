It's a terrible movie, a terrible script, a bad direction, and a meaningless ending. Also bad performances, except Clancy Brown, who has not been used here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was purgatory - you do it so that you can clear enough bad karma to actually see a good line. <br /> <br /> The movie presents a father and a son who look like they probably haven't been involved. The part of the male leader is not well written and seems to be unstable in this role. You see the plot miles away. Also, there is no point in the woman and her brother, the policeman. So, at the end of the movie, the big action he has taken is not a meaningful script.
