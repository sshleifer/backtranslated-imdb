Nothing would have saved this movie, not even Superman. <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, special effects would have been amazing. Better governance could have made the participants feel better and achieve better results. But nothing, but feeding the script to a dragon could have improved it. Design holes, bad lines, terrible pace, endless repetition of the same frame of CGI dragon through the corridors ... ugh. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br />
