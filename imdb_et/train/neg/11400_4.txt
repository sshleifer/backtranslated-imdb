The Hazing is a mumbo-jumbo confused that is so difficult to be Evil Dead that it even refers to Bruce Campbell several times. The problem is that it is not just in the same league as this terrible movie. This movie is not nearly original. The plot has previously been used by Kevin Tenney demons at night and it was much more fun. This flick leaves too much time for a complex exposition before children enter the horrible mansion and begin demonic events. <br /> <br /> Brad Dourif is not as usual here to do a lot, but if he's a screen that puts another top-level performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous. As far as children's behavior is concerned, it is satisfactory, but not at all good. Dirty camera is annoying or more annoying. There are some good moments when the first man gets in and throws away some deadly linings while he is sending his victims, but it was never scary. Gore is low and low on average, but the director tries to make up for it, showing a couple of times topless. All in all, just be it if you have 87 minutes of waste.
