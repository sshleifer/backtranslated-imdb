I love what John Saxon has turned on. Once he takes over the camera, he controls a movie that should have been titled "Please do not watch this movie: Zombie Death House". The $ 1,000 dollar shock insurance certificate is an expensive way for Fred I Ray to spend 14 dollars on a large 70's cheese legend filmed landfill. Ray is a man in front of RetroMedia. Ray, by the way, makes Charles Bandi hotter than the plasterboard on the Ford Falcon. Just bad now, both they and boring. It is nice that Ray digs these old things and in some cases it is commonly used as the rest of the dollar video hucksters, but in the case of Zombie Death House (the word "Zombie" partly overlaps to add ownership and interest in this part) FOR FOR) ONLY) TO USE THIS TRIPE SERVICE TO ISSUE IN COLLECTION AND SAXON COLLECTIONS !!! If you want to see a real scarf, pick up black Christmas, a nightmare on Elm Street or a glove.
