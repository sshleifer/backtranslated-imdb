Basically there is a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks his zombie is in his closet and his parents are fighting all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie is slower than the soap opera ... and suddenly Jake decides to get Rambo and kill the zombie. <br /> <br /> OK, first, if you are going to make a movie, you have to decide if it's a thriller or a drama! According to the drama, the film is observable. Parents divorce and claim as in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet that completely destroys the movie! I was expecting a BOOGEYMAN-like movie and instead looked at some nonsense drama with thriller spots. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 for well-played parents and landing dialogues. With Jake: Just ignore them.
