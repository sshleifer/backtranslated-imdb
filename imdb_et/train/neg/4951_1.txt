I commented when he debuted for the first time and gave it "thumbs in the middle", noting that I would only give him the benefit of the first episode. I've seen six episodes in June 2006. And as a lifetime Batman fanatic, I can say without hesitation: this exhibition is totally silly. <br /> <br /> It's all wrong. Everything. Just the past of exhausting animation and design, the story is ridiculously twisted and without the characteristic development of the sign writers or the obvious interest in giving any story to any subject. <br /> <br /> And for God's sake. Is it just me, or is Joker in all EPISODE? Is Gotham a big part of the rotating door legal system? Or, again, is it just a total lack of interest in the writers to make other enemies do (see "not developing the signs" above). <br /> <br /> And even worse, every Joker story has the same 3-part formula. <br /> <br /> 1) Joker is gassing people. <br /> <br /> 2) Joker sets the entire city gas. <br /> <br /> 3) Batman saves the day. <br /> <br /> Pfeh. <br /> <br /> There was one episode I saw that it wasn't a Joker story. The title escapes me, but the villain was the evil Clumemaster ... "Quiz game" episode with the quiz. It was one of the worst Batman story I've ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than "I got Batman in my basement." <br /> <br /> I can't really say what I feel is like this exhibition because it's probably against ToS, but it starts with "B" and rhymes "fastardization". Thanks for the goodness of Timm / Dini / etc. Era Bat-Entertainment, Back Fox and Kids WB Days. Unfortunately, such good things that I should have known could not last forever.
