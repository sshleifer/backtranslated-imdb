If you don't feel that your emotions have been played, this movie doesn't like it. On the other hand, if you enjoy the secrets of British crime, you follow the clues and see how they all logically fit in, then you are very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Here are some logical contradictions to bring to this disappointment: <br /> <br /> * Although the police use CCTV cameras early to gather clues from a mystery, a large truck that stopped and blocked the children's view before his disappearance stays in the camera. This is a critical part of the mystery. It is not compatible with the car when the children were caught in the camera, not a large truck, which is so critical to the mystery. <br /> <br /> * Movie length indicates that tracking devices are more complex. children's pathways, but reserves the opportunity to use the same sophisticated equipment, observing clues as part of the visible location of vehicles in a place adjacent to the crime scene. <br /> <br /> * England has a left drive. The director goes out of his way to get a car in the right crime park, several meters away from a flower kiosk if he could have parked immediately or even from the side. like a huge truck did. <br /> <br /> * Police Forensic Team is so careful to find a thrown mobile phone in a sewer drain, which is several miles from the crime scene, but can't find blood evidence from the head injury at the crime position, even though they secured the scene in just a few hours after the disappearance and without a break. <br /> <br /> * The search dog was not used to find missing children at all; this is the country that is well-known for developing an ulcer dog for search and hunting. <br /> <br /> * It is illogical that such a highly publicized news story is not expected to create an innocent driver who stopped the flower pot. <br /> <br /> * It is illogical for a mother to go to such extremes and spend so much effort to leave the carpet fibers under her nails so that her ultimate murderers will even attract her daughter to do the same - if she just couldn't guard the guard go home. If she had enough thought to ask her daughter to get a nail under her nail, she could just ask her daughter to ask for help or even leave the mobile home in the out-of-home park. > <br /> * A little girl's kidnapped suspect was depicted mentally slowly / dimly - rightly her mother sinking unconscious? but he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and to fully exercise his rights, not to blame himself. <br /> <br /> Such contradictions are those that bring true unisex disappointment. "Five Days" is a very weak British crime story.
