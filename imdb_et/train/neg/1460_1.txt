If another Hitler ever arises, this is partly due to nonsense, as is the film that spreads the absurd perception that it was visibly distorted from the beginning. Far from this person and choosing the highest position in the country, sensible people would have crossed the street to avoid him, and he would be a dead ditch, anonymous and unknown. <br /> <br /> Everyone who reads the accounts of Hitler's close associates, such as his secretary Traudl Junge, is struck by the fact that people found him kindly, intelligently, and generously. He was also a brilliant orator, and the fact that his speeches appear all over and against modern ears ignores the times when they were made when the political speech was common. Based on overpriced anti-Semitism, which was not central to the Nazis, who were mostly communist, and not time-old or unusual. The film looks like Hitler's only ambition from the outset has been the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> If you want to identify the next person causing tens of millions of deaths, you can ignore the fleck-lipped ravers life shown here. Instead, look at the charming, charismatic man whose convincing speeches inspire the whole nation and whose political work is visibly and essentially beneficial to the state. I'm afraid his personality is much more like Barack Obama than Fred Phelps. <br /> <br /> I was hoping a lot here and I just got a cartoon. The fools who did this thing committed a crime against reality. This is the historical equivalent of Reefer Madness.
