I have to say that in my childhood I am very proud of many rented films. The exception is Theodore Rex. Talk about all the slow movies to continue with any actor. Could you just imagine what Whoopie's dismissing agent has to tell him to write to this mess? "Hey, if you saw they were showing Dinosaurs, yeah, they're making a movie about it and you see Germany! "After that, this agent must have much to do with Star Wars. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad that I thought Whoopie had to buy all the copies of this movie and destroyed it. I just wished she could have do the same with my memory, because my sister is watching this movie yet. I mean c'mon, I even admit that I looked at Mr. Nanny and Kazzami theaters (good reasons why I gave up Hulk Hogan and Shaq for a while), but it seems to me to be worse than the greatest regret of my childhood and my life, and it was 16 years ago.I'm now 24 if you want to do math. <br /> <br /> If I think my list of the worst films of all time , I don't even mention it because, like a robbed step-child, I'm trying hard to say it happened. Turn you to Whoopie, just be glad people only recognize Eddie and Sister Act 2 as your worst thing you are lucky. rigid.
