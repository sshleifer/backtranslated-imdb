This film is the dirty hanging of George Eliot's all-time best novels Silas Marner. <br /> <br /> The movie details shown in IMDb confirm the original author, but I did not see it at the beginning of the movie, but at the end of the credit, saying, "The book was recommended by Silas Marner". Recommended? It was nothing but a story of the complete hanging of all the essential elements: <br /> <br /> An afflicted and sad old man, a craftsman, poor and lonely, has all his assets stolen. One night, the child drives to his door when his mother dies outside the snow. The man takes him in and brings him up for one day when a local prince (or a rich politician here) demands the adoption of a child. This is the one who has been the father of a child for years of illegal activity. There will then be a struggle over who should be the child's legal custody. <br /> <br /> In this and every other aspect, this story is exactly the same. Only one can find the difference. Silas Marner had epilepsy, but maybe it would have made Mr Martin's ability to work too far. In addition, her hair is colored with carrot juice (presumably she looks younger, but actually makes her look more clown that she is)! It also adds meaningless jokes that this amazing comedian can't resist the story that doesn't participate in it, and only reduces the depth of the story. Like when a child cries out of the courthouse, declaring that he can only be happy with the man who has been the father of all these years. That's what the girl in the movie is about, who applies a nose decongestant to her nose bridge to make it tear! <br /> <br /> I am surprised that legality and integrity in the film industry allow for such a movie. If I were a trustee of George Eliot, I would demand a remedy. If I were Steve Martin, I'd send it to the profit or the poor. At least it should be called "Silas Marner", adapted by S Martin. Better removed from archive! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this story - and I hope it is - leave it completely and look at Silas Marner. Or read the book! The BBC perfectly adapted it in the 1980s.
