* Possible spoiler * <br /> <br /> "Back to the cabin by the lake" is a useless film. The action was not good and the plot was not even very interesting. <br /> <br /> Cabin by the Lake is a good TV movie. There was no sequel. Judd Nelson was very good in the first film and made his character much more than that. It seemed that HE would not even be interested in making the result. His action was good, but it could have been better. I really don't want to comment on the rest, because I don't think they're even worth noting. But I do it. Alison's character is not hardly shown in the first part of the film. Suddenly, he is the center of attention beside Stanley Caldwell. There was no point in the role and it would have been somewhat better. Dahlia Salem was absolutely terrible. His behavior was below decent and the people who were casting should have sought someone else. Director Mike was a confused character. He seemed to be there, but it didn't seem his death to be necessary. This task was good, not great, but better than Salem. Stanley, who is expected to be dead, will make a movie based on his script "Cabin by the Lake". He stumbles upon the director and in a short time the director is dead and Stanley runs the show. Yes, no one from the team will let this stranger in the picture and finish a movie that doesn't know anything about him. There are some killings, not much, and what's shown is ridiculous. One of the most famous actors in the scene is filming. Another sign can be chewed by a motorboat. And one gets into the plants before drowning. These writers must be very exciting. <br /> <br /> I have to say that filming was not impressive. So that it turned back from a low budget to normal, it began to get very upset. The new cabin in the lake was also badly created. We are not shown, but only in some scenes and the whole thing in the basement was useless. It only worked in the first movie because we had much more space, but it didn't work. <br /> <br /> There were too many characters in this sequence. All but a few had no reason to be there. What's being shown was really bad and ... they just had no purpose in this movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Back Cabin by the Lake" is another choice where the first one left. "At the lake by the cabin" I can take it, but it was not just impressive. Judd Nelson should have avoided it and so you should. It's not the first one and it went too slowly. Nothing happened in the first hour and it continued to move. Not to mention that the writing was terrible. Just put it when you need to sleep. <br /> <br /> So we see that Stanley is dying and is still alive and well. By the way, as he says, it seems that only a third installment for the film itself can be possible. Stop throwing off to the future and we can be fine! <br /> <br /> (Didn't the filmmakers realize they showed us how to film the first lake scenes? They were all in the tank. Never reveal the secrets of filming.) <br /> <br />
