What a bad movie. I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes would be involved in something like that. If you make a movie that contains baseball and shows baseball scenes, at least make the action somewhat realistic. Why was the crowd always stood out for a reason during the games? *** POSSIBLE SPOILER *** And the last scene in the movie .... what was it? We have somehow believed that DeNiro has found its way into the uniform of the judge and that the game is played even in a boom. 3 stars out of 10.
