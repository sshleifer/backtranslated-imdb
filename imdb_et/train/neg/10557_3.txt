This is a terrible little product that gives both a nightmare and a headache. It's an unpleasant mix of lively action and ugly stop-motion animation. It's strange, but it's not such a joke, a weird trip someone can expect. It's cold, inhuman, friendly, bad, even horrible. There is no reason to watch this movie. After all, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. And Cosgrove-Hall made more attractive things with stop-motion. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that it is French production. As such, he re-enforces a stereotype that does not exist in French.
