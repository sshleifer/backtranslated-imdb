Too Much Borrowed Class B- <br /> <br /> Super Bowl Sunday is one of the slowest days in cinemas every year. That is why film studios tend to release larger budget films over the weekend. Every few years, the studio displays a female vintage competition (2001 "The Wedding Planner"). This Super Bowl weekend like "The Wedding Date" tries to find success and attract viewers who don't look at the game. <br /> <br /> The sick people who know him, one woman, Kat Ellis (Debra Messing, TV "Will and Grace") hires a man from Nick (Dermot Mulrony, "About Schmidt") to invite him to his friend wedding in london. His family has given him a hard time if he is not married, and his seven-year-old marriage, which he lost without reason, is the best man. To make her jealous of Kat parades Nick around her to see her what she's missing. But in the end, Nick Katil understands that he can open and let someone love him. <br /> <br /> The film borrows too much from similar wedding movies. It's almost a 1999 "Picture Perfect" carbon copy and mixes with "Wedding Planner" and "My Best Friends Wedding" in similar scenes. The film also reveals the theme of "Pretty Women" and the knowledge of its audience refers to the wise references to this and other films. <br /> <br /> "Wedding Day", all the clich√© elements are a typical wedding movie, a stereotypical overflowing mother (Holland Taylor, "Legally Blonde") and a wedding ceremony for practically plagiarize family members and friends at a wedding and rehearsal dinner. The end result has been done before, but it was something that was not fully anticipated. The real reason why Kat was dumped is a surprise and changes the direction of the film over the past half hour. <br /> <br /> Although "Wedding Day" is predictable, it is capable of standing alone. Debra Messing proves in her first leadership that she can be charming and funny. Dermot Mulrony has great chemistry with Debra Brass, but most of his dialogue was too harsh and unreal. He is best able to do what he has given and to be able to save the character. <br /> <br /> With the use of many smart (often sexual) sticks, the movie is really funny. Although the film has a chick mainly, the film has all the components. A good story and humor make it the best time to release a movie.
