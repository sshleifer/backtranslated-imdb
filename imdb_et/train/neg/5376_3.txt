The CHOKE (aka AX in the UK) is a slasher, which is allegedly a direct DVD movie. I say "supposedly" because the title of the movie does not appear in parentheses "V", which indicates that it was made for a DVD movie (although it is one appearance). <br /> <br /> The plot is easy? The band keeps a concert in the former meat industry and is killed one by one. <br /> <br /> I think most would agree that the film would never have been a masterpiece, but it does not excuse the mistakes here. Even DVD movies like BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (with a very low IMDb rating) have many redemption features and sometimes they come in so-called "bad, good" movies. But CHOKE is by no means serious (such as HALLOWEEN) or the movie "so bad that it's good" (for example, NAIL GUN MASSACRE). <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a good symbol when killed by a cage. The effect of the blood was very small but understandable due to the very low budget. But from there it is downhill all the time. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION there are so many mistakes that I could talk about them all day. But a couple of obvious eyes stand out and I'm going to them. <br /> <br /> The above-mentioned concert, which the band has, seems to start with about 50 people, but after the music stop, only about 8 people seem to have left (and they're all meant to be locked!). <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are not at all pleasing. Most of the band members are aggressive helllings or just strange. No one cares about what happens to them, and even their supposed friends will forget them when they are sent. The highlight of the film is the existence of a homeless man who seems to be treated as a certain church (seriously!). He obviously draws some really funny lines. Unfortunately, even his presence cannot save the movie. <br /> <br /> Too many scenes where people move and talk without characterization. About 65 minutes of the movie will be spent watching the characters walks around. The characters disappear for a long time without explanation. Like other DVD movies, such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, characters spend a lot of time aggressively on each other without any provocation. There are many assault attacks (mostly male characters), and one result is an almost complete fight. In fact, it can be said that the format goes as follows: moving characters - murder - the characters walk - murder takes place. You get the idea. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible and it seems that the f-words used are not spoken. Maybe it should have been funny, but it just gets sad. What's more, we've all seen it a thousand times before (usually with much greater impact). <br /> <br /> The film is no tension at all. The corpses are the only sign that the characters are in danger. Maniac crashes and characters act like general moorons. They don't try to get out of the factory or find a weapon to defend themselves. And much of the time, they don't even pretend they're scared. <br /> <br /> Like DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, no murder is committed at the time of the murder (except for the final murder after the identity of the killer). A random weapon looks like somewhere to kill this victim. No one can see how characters are tracked at any time. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, this movie was fun (of course, inadvertently), but it's not funny at all. <br /> <br /> And as the other reviewer has pointed out, the soundtrack contains music that is very bad, even for those who like punk rock. Attachments dance uncomfortably on it. The result (no music at the beginning!) Consists of a Sugarbabe wannabe band that sings a very bad song that is not entirely related to the film. <br /> <br /> Don't misunderstand the points in this review. This reviewer loves bad movies (such as NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) as much as the classic (for example, HALLOWEEN and Friday 13th). But it seems that THE CHOKE tried too hard to enter one of these categories without being in any place. And even if straight DVD movies go, this is a weak effort. <br /> <br /> With a positive note, this movie contains some pretty good murders. But if the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously, these scenes lose their importance quickly as their intensity disappears into oblivion. <br /> <br /> Traditional 1980s fans should avoid the B-slashes of this movie. And fans of classics like HALLOWEEN and Friday 13 should do their best to avoid it!
