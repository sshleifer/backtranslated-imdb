It's a simple story, but it seems very manipulative. It has no sins because it leaves no room for imagination or personal thought or reflection. <br /> <br /> Animation is well done, but I feel it is too presentation. I would have preferred more pictures behind, more space in the background, and maybe it wouldn't look like that. <br /> <br /> But with the Hollywood style movie, it works well, but it's Aardman's highly derivative movies and it bothers me. Perhaps a longer film will test whether this maker can do without a vote. <br /> <br /> I think the voice is too glib.
