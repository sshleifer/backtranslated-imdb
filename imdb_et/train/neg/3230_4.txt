I just finished the guinea pig - Devils experiment. I have to say that this movie, although I have a very good FX, better than expected, was not a good movie. I honestly say I enjoyed this movie at all. Of course this is effective so it is shocking, realistic, twisted for 43 minutes of torture, but I found it to be very boring (and not as gory as I hoped). And I also found that torturers were very annoying when they talked and created, trying hard all the time, it destroyed it even more (and I'm sure there are some people who agree with me). I have now seen a guinea pig 1,2,3,5 and the best of me a guinea pig 2 - meat and blood flowers. I don't say much more about the Devils experiment except Great fx, the girls' descent, the tedious tormentors, generally I give him 4 stars because of the FX cos which they are fantastic.
