I stole this movie when I was in college. I've been trying to see it three times, two of you because your friends wanted to see it. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but because he's so funny, he's gotta be funny." Wrong! I can't watch this unique catch after a dream boxing / insult war where burning a good-fingered boy causes physical pain against your opponent. You think the terrible comedy that hurts you is ridiculous, but after you look at it, you know it is true. This movie is not worth what I paid for it. I watched a ton of Steven's mixed-up movies and I even looked at Crossroads twice ... but I still couldn't watch it.
