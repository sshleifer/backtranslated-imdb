This movie was written by excellent McGovern and director Frears. This film was a little disappointing. It seemed too short. He spent too long in the atmosphere of Hove and smiled at Catholic demands. Then the fascist and socialists are very quick to draw the attention of the family and the terrible conclusion. <br /> <br /> But my wife thought Liam was cute.
