Undoubtedly, this is one of the worst pictures I've ever seen in paying for money - which flick you choose in desperate shopping malls during Christmas holidays if you've forgotten something good, but still see a dead movie! And that is how I came to see this stink bomb ... <br /> <br /> Beyond the three decades right, I still get the rotten fish that makes up this story. The incredible plot - that the killer whale carries the fear of an individual who is not the sea - is ridiculous. And that's all, except for a completely out-of-the-box "love theme" that plays over the love story of the missing movie finish. At least Charlotte Rampling is a cute (two-dimensional role), but Richard Harris just looks at the landscape. He was not Captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and it is not "jaws". I am happy to have made most of this point meaningless and when I ride on the air, I move forward. "Danger, Will Robinson!" View current tv a commercial that shows a man and a woman looking at a whale ("Orca - I Love Orca ...") - at least it's over 60 seconds. This flick represents 92 minutes of my life, which I never get back.
