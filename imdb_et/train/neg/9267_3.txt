After already being disappointed with the "final conflict", this series hits its very weak fourth entry. At least a third movie attempted (failed) to continue Damien's story, while it simply replicates and replicates ideas from "Omen" (the animals are afraid of the Antichrist, death of one person is very similar to death). photographer in first film). But what seemed exciting and creative seems just stupid here. And a little girl just looks like a corrupted child.
