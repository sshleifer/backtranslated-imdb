I couldn't even look at this movie until the end. I can't comment on this story because I didn't watch the whole movie and why I couldn't watch it because it was "participants". First of all, mostly they just seemed rigid and I'm sure their scripts were just out of their frame - but that's a small question. The main question I have with the participants is not really their fault ... the one who gives this movie! Come on, this movie came out in 2003 ... I thought that bringing people to play their twenties teens went out of fashion with a new wave? I can't watch a movie where one of the first lines, if older than an older man, is "I'm 17!" How can anyone take it seriously ????? Don't miss this movie, go for a 90-minute walk and get a lot more than this movie could ever give.
