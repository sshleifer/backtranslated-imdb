Absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> Now, before the cinema legions squeeze their laces, let me work out. Much as I enjoyed it, it's just one of the worst films I've ever seen, and it's definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in the cinema (an impressive statement, as I remember Daredevil's big screen). These two leaders (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were not the best and the worst badly. Of course, they were not helped by a script that had so much emotional depth as Daphne & Celeste's single and characterization, which was about as convincing as EU defense. The plot (the concept of slightly stretching) was thin, and "gore" scenes, though undoubtedly brutal, were irrelevant and ridiculous. What a plot revolves around about twenty models (Cuthbert) who are abducted, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral torments, both psychological and physical. Torture scenes feel disconnected and the emphasis was on shocking rather than intimidating the audience. Although there are very few positive positives about this movie, its redemption qualities are the drawbacks that make it so terrible. The cinema has never heard a vocal audience anymore. Within twenty minutes, the entire cinema was stitched and stayed so far. For my part, I came out with a laugh, supported by a film that had risen to the top of the terrible film making. Regardless of how you look at it, it is really a cinematic achievement and a plan for future management plans detailing how not to film. <br /> <br /> P.S. I did not mention that I managed to get the movie free ... so I can laugh at it. I was still tempted to ask for my money ... it was really bad.
