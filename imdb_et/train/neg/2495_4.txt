The problem with such films is that there are literally dozens of them every year. Fortunately, only a handful is given to the theatrical edition, while others are put directly into a video or television, like this movie. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie is really its originality. This is one of those films that uses the hard but worrying man's "Die Hard" formula in the wrong place at the wrong place. In this case, it is a game played by Casper Van Dien, who works for a security agency that thoroughly tests the safety procedures of companies and individuals. In this case, he is sent to a cruise ship, which is, of course, hijacked. This movie is seen as a mix of "Die Hard" and "Air Force One", and the film did not even try to hide that these two films were probably the biggest source of "inspiration" for him. So you really can't read this movie at all. It uses all the clich√©s out of the book, and this film does not offer any surprises or anything reminiscent of something original. <br /> <br /> As you would expect from this movie, this is a very weak script. Or rather said it has some very lazy writings. As I said earlier, there is nothing original in the film, but the actual story itself contains some elements that are far from likely and are simply ridiculous. I mean, hijacking a huge cruise ship with only about 8 boys, half of which only take up some small weapons, and then ask for a ransom "only" $ 10 million for a ship that is about ten times higher than this amount is quite ridiculous. How are they going to share that money later? Anyone get a little over a million or something? It is hardly useful for such a large and risky company. And then it is taking the hostage hostage. Somehow they manage to take all the big hostages of the ship and they can place them in one room with only one man with a pistol, which he can't even hold right. But you never see more than 30 hostages as if they were all the people who were on board at that time. Even when Van Dien is looking for his son and vice versa, no matter in which space they walk through a huge cruise ship, they always get into each other. Just a few examples of lazy writing a movie. <br /> <br /> But, of course, it is a boost, so of course it turns into another. But then again, it's not like this movie is good. On the side of the actors, it looks like they never had a weapon before and the film is full of some ridiculous slowdowns. It really becomes ridiculous at points. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film does not have the best actors, although I have to say that Casper Van Dien is not really a bad "silver hero" and an actor like a genre and a B-film chain. He just suffers the same problem as Tom Cruise; no matter how old he is, he never sees a convincing teenage father. Van Dien started as a promising young young actor, but in such films, her career will soon not be successful. He's probably able to do something better, though he has never been given the opportunity to show it. All other actors do the right job, but their characters are just so formal that they are never really interesting. <br /> <br /> Well, this is not the worst genre movie I've ever seen, but it's also not the most original or memorable. <br /> <br /> 4/10
