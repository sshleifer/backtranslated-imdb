Although it has been 2 years, I still remember all the waste that contains the whole plot of the film. Unfortunately, I found this movie after friends and I chose it through BlockBuster's new releases. We decided to choose a movie because it was the only one we all saw and it seemed pleasant. Although some time has passed since the time of watching the film, I still remember the absence of the plot (seriously, no real plot) and the total waste of time spent watching the film. If you are in a video store and this movie hits the eye, walk on and find a better movie. When you saw this movie, I understand your pain :)
