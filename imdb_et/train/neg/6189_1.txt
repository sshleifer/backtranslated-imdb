I bought the DVD version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife, who loved the version she was calling on television. But the version on DVD was a disaster. The illumination was bad and nonexistent, and the entire scenes were simply cut out. In one situation, Adele will be asleep and we will immediately cut to another scene - getting into the middle of the sentence - where it is next night. Signs like Grace Poole and Mason have never even been introduced, leaving one to wonder if they have fallen off within a few minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> The sighted DVDs were made by Platinum Disc Corp. and even at $ 6.32 it was black. <br /> <br /> Be careful what kind of movie you buy! We'll send it back.
