Joe Don Baker. He was a "Walking Tall" and he had a good part of "Goldeneye", but here in Final Justice all hope has gone ... the blind side has won. <br /> <br /> As with most humanity, my main experience with MST3K was what this experience was! Mike and the robots dig their nails deep into Baker's big muscle and twist it completely. It is obvious that they just started with "Mitchell" in their anti-Joe Don blow, and here is their continuation on the subject. <br /> <br /> This makes it a funny experience: there are many choices. My favorites - "John Rhys-Davies for Sale", "This is" Meatball: Texas Ranger "", "none of them are sponge-worthy," "Why did he wear his bridal dress to bed" and my favorite - "" Son ... " ? What? What was he, son of PREACHER MAN? ' <br /> <br /> "Final Justice" is in itself, because Joe Don puts this movie in, "a big fat nada". But here it is really an entertaining value. You get the opportunity to catch this version of "Final Justice". <br /> <br /> Two letters "Final Justice". ONLY for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Oh, and try not to go to Malta when Joe Don is in town.
