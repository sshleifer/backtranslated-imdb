See the 1936 version. As personally annoying, I find Charles Boyer's voice, he is more cosmopolitan, depressive Rudolf - I mean Omar Sharif, but not - too cute and lively. Catherine Denueve (sp) besides being too old, nothing like Marie - nothing! He looks too complicated to even think he's dying for this man's love in this way. <br /> <br /> The only actor in the entire movie that transmits their role is Ava Gardner, whose appearance on the Empress Elisabeth's screen is quite short (and look at pictures from the Emperor's country is more than a passing similarity) since historically Elisabeth did not attend much in Rudolf's life.
