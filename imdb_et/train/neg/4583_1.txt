If you want to see an intelligent, philosophical discussion of human potential and potential, see "Waking Life", which is brilliant. "What # $ *! Do We Know" is at the heart of this place, poorly managed, poorly written, ill-acted, completely without any artistic direction and completely annoying. It wasn't a little thoughtless or fun. Adding this rhyming "Ramtha" to this movie is a good reason to avoid it. Isn't it strange how filmmakers decide to watch this woman worship about the 2000-year-old god of the Atlantic or something? What flakes are an old chick and what is my waste of time and money on this film. People in charge of this movie should not be allowed to make a movie once more.
