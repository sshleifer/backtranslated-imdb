This is one very confusing film. The movie is very difficult to follow and the plot just didn't make sense. Wolfman's rage was made in Spain and I think that if any movie is dubbed from one language to another, it doesn't exactly change the way it was first thought. Perhaps this is part of the problem, but I doubt if it can take into account all the problems associated with this film. Copying is pretty bad and the voices don't fit well. Scenes are unpleasant, there are a lot of strange and irrelevant signs that make the viewer even more confused. What I did about this film was the appearance of the huntman and the scenes where he was attacking. Now that they could have assembled it and thought in some ways, they might have had something. Don't waste your time on it.
