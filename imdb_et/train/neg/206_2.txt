I just gave this 2 stars of this movie just because Dominic Monaghan made his effort. Everything else about this movie is very amateur. All things related to the direction of this film were very poorly met. Not only should the director think about what he or she is doing for a career, but perhaps he should watch some movies. Since Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, he puts this caliber film on him terribly. Where the "actor" was that Jack's best friend should never step in front of the camera. Of such a small film, I did not expect much, but perhaps a little more time and effort in the characters and their surroundings. Don't waste your time or money on this film (as I did), you will be very disappointed.
