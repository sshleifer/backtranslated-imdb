In the film, I feel it should be more than just art. I think it should be more than a way to talk about the story on the screen. This short David Lynch tells a story, but not much. I felt it was funny but too strange to be a comedy. It's good film making, but there's nothing else to do with it. As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of David Lynch, but I have some frustrations about his work because I don't see it at all. This is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far, but I know he still has a lot of talent and I'm happy to see what he keeps for us in the future. If you like Lynch, look at it, but don't be surprised if you don't like it.
