In recent years, as often as non-ironic zombie films have been in vogue, as well as the diets of other risen meat. "Fido" is a film that is either an experiment in cash, just a manifestation of it or both - and it falls exactly into the category of ironic zombies. The joke here is that we see walking in a deadly contrasting context with a broad stereotypical, clean and intermittent history (we are after a great Zombie War, and the creatures are now being slaves) as a suburb of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> This is a moderately funny concept on its own and enough, perhaps a five-minute comedy sketch, but it cannot in itself play a feature film. It is a joke that rotten bodies for servants are not compatible with the ideal version of this small town, repeated over and over again and loses efficiency. The soundtrack consistently plays sunny stories, while zombies can get bystanders. The word "zombie" is constantly inserted into an otherwise familiar line to get a cheap attempt to laugh. The very wide-ranging and artificial nature of the "Nineteenth Century" representation does not help me upset. It is as stylized as apparently inspired by "Pleasantville" inspired by the fact that the 1950s surrounding the labels are more evident than actually any similarity that could have occurred between 1950 and 1989. the film is strange and incredibly amazing about how open, underground and higher the 2000s are. <br /> <br /> Because characters are types of 1950's pop culture, it's hard to invest much in them. Each of them has some of its characteristic features - Helen is an affiliated performer, and Bill loves golf and she's haunted when she was supposed to kill her father, but they stay pretty two-dimensional. Within this bad writing, performances are fine. The best is Billy Connolly as a zombie Fido, who in Boris Karloff's tradition "Frankenstein" really gives character and sympathy to a green green monster who can't speak. <br /> <br /> There is little uncomfortable allegory that has been thrown around raw material fetishism, racism, classicism, war parachutes, etc., but none of them really works at a comprehensive level and filmmakers do not; really stick to something. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie does not have the courage to "Look! Zombies" "Leave this to Beaver!"
