I knew I could see a movie with a small budget, but I was expecting much more of Alex Cox's movie. The action of the two leading men was terrible, especially a white man. The girl would have had to compete against the Oscar for these two. This film was full of what I think people in the film industry and some other jokes that I actually understood and made me laugh out loud, which is rare. Without these ridiculous moments I would have given this movie 2/10. What happened to Alex Cox, who did all the 80s classic? <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> I had a few questions I had after the movie ended. Why did the Mexican guy first go to another man's house? What did her daughter say she got 100 people fired from her last job? Why did he break his own things when he was angry with him? I think I should have gone to the Q&A after the movie, but I didn't want to get up at 10am.
