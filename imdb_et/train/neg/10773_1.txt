I just watched this terrible TV. Needless to say, this is one of the movies you look at to see how much worse it is. Frankly, I don't know how much lower the bar is. <br /> <br /> Characters consist of one flat stereotype after another and the obvious attempt to create another "Bad News Bears" is embarrassing to say very little. <br /> <br /> I have seen some of the most expensive turkeys in my time, but there is no reason to list them because it is "Number Uno". <br /> <br /> Let me tell you, I watched the Vanilla Ice movie because it was so bad that it was funny. It's ... it's ... not so good.
