I've always liked Fred MacMurray and even though his career was tragically short? I think Carole Lombard is fun to watch. Combine these two big and attractive stars, add top-notch supporters like Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour, and Charles Butterworth, give them a romantic script, a team with them by director Mitchell Leisen, and you get a mediocre movie experience. br /> <br /> Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) "meet cute" during a Panama Canal visit and will fall in love for a few weeks. Skid is a great trumpeter so he starts a musical career that is predictably meteoric both in its rise and fall. While climbing to the musical stardom, he ignores Maggie, who later inspires him to start after he has hit the bottom. Ah, yeah? It's a real Hollywood lucky ending that won't come too fast. <br /> <br /> The stars and the director with this caliber should ensure success, but this film is so predictable and slow that it is difficult to see at times. Earlier scenes in Panama are so harsh that they seem to last forever, and later, Skid runs endlessly in New York. Fred and Carole try their best, but the tired script and the direction of S-L-O-W just don't give them the chance. Even the last scene where Maggie encourages Skid to rise from ash and disappointment just doesn't fit. <br /> <br /> This movie must be seen once to see some of MacMurray and MacMurray stars. Lombard. However, I guarantee that looking at it will take about 48 hours.
