Of everything I read about the film, I was delighted to support a Christian theme film. Everything from the movie was very unprofessional. Especially in writing! Without good writing, the film has no chance. The writer / director said in an interview that he did not want to give away how the title is related to the story. Believe me, it wasn't a big surprise. I was waiting for a teen / young adult company to open up, but it never did. As a divorced person, I was very disappointed. This film would not have been convenient for me when I first went through the emotional instability that divorce might bring to your life as a Christian.
