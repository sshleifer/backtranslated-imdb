The film interferes with religious ethics and ideals to such an extent that it cannot bind to any death penalty at any level. By presenting the lawful execution of the convicted murder as a catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mankind, the film raises the murder of the parents to the martyr of Christ. Somehow, according to the plot, God is outraged that society has decided to get rid of this fanatic who killed his parents, starting with them while they were asleep in bed while they were asleep. But this god has no resentment for the killer's actions. The ultimate character, who is not a religious woman of suicide, ultimately gives her life an arrogant but unreliable attempt to save this killer killer. In other threads of the less developed plot, Jesus returns as a powerless and frustrated vagabond to symbolically release God's wrath. The modern incarnation of Christ does not make him not only human but also the Messianic ideal of all religions. He cannot influence humanity for the good and the unemployed when he speaks of the edges of life, waiting for the destruction of mankind. Meanwhile, the mentally unstable pregnancy, with the little help of Jesus, finds it capable of being born again in the infant's unborn child, who somehow saves all mankind's almighty anger. I also interpreted it to support a certain level of abortion. This film, which tries to tell a lot about religious issues in the thriller, does not make any religious point, which I could clearly interpret, except for the beliefs of people. This raises many questions he never tried. This ignores the religious values ​​of this audience, trying to portray their version of asinine. Foolish
