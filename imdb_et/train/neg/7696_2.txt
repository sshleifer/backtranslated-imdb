Yes, stupidity! I just finish watching and I still have a bad taste in my mouth. Too many colors, too much unnecessary "impurities" story, too many stupid characters (I assume they wanted to get comic relief, but I just wanted to cry) ... too much of everything. Shame to ruin one of the "Arab Nights" divine from the northwest. Childhood, naive (both in a bad way) and many magical mistakes, I don't think it could hold a five-year-old child for more than ten minutes. The princess is cute but should be a tongue, because the actress doesn't know how to fulfill her role. The rest of the majority is even worse ... our "bad guy" is really bad. Shame that "good boy" is no better. Only the light in this darkness is, of course, David Carradine, who unfortunately goes deep below his level, but at least keeps his actor / fighter skills up. I'm still sorry to see him in such a thing, but I'm glad I had something to look at in the whole symbol, so thank David. Only, ONLY, will I give him 2 stars of this fiasco ... I'd give him more, but it would raise the final score for the whole movie. The rest is so bad that I would like me to classify it, but there are no class lovers here, and I think it would be too much.
