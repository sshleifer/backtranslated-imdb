*** LIGHT SPOILER ALERT *** The story sounds good and if you have read the novel, you are probably expecting a deep and intense film that could offer some interesting and inadequately studied human relationships. > <br /> It is enough for the script to try to do this, the director will try to do it, but the main lie will not fail. Maria's action is so dry that she doesn't have any feelings, her most intense moments seem almost comic. Sometimes he feels nervous about the camera. Her only sense of scene is near where she drops her girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Ioana seems even more tense than Maria and worse, she doesn't seem natural at all. Maria was in an attitude, even if it was artificially overturned, but she had it and her character got no credibility. And worse, we don't have an overview of him: where does he come from, how did he participate in lesbian relations, how does the relationship develop? We get only a few bits from our parents and their relationship seems to be "there": it has content and an end, but not a start. Just like her partner Maria, she's only the scene that really touches the scene where she throws Maria's character Kiki. <br /> <br /> Tudor is the only person in this movie (besides the homeowner who works very well there) who can prove some talent. He has his own character attitude and it suits him. Only one or two times it seems that he looks (at his parents' meal if he doesn't need it at all). <br /> <br /> I love this story, Tudor Chirila is right there, the homeowner actually works, and Puya is delivering a couple of styles, but it doesn't record the movie. Too bad was the whole device's great potential and Romanian cinema could have used a movie on this topic. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the blood sugar ratio between brother and sister seems more reliable than non-background feel (well, Maria's interludes are nice to try in that direction) Maria and Ioana's lesbian relationship. I am quite sorry that I spent money on the ticket, rather I watched it for the comfort of my room.
