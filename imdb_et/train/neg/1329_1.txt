This movie is AWFUL. I have not laughed so much about a movie that had been inadvertently funny for a long time. Leno would have stood up and late at night. The cars in the movie were cool, but the film itself is the most stupid movie I've ever seen. it is pathetic, the behavior is terrible and the plot could have been written for 4 years. can't get me wrong, jay leno is fun but not in this movie!
