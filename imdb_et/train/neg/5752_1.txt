I don't usually comment, but there are things to say. Where to Start ... <br /> <br /> The actor Jeremy in London was terrible! I didn't think he was so bad. The plot could have been good if it was well managed and a good actor performance. Unfortunately, this is one of the films you read and think it has great potential for entertainment, but it is disappointing from the start. Well, I have a good laugh at least. I'm not wasting my time if I were you.
