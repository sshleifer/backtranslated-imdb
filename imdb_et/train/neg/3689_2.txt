The main aspect of Superstar's films in his later stages was the frequency, the gap between one film and the next. Being a renowned star in the South Indian cinema, he was excellent before receiving Baba. <br /> <br /> Since Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), 11 years of massive heroes in Tamil had only 11 exactly 1 year. All of them were very hit. He had a picture that many could not easily remove. <br /> <br /> But after Padayappa (1999) he went to hibernation. His fans all over the world, especially in South India, were ready to see any movie with their superstar. That's how Tamil cinema industry decided to come to Baga. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers thought fans would take everything they show with Superstar. But this film did not work clearly in this film. As usual, the media hypothesis and the expectations of the fans are beyond. <br /> <br /> The picture of the Rajnik Cage was completely damaged. Fans went nuts. Movie collection did not match the expected level. The reputation of large people fell. <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect of this movie was A.Rehman's songs. Rehman has known to have produced some good music for some of the worst films like Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, En Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu, etc. > <br /> You feel very depressed not because the movie was bad, it's a superstar image. He took five full years back to fully recover two of Chandramukhi and Sivaji and gave the fans back what they were looking for in a superstar movie.
