Wow. Some movies leave me speechless. It was undoubtedly one of those films. When I left the theater, no word came to my mouth. All I had was an incredible desire to slam my head against the theater wall to help me forget about the last hour and a half. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. Frankly, this movie has nothing to suggest. Humor was in the first class, at best the actor was too foolish and the plot was drawn astronomically far. I hear a promise that I will never see another movie starring Chris Kattan or any other SNL member.
