The premise of this film was sufficient, but by subpar acting it was just happier and boring. it was a murder, it wasn't like the man who did it. Also, with some setbacks, there is a secret that shows that such events change rights to some extent. There is no emotion in this movie. The first 20 minutes is exactly the woman who calls her sister and hears her message. It was boring and boring. Some polishing and better functioning could have been pretty good.
