Believe it or not, "Woodchipper Massacre" gave me a complete gonorrhea! That's right, I have a rainbow that frees me just because a group of kids played around with a video camera and did some sort of fucking and breakdown. This is beyond my understanding of how someone with moderate intelligence can withstand this film load. The only reason I managed to sit through the whole thing (not without suicide attempts) was that I was frightening first, and secondly - I think I wanted to investigate this recently discovered hatred I experienced it ... This movie is a "video clip" "horror / comedy" about three siblings left on the weekend to care for their parents aunt. The youngest child accidentally reaches the old lady with his Rambo-replica hunting knife. They can then crush the aunt with a variety of tools (apparently she had no drops of blood in her body!) And she pulled her father's rented wood chippers. kids finally grind that jackass too ... I never remembered casting annoying actresses that actually caused me nausea. Seriously, the voice of one blonde chick had to pain me all the time. All actors were cruel - literally just screaming in their fake speech dialogue and splits jokes that have to be written with a chimp that just doesn't care Now I can usually evaluate independent efforts, but only those who can understand that other people than their relatives can understand could watch it! I don't have to see a 3-minute picture of a car that pulls out a carriageway, and a tortuous, painfully long lawn assembly with some ridiculous music. In addition, why does hell have a bloody piano in this box?! There was a piano in one scene, and nobody was killed near it! I'm remembering this movie. If you don't like the naughty mess, I'd recommend someone with half the brain to avoid it in the trash.
