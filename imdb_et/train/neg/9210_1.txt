I have completely forgotten this movie so far. It was the boldest and worst attempt to demonize the hobby I've ever seen. This message seemed to be: "Do teenagers not use their imagination, they can play games seriously, go crazy and injure people." I can only guess that the imaginative writers of this work thought that D & D-style games are a form of evil ritual or arcanism.
