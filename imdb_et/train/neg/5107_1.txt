This is a British edition that is less extravagant than the US version. The person concerned gets a new kitchen or maybe a bedroom and a bathroom and is grateful for what they have received. The US version of this exhibition is all that reality TV shouldn't be. Instead of making some improvements in a house that passengers could not afford or do, they are being built around the house. I don't know if this exhibition is trying to show what a bad welfare system is in the US, or if you came up enough to get it. Nor is it quite a vulgar product placement, especially by Sears. Rsther as a family in a poor area for potential millionaires would be much better off helping the community as a whole, where instead of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home, build something for the whole community ..... maybe the place where the diy and power tools can borrow and return with building materials so everyone can benefit if they want. Giving it to one person can cause enormous displeasure among the rest of the local community who are still living in the same abandoned house.
