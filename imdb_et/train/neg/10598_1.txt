it is t !! it looks worse than t.v. Movie. and I think some order was even concieved and the results ... war is more beautiful. Jean Claude van's shame has done it again and he asks why his career is where it is today. no script, no story and time should not be wasted. I mean it. One in ten is too high, too high. goldberg should be dimmed for that. van shame is not an actor.
