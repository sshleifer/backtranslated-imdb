A very disappointing version of Lorna Doone. Too many missing characters, not romantic scenes, changes in story, too short, appeared with low budget. There is hardly enough dialogue to understand the story if you are not familiar with the novel. In some scenes, it seems that Lorna has cold lips on her lips. I'm sure the make-up will best hide it. I think they didn't want to stop filming until it got better, sorry. Most likely why this film lacked kissing scenes. Only one disappointing kiss ended. Lorna Doone is a great epic story and it must be told. The 2000 version of Lorna Doone is twice as long, more romantic, more enjoyable, and more realistic for the book.
