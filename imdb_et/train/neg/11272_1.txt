... the first movie I had to go through. And it was cast and the team ex-ante (not that I was involved, I hurried to add). I did this in the first hour so I think I'm just qualified to comment, but that was my limit. <br /> <br /> Like other comments here, how it got through any QA. Accumulation of the worst dialogue, the image of a woody, dreadful casting, all packed together without a piece of land. <br /> <br /> Casting Tara Fitzgerald was strange, almost comic. He has the worst accent in Russia's history. <br /> <br /> Depending on the screening, the directors and manufacturers watered the bar outside the cinema. Obviously, they couldn't sit down again. <br /> <br />
