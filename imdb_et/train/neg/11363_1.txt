This movie was advertised on radio, television, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every topic. So when we went to Kinnepolis multiplex, our expectations were very high. But oh boy, how sad this movie is! This is a movie about a Hollywood movie. The shades are so clear that we are not ready to produce "great Hollywood movies". I'm not a film critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. As my subject line says, it is nothing and then a loop. You could also watch TV without seeing anything. It was the feeling we got when we saw Shades. SHADES ARE BAD PRODUCTION !!!
