I would usually have given this film 6. It deals with a very important topic and does it fairly well - despite Katie Wright, which is an accomplishment in itself. <br /> <br /> I have no idea if he was actually taught to play such a character or, of course, irritating, but he did a fantastic job of making me look after Lex. He has no other dimension than how confused, helpless and helpless he is, and how good he is puzzled. I understand how a young girl who blames her friend for a loss and whose eating disorder has fallen out of control would be upset, frightened, and painful. However, Wright's entire performance is based on unbroken sailing and slipping, the rest being whining. I couldn't help but I felt that the problem of this particular girl was not caused by a demon that is Bulimia but is not a backbone. I doubt this is the film the film should do.
