as always, this is an inaccurate picture for the homeless. In the early 1990s, the TV talked about a lot of false panhandlers and made everything unrecognizable and said we all made over $ 100 a day when $ 20-40 a day was much closer to reality. when somebody drove where I kept working, and offered me a job, I actually went to work and took work when I was physically fit. for at least two years and held the most in the bank and remained at $ 10-20000 for $ 1-2 and $ 2-5 casino games. Normally, I can always win and win decent if I just had money. Instead, I can always play around $ 1,000 a month in a minimum purchase because I don't want to lose it all. I was just a homeless reason why I didn't want to risk running all my money and broke, sometimes I was over $ 1000-2000 in my sock. anyone who wants to talk to sevencard2003 yahoo messenger.i admit that i was different than most homeless people because of the fact that i never smoked and did not take medications. im no longer homeless, i am now govt housing $ 177 a month and getting ssi and spend most of my time winning online poker. Mother and sunflower varied worked hard to get SSI. I am glad that my days are hidden during the night while sleeping in the casino conference center, worrying about security. that television crew had chosen me because it had been a lot before. the shame they do not choose the better they choose.
