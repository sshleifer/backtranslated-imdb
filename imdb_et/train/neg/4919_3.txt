I have rarely been so irritated as the leading force, as I was in Ali McGrawi's film. God is it annoying or what? She says everything in the same tone and is terrible, so frightening that Ryan O'Neal, on the other hand, is great. <br /> <br /> There is not much story. He's rich, he's wood, they both have to sacrifice a lot of love. His father is Stonewall Jackson, his name is his first name, if you didn't notice the difference between the two that they crossed for love. <br /> <br /> The Oscar nominees for this movie show that it was going to be a bad year. John Marley is a wooden father but a supportive appointment? At least Ali didn't win. I still think that Katharine Ross should have played Jennifer, but if it were from me, Katharine Ross would have had many more movies. He's definitely a better actor than McGraw. <br /> <br /> I didn't even cry when he got sick, I never felt sad. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Tommy Lee Jones look like he was about 15 years old and the score is good. But it is so old that it has a beard length and its sin is not so old, it knows it.
